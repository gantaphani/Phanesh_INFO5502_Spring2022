this is a putative class action filed by sixteen present and former female patients at nebraska three residential mental health lincoln regional center lrc,the norfolk regional center nrc,and the hastings regional center hrc.plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the director of the nebraska department of health and human services and the chief executive officers and the clinical directors of the three facilities,all sued in their official capacities.the complaint alleges that these seven defendants are violating plaintiffs federal constitutional and statutory rights by failing to protect them from sexual and physical assaults by male patients and staff,and by failing to adequately treat their mental illnesses and developmental disabilities.the district court certified a single class for these disparate claims 
all women who were subjected to rape,sexual assault,sexual harassment,sexual exploitation,and physical assault,while in the care and custody of nebraska health and human services system nhhss as residents at one or more of the nhhss residential mental health facilities and all women who are currently,or in the future will be,in the care and custody of the nhhss and placed as residents at one or more of the nhhss residential mental health facilities.
we agreed to review defendants interlocutory appeal of this order under rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure.see generally bush,cir.we conclude plaintiffs failed to satisfy the requirements of article iii and rule,and the district court abused its discretion in presuming these requirements were satisfied.see in re milk prods.antitrust,cir,cert.denied,d standard of review.we therefore vacate the class certification order.
the named plaintiffs are women who are or were involuntarily confined at lrc,nrc,hrc.one plaintiff,caroline,was the named plaintiff in a prior class action alleging failure to protect patients at hrc from assaults by male patients.the district court certified a class consisting of all women who had been sexually assaulted or raped by male patients at hrc plus all current and future residents of that facility.caroline johnson.the court subsequently approved a consent decree that went far beyond patient safety issues,committing state officials to detailed provisions mandating the development and implementation of appropriate mental health treatment for class members.caroline johnson,case.that decree expired by its own terms on december.in this action,plaintiffs expanded their causes of action to include both safety and treatment claims and broadened the purported class to include women at all three regional facilities.plaintiffs urged the district court to exercise jurisdiction under the expired caroline consent decree,but the court denied the request.that ruling is not before us.
ten plaintiffs allege they were sexually assaulted by facility employees,nine by the same staff member at lrc and one by a different staff member at nrc.one plaintiff alleges she was sexually harassed by a staff member at nrc.five plaintiffs allege they were sexually assaulted by male residents at lrc and nrc.five plaintiffs allege they were denied adequate mental health trauma treatment at one or more of the facilities.three plaintiffs allege they were denied adequate trauma treatment after discharge.all plaintiffs allege that defendants failed to provide 
appropriate and effective nursing care,medical care,academic instruction,occupational therapy,social,and independent living skills training,recreational therapy,vocational training and rehabilitative,psychological testing,psychiatric care,individualized training,meaningful physical education,discharge planning and the provision for a system of mental health residential facilities designed to meet the individual needs of plaintiffs.
plaintiffs allege violations of their rights under the first,fourth,fifth,ninth,and fourteenth amendments of the constitution,title ii of the americans with disabilities act,et,and section of the rehabilitation act,
plaintiffs class action complaint requests sweeping injunctive relief which,if granted,would require the district court to mandate and monitor detailed programs governing nearly every facet of the state operation of the three residential risk assessment,placement,and discipline staff leadership structure prehire procedures and training for staff sex education and sexual expression policies creation of all women safe units and a woman council selected by class members at each facility a trauma treatment model that includes biological medications,psychological,and psychosocial components and programs for mental health treatment and rehabilitation consistent with the individual needs of each class member.the complaint also seeks a declaratory judgment that defendants have violated plaintiffs constitutional and statutory rights.
by certifying a single class action to litigate this broad array of claims and prayers for relief,the district court has essentially conferred upon itself jurisdiction to assert control over the operation of three distinct mental health facilities,a major component of nebraska state government.a federal court may not lightly assume this power.where,as here,the exercise of authority by state officials is attacked,federal courts must be constantly mindful of the special delicacy of the adjustment to be preserved between federal equitable power and state administration of its own law.rizzo goode,d quotation omitted see angela clinton,cir federal courts operate according to institutional rules and procedures that are poorly suited to the management of state agencies.moreover,as the sweeping consent decree in caroline illustrates,this concern is heightened in the class action context because of the likelihood that an order granting class certification may force a defendant to settle rather than incur the costs of defending a class action and run the risk of potentially ruinous liability.advisory committee notes to amendments adopting rule f.consequently,before certifying a class seeking broad injunctive relief against a state agency,a district court must ensure that it has article iii jurisdiction to entertain each claim asserted by the named plaintiffs.see rivera,cir,at.and the court must conduct a rigorous analysis to ensure that the prerequisites of rule are satisfied.of the falcon,d.
plaintiffs complaint seeks only equitable relief because nebraska eleventh amendment immunity would bar damage claims in federal court against these defendants acting in their official capacities.see murphy state of arkansas,cir.to have article iii standing to seek prospective relief,plaintiffs must show they are likely to suffer future injury that will be remedied by the relief sought.james city of dallas,cir,cert.denied,d.past exposure to illegal conduct is not enough absent present adverse effects.city of los angeles lyons,d quotation omitted see steel citizens for a better environment,d.for this reason,a claim for equitable relief altering the custodial conditions at a state institution normally becomes moot when the plaintiff is no longer subject to the challenged conditions.see inmates of lincoln intake detention facility boosalis,cir.therefore,defendants argue,former patients who allege they were victims of assaults or inadequate treatment in the past are not proper members of the class.on this record,we agree.
when the district court certified the class,fourteen of the sixteen named plaintiffs no longer resided at any of the three facilities.nearly all the relief sought in the complaint addresses future conditions within the facilities.these fourteen plaintiffs,like other class members who no longer reside at the facilities,are not likely to suffer a future injury that will be remedied by this relief unless they are recommitted to one of the facilities,in which case they would enjoy the benefits of any injunctive relief that may be granted as members of the class of future residents.moreover,the presence of former residents in the class poses a substantial risk to the efficiency and economy of litigation which is a principal purpose behind the class action device,at
