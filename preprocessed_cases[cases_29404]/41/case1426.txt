lee ann schmidt appeals the district court order upholding the denial of her applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income by the social security administration.schmidt contends that the administrative law judge alj erred by not giving controlling weight to her treating physicians opinions,by finding that her testimony lacked credibility,and by failing to take into account additional limitations when questioning the vocational expert.we affirm.
lee ann schmidt suffers from a series of health problems,beginning with a back injury that she sustained at work in november.she sought treatment from sunil thomas,from january through march.thomas performed two surgeries on schmidt back,a laminectomy and disketomy at,and an anterior disketomy and fusion at.
in may,schmidt moved to oklahoma and continued her treatment with jeffery nees,on december,nees stated that schmidt had a normal gait,good bilateral heel and toe walking,and she showed no gross deficits to my exam today.he concluded that schmidt ha d reached fairly maximum medical benefit,and released her from his care with the understanding that she would undertake vocational rehabilitation.approximately one month later,nees stated that,in his opinion,schmidt existing ailments resulted in a permanent disability.he further opined that schmidt could return to limited employment on february,with the restriction that she not lift more than fifteen pounds at a time,avoid repetitive bending,stooping,or twisting,and that she be allowed to change position freely.
schmidt returned to wisconsin and to thomas for evaluation and care.in november,thomas completed a wisconsin department of workforce development form indicating that schmidt was able to work,with limitations.approximately two months later,thomas opined that he agreed with nees assessment of schmidt,including nees conclusion that schmidt had been capable of working four hours per day since february.
two years later,in february,nathaniel jalil,an,evaluated schmidt.jalil opined that schmidt had no significant past medical history except for depression,for which she is on zoloft.schmidt reported to jalil that she had a history of pain in both knee joints off and on for many years.she also stated that she had been working at a new job that required her to stand continuously for four hours,which caused her to experience pain in both of her knee joints and her back.jalil concluded that overall,the patient is doing pretty good.he prescribed an for schmidt sore knees,encouraged her to continue walking,and referred her to scott cameron,an orthopaedic surgeon.cameron evaluated schmidt knees and diagnosed her with bilateral hypermobile patellae with positive apprehension signs bilaterally.he also noted that schmidt had no effusion,crepitance,tenderness,or arthritic changes,and her were unremarkable.finally,cameron recommended that schmidt adjust her lifestyle to accommodate her knees.
in march,somsak tanawattanacharoen,evaluated schmidt for chronic low back pain.schmidt told tanawattanacharoen that she was working with a work restriction due to her low back pain.in his examination of schmidt,tanawattanacharoen found no evidence of lumbar disc syndrome,no tenderness or muscle spasms,normal bilateral raising,normal neurological functions,muscle strength in the lower extremities,no weakness of the big toe muscles,and intact sensation along the lateral aspects of both feet.tanawattanacharoen then prescribed medication and physical therapy.later that month,schmidt failed to show up for her first physical therapy session because she forgot about it,but she stated that she would reschedule after she returned from a vacation if she was still having problems.schmidt never rescheduled.
in july,schmidt called jalil office to request medication to alleviate her back pain,and jalil prescribed ultracet.later that month,jalil reevaluated schmidt,who was requesting a doctor note stating that she needed to live on a apartment in addition to pain medication samples.jalil noted that schmidt complained that she still was experiencing back pain that radiated down her legs stemming from her back surgery,and that she was taking medication that he prescribed to her to alleviate her pain.other than her back pain,jalil opined that schmidt was doing very good.following his examination,he provided schmidt with the note that she requested and some medication samples.
in july and january,two physicians working on behalf of a state agency reviewed schmidt medical records they concluded that schmidt could perform work consistent with medium exertion.the state physicians noted,however,that schmidt had postural limitations on some activities,such as stooping,kneeling,crouching,and crawling.
in february,schmidt returned to jalil complaining about a recent of her back and joint pain.jalil referred schmidt to a rheumatologist,marlon navarro.when navarro examined schmidt a few days later,she complained of constant dull back pain,constant numbness and tingling in her left leg,increased stiffness in her lower back,intermittent ankle,wrist,hand,and hip pain,hypermobile patellae,and swollen knee and ankle joints.she also told navarro that she was performing all of her activities of daily living,but she was no longer employed,and she was applying for social security disability.navarro opined that schmidt had a normal neurological examination with intact sensation and systematic normal deep tendon reflexes in both her upper and lower extremities.while schmidt stated that it was too painful for her to flex her lumbar spine,navarro found that her right and left rotation and flexion were normal.he further opined that schmidt sacroiliac maneuvers were negative,she had no spinal tenderness,and her total body examination did not reveal any swelling,restricted motion,tenderness,or instability.ultimately,navarro diagnosed schmidt as suffering from joint and back pain,and,with the exception of her knee condition,schmidt pain likely was the result of early degenerative joint disease.he then recommended that schmidt use different pain medications and referred her to a pain clinic for her joint pain.
approximately one week later,schmidt had another appointment with jalil.jalil noted that schmidt complained of back pain and pain radiating into her lower extremities,especially on the left side.schmidt further complained of difficulty bending over,sitting up from a supine position,and prolonged standing.when jalil examined schmidt,he found no focal neurological deficits and normal superficial and deep tendon reflexes,but her gait was slightly unstable,her leg raising was positive on the left,she had some spinal tenderness,and she had a slight sensory deficit over her big and second toes.jalil reassured schmidt that the pain in her back was due to osteoarthritis and her previous back surgeries,and noted that schmidt had a generally benign physical examination.he noted that a t this stage,not much can be done for her back pain,and he did not recommend any treatment beyond schmidt previously prescribed medications.
the next month,april,schmidt returned to jalil complaining of numbness in her left leg.when jalil examined schmidt,he again did not detect any additional physical problems.he then referred schmidt to a neurologist,sarat ahluwalia,two weeks later,ahluwalia examined schmidt.schmidt complained of chronic back and leg pain and new symptoms of right leg pain with radiation.following her examination,ahluwalia concluded that schmidt was in no apparent distress and had only mild neck tenderness.schmidt motor examination showed normal strength in both of her upper extremities,but her lower extremity examination revealed mild muscle weakness,some decreased sensation,and brisk reflexes on her left side.ahluwalia diagnosed schmidt as suffering from low back pain with some radicular features and recommended that she undergo another magnetic resonance imaging mri scan of her spine.schmidt mri of her lumbar spine showed satisfactory changes,no defined recurrent or residual disc protrusion or bulging,and only mild facet degenerative changes and a possible cyst.the mri of schmidt cervical spine showed a small right disc protrusion with very mild stenosis.ahluwalia prescribed physical therapy,a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation tens unit,and medication.
in june,schmidt had an electromyograph emg and nerve conduction studies of her left leg,which showed normal results with no evidence of radiculopathy or neuropathy.that same month,schmidt returned to ahluwalia for a examination.she reported that her symptoms were unchanged.when ahluwalia examined schmidt,she noted that schmidt had normal motor examination with full strength in all muscle groups,with the exception of mild weakness in her left toe.she also reviewed schmidt diagnostic tests.ahluwalia concluded that schmidt back and neck pain were myofascial,so she recommended additional testing and an mri scan of schmidt brain.she further recommended that schmidt continue taking her medication and undergoing physical therapy.
the next week,schmidt saw jalil for a examination.schmidt again complained of numbness and tingling in her upper and lower extremities,as well as neck pain.following his examination,jalil noted that he did not find anything significant.he slightly adjusted schmidt pain medication and scheduled her for a visit in three months.
contrary to ahluwalia treatment plan,schmidt began skipping her physical therapy sessions.while schmidt attended two sessions in april,she missed her appointment on may.in notes dated july,schmidt physical therapist stated that it was unknown whether schmidt met the goals of the treatment,and if schmidt continued to miss her appointments without notification,then she will be considered discharged from treatment.schmidt never returned to physical therapy.
in october,schmidt returned to jalil for a examination.schmidt complained of numerous maladies,including memory loss,numbness and tingling in her lower extremities,dizziness,and a dry cough.following his examination,jalil noted that schmidt had a normal ear examination,except for a little fluid behind the right ear,an enlarged and swollen lymph node on the right side of her neck,and bilateral rhonchi and wheezing.he diagnosed schmidt as suffering from dizziness and vertigo,otitis media,and bronchitis,as well as being a chronic smoker.jalil adjusted schmidt medications and recommended that she abandon her smoking habit.he also ordered chest and laboratory studies,all of which returned normal results.
two months later,in december,schmidt returned to jalil and asked him to sign a functional capacity questionnaire prepared by her attorney.on that questionnaire,jalil noted that schmidt suffered from arthritis of the lumbar spine,status,arthritis of the cervical sine,and depression.he further stated that he prescribed for schmidt both pain medication and medication for her depression.jalil also checked yes to indicate that schmidt had chronic and disabling pain that her emotional condition contributed to her pain and that she could not be expected to concentrate and pay attention to details after performing sedentary work for even a few hours.he further opined that schmidt could perform only very jobs with the limitation that she be able to sit or stand at her option,and that she was incapable of even sedentary work on a sustained basis.finally,jalil opined that schmidt either would have to leave work early or miss work more than four times per month.
in addition to her medical treatment for her physical ailments,schmidt also sought treatment for her mental impairments from marcus desmonde,beginning in july.schmidt complained of depression related to her physical problems and stated that she had been taking zoloft.following his examination,desmonde noted that schmidt concentration was above average,and that she was outgoing,friendly,cooperative,spontaneous,and uninhibited.schmidt told desmonde that she did not have any thought disorders,suicidal or homicidal ideation,or symptoms of anxiety or panic.she also stated that the symptoms of her depression were well regulated on her zoloft.desmonde diagnosed schmidt as suffering from an adjustment disorder with depressed mode and assessed her global assessment of functioning gaf in the prior six months between and sixty,which indicated mild to moderate symptoms.he opined that schmidt appeared capable of understanding simple to moderately complex instructions,as well as interacting appropriately with supervisors,coworkers,and the general public.desmonde did note,however,that schmidt may have difficulty tolerating the stress and pressure of full time,competitive employment at this time.
in july and january,two psychologists working on behalf of a state agency reviewed schmidt medical records they concluded that schmidt did not have any significant limitations caused by a mental impairment.
in january,schmidt began individual therapy with a social worker,mary sirek,msw.after missing her first appointment,schmidt met with sirek,and her chief complaints were pain and sadness.schmidt endorsed all of the symptoms of a major depressive disorder and reported a previous suicide attempt that did not require hospitalization.she also reported suffering from panic attacks,but stated that taking zoloft helped significantly.sirek diagnosed schmidt as suffering from a major depressive disorder,single episode,and panic disorder with agoraphobia in remission.she also assessed schmidt a current gaf score of,which indicated a moderate impairment.sirek recommended that schmidt attend therapy sessions.
schmidt returned two weeks later,and sirek described her as very positive and stated that she looks very good today.sirek also noted that noted that schmidt did not complain of her pain,nor did she seem to be in as much pain as she has been in the past.schmidt then missed several therapy sessions and was not seen again for more than two months.when schmidt returned to therapy in april,schmidt told sirek that for the most part things have been going quite well,with the exception of feeling increased pain in her back,hips,and knee.schmidt then missed another series of therapy sessions.on june,sirek noted that schmidt was a no show four times and seen only three times,and s he never responded to my letters regarding her no shows.sirek concluded that schmidt appointments were so scattered she never really invested in her goals.she then discharged schmidt from her care,citing patient withdraw.
in october,at the request of the state agency,desmonde schmidt.desmonde reviewed his notes from his prior examinations of schmidt,as well as sirek notes.he found no evidence of a personality disorder.ultimately,desmonde concluded that his current assessment was consistent with his july evaluation,namely that schmidt suffered from an adjustment disorder with depressed mood with mild to moderate symptoms.he reiterated that she appeared capable of understanding simple to complex instructions and carrying out tasks with reasonable persistence and pace for to hours.she interacts appropriately with,supervisors and has little contact with the general public in her current bookkeeping job.finally,he opined that schmidt currently tolerates the stress and pressure of part time employment,but may have difficulty tolerating the stress and pressure of full time,competitive employment.
in march,during the time that she was being treated for the physical and mental conditions discussed above,schmidt applied for disability insurance benefits dib and supplemental security income ssi,alleging a disability onset date of january.specifically,schmidt applications stated that her ability to work is limited because of her l ower back fusion,with nerve damage.both knees dislocate very easy.the social security administration agency denied schmidt applications at the initial stage and on reconsideration.schmidt then requested a hearing on her claim before an alj.
during the hearing before the alj,schmidt was represented by counsel and testified on her own behalf.in addition to testifying about her back and knee pain,schmidt testified that she could no longer perform her former,job as a bookkeeper in a typical office setting because she needed to get up and move around,she could not sit for long periods of time,and she made errors due to her pain.she also testified that she was able to drive,perform household chores,cook,wash dishes,and launder her clothes.schmidt stated,however,that she had difficulty with grocery shopping and had problems using stairs.finally,schmidt testified that she was taking both pain and medicine,in addition to tylenol.
a vocational expert also testified during schmidt hearing before the alj.the alj asked the vocational expert a hypothetical question regarding an individual of schmidt age,education,and previous work experience who had similar impairments,including back and leg pain,pain and numbness in her hand and arm,knee pain,bilateral knees,and who suffers from depression and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.additionally,the alj asked the vocational expert to assume that the hypothetical individual was able to perform light work with a option and no more than occasional bending,twisting,stooping,kneeling,crawling,and climbing.finally,the alj told the vocational expert to accommodate the need for reduced stress by considering work that would not involve high production goals or more than simple to moderately complex instructions.the vocational expert responded that such an individual could not perform schmidt past relevant work,but could perform various other jobs with light duty limitations,such as cashier jobs in wisconsin or manufacturing jobs in wisconsin.the vocational expert further testified that if the hypothetical individual was limited to sedentary work,the individual could perform both cashier and manufacturing jobs.the vocational expert also stated that his testimony would not change if the hypothetical individual was limited to unskilled work and was precluded from power gripping.noting that the vocational expert testimony was based on the hypothetical individual working days,five days per week,schmidt attorney asked if those same jobs would be available if the hypothetical individual was restricted to working no more than or four hours at a time.the vocational expert responded that all of the jobs he previously identified would be eliminated.
the alj denied schmidt applications for dib and ssi benefits,holding that schmidt failed to carry her burden of proving that she was disabled within the meaning of the social security act.see a.specifically,the alj concluded that schmidt failed to show that she suffered from a medically determinable physical or mental impairment expected to last at least twelve months or result in death and that rendered her unable to engage in substantial gainful activity.see d a,a.the alj reasoned that jalil and desmonde conclusions regarding schmidt work restrictions should not be given controlling or substantial weight based on the totality of the medical evidence.the alj also concluded that the objective findings do not support the level of chronic pain asserted by the claimant.finally,the alj relied heavily on the vocational expert testimony to conclude that the commissioner had demonstrated that schmidt could perform numerous jobs despite her limitations.the alj thus denied schmidt applications at step five of the sequential analysis.see a i iv see also young barnhart,cir if the claimant makes it past step four,the burden shifts to the commissioner to demonstrate that the claimant can successfully perform a significant number of jobs that exist in the national economy.
schmidt appealed to the appeals council,which denied her request for review.the appeals council denial of review made the alj decision the final decision of the commissioner subject to judicial review.schmidt then filed suit in the district court,which affirmed the alj decision and subsequently denied her motion to alter or amend its judgment.schmidt now appeals to this court.
where,as here,the appeals council has declined to review the alj decision,the alj decision constitutes the final decision of the commissioner.haynes barnhart,cir.thus,like the district court,we review the alj decision.white sullivan,cir.when assessing the alj decision,we review the alj legal conclusions de novo.haynes,at.we deferentially review the alj factual determinations,dixon massanari,cir,and we will affirm the alj decision if it is supported by substantial evidence in the record,boiles barnhart,cir see also g.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.barnett barnhart,cir quotation and citation omitted.substantial evidence must be more than a scintilla but may be less than a preponderance.skinner astrue,cir.when reviewing for substantial evidence,we do not displace the alj judgment by reconsidering facts or evidence or making credibility determinations.id.citing jens barnhart,cir.in other words,so long as,in light of all the evidence,reasonable minds could differ concerning whether the claimant is disabled,we must affirm the alj decision denying benefits.books chater,cir.
on appeal,schmidt first argues that the alj should have given controlling weight to the opinions of jalil and desmonde and that the alj failed to explain adequately his refusal to credit their assessments.normally,a treating physician opinion regarding the nature and severity of a medical condition is entitled to controlling weight if supported by the medical findings and consistent with substantial evidence in the record.skarbek barnhart,cir citing d.however,while the treating physician opinion is important,it is not the final word on a claimant disability.books,at quoting reynolds bowen,cir.as we previously have noted,t he patient regular physician may want to do a favor for a friend and client,and so the treating physician may too quickly find disability.id.quoting stephens heckler,cir.see also hofslien barnhart,cir discussing the treating physician rule and stating that while a treating physician has the advantage over other physicians whose reports might figure in a disability case because the treating physician has spent more time with the claimant,the fact that the claimant is the treating physician patient also detracts from the weight of that physician testimony,since,as is well known,many physicians including those most likely to attract patients who are thinking of seeking disability benefits will often bend over backwards to assist a patient in obtaining benefits,and therefore the weight properly to be given to testimony or other evidence of a treating physician depends on circumstances internal citations omitted.an alj thus may discount a treating physician medical opinion if it the opinion is inconsistent with the opinion of a consulting physician or when the treating physician opinion is internally inconsistent,as long as he minimally articulates his reasons for crediting or rejecting evidence of disability.skarbek,at internal quotations and citations omitted.
in this case,the alj provided an adequate explanation of his decision not to give controlling weight to jalil and desmonde opinions.regarding jalil december statement that schmidt was incapable of performing even sedentary work,the alj found that diagnosis was not supported by the medical evidence in the record.for example,jalil february treatment notes indicate that schmidt physical examination was benign,and his june treatment notes indicate that he did not find anything significant despite schmidt complaints regarding numbness and tingling in her extremities.further,despite schmidt complaints about pain,jalil remarked on multiple occasions that her condition was pretty good and very good.we agree with the alj that these statements and others in jalil treatment notes are inconsistent with jalil december conclusion that schmidt could not perform sedentary work.further,as the alj notes,schmidt has failed to establish that she suffers from her claimed level of chronic pain because her medical records indicate that she was able to keep her pain in check using various medicines,and that she did not follow through with her physical therapy or pursue pain management.finally,the functional capacity questionnaire on which jalil stated that schmidt could not perform sedentary work is suspect because schmid
