this appeal requires us to resolve conflicting statutory interpretations of e of the indian health care improvement act,b,which requires the federal government to pay percent of certain medicaid costs for services which are received through an indian health service facility.the arizona health care cost containment system arizona,the state entity that administers arizona medicaid program,interprets this language as requiring the federal government to reimburse states for all health care services provided to indians under referral agreements between health care service providers and the indian health service ihs.by contrast,the health care financing administration hcfa the federal entity that administers medicaid,interprets this language as requiring the federal government to reimburse states only for health care services provided by an ihs facility which offers,is responsible for and bills medicaid for the services provided.the district court held that arizona interpretation was correct and granted arizona motion for summary judgment.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and now reverse.
as part of its unique relationship with american indian tribes and alaska native corporations,the federal government provides health care services to roughly million american indian and alaska native people.see lincoln vigil,d ihs fact sheet.gov files ihsfacts jan.doc last visited november.since,ihs,now a federal agency within the department of health and human services hhs,has been responsible for providing these services.from its inception,ihs had sought to accomplish its objectives primarily by building and staffing its own facilities on or near indian communities.am.indian policy review comm n,report on indian health,comm.print.geographical,logistical,and financial limitations made it impossible for ihs to provide the full range of medical services in this manner,and ihs routinely entered into different types of agreements with other health services providers to fill in gaps in ihs services.id.at.
in,the medicaid program was signed into law.medicaid,a joint federal and state medical welfare program,provides for state medicaid agencies to reimburse health care providers for the cost of covered services delivered to medicaid beneficiaries.the federal government then reimburses the states for all or part of those expenditures,b.the rate at which the federal government reimburses the states for medicaid expenditures,called the federal medical assistance percentage,or fmap,typically ranges from to percent.see b.the federal government recalculates the fmap reimbursement rate annually based on each state per capita income.see id.b,a b.although indians were entitled to use service providers to the same extent as other citizens of a state,the degree to which indians actually benefited from the newly established medicaid programs is unclear.report on indian health,supra,at.
in,congress found that many ihs facilities were inadequate,outdated,inefficient,and undermanned,and enacted the indian health care improvement act ihcia to implement the federal responsibility for the care and education of the indian people by improving the services and facilities of federal indian health programs and encouraging maximum participation of indians in such programs.ihcia,stat.title iv of the ihcia contained numerous provisions aimed at upgrading the overall quality of ihs facilities.see ihcia.
relevant here,a of the ihcia amended the social security act to permit ihs facilities to obtain medicaid reimbursement for services provided to indians.see ihcia a.as a result,ihs facilities could receive reimbursement from medicaid as well as funding through direct congressional appropriations.because states previously did not provide medicaid funding for ihs health care services,this enactment would have imposed an additional burden on states medicaid programs.to avoid this result,congress amended b of the social security act,b,by inserting the following language 
notwithstanding the first sentence of this section explaining how the federal medical assistance percentage will be calculated for each state,the federal medical assistance percentage shall be per centum with respect to amounts expended as medical assistance for services which are received through an indian health service facility.
ihcia e,b emphasis added.
immediately after the enactment of the ihcia,and for the next twenty years,hcfa interpreted this language as requiring a fmap reimbursement rate of percent for health care services provided by ihs for indians,when ihs billed medicaid directly for those services.hcfa did not allow a fmap reimbursement rate of percent for health care services provided by providers,even when ihs had entered into referral agreements with those providers.
hcfa interpretation of e corresponded to the different types of agreements ihs had used to supplement its services.in some cases,an ihs facility would offer a health care service to its indian patients,and provide the service by purchasing it from a contractor a health service provider.after the enactment of the ihcia,ihs billed medicaid directly for these services.ihs also entered into referral agreements with providers.under these agreements,the provider agreed to furnish medical services at a rate no higher than the prevailing medicare allowable rates to indians referred by ihs.reimbursement rates for health care services authorized under the indian health service contract health service regulations.june.ihs did not bill medicaid for such services.before,arizona neither received nor claimed a fmap reimbursement rate of percent for services provided to indians under these referral agreements.
in,hcfa issued a memorandum to an associate regional administrator in hcfa region ix in response to arizona question whether transportation provided to indians was eligible for a fmap reimbursement rate of percent.the hcfa memo stated 
w e do not agree that transportation is a service provided through an ihs facility.our position on this issue is that in order for ihs services to qualify for fmap,the service must be provided by ihs,or a contractual agent of an ihs or tribal facility,considered as a facility service that is,a service that would be within the proper scope of services which can be claimed by that facility,and claimed by the ihs facility as a service of that facility.these services are referred to in regulation at cfr inpatient hospital services and cfr outpatient hospital services and rural health facility services.
for most facilities,services are furnished within the physical confines of the facility.satellite facilities owned or leased,and operated by ihs or tribal programs,are also considered to be within the physical confines of an facility referred services,provided through a contractual arrangement,can also be considered provided through an ihs facility and reimbursed at the fmap rate as long as these are services that could be provided as a facility service,as referenced by regulation above.any other type of services,such as nonemergency transportation,are not considered to be facility services,and therefore should be reimbursed at the normal match rate.
memorandum from the acting,medicaid bureau,to the reg l adm r,div.of medicaid,region ix may,emphasis added.
arizona interpreted the memorandum statement that a fmap reimbursement rate of percent applied to r eferred services,provided through a contractual arrangement as extending to all health care services provided under referral agreements between ihs and service providers.as a result of this interpretation,arizona developed a procedure for claiming a fmap reimbursement rate of percent for services that met five criteria the recipient was a indian who had chosen ihs as his or her health plan as of the date of the service the service was provided by a provider the service was furnished pursuant to an agreement between an ihs facility and the provider at the time the service was provided the service was a facility service,under or and the date of the service was on or after may,the date of the transportation memorandum.
arizona made its first claim under the new procedure for the quarter ending march.as a result of its new procedure,arizona claimed an additional of federal reimbursement,which hcfa allowed without deferral or investigation.however,in late,hcfa began to defer action on arizona reimbursement claims,and ultimately disallowed arizona subsequent claims to the extent they exceeded the normal fmap reimbursement rate.
arizona appealed hcfa disallowance of approximately million of arizona claims.the departmental appeals board dab upheld hcfa disallowance in a administrative decision.in this decision,the dab held that the meaning of received through an indian health service facility was ambiguous,because it could mean by means of or in.following its procedures for resolving disputes over ambiguous statutory language,the dab held 
hcfa reasonable and interpretation of the costs eligible for fmap was limited to those received through an ihs facility which offers,is responsible for and bills medicaid for the services provided arizona was notified of and long operated consistently with this interpretation hcfa did not change this policy in its memorandum of may arizona did not reasonably rely on an alternative interpretation and the costs disallowed here were not eligible for fmap rate under hcfa interpretation.
accordingly,the dab upheld all the disallowances at issue 
arizona brought suit in the district of arizona to challenge the dab decision.ruling on for summary judgment and applying the framework of chevron,natural resources defense council,d,the district court ruled in favor of arizona.noting its agreement with the only two federal courts that had then addressed the issue,north dakota ex rel.olson ctrs.for medicare medicaid,d,rev,cir,and ellenbecker ctrs.for medicare medicaid,d,rev,cir,the district court reversed the dab,concluding that as a matter of law the language of e at issue is clear and unambiguous and the phrase received through is properly interpreted as pertaining to services that are provided as a result of a referral from an ihs facility by private health care providers who bill the state medicaid program for those services.the district court determined that hcfa interpretation to which the dab had deferred was unreasonable.therefore,the district court granted arizona motion for summary judgment,which hcfa now appeals.
we review the district court grant of arizona motion for summary judgment de novo.balint carson city,cir.there is no dispute that the dab decision is the product of formal adjudication that merits chevron deference.see united states mead,d.therefore,we follow a process in reviewing the dab interpretation of federal law.chevron,at.first,if a court determines that congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,then that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.united states haggar apparel,d internal citations and quotations omitted.second,if the agency statutory interpretation fills a gap or defines a term in a way that is reasonable in light of the legislature revealed design,we give that judgment controlling weight.id.internal citations and quotations omitted.
we begin with the plain language of the statute.gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay,d.the district court focused on the meaning of the word through in the phrase services which are received through an indian health service facility,in e.the word through is not defined elsewhere in the statute or by regulation.accordingly,we consider whether there is an unambiguous common sense meaning of the word that resolves the question whether this phrase includes services provided by providers via a referral agreement with ihs,as arizona would have it,or is limited to services provided by a particular ihs facility within its scope of services and billed by that facility to medicaid,as the dab held.see wilderness soc y fish wildlife,cir en banc when no statutory or regulatory provision defines the meaning of a term,we consider the common sense meaning of the words,including review of dictionaries,amended by cir en banc.
after referring to dictionaries that were current when congress was drafting this legislation,we are unable to resolve this ambiguity.as noted by the dab,the phrase through can mean by means of and by the help or agency of,webster third new international dictionary,which supports arizona interpretation,as well as in and within,which supports hcfa interpretation.black law dictionary ed 
in construing specific words in a statute,we must also look to the language and design of the statute as a whole,k mart cartier,d,and read the specific words with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.wilderness soc y,at quoting davis michigan dep t of treasury,d.arizona argues that because congress used the phrases provided in or offered by in various medicaid provisions,it intended the phrase received through in e to mean something different.for example,the ihcia provides that states must be reimbursed under medicaid for services provided in indian health service facilities,ihcia a,b.in addition,various subsections within restrict medicaid coverage to services that are provided by or in a facility.see,id.a medical assistance includes medical services provided in a facility a medical assistance includes ambulatory services offered by a rural health clinic t covering laboratory services customarily provided by or through,a general practitioner,family medicine physician,internal medicine physician,or pediatrician.because a court must presume that congress intended a different meaning when it uses different words in connection with the same subject,see sec mccarthy,cir,arizona contends it is clear that congress did not intend to limit the fmap reimbursement rate of percent to services provided in or offered by an ihs facility.
we agree that congress has used a variety of expressions to describe the relationship between medical services and the service provider,and has variously limited medicaid coverage to services provided in,by,or through a particular type of provider.however,this conclusion does not explain what congress meant by the language in e,providing a fmap reimbursement rate of percent for services received through an ihs facility.even if we agreed that congress did not intend the fmap reimbursement rate of percent to be limited to services received by patients within the boundaries of an ihs facility,we note that hcfa does not interpret e as imposing this limitation.rather,hcfa interpreted the fmap reimbursement rate of percent as applying to services provided by certain contractors so long as the services are billed through the ihs facility.despite arizona efforts to distinguish received through from other similar expressions,congress use of the phrase received through does not answer the question whether the fmap reimbursement rate of percent applies to services provided by a health services provider under a referral agreement with an ihs facility.to this extent,we agree with the eighth circuit,that even if received through has a broader connotation than provided in,the statute does not specify how far received through should extend.thus the statutory language is susceptible to multiple interpretations and does little to resolve the present controversy.north dakota ex rel.olson ctrs.for medicare medicaid,cir.
moreover,reading received through an ihs facility in the context of the ihcia as a whole weighs in favor of hcfa more limited interpretation.hcfa argues that congress linked the fmap reimbursement rate of percent to ihs facilities and their services,rather than to other health service providers.in other words,the purpose of title iv of the ihcia was to benefit ihs facilities by enabling them to receive medicaid reimbursement,which must be placed in a special fund and used exclusively for the purpose of making any improvements in the facilities of such service which may be necessary to achieve compliance with the applicable conditions and requirements of title xix of the social security act.see ihcia c,a.therefore,the statutory structure better supports interpreting received through an ihs facility to ensur
