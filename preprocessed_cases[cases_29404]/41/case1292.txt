christine leitgen sued her former employer,franciscan skemp healthcare the hospital,under title vii of the civil rights act of,claiming as relevant here that it retaliated against her by forcing her to resign after she complained that its compensation scheme unlawfully underpaid physicians based on gender.the hospital pools revenue received for childbirth deliveries and redistributes the receipts equally among all physicians in the obstetrics department,but leitgen advocated for a system that would pay physicians on a basis.the district court granted summary judgment for the hospital.we affirm.
leitgen began working as a physician in the hospital department of obstetrics and gynecology in.the number of doctors in the group fluctuated with time,but when leitgen joined she became the fourth physician and second woman in the group.over the years leitgen developed her practice and became one of the department most and highest paid doctors,frequently performing more than deliveries per year.in january,the department appointed her to serve as chairperson,and in it reappointed her to a second term.leitgen stepped down before her second term expired,however,to dedicate more time to her clinical practice,and after about a year of interim leadership,the hospital eventually hired edward sandy in august to serve as the department new chair.
throughout leitgen employment,the hospital billed pregnant women for a package of services that included both prenatal care and delivery.and although the hospital compensated the patient primary physician directly for providing prenatal services,it pooled the revenue generated from the delivery and redistributed it equally among the physicians in the group.because of this policy of sharing delivery revenue,the doctors who performed the most of less payment than they would under a system where each doctor was paid purely for services rendered.
at several points during leitgen employment,she and other female physicians expressed concern that,because each woman in the practice had a larger patient base and thus tended to perform more deliveries than each man,the hospital policy of pooling delivery revenue meant that the women were unfairly compensated for their birthing services.between and,even though her salary was one of the highest in her group,leitgen complained numerous times about the pay structure to the of the department.at one point the chair raised the issue with the hospital compensation committee and learned that any change would have to be made within the department.no change was made after these initial inquiries.
the female physicians again raised the issue during leitgen tenure as chair.at that point it remained unclear whether a change required a unanimous vote of the department,but regardless,leitgen did not try to modify the system because the female doctors in the group feared that a change would adversely affect the department morale.in,one of the department other female physicians,karen keil,complained again to leitgen about the compensation setup,pointing out that because she and leitgen currently performed more deliveries than anyone else in the group,the system was most detrimental to them.when sandy became the department chair,both keil and leitgen informed him that they thought the compensation system was unfair to them,both as women and as physicians.the parties dispute whether leitgen and keil framed their problem with the compensation system as implicating possible gender discrimination,but for purposes of summary judgment we resolve that dispute in leitgen favor.
in light of these complaints,the department physicians discussed compensation schemes several times.when sandy became chair,he put the issue on the agenda for multiple department meetings and distributed scholarly work outlining different potential models of compensation.sandy also expressed a concern that paying doctors based purely on their number of deliveries would tempt them to schedule medically unnecessary inductions so that patients would give birth during a particular shift.at no point during any of these discussions did leitgen or any other doctor ask for a vote on the issue,and the arrangement remained in place.
when leitgen complaints proved unproductive,she took her concerns directly to tom tiggelaar,who was the secretary of the hospital compensation committee,the hospital vice president of finance,and the chief financial officer.on august,leitgen emailed tiggelaar requesting a meeting,and tiggelaar responded by speaking to sandy about the issue and by reaching out to other employees to request statistics regarding leitgen production as compared to other members of the department.after receiving delivery statistics,tiggelaar met with leitgen on september,to discuss the matter.leitgen complained that the compensation system adversely affected her pay and that she thought the pooling and sharing of delivery revenues was discriminatory to women.the hospital disputes that discrimination was part of this conversation,but again,we assume for purposes of summary judgment that leitgen communicated the potential discriminatory import of her concerns.after the brief meeting,neither party followed through on promises to resume their conversation.but,according to tiggelaar,he reported the essence of the meeting to both sandy and diane holmay one of leitgen supervisors within a day or two.leitgen herself also informed sandy that the meeting had taken place.according to leitgen,sandy was annoyed that she had taken her concerns outside of the department,and their relationship suddenly soured after her meeting with tiggelaar.
although leitgen generated substantial revenue on behalf of the hospital,her time with the department was marred by conflicts with patients and staff.leitgen takes issue with the way other staff members perceived her behavior during these conflicts,but she acknowledges that patients and nurses complained about her communication style.even though we construe the facts in leitgen favor,we need not ignore the undisputed fact that these unflattering complaints were made by patients and staff.for example,in a nurse complained that leitgen chastised her about her performance and stated that it was typical of the poor nursing care in the department.the following year,a patient experiencing an ectopic pregnancy reported that leitgen refused to treat her.later in,a different nurse confronted leitgen,telling her that members of the support staff found her demeanor condescending.in,leitgen met with members of the hospital management to discuss her combative communication with other employees,and after that meeting one of the managers recommended to holmay that leitgen be fired because of her communication problems.but the hospital did not fire leitgen at that time,and the following year she and holmay met with the same manager again to discuss similar issues of teamwork and collaboration.during that meeting holmay confronted leitgen about new incidents involving conduct that holmay considered disruptive to patient safety and staff camaraderie.
even after these conversations with management about respectful communication,nurses continued to take issue with leitgen behavior,and they reported their concerns to bonnie young,the director of the department nursing staff.here again,leitgen disputes the way her behavior was perceived by the staff involved,but admits that she received multiple oral warnings between and that her communication with the support staff was problematic.for example,leitgen acknowledges that at least two nurses told young that they refused to continue working in the department because of the way leitgen had treated them.
despite these continued communication problems,in her performance evaluation in march,both sandy and holmay identified positive contributions that leitgen made to the department.they told leitgen that she had shown some improvement in her interactions with support staff and was an asset to the hospital.sandy also asked leitgen to serve on the recruiting committee,and he invited her to represent the department at a conference at the end of the year.as of march,both holmay and sandy agreed that leitgen faced no risk of termination.
but four months after this performance evaluation,nurses began to renew their complaints about leitgen.in july,young reported to sandy that another nurse,wendy stone,had complained that leitgen had humiliated and verbally abused her in front of a patient.leitgen admits to having made comments that upset stone in front of a patient but contends that the comments were justified by stone performance.the same day that sandy learned of the incident he wrote the first of a number of emails to holmay about the possibility of disciplining leitgen.in this email,sandy said that he had tolerated leitgen because she added value to the department,but he also commented that her behavior could not go on forever.after meeting with stone to discuss the incident,sandy sent another email to holmay stating that they needed to meet in person because,upon reflection,he believed that leitgen interpersonal conflicts were more serious than he had previously understood.both stone complaint and sandy decision to explore discipline against leitgen occurred more than a month before leitgen met with tiggelaar in early september to complain about the compensation system.
leitgen deteriorating relationship with nursing staff and patients continued throughout september.for example,while leitgen was in the middle of a delivery,a nurse called asking for assistance with a matter.leitgen could not take the call herself,but she told the person relaying the message to go hit the nurse who had requested assistance.leitgen later testified that she had meant this comment facetiously,but she admitted that some people in the room apparently did not take it as a joke.that same month a patient complained that leitgen had blamed her for the difficulties that had arisen during her emergency caesarean section.and around the same time,young received two additional complaints from staff members about leitgen a nurse complained that she had been belittled,and a midwife reported that she was unable to build a collaborative practice with leitgen.young did not notify leitgen about either of these incidents or complaints.
during september the exact date is uncertain,while she was still serving on the recruiting committee,leitgen also made comments that members of the hospital viewed as disloyal to its recruiting mission.leitgen told a doctor that the department was recruiting that she felt her ideas were not heard,that she had little respect for the nursing staff,and that she felt unhappy at the hospital.in the course of that conversation,leitgen told the recruit that she would not have joined the hospital knowing what she knows now and that she might be gone by the time he arrived.after this conversation with leitgen,the recruit contacted sandy and expressed a concern about accepting a position with the hospital because he feared that the physicians were unhappy.
by early september,having decided the previous month to discipline leitgen for her abuse of staff,sandy and holmay began preparing a recommendation that leitgen be terminated.they met with a member of the management committee to determine what documents they would need,and shortly after this meeting,holmay asked young to prepare a timeline listing instances where nurses or patients had reported that leitgen was either rude or disruptive.young prepared a first draft of this timeline by september,based on unofficial,private notes that she kept regarding conflicts between staff members.although young memorialized complaints from nurses regarding interactions with doctors and other staff in these notes,she did not,as a general rule,investigate the incidents or take note of opposing viewpoints.holmay and sandy had been exchanging emails about disciplining leitgen since at least july,but before september no one had been gathering documentation about leitgen for the purposes of termination.in addition to requesting the timeline,sandy began excluding leitgen from conversations about recruiting and told her that she would no longer be representing the hospital at the upcoming conference.sandy did not inform leitgen that she was in jeopardy of being fired.
on october,sandy formally recommended to the hospital executive committee that it terminate leitgen.he supported his recommendation with the following documentation personal letters from both him and holmay,young timeline,and a separate timeline created by holmay.through these documents and their personal statements to the committee,both sandy and holmay expressed their opinion that,although leitgen was an amply qualified physician,her hostility toward staff and patients was unacceptable.in addition to these concerns,one of the members of the executive committee emphasized that he was dissatisfied by the negative comments leitgen had made recently to the physician the hospital had been trying to recruit.after hearing recommendations from sandy and holmay,the committee voted to fire leitgen.
on november,leitgen attended a termination session where members of the executive committee told her that she could either resign or be fired.leitgen quit the following day.holmay attended the meeting with two other hospital administrators,but sandy was absent.at the meeting,the hospital told leitgen that it was terminating her because of the numerous complaints that nurses and patients had made against her over the years.in discharging leitgen,the hospital elected not to follow its policy recommending that it notify employees in writing of potential disciplinary actions resulting from disruptive behavior.
the district court granted summary judgment for the hospital.it bypassed the question whether leitgen complaints regarding the compensation system were protected conduct and concluded that,even if they qualified,no reasonable jury could find a causal connection between leitgen complaints and her forced resignation.the court found it significant that leitgen had been complaining about the compensation system for years,but the hospital did not force her to resign until after a flurry of complaints from nurses regarding her conduct.
on appeal,leitgen relies exclusively on the direct method of proof to argue that genuine issues of material fact prevent summary judgment for the hospital.to survive summary judgment on her retaliation claim under the direct method,leitgen needed to provide sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence to establish that she engaged in protected conduct,that she suffered an adverse employment action,and that there was a causal connection between the two.see jones,cir casna city of loves park,cir.there is no dispute that leitgen forced resignation constitutes an adverse employment action,so we are left with the questions whether leitgen engaged in protected conduct and whether that conduct was causally connected to her forced resignation.the district court bypassed the issue of protected conduct,but because leitgen focuses on her conversation with tiggelaar as the applicable protected conduct and that conversation is relevant to the question of causation,we begin our analysis there.
for leitgen to show that she engaged in protected conduct,she had to prove that she had a reasonable,belief that the compensation system was discriminatory when she complained about it,but she need not prove that the system was actually discriminatory such that she would have prevailed on a claim of intentional discrimination under title vii.see tate exec.mgmt,cir fine ryan int l airlines,cir.our requirement that leitgen have a reasonable,belief that her complaint involved gender discrimination is not onerous.see mattson caterpillar,cir.she simply had to show that her belief that she was complaining about unlawful discrimination was not completely groundless.see fine,at quoting mcdonnell cisneros,cir.
in her appellate brief,leitgen acknowledges the hospital argument that she never engaged in protected conduct but responds that the supreme court decision in crawford metro.gov t of nashville davidson,establishes that her complaints were protected.crawford addressed only whether cooperating with an employer internal investigation of discrimination was prot
