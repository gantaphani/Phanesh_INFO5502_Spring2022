plaintiffs richard and mary lou stengel sued medtronic under state law when a medical device manufactured by medtronic rendered richard permanently paraplegic.medtronic moved to dismiss the stengels complaint,contending that the medical device amendments mda to the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca preempted their claims.the stengels moved to amend their complaint to add a new negligence claim.that claim alleged that medtronic had violated a duty of care by failing to report known risks associated with use of its medical device to the food and drug administration fda.the mda required medtronic to report those risks to the fda.medtronic contended that the mda also preempted the stengels new negligence claim.
the district court held that the mda preempted all of the stengels claims,including the new negligence claim.stengel medtronic,no.cv tuc rcc,wl,at.it denied the stengels motion to amend the complaint and dismissed their suit under federal rule of civil procedure b.id.the stengels appealed the denial of their motion to amend,as well as denial of an evidentiary ruling.a panel of this court affirmed over a dissent.cir.we granted rehearing en banc.cir.
the central question in this appeal is whether the mda preempts a claim in which the duty of care parallels a duty imposed by the mda.we conclude that such a claim is not preempted and reverse the district court.
background 
congress enacted the mda to extend the coverage of the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca to medical devices.see riegel medtronic.the mda divides medical devices into three classes according to user risk.class i devices pose the least risk class iii devices pose the most.see id.at see also a.class i devices are subject to general controls such as labeling requirements.id.a a riegel,at.class ii devices are subject not only to general controls,but also to special controls such as performance standards,postmarket surveillance,and patient registries.a b riegel,at.if a device can not be determined to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness under class i or ii controls and is either marketed as a device or may cause an unreasonable risk of illness or injury,it is a class iii device.a class iii device is subject to a approval process of the fda.a c riegel,at.the medtronic pain pump and catheter that caused richard stengel injury was a class iii device.
the fda approval process of a class iii device is rigorous.riegel,at.the fda performs a assessment of the device and determines the adequacy of the manufacturer proposed label.id.at.the fda then denies,approves,or approves with conditions on distribution,marketing,or sale.see d see also riegel,at.once the fda approves a device,the manufacturer is required to report any information that reasonably suggests that the device m ay have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or h as malfunctioned and that any recurring malfunction would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury.a see a see also riegel,at.
for purposes of this appeal,we assume that all allegations in the stengels proposed amended complaint are true.medtronic obtained approval of its synchromed pump infusion system in.medtronic obtained supplemental approval for its synchromed el pump and catheter in.
on october,richard stengel had a synchromed el pump and catheter surgically implanted in his abdomen to deliver pain relief medication directly into his spine.in february,stengel collapsed at home.at the hospital,he reported feeling heaviness and decreased sensation in his right leg.he was diagnosed with ascending paralysis in his lower body.a neurosurgeon removed the catheter,but stengel was left permanently paraplegic.medtronic medical device caused the paralysis.
when it received fda approval of its synchromed el pump and catheter,medtronic was not aware of certain risks associated with the device.before stengel was paralyzed,however,medtronic had become well aware of those risks but had failed to inform the fda,even though the mda required medtronic to do so.the fda discovered the risks,and discovered that medtronic already knew about them,when it inspected a medtronic facility in late and early.the fda sent a warning letter to medtronic in july,stating that medtronic had misbranded its class iii device by concealing known risks,in violation of a,a.in response to the fda warning letter,medtronic sent a medical device correction letter to doctors in january.medtronic recalled the device in march.this advice and recall came too late to help richard stengel,who had been paralyzed in.
ii.standards of review 
we review de novo a district court legal conclusions regarding the sufficiency of a complaint.martinez wells fargo home,cir.we ordinarily review for abuse of discretion a denial of a motion to amend a complaint.alvarez chevron,cir.but here,where the district court denied the motion to amend because of its conclusion that the claim in the proposed complaint was preempted as a matter of law,we review de novo.we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.
iii.discussion 
there is a presumption against federal preemption of state laws that operate in traditional state domains.in all preemption cases,and particularly those in which congress has legislated in a field which the states have traditionally occupied,we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.medtronic,lohr,citations omitted omission in original.parties seeking to invalidate a state law based on preemption bear the considerable burden of overcoming the starting presumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law.de buono nysa ila med.clinical servs.fund,citation omitted.t he historic police powers of the state include the regulation of health and safety.id.throughout our history the several states have exercised their police powers to protect the health and safety of their citizens.because these are primarily,and historically,matter s of local concern,the states traditionally have had great latitude under their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives,limbs,health,comfort,and quiet of all persons.lohr,at citations omitted omission and alteration in original.
the mda contains an explicit preemption clause that provides as follows 
except as provided in subsection b of this section,no state or political subdivision of a state may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement 
which is different from,or in addition to,any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device,and 
which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.
a.subsection b is not relevant to this appeal.
an implementing regulation provides 
state or local requirements are preempted only when the food and drug administration has established specific counterpart regulations or there are other specific requirements applicable to a particular device under the act,thereby making any existing divergent state or local requirements applicable to the device different from,or in addition to,the specific food and drug administration requirements the following are examples of state or local requirements that are not regarded as preempted by 
section does not preempt state or local requirements that are equal to,or substantially identical to,requirements imposed by or under the act.
the supreme court has decided three preemption cases under the mda.the rule that emerges from these cases is that the mda does not preempt a claim for violating a duty that parallels a duty under the mda.
the first case is medtronic,lohr,decided in.after lora lohr pacemaker failed,the lohrs sued its manufacturer,medtronic,under state law for damages.at.the lohrs complaint included numerous negligence claims,including a claim alleging failure to warn the plaintiff or her physicians of the tendency of the pacemaker to fail,despite knowledge of other earlier failures.id.at.medtronic moved for summary judgment,contending that all of the lohrs claims were preempted.id.the court held that none of the lohrs claims was preempted.id.at.it wrote nothing in denies florida the right to provide a traditional damages remedy for violations of duties when those duties parallel federal requirements.id.at.
medtronic had argued that because the mda provides no damages remedy,it preempts states from providing such a remedy,even for violations of parallel duties.id.at.in part iv of his opinion,joined by three others,justice stevens emphatically rejected medtronic argument 
an examination of the basic purpose of the legislation as well as its history entirely supports our rejection of medtronic extreme position.the mda was enacted to provide for the safety and effectiveness of medical devices intended for human use.to the extent that congress was concerned about protecting the industry,that intent was manifested primarily through fewer substantive requirements under the act,not the provision furthermore,any such concern was far outweighed by concerns about the primary issue motivating the mda enactment the safety of those who use medical devices.
id.at citation omitted.justice breyer did not concur in part iv,but specifically stated his reason for not joining i do not join part iv,which emphasizes the differences between the mda and the statute at issue in cipollone liggett group,because those differences are not,in my view,relevant in this action.id.at breyer,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.justice breyer stated reason for not joining part iv did not include disagreement with the passage quoted above.
the court held that the mda did not preempt the lohrs claim alleging that medtronic negligently had failed to warn plaintiff or her physicians of the known dangers of its pacemaker.the generality of the duty to warn was important to the court analysis.the court wrote 
t he predicate for the failure to warn claim is the general duty to inform users and purchasers of potentially dangerous items of the risks involved in their use.th is general obligation is no more a threat to federal requirements than would be a duty to comply with local fire prevention regulations and zoning codes,or to use due care in the training and supervision of a work force.
id.at.the duties upon which the lohrs relied escape preemption because their generality leaves them outside the category of requirements that envisioned to be with respect to specific devices such as pacemakers.id.at.
the second case is buckman plaintiffs legal.the plaintiffs in buckman brought a negligence suit for damages alleging injuries resulting from orthopedic bone screws,a class iii medical device.id.at.defendant buckman was not the manufacturer of the screws.instead,it was a consulting company that plaintiffs alleged had made fraudulent misrepresentations to the fda in the course of obtaining approval for its client,the manufacturer.id.at.the court characterized the plaintiffs claims against buckman as claims.id.at.it wrote that such claims 
conflict with,and are therefore impliedly preempted by,the mda.the conflict stems from the fact that the federal statutory scheme amply empowers the fda to punish and deter fraud against the administration,and that this authority is used by the administration to achieve a somewhat delicate balance of statutory objectives.the balance sought by the administration can be skewed by allowing claims under state tort law.
id.footnote omitted.
the court in buckman distinguished silkwood kerr mcgee,in which it had held that a negligence cause of action allowing punitive damages was not preempted by the atomic energy act.the court wrote,silkwood claim was not based on any sort of theory,but on traditional state tort law principles of the duty of care owed by the producer of plutonium fuel pins to an employee working in its plant.buckman,at.the court also distinguished medtronic lohr,in which the lohrs claims arose from the manufacturer alleged failure to use reasonable care and had not been concerned with wrongdoing during the fda approval process.id.in contrast to the plaintiffs in medtronic lohr,the plaintiffs in buckman alleged no claim and were concerned exclusively with alleged fraud on the fda that had occurred as part of that approval process.the court found that the approval process of a class iii device is wholly federal it originates from,is governed by,and terminates according to federal law.id.at.it continued 
in the present case,the fraud claims exist solely by virtue of the fdca disclosure requirements.thus,although medtronic lohr can be read to allow certain causes of action that parallel federal safety requirements,it does not and can not stand for the proposition that any violation of the fdca will support a claim.
in sum,were plaintiffs to maintain their claims here,they would not be relying on traditional state tort law 
the final case is riegel medtronic.plaintiffs sued medtronic for damages under state law after an class iii catheter in the lead plaintiff coronary artery ruptured.id.at.the catheter had been inflated to a higher pressure than recommended on the label.id.plaintiffs alleged that the catheter was defective under state law.id.the court held that plaintiffs claims were expressly preempted by the mda because state law imposed a more stringent safety requirement than federal law.id.at.however,the court was careful to state that medtronic lohr remained good law.it wrote 
state requirements are under the mda only to the extent that they are different from,or in addition to the requirements imposed by federal law.a.thus,does not prevent a state from providing a damages remedy for claims premised on a violation of fda regulations the state duties in such a case parallel,rather than add to,federal requirements.lohr,at.
there are three categories of preemption express,field,and conflict.see indus.truck ass henry,cir.field and conflict preemption are subcategories of implied preemption.though the court did not say so explicitly,it is clear that its decision in lohr was an holding that there was no preemption under any of the three categories.the court framed the issue without any qualification as to category of preemption the question presented is whether the mda a state negligence action against the manufacturer of an allegedly defective medical device.lohr,at.
during the course of its opinion,the court addressed the three categories.first,the court held that there was no express preemption.it wrote 
a ny understanding of the scope of a preemption statute must rest primarily on a fair understanding of congressional purpose.congress intent,of course,primarily is discerned from the language of the preemption statute and the statutory framework surrounding it.
id.at citation omitted emphasis in original.
second,the court held there was no field preemption.justice stevens wrote in part iv 
medtronic argues that the plain language of the statute any and all claims brought by an injured plaintiff against a manufacturer of medical devices.
medtronic argument is not only unpersuasive,it is implausible 
given the ambiguities in the statute and the scope of the preclusion that would occur otherwise,we can not accept medtronic argument that by using the term requirement,congress clearly signaled its intent to deprive the states of any role in protecting consumers from the dangers inherent in many medical devices.
id.at.justice breyer concurred on this point.he wrote,i can not find any indication that either congress or the fda intended the relevant fda regulations to occupy entirely any relevant field.id.at breyer,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
third,the court held that there was no conflict preemption.conflict preemption exists when a state requirement actually conflicts with a federal requirement,making impossible compliance with both requirements,see.lime avocado growers,paul,or when a state requirement stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,hines davidowitz.the mda implementing regulation provides that state requirements are not preempted if they are equal to,or substantially i
