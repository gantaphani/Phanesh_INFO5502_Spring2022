appellant linda guinn brought suit against appellee astrazeneca pharmaceuticals lp astrazeneca,claiming her use of the prescription drug seroquel caused her to develop diabetes.prior to trial,astrazeneca filed a daubert motion for the exclusion of the expert testimony of jennifer marks and a motion for summary judgment.after conducting a daubert hearing,the district court entered an order granting both motions.the court found that summary judgment in favor of astrazeneca was appropriate because guinn had failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of causation.the court based its ruling on two alternative grounds.first,the court held that the testimony of marks,guinn only evidence on the issue of specific causation,did not satisfy the requirements of rule of the federal rules of evidence and therefore should be excluded.second,the district court held that even if marks testimony were admissible,it did not support the conclusion that it was more likely than not that seroquel substantially contributed to causing guinn diabetes.we affirm the district court order granting both astrazeneca daubert and summary judgment motions.
background 
procedural history 
guinn brought suit against astrazeneca in the district of massachusetts,claiming to have developed diabetes as a result of taking seroquel.guinn asserted claims against astrazeneca for strict products liability,negligence,fraud,and civil conspiracy.guinn contended that while her prescribers were unaware of any increased risk of hyperglycemia or diabetes associated with seroquel,astrazeneca knew seroquel caused weight gain in approximately to of patients.according to guinn,despite astrazeneca knowledge of the relationship between seroquel and weight gain,the company marketed seroquel as having no effect on patients weight and failed to include adequate warnings on seroquel labels as required by united states food and drug administration fda regulations.guinn further contended seroquel is no more effective than other antipsychotics which she claims pose less of a risk of weight gain.
the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred guinn case and other actions involving seroquel to the middle district of florida for coordinated pretrial proceedings in july.at the time of the district court summary judgment order,the consolidated action had grown to include the claims of several thousand plaintiffs.
seroquel,chemically known as quetiapine fumarate,is an antipsychotic medication manufactured and distributed by astrazeneca.seroquel has been approved by the fda for use in the treatment of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.guinn was prescribed seroquel from may through april.
marks expert report 
marks,guinn expert witness on specific causation,first gave her opinion in an expert report submitted to the district court marks began her discussion of guinn with a review of her medical records dating back to.marks noted that the first weight she had available for guinn was pounds in march.according to marks report,guinn reached a peak weight of pounds in january and thereafter her weight,though fluctuating,generally decreased until june,when she reached her lowest weight of pounds.it was at approximately this time that guinn began taking seroquel.guinn then gained weight until she was diagnosed with diabetes with a weight of pounds in february.marks summarized her review of guinn medical records by stating she gained approximately forty pounds during her five years of taking seroquel.
after reviewing guinn weight history,marks concluded,based on reasonable medical probability,that seroquel was a cause of guinn diabetes.marks explained that exposure to a medication which caused weight gain worsened her underlying insulin resistance and likely accelerated the onset of diabetes in such a predisposed individual.
marks deposition and astrazeneca daubert motion 
in marks deposition,astrazeneca provided marks with additional information regarding guinn medical history and more fully examined marks opinion on causation given this new information.the additional medical history discussed at the deposition revealed that guinn had already had a number of risk factors for diabetes before she began taking seroquel.guinn had struggled with obesity,a significant risk factor for diabetes,and experienced dramatic weight fluctuations since her teenage years.in fact,guinn weight fluctuated before,during,and after her use of seroquel,with her highest recorded weight during each period being roughly equivalent guinn also had a sedentary lifestyle,a poor diet,a significant family history of diabetes,hypertension,hyperlipidemia,schizophrenia,and prediabetes,all of which,in addition to her age of,put her at an increased risk for developing diabetes.marks stated she was not aware of all of guinn risk factors at the time she wrote her initial report because she had only reviewed medical records provided to her by guinn attorneys dating back to 
at the deposition,marks expanded on her theory of causation.she reiterated her belief that seroquel caused guinn diabetes through the mechanism of weight gain.when asked what steps she had taken to determine whether seroquel had caused guinn weight gain,she replied that she had considered only the medical literature showing that seroquel can cause weight gain and the temporal proximity of guinn use of the medication.marks stated she had made no attempt to quantify the amount of weight gain she attributed to seroquel and had done nothing to rule out other factors as the sole cause of guinn weight gain.marks further acknowledged that seroquel does not cause weight gain in approximately of the patients who take the drug.
when asked what she had done to rule out guinn other risk factors as the sole cause of guinn diabetes,marks stated she knew of no methodology for ruling out alternative causes and thus had not attempted to do so.in fact,marks agreed guinn other risk factors alone were sufficient to explain the onset of her diabetes.marks stated,however,she had no way of ruling out the seroquel any more than she c ould rule out any other risk factors.
marks also stated she could not rule out the possibility that guinn had diabetes before ever taking seroquel.according to marks,the development of diabetes is a slow,incremental process that occurs gradually over many years.marks explained that about half of the patients who are diagnosed with diabetes have actually had the disease for approximately five years prior to diagnosis.marks stated that although there was some evidence indicating guinn may have had diabetes before taking seroquel,she believed the evidence was ultimately inconclusive 
astrazeneca filed a daubert motion seeking to exclude marks testimony based primarily on statements made at marks deposition.astrazeneca first argued that marks had failed to adequately consider and rule out other potential causes of guinn diabetes.astrazeneca further contended that marks methodology was unreliable because it was based primarily on the temporal proximity of guinn ingestion of seroquel to her diagnosis of diabetes.
marks declaration 
soon after astrazeneca filed its daubert motion,marks submitted a declaration to supplement her initial expert report.marks explained that although she had received additional medical records and data regarding guinn since her initial report,including information provided to her during her deposition,t he additional records produced d id not substantially alter her conclusions.
likely in response to astrazeneca criticisms,marks declaration provided a more complete explanation of her methodology.marks explained that she based her conclusion on 
the totality of the evidence,including the temporal association of ingestion of seroquel with the onset of diabetes,a stable risk factor profile without the diagnosis of diabetes prior to use of seroquel,clinical evidence of a pattern of overall weight gain while on seroquel prior to diagnosis of diabetes,evidence of a significantly increased risk of diabetes as a result of seroquel ingestion reported in the literature,and the consistency in the clinical presentations of guinn compared with those of patients in literature and clinical trials.
marks also reiterated that it was not possible or practical to quantify the risk of each risk factor in each individual plaintiff.
the daubert hearing 
marks theory of causation was more fully explored in a daubert hearing conducted before the district court.on direct examination,marks again stated that she had considered all of guinn risk factors for diabetes but that there was no scientific way to determine whether one of the risk factors may have been the sole cause of her diabetes.marks,however,did not elaborate on how she had considered guinn other risk factors in forming her opinion that seroquel substantially contributed to guinn diabetes.instead,she testified that a ll the risk factors work together.
on cross examination,marks acknowledged that guinn other risk factors were sufficient to explain the onset of her diabetes in fact,marks testified that,given guinn risk profile,it was very likely that she would develop type ii diabetes whether she took seroquel or not.
marks also acknowledged on cross examination that specific events in guinn life could have caused guinn to gain weight during the time she took seroquel.prior to taking seroquel,guinn had lost a significant amount of weight due to a lack of appetite associated with a period of mental illness.marks explained that she had not been aware of this cause of guinn weight loss at the time she initially formed her opinion.marks acknowledged that as seroquel improved guinn mental condition,guinn reverted to her ordinary eating habits,which,combined with her sedentary lifestyle,were alone sufficient to explain guinn weight gain.moreover,during the time guinn was taking seroquel,she gained approximately ten pounds in the six months after she quit smoking,something marks stated is a known cause of weight gain.guinn also had two serious back injuries during the time she took seroquel,requiring steroid injections and surgery.marks acknowledged that her failure to include guinn injuries in her report was an oversight and that guinn injuries and consequent recovery time could have contributed to her weight gain.
marks again stated on cross examination that she had not attempted either to quantify the amount of guinn weight gain that could be attributed to seroquel or to rule out other factors as the sole cause of guinn weight gain.when marks was asked if she had used any methodology to determine whether guinn weight gain while on seroquel was caused by the medication rather than normal weight fluctuations,marks once again replied she knew of no method to prove that seroquel caused the weight gain.marks also stated that although she ordinarily would have a detailed conversation with a patient regarding issues such as diet and exercise to determine the cause of a patient weight gain,she did not personally examine or speak with guinn when forming her opinion.
c.the district court order 
after the daubert hearing,the district court entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of astrazeneca.the court held guinn had failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of specific causation based on two separate grounds.
first,the district court granted summary judgment on the basis of its exclusion of marks testimony,guinn only evidence on the issue of specific causation.the court held that marks failed to satisfy the reliability requirement of federal rule of evidence,as elucidated in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.the district court stated marks was unable to articulate any scientific methodology for assessing whether,and to what extent,seroquel contributed to guinn weight gain and diabetes.guinn astrazeneca pharm.lp,d.the court also found that marks opinion on causation amounts to nothing more than inadmissible ipse dixit,as the only connection between the conclusion and the existing data is the expert own assertions.id.quoting mcdowell brown,cir.the court ultimately held that excluding marks testimony was a basis for granting summary judgment because guinn has no other expert upon whose testimony she can rely to establish specific causation,and this type of proof requires expert testimony.id.at quoting mcclain metabolife int l,cir.
second,the district court held that,even if marks testimony was admissible,her statements were insufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact with respect to specific causation.the court noted marks testified that factors other than seroquel could have caused guinn weight gain,guinn risk factors alone could have caused her diabetes,and marks had made no attempt to determine the relative contribution of the various potential causes of guinn weight gain and diabetes.the district court held that,given this testimony,no reasonable juror could conclude that seroquel more likely than not played a role in causing guinn diabetes.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews a district court decision regarding the admissibility of expert testimony for an abuse of discretion.united states frazier,cir.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.midrash sephardi,town of surfside,cir.
iii.discussion 
as explained above,the district court based its order granting summary judgment on two separate holdings.because alternative holdings are accorded precedential value in this circuit,bravo united states,cir,we will address each of the district court rulings in turn.
a.the admissibility of marks expert testimony 
rule of the federal rules of evidence governs the admission of expert testimony.this circuit applies a inquiry to determine whether an expert has met the requirements of rule.frazier,at.under this test,a court must consider whether the expert is sufficiently qualified to testify on the issues he intends to address the expert methodology is sufficiently reliable as determined by the sort of inquiry mandated in daubert and the testimony assists the trier of fact,through the application of scientific,technical,or specialized expertise,to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.id.citing city of tuscaloosa harcros,cir.
neither the district court nor the parties in this case dispute that marks is qualified to testify as an expert on diabetes causation.there is also no dispute that expert testimony regarding the cause of guinn diabetes would assist the trier of fact because the testimony concerns matters that are beyond the understanding of the average lay person.see id.at citing united states rouco,cir.marks testimony is thus admissible under rule if her methodology is sufficiently reliable.
the methodology of differential diagnosis 
on appeal,guinn contends marks testimony is reliable because she employed the scientifically accepted methodology of differential diagnosis.differential diagnosis is accomplished by determining the possible causes for the patient symptoms and then eliminating each of these potential causes until reaching one that can not be ruled out or determining which of those that can not be excluded is the most likely.westberry gislaved gummi ab,cir see also mcclain,at describing differential diagnosis as a process of identifying external causes by a process of elimination 
although a reliable differential diagnosis need not rule out all possible alternative causes,it must at least consider other factors that could have been the sole cause of the plaintiff injury.as the fourth circuit explained in westberry,a differential diagnosis that fails to take serious account of other potential causes may be so lacking that it can not provide a reliable basis for an opinion on causation.at see also in re paoli yard pcb,cir a t the core of differential diagnosis is a requirement that experts at least consider alternative almost has to be true of any technique that tries to find a cause of something.as other circuits have recognized,an expert must provide a reasonable explanation as to why he or she has concluded that any alternative cause suggested by the defense was not the sole cause of the plaintiff injury.best lowe home,cir quoting paoli,at see also lauzon senco,cir stating an expert must be able to explain why other conceivable causes
