this appeal arises from the district court denial of defendants motion to vacate a consent decree entered in a challenge to tennessee managed care program,tenncare,under the medicaid act.plaintiffs alleged that defendants,tennessee officials charged with implementing tenncare,failed to provide early and periodic screening,diagnosis and treatment epsdt services in violation of the medicaid act,and the parties consent decree imposes systemic remedies for these alleged violations.defendants argue that the consent decree must be vacated under federal rule of civil procedure b because this court intervening decisions render such systemic remedies unenforceable.defendants also request reassignment of the case.we decline to vacate the consent decree in its entirety,but we vacate a portion of the consent decree in light of intervening decisions,and we remand the case for reassignment and further proceedings.
in,plaintiffs filed this suit on behalf of the more than half million children throughout tennessee who depend on tenncare for essential medical and mental health services.the case was originally assigned to judge john nixon.plaintiffs alleged that they were individually denied care and that tenncare is systemically deficient in providing epsdt services,information about those services,and adoption assistance.plaintiffs claims were primarily based on medicaid epsdt provision,a,which states that 
a state plan for medical assistance must provide for 
a informing all persons in the state who are under the age of and who have been determined to be eligible for medical assistance including services described in section a b of this title,of the availability of early and periodic screening,diagnostic,and treatment services as described in section r of this title and the need for immunizations against diseases,
b providing or arranging for the provision of such screening services in all cases where they are requested,
c arranging for directly or through referral to appropriate agencies,organizations,or individuals corrective treatment the need for which is disclosed by such child health screening services,and 
d reporting to the secretary particular information relating to early and periodic screening,diagnostic,and treatment services provided under the plan during each fiscal year.
the parties negotiated a consent decree and the district court accepted that decree in may of.the consent decree requires defendants to provide screening,diagnosis,and treatment services specifies the scope of those services requires coordinating epsdt and other services and establishes monitors for compliance.one consent decree provision requires geographic comparability in the availability of services under a.another provision states that,w here a specific residential placement is recommended for treatment,and there is a waiting period for such placement,during the interim a managed care organization may not simply place the child on a wait listing for the specific residential placement.the decree permits e ither party to seek modification as permitted by existing law,and specifically states that 
this consent decree is premised upon the assumption that the epsdt requirements of a and r,and u.a and and of the adoption assistance act are enforceable in an action under.defendants do not waive any right to seek modification of this consent decree if controlling preceden t establishes a lack of enforceability as to any of these provisions.
in december of,the district court determined that defendants were not in compliance with the consent decree and epsdt requirements,and appointed a special master to assist the parties in addressing tenncare deficiencies.in february of,after the defendants alleged that judge nixon had engaged in improper ex parte communications with the special master,judge nixon voluntarily recused himself and the case was reassigned to judge william haynes.in march of,judge haynes relieved the special master of his special master duties,but retained the special master as a technical advisor under the district court inherent authority and barred inquiry into the special master ex parte communications with judge nixon.defendants moved the district court to reconsider this ruling,primarily arguing that the special master appointment as technical advisor was inappropriate given the allegations of improper ex parte communications and the court ruling that the defendants could not investigate these communications.defendants also noted that relief beyond that granted in the consent decree could not be predicated,even in theory,upon any violations of underlying epsdt law because recent jurisprudence from the supreme court makes clear that the medicaid statute in this context does not confer a right that is privately enforceable by the beneficiaries.to support this argument,defendants cited gonzaga university doe,in which the supreme court held that it is rights,not the broader or vaguer benefits or interests,that may be enforced under the authority of.therefore that statute is enforceable under only if congress intended to confer individual rights upon a class of beneficiaries.id.at.
in a hearing on april,the district court denied defendants motion for reconsideration and stated that appointing the former special master as technical advisor avoided los ing the benefit of his extensive study and review of the matters.the district court rejected defendants argument because defendants had not analyzed gonzaga in their filing and the sixth circuit had not applied gonzaga to the medicaid act.the district court also noted that a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b was the appropriate method for a challenge to the consent decree,but that defendants had failed to make a rule b motion and that such a motion would be untimely at that point,more than one year after gonzaga was decided.
in july of,this court applied gonzaga to decide a challenge to michigan compliance with epsdt provisions in westside mothers olszewski,cir westside mothers ii.in westside mothers ii,plaintiffs claimed that the state had violated the medicaid act by 
refusing to provide,and not requiring participating hmos to provide,the comprehensive examinations required by a,r and not requiring participating hmos to provide the necessary health care,diagnostic services,and treatment required by r not effectively informing plaintiffs of the existence of the screening and treatment services,as required by a failing to provide plaintiffs the transportation and scheduling help needed to take advantage of the screening and treatment services,as required by a b and and developing a medicaid program that lacks the capacity to deliver to eligible children the care required by a,a a,and b.
id.at.we affirmed the district court conclusion that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted for defendants alleged failure to ensure the actual provision of,or arrangement for,medical services.id.at.although states must provide for making medical assistance available,a,and provide that medical assistance be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals,a,we held that a state obligation is only to pay for services actually rendered,not ensure the reasonably prompt provision of services,because the medicaid act defines medical assistance as payment of part or all of the cost of the enumerated services,a id.at insertion in original.we also dismissed plaintiffs claim that would require the state to ensure comparable service availability because the underlying provision,a,was not privately enforceable under.id.at.however,we also held that plaintiffs allegation that defendants refused or failed to effectively inform plaintiffs and their caretakers of the existence of epsdt services stated a claim for relief for violation of a.id.at.
in november of,five months after westside mothers ii was decided,defendants in this case moved to vacate the consent decree under federal rule of civil procedure b.eleven months later,the district court issued an opinion noting that it had addressed defendants arguments in its april,hearing and denied a motion on that basis,and that the defendants had not appealed that ruling.further,the court stated that the pendency of a dispositive motion does not stay discovery,and 
i f the defendants had not been so intransigent on discovery issues requiring extraordinary amounts of the court time,there would have been a ruling on the motion to vacate.the court will continue its research on that motion,but the court also has to give attention to other actions on this court docket because rulings in other actions have been delayed because of the extraordinary amount of time the court has had to expend on the electronic discovery issues in this action.
in march of,this court decided brown tennessee department of finance administration,cir.brown concerned a suit by mentally disabled plaintiffs who alleged that tennessee had violated the medicaid act by failing to provide medical assistance adequate in amount,duration,and scope a choice between services reasonably prompt medicaid application information reasonably prompt service due process in service denials.id.at.in the parties settlement,tennessee agreed to overhaul its administrative system,expand funding and programs for the mentally disabled,and develop program infrastructure with the goal of increasing program enrollment and substantially reducing or eliminating the waiting list for waiver services.id.at.after westside mothers ii,tennessee moved to vacate the settlement under rule b.in brown,this court declined to vacate the entire agreement because the record did not conclusively show that the decree was primarily aimed at ensuring the provision of care and eliminating waiting lists,goals unenforceable after westside mothers ii.id.at.we did,however,vacate provisions that obligated tennessee to eliminate waiting lists and stated that,under westside mothers ii,absent more,a waiting list for waiver services does not violate federal law because the state duty is to pay for services,not ensure they are provided.id.at.we also vacated tennessee commitment to develop provider network capacity because that commitment d id not appear to remedy any violation of federal law after we held in westside mothers ii that medicaid comparable provision was not enforceable under.id.at.
three months after brown,in may of,defendants in this case moved in the district court to ascertain the status of their mothers ii motion to vacate the consent decree.the district court referred the parties to the note in its october,opinion.defendants then petitioned this court for writ of mandamus ordering the district court to rule on the motion to vacate.on september,this court concluded that mandamus should be denied based on the petitioners filings alone but ordered the district court to state in writing,within days of the entry of this order,any reason that this petition should not be granted.
three days later,the district court held that neither westside mothers ii nor brown required vacating or modifying the consent decree.john goetz,d.the district court noted that westside mothers ii expressly recognized an enforceable right under section a a for the state defendants ineffective outreach services in failing to inform plaintiffs of mandated medical services under the medicaid act and declined to vacate the consent decree information and outreach provisions.id.at.the district court acknowledged our statement in brown,that absent more,a waiting list for waiver services does not violate federal law,id.at quoting brown,at,but declined to vacate the consent decree requirements for the provision of epsdt services in the present case because brown decided only the waiting list and provider network claims in the context of the medical assistance and reasonable promptness clauses in section a a,id.at.the district court concluded that the consent decree remained enforceable without modification because the statutory text,legislative history,and accompanying regulations indicated congressional intent to establish an enforceable right to epsdt services and because the provisions of the decree are not premised on a duty to provide network adequacy or to terminate waiting lists subsequently eliminated as discussed in westside mothers ii and brown.id.at.defendants appeal this decision.
defendants argument for vacating the consent decree proceeds along two lines.first,defendants focus upon an assertion that the medicaid statute as a whole does not confer individually enforceable rights.the statute,they point out,uses language,not language.and,they say,the epsdt provisions implicated in the consent decree provide for systemwide programmatic regulation of the state program.defendants rely on the fifth circuit opinion in frazar gilbert,cir,rev on other grounds sub nom.frew hawkins.defendants also look to the content of the consent decree to argue that it addresses systemic concerns rather than provides a vehicle for enforcement of individual rights.second,defendants examine individually the primary statutory provisions on which the consent decree and plaintiffs claims are based in an effort to show that none of them is privately enforceable.
defendants first line of argument has considerable support in the language of the statute.but in westside mothers ii our court implicitly rejected such a broad view by assuming that some provisions of the statute may indeed be privately enforced and by examining individual provisions of the statute to determine whether a private right of action exists under each portion.most importantly,for purposes of this case,the panel in westside mothers ii permitted plaintiffs claim for relief under a a,a provision implicated in this case,to go forward.moreover,in brown,which presented a procedural posture identical to this case,we refused a request to vacate a consent decree in a suit brought by mentally disabled tennessee residents under the medicaid statute,in part because it was unclear from the record whether westside mothers ii completely undermined the settlement.the court in brown noted the absence of any record of settlement discussions or statements to the court and uncertainty about the basis and meaning of the decree.the panel adopted the approach of vacating portions of the consent decree that were based on provisions deemed unenforceable in westside mothers ii.brown,at.
here,it seems evident that the provisions of a are an important basis for the decree.we thus have no indication that the decree as a whole is undermined to such an extent that it should be set aside in its entirety.given the counsel of brown and taking into account that this court implicitly determined in westside mothers ii that at least one of the requirements of a that contained in a a may be enforced through an action under,we conclude that setting aside the decree in its entirety is unwarranted at this time.
we turn to an examination of specific portions of the statute in an effort to determine private enforceability.this is the teaching of westside mothers ii and also the approach defendants undertake in their second line of argument.although defendants argue that this analysis also requires vacating the consent decree in its entirety,we disagree.instead,we follow brown narrow approach of vacating those provisions of the decree based on portions of the statute not privately enforceable under westside mothers ii using this approach,and because westside mothers ii holds that a is not privately enforceable under,at,we vacate the consent decree requirement that defendants ensure that the availability of services is geographically comparable and any other provisions based on a.beyond this one provision,the status of other provisions of the decree remains uncertain.
one open question is the extent to which westside mothers ii holding that a state obligation under a and is only to pay for medical assistance may be applicable to the provisions of a not addressed in westside mothers ii.the answer to this question could potentially impact the provisions of the consent decree that require actual provision of service rather than simply payment.another issue relates to whether westside mothers ii determination about waiting lists is applicable to the waiting list provision of a c.f
