robert ellis appeals from the district court judgment affirming the commissioner denial of ellis claim for disability benefits.we affirm.
ellis filed an application for supplemental security income ssi on october,and the alj held a hearing on ellis application on november.the alj denied the application for benefits on january,and the appeals council denied ellis request for review on april,making the alj decision the final agency decision.
ellis alleged in his october,disability report that he has been disabled since due to back and leg problems,medications,chronic pain,hepatitis c,and limited physical activity.admin.at.ellis has been on strong narcotic pain medications for over ten years,and noted that medicine is the only thing that relives sic his pain.id.at.during the november,hearing,ellis testified that in addition to the impairments he had during his previous disability hearing in,he had been diagnosed with hepatitis c and diabetes within the last three years.id.at.ellis also testified that he had been admitted to the hospital with a blood clot in his left leg,which was diagnosed as thrombosis,one month prior to the hearing.id.at.ellis testified that a recent ct scan of his shoulder and neck revealed either a pinched nerve or torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder,for which he planned to have an operation.id.at.ellis stated that problems with his back,particularly degenerative disc disease,and his inability to sit or stand in one position for any period of time would prevent him from doing the types of jobs suggested during his prior hearing,such as a small parts bench assembler or sorter.id.at.
ellis treating physician,patrick johnson,provided an opinion dated november,in which he stated that ellis had multiple chronic medical problems that rendered him incapable of performing any sustained gainful employment.id.at.the opinion listed ellis medical problems as severe chronic pain in his back and hip as a result of multiple vehicle accidents,diabetes,hepatitis c,recurrent episodes of deep vein thromboembolism a blood clot in the thigh or leg dvt,severe dental caries,and hypertension.id.johnson opined that ellis was incapable of even the most sedentary work because he can not sit or stand probably for more than one hour at a time due to his chronic pain and his tendency toward developing blood clots in his legs.id.johnson also submitted a medical source statement of ability to do activities physical,dated october,in which he opined that ellis could walk a total of two hours in an period,but only a half hour without interruption,and that he could sit for a total of four hours in an period,but only one hour without interruption.id.at.
ellis has seen johnson on a regular basis since,primarily for chronic back and hip pain.the vast majority of ellis contacts with johnson during the time period since ellis previously denied application for disability benefits in have been routine examinations for his chronic back pain and refilling pain prescriptions.id.at.during each visit,johnson continued ellis regular course of medication and filled prescriptions by phone on a monthly basis between visits.id.johnson noted that ellis hepatitis c was quiescent during a september,visit.id.at.he also noted at an april,visit that ellis chronic back and hip pain were stable on his current medications.id.at.ellis first complained of shoulder pain during his august,checkup.id.at.johnson increased ellis oxyir prescription and gave ellis a depomedrol injection for the shoulder pain.johnson noted probable rotator cuff tendinitis,as opposed to a rotator cuff tear,and scheduled an mri.id.the tendinitis and pinched nerve were confirmed by an mri of the right shoulder on october,which revealed h ypertrophic ac joint with inferior impingement against the musculotendinous junction of the supraspinatus and b icipital tendinitis.id.at.
ellis has had two episodes of dvt,most recently being hospitalized on september.id.at.within hours the leg swelling and pain reduced dramatically,and he was walking without pain or difficulty by september.johnson continued ellis on coumadin to control the swelling and released ellis on september.the previous episode occurred in august when ellis was immobile following a pelvic fracture from an automobile accident.id.at.a examination on august,revealed that there was no warmth or swelling in the lower left leg and that ellis was doing well following a week in the hospital on heprin therapy.id.at.examinations subsequent to the episode revealed no evidence of recurrent dvt.id.at.
as to ellis back pain,the record includes ellis regular complaints of back pain and medication refills,and the results of an mri of the lumbar spine performed on july.the mri revealed m ild to moderate degenerative facet disease throughout the lumbar spine,and d egenerative disc disease but without disc herniations,spinal canal or gross neuroforaminal stenosis.id.at.
richard secor performed a state agency consultative examination of ellis on january,including various range of motion tests.secor noted that ellis had full range of motion in both shoulders,in his right elbow,both wrists,both knees,and both hips.id.at.he also had full range of motion upon lateral and back flexion of his cervical spine and lumbar spine.id.the examination revealed only slight range of motion limitations in ellis left wrist,extension of his cervical spine,rotation of his neck,and extension of his lumbar spine.id.secor recorded grip strength in both hands and both upper extremities at out of.id.at.secor noted that ellis recent mri showed no acute herniation,and that ellis reported chronic pain,which was treated with narcotics.id.at.secor also noted that ellis walked with assistance of a cane,but opined that the cane was not medically necessary.he noted that ellis could sit,stand,and lie down without assistance.id.at.
the alj determined that ellis had medically determined impairments of dvt,diabetes mellitus,and fibromyalgia,which amounted to severe impairments.add.at.the alj determined that ellis hepatitis c was,based on the medical records indicating that ellis liver enzymes were normal in april and that the hepatitis c was quiescent in september.the alj further found that ellis did not have a severe impairment in his back and legs,other than as it related to the fibromyalgia.he also found that ellis shoulder pain did not present a severe impairment unrelated to the fibromyalgia that was expected to last at least twelve months.
the alj then determined that ellis impairments did not meet a listed impairment and proceeded to determine ellis residual functional capacity rfc.the alj found ellis subjective complaints of the severity of his symptoms and limitations to be not fully credible,based on a lack of objective medical evidence or a treatment history that would support his allegations.giving ellis some benefit of the doubt about his limitations,the alj determined that ellis could lift and carry no more than ten pounds,could sit for up to six hours in an workday,and could stand for up to two hours in an workday,resulting in a finding that ellis could perform the full range of sedentary work.based on ellis age,education,and ability to perform the full range of sedentary work,the alj found that ellis was not disabled.see pt,subpt.p,app,table,rule.
the appeals council denied ellis request for review,and ellis appealed the denial of benefits to the district court.the experienced magistrate judge performed a thorough review of the medical evidence and determined that the alj did not err in denying ellis application for benefits.ellis appeals.
we review de novo the district court decision upholding the commissioner denial of disability benefits.we will affirm if substantial evidence on the record as a is,evidence which a reasonable mind would find adequate to support the commissioner the commissioner findings.stormo barnhart,cir.we consider the whole record,including evidence that detracts from as well as evidence that supports the commissioner decision,and we will not reverse as long as substantial evidence supports the outcome.id.
the alj undertook the familiar analysis in determining whether ellis was disabled finding at the fifth step that he was not.the commissioner bears the burden at the fifth step of establishing that,given the applicant residual functional capacity,age,education,and work experience,there are a significant number of jobs available in the national economy which the applicant can perform.c.ellis raises three issues on appeal.he claims that the alj erred by failing to fully develop the medical record before refusing to give controlling weight to his treating physician failing to properly apply the polaski factors to his subjective complaints of pain and failing to seek vocational expert testimony.we address each issue in turn.
alj obligation to develop the record and defer to ellis treating physician 
the alj declined to give controlling weight to johnson opinion because the opinion was not well supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and no examinations revealed signs indicative of johnson opinion such as muscle atrophy.add.at.ellis argues that rather than rejecting johnson opinion as conclusory,the alj had a duty to contact johnson for clarification of his opinion before discrediting it.
a social security hearing is a proceeding,and the alj has a duty to fully develop the record.see stormo,at.although that duty may include a treating physician for clarification of an opinion,that duty arises only if a crucial issue is undeveloped.id.ellis does not allege that the record is missing any relevant medical records.in fact,the alj held the record open for days following the hearing to allow ellis to supplement it with a more recent opinion from johnson,which gave the alj the benefit of johnson november,letter.at oral argument before this court,ellis attorney noted that he supplemented the record and asserted that the record was sufficiently developed to support johnson opinion that ellis was disabled.without informing the court what additional medical evidence should be obtained from johnson,ellis has failed to establish that the alj alleged failure to fully develop the record resulted in prejudice,and has therefore provided no basis for remanding for additional evidence.see shannon chater,cir r eversal due to failure to develop the record is only warranted where such failure is unfair or prejudicial.the alj did not err in failing to johnson.
the alj refused to give controlling weight to johnson opinion that ellis was disabled and limited in his ability to stand for no more than two hours a day or to sit for no more than four hours per day.in assessing ellis rfc,the alj determined that ellis could sit for a total of six hours and stand for a total of two hours,but was limited to sedentary work.this in itself is a significant limitation,which reveals that the alj did give some credit to johnson medical opinions.it is only johnson opinion about how long ellis could sit or stand and his opinion that ellis was incapable of working with which the alj disagreed.
generally,an alj is obliged to give controlling weight to a treating physician medical opinions that are supported by the record.see randolph barnhart,cir d.a medical source opinion that an applicant is disabled or unable to work,however,involves an issue reserved for the commissioner and therefore is not the type of medical opinion to which the commissioner gives controlling weight.see stormo,at t reating physicians opinions are not medical opinions that should be credited when they simply state that a claimant can not be gainfully employed,because they are merely opinions on the application of the statute,a task assigned solely to the discretion of the commissioner.internal marks omitted e.further,although medical source opinions are considered in assessing rfc,the final determination of rfc is left to the commissioner.see e.thus,to the extent that the alj discredited johnson conclusion that ellis could not work,he rightly did so.
the commissioner defers to a treating physician medical opinions about the nature and severity of an applicant impairments,including symptoms,diagnosis and prognosis,what an applicant is capable of doing despite the impairment,and the resulting restrictions.a.a treating physician opinion is due controlling weight if that opinion is by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the record.hogan apfel,cir quoting prosch apfel.
this arguably includes johnson opinion that ellis could only stand for a total of two hours and sit for a total of four hours in a work day based on ellis severe chronic back and hip pain.admin.at.johnson also opined that ellis could neither sit nor stand for more than an hour at a time due to his chronic pain and tendency toward blood clots in his legs from the deep vein thromboembolism.id.at.the alj applied the same limit to ellis ability to stand,but found that he could sit for up to six hours rather than four in an period.as noted by the alj,there is no medical evidence suggesting the limitations contained in johnson letter.ellis admittedly has chronic back and hip pain,but the record reveals that his medications alleviate that pain.ellis testified that he spent his time reading and watching television,which is contrary to his assertion that he could sit only for a limited time.johnson never ordered or even suggested to ellis that he limit the time that he stood or sat,nor did ellis ever suggest to johnson that he was unable to stand or sit for any length of time.see hogan,at discounting medical source statement opining that applicant could not sit,stand,or walk for more than minutes at a time or one hour total per day where no similar restrictions were included in her treatment records,and the consulting doctor concluded that the applicant could sit,stand,or walk up to six hours per day.although johnson listed ellis propensity for blood clots in his legs as medical support for his finding that ellis could not sit or stand for more than an hour at a time,johnson never cautioned ellis or limited ellis prolonged sitting or standing to avoid the possibility of a blood clot.see hensley barnhart,cir affirming alj decision discrediting treating physician opinion that applicant had significantly limited mobility where few if any functional limitations were placed on the applicant by his other physicians hogan,at discrediting treating physician opinion of limitations where n one of these restrictions appear elsewhere in the treating physician treatment records.johnson noted that kept ellis thromboembolism in control.further,secor noted that ellis was able to walk briskly without use of the cane that he carried,opining that the cane was medically unnecessary,and ellis had no problems getting around the examining room.because johnson opinion that ellis could only stand for two hours and sit for four hours,and do neither for more than one hour at a time,is not supported by any medical evidence in the record and is contrary to other evidence in the record,the alj properly discredited the opinion.
application of polaski to ellis subjective claims of pain 
it is the alj duty to determine an applicant rfc.before doing so,the alj must determine the applicant credibility,as his subjective complaints play a role in assessing his rfc.pearsall massanari,cir.applying the factors discussed in polaski,at,the alj found that ellis was not fully credible about the severity of his symptoms and limitations based on a lack of objective medical evidence in the record,as well as ellis limited treatment record.add.at.the alj noted that ellis medications alleviated his pain,there was no record of adverse side effects from the medication,and no doctor observed signs consistent with the limited lifestyle claimed by ellis.id.at.while the alj may not discount ellis complaints solely because they are not fully supported by objective medical evidence,ellis complaints may be discounted based on inconsistencies in the record as a whole.lowe apfel,cir.
where adequately explained and supported,credibility findings are for the alj to make.id.the alj adequately explained the inconsistencies upon which he relied to discount ellis subjective complaints,and we therefore uphold that finding.the record reveals that ellis has not worked since.admin.at.see woolf shalala,cir noting that a sporadic work history is relevant to the alj credibility analysis polaski,at noting work history as one factor to consider in credibility determination.ellis claimed that back and hip pain were severe enough to prevent him from sitting or standing for any length of time,yet secor examination in january revealed that ellis had normal,or near normal,range of motion in his shoulders,hips,cervical spine,and lumbar spine.admin.at.the record also revealed that medication alleviated his pain.id.at.finally,johnson noted his concern that ellis was becoming addicted to the narcotic medications as early as id.at,providing a further basis for disbelieving the severity of ellis complaints,see anderson barnhart,cir noting that record supported alj finding concerning applicant possible overuse of narcotic pain medication in discrediting applicant.
requirement for vocational expert testimony 
ellis argues that the alj erred in relying on the guidelines grids to determine whether he was disabled because of his impairments.the alj may not rely on the grids if ellis suffers from impairments,but instead must obtain the opinion of a vocational expert.see shannon,at.impairments that do not diminish or significantly limit the claimant residual functional capacity to perform the full range of activities do not prevent use of the grids,however.id.because the alj was within his discretion,based on the record,to discredit ellis subjective complaints of pain and find that ellis pain did not diminish his ability to perform the full range of sedentary work,the alj properly relied on the grids without calling for vocational expert testimony.id.
ellis also argues that his inability to sit or stand for more than an hour at a time significantly limits the number of sedentary jobs available to him,and as such,the alj should have called a vocational expert to assess this limitation.sedentary jobs primarily involve sitting,although the category also includes jobs with occasional standing or walking.a.a social security ruling explains that the sitting requirement allows for normal breaks,including lunch,at two hour intervals.see ssr,wl,at.july.the ruling likewise notes that the full range of sedentary jobs requires an applicant to be able to walk or stand for approximately two hours out of an day.the need to alternate between sitting and standing more frequently than every two hours could significantly erode the occupational base for a full range of unskilled sedentary work.id.at.the ruling notes that the rfc assessment should include the frequency with which an applicant needs to alternate between sitting and standing,and if the need exists,that vocational expert testimony may be more appropriate than the grids.id.
if the alj had credited johnson opinion that ellis could sit for no more than one hour at a time,then we would agree with ellis that the alj should have sought the opinion of a vocational expert.we have already determined,however,that the alj properly discredited johnson opinion,and the alj rfc assessment properly excluded that limitation.having found,as supported by the record,that ellis could sit for up to six hours during an period,with no apparent need to alternate that position more frequently than every two hours,the alj appropriately relied on the grids.see patrick barnhart,cir affirming alj use of grids where alj properly discredited claimant complaints of fatigue.
we appreciate the fact that ellis has had an unfortunate and difficult history involving numerous automobile accidents that resulted in significant injuries.given the record,the alj explanation of his actions,and the district court thorough review,we are bound to uphold the commissioner decision to deny benefits.the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
i respectfully dissent.the administrative law judge failed to give controlling weight to the opinion of ellis treating physician,that ellis was permanently and completely disabled,instead giving credence to a medical consultant who examined ellis on a single occasion.moreover,the alj improperly rejected ellis testimony with respect to his inability to work because of constant debilitating pain.after a careful review,i believe that ellis has demonstrated by substantial evidence in the record as a whole that he is entitled to disability benefits starting november.i would remand to the district court with directions to remand to the commissioner for an award of benefits.
the alj and the majority err in not considering ellis extensive medical history when evaluating his application.it is appropriate to consider the claimant entire history as background in determining whether he is currently disabled.hamlin barnhart,cir e ven if a doctor medical observations regarding a claimant allegations of disability date from earlier,previously adjudicated periods,the doctor observations are nevertheless relevant to the claimant medical history and should be considered by the alj.see also frustaglia sec y of health human,cir per curiam t he alj is entitled to consider evidence from a prior denial for the limited purpose of reviewing the preliminary facts or cumulative medical history necessary to determine whether the claimant was disabled at the time of his second application.
review of this previous history is revealing.ellis has been involved in numerous serious accidents.admin.at.in,when ellis was,he was a passenger in an automobile accident and sustained fractures to both femurs,a fracture to the left radius,pneumothorax collapsed lung,and numerous internal injuries.id.at.in july of,ellis was in the bed of a pickup truck that rolled several times.he was thrown clear but sustained a pelvic fracture and other injuries.id.on october,ellis was a passenger in a car that was struck from behind.he was thrown through the windshield and sustained extensive facial lacerations and contusions of his right forearm and right hip.id.at.two months later ellis resumed work as a roofer and sustained injuries to his right hip after a fall from a roof.id.at.sixteen months later,he fell again and sustained a bruise to his tail bone.id.in september of,ellis was a passenger in a rollover accident in which he suffered a severe scalp laceration.id.at.in april,ellis was a passenger in a car that left the road and hit a tree.he suffered multiple minor injuries.id.at.to summarize,ellis has been involved in five serious car accidents in which he sustained injuries including fractures of both femurs,a fracture of the left radius,a collapsed lung,a pelvic fracture,facial lacerations,scalp lacerations,and multiple minor injuries.in addition,he has fallen twice from roofs,injuring his right hip and tail bone.
the alj improperly rejected the opinion of ellis treating physician,patrick.johnson.a treating physician opinion is given controlling weight if that opinion is by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the record.holmstrom massanari,cir quoting prosch apfel,cir quoting d.the alj must give good reasons for the weight accorded a treating physician opinion.id.
johnson has been ellis treating physician since august.he treated claimant for his injuries from the automobile accidents,falls,and the disabilities flowing from these accidents deep vein thrombosis of the left leg,admin.at excruciating pain in the right hip,id.at a chip fracture,id.ecchymoses in the right leg,id.numbness in the right leg,id.at elevated blood pressure related to severe pain,id.at and chronic back,hip,and elbow pain id.at.ellis has been treated for a collapsed gall bladder,id.at active hepatitis c,id.at infected teeth and severe gingivitis,id.mild to moderate degenerate facet disk disease,id.at and cervical spondylosis,id.at.in september,ellis was hospitalized for deep vein thrombosis causing swelling in his left leg.id.at.the admitting physician,jesse hoff,also diagnosed ellis with dependent diabetes.id.at.
johnson wrote repeated letters detailing his reason
