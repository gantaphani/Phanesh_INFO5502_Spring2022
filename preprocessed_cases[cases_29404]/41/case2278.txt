as we are often called to do,we address a federal agency interpretation of words chosen by congress and the sometimes tricky shoals of chevron deference.resident councils of washington,an organization consisting primarily of nursing and boarding home residents and their families,and the washington state care ombudsman program,representing washington care facility residents collectively,plaintiffs,appeal the adverse grant of summary judgment in their challenge to the secretary of health and human services secretary or agency regulations authorizing states to allow the use of paid feeding assistants to feed nursing home residents who do not have complicated feeding problems.
plaintiffs contend that the regulations violate the nursing home reform law reform law,by permitting nursing or services to be performed by individuals not authorized by the statute.they argue that the regulations are not entitled to deference because they are contrary to congress express intent and,alternatively,that the regulations are not based on a permissible construction of the reform law.we have jurisdiction under and affirm.
facts and procedural history 
statutory background 
congress enacted the reform law as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of,stat.codified as amended at.the reform law legislative history indicates congress was deeply troubled that the federal government,through the medicaid program,continues to pay nursing facilities for providing poor quality care to vulnerable elderly and disabled beneficiaries.i at,cong.the central purpose of the reform law was to improve the quality of care for nursing home residents,and either to bring substandard facilities into compliance with medicaid quality of care requirements or to exclude them from the program.id.
to effect this purpose,the reform law imposed several new requirements relating to nursing home resident services,including an annual standardized resident assessment conducted by a registered nurse,b,b a written plan of care for each resident,id.b,b and resident medical care under a physician supervision,id.b,b.
the reform law also prohibits the paid use of any individual as a nurse aide in the facility for more than months unless the individual has completed a training and competency evaluation program and is competent to provide nursing or services.id.b a,b a.congress then specified that nurse aides are required to complete a minimum of hours of initial training.id.f a i,f a i.congress defined nurse aide to mean any individual providing nursing or services to residents,but excluding any individual who is a licensed health professional,registered dietician,or volunteer.id.b f,b f congress did not further define nursing or services.
ii.regulatory background 
a initial regulations 
in,the department of health and human services hhs issued regulations implementing the reform law.see.these regulations enumerated certain topics to be included in the nurse aide training curriculum,including a ssisting with eating and hydration and p roper feeding techniques.b v,vi.
the regulations did not,however,further define nursing or services,specifying only that an individual must be directly involved in patient care to meet the definition of nurse aide.at.hhs administrators subsequently interpreted nursing or services in informal letters to include assisting a resident with feeding and,accordingly,took the view that feeding assistance could only be performed by a nurse aide or statutorily exempt individual,though it appears the secretary never made an official pronouncement to this effect.
b proposed regulations 
in march,the secretary proposed a new rule allowing states to permit nursing homes to use paid feeding assistants for residents without complicated feeding problems see notice of proposed rulemaking.the notice explained that the new rule was necessary in light of changes in the care industry,including a growing shortage of nurse aides,exacerbated by the nature of feeding assistance,an increasing aged population,and increasing demands on nurse aides.id.at.the secretary described the positive experiences of two states that use paid feeding assistants.id.at.the proposed rule preamble noted the secretary conclusion that the proposed change comported with existing law and that the benefits of the change would outweigh any risks.id.finally,the secretary acknowledged that the proposed rule constituted a change in policy and solicited public comment.id.at 
c final regulations 
after receiving over comments,of which supported the proposed rule the secretary promulgated the final regulations on september,codified at h.the final regulations allow states the option of permitting nursing homes to use paid feeding assistants subject to certain limitations.
feeding assistants must first successfully complete a training course including at least eight hours of training.h i,q,a.in addition,feeding assistants may feed only those residents who have no complicated feeding problems such as difficulty swallowing,recurrent lung aspirations,and tube or parenteral iv feedings.id.h.resident eligibility to be fed by feeding assistants is based on the charge nurse assessment and the resident latest assessment and plan of care.id.h iii.further,feeding assistants must work under the supervision of a registered,or licensed practical,nurse and must call a supervisory nurse for assistance in the case of an emergency.id.h.finally,the rule clarifies that feeding assistants are meant to supplement,not supplant,nurse aides.
iii.district court proceedings 
plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief in district court,alleging that the regulations violated the reform law and were arbitrary and capricious in violation of the administrative procedure act.after dismissing six for lack of standing,the district court granted summary judgment to the secretary,concluding that the reform law use of the term nursing or services was ambiguous,that the agency interpretation of it a permissible construction which did not frustrate congressional intent,and that the agency action was not arbitrary or capricious.
plaintiffs timely appealed,contesting only the district court determination that the regulations do not violate the reform law.
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.creagri,usana health sciences,cir.
when reviewing an agency construction of a statute it is charged with administering,we first look to the statutory text to see whether congress has spoken directly to the question at hand.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.contract,rumsfeld,cir per curiam quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d.thus,t he language of a statute is controlling when the meaning is plain and unambiguous.united states,cir.
if,however,the statute is uncertain or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,a reviewing court can not simply impose its own construction.see united states,cir.rather,under chevron,we defer to the agency interpretation if it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.at.
discussion 
the sole issue before us is whether feeding nursing home residents without complicated feeding problems constitutes a nursing or service,which must therefore be performed by a certified nurse aide.the secretary has determined that such activity is not a service and may therefore be performed by a feeding assistant subject to fewer training requirements and less oversight than a nurse aide.in evaluating the secretary interpretation,we employ the familiar chevron test.
chevron step one unambiguous meaning 
a standard 
we must first determine whether the meaning of the reform law is plain and unambiguous and,therefore,controlling.see,at.to determine if congress has directly spoken to the issue of whether feeding nursing home residents without complicated feeding problems is a nursing or activity,we employ the traditional tools of statutory construction if congress had an intent on this issue,that intent is the law and must be given effect.student loan fund of idaho,dep t of,cir internal quotations omitted.
these tools of construction require us first to engage in a textual analysis of the relevant statutory provisions and to read the words of statutes in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.if the proper interpretation is not clear from this textual analysis,the legislative history offers valuable guidance and insight into congressional intent.however,it is well established that legislative history which does not demonstrate a clear and certain congressional intent can not form the basis for enjoining regulations.
id.citations and quotation marks omitted.in conducting this analysis,we may not rewrite a statute,but instead simply construe what congress has written.after all,congress expresses its purpose by words.it is for us to to add nor to subtract,neither to delete nor to distort.cases,more or less,each containing six jars of jam united states.u nless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.wilderness soc y fish wildlife,cir en banc internal quotations omitted.if necessary to discern congress intent,we may look to the structure and purpose of a statute in determining the plain meaning of its provisions.id.if congress has spoken directly to the question at hand,we may not defer to a contrary agency interpretation.id.at.
b analysis 
although plaintiffs acknowledge that the reform law neither expressly defines nursing or services,nor explicitly states that all resident feeding must be performed by a certified nurse aide,they nonetheless contend that the reform law plain language,general purpose,and structure demonstrate that congress clearly intended all resident feeding to be performed by certified nurse aides.
plain language 
as noted above,the reform law prohibits the use of any individual performing nursing or services to residents for more than four months unless the individual has completed a minimum of hours of training.b a b f f a i b a b f f a i.congress provided no further elaboration on its intent or the definitions of the relevant terms in the statutory text or legislative history.see,i,at.
referencing dictionary definitions of nursing and related,plaintiffs contend that the statute meaning is clear 
they argue that the inclusion of services indicates that certification is required for the personal care assistance that has a relation to the health care provided to nursing home residents,and they assert ipse dixit that such assistance includes assistance with eating,as well as assistance with other activities of daily living such as dressing,walking,and using the toilet.
no support is offered for this claim beyond the statement that residents live in nursing homes only because they can not live independently and need substantial assistance to perform daily tasks such as dressing,walking,eating,and using the toilet.true as this might be in most cases,it fails to account for the regulations limited application to residents without complicated feeding problems.all agree that feeding the most infirm or medically challenging residents constitutes activity and requires a nurse aide.
the next argument is that the statute plain language clearly demonstrate s a decision by congress to require that all care by nursing home staff members be provided exclusively by licensed health professionals,registered dieticians,or certified nurse aides.again,little support is offered.although a congressional committee has noted that nurse aides provide most of the care to nursing faclity sic residents,at,reprinted in,and the secretary has described nurse aides as performing tasks on an individual,in direct contact with a resident,and directly involved in patient care,a,b.at,it simply does not follow that nurse aides must perform all care of nursing home residents.at most,these statements indicate that all work performed by nurse aides is.they do not,however,support the,that all work must be performed by nurse aides.
in sum,nothing in the statutory language or legislative history clearly shows that congress intended the phrase services to include all resident feeding or that all care be performed by nurse aides.unable to identify congress clear intent from the plain language,we turn to the purpose and structure of the statute.
purpose and structure 
plaintiffs note that because the reform law is remedial in nature it should therefore be construed broadly in light of its purpose.see tcherepnin knight,d noting the familiar canon of statutory construction that remedial legislation should be construed broadly to effectuate its purposes.plaintiffs contend that the reform law purpose and structure indicates that the phrase nursing or services includes virtually all care provided in a nursing home.
all agree that the central purpose of the reform law was to improve the quality of care for nursing home residents.i at.plaintiffs argue this purpose was to be served in large part through the nurse aide certification standards,which must therefore apply broadly to all staff members providing assistance with activities of daily living.once again,no support is offered for the assertion that congress intended all care to be performed by nurse aides.true as it may be that nurse aide certification plays an important part in congress efforts to improve nursing home care via the reform law,this says nothing about whether the feeding of residents without complicated feeding problems constitutes a service that congress intended to address through nurse aide certification.
in sum,as the district court held,congressional intent that resident feeding constitutes a service can not be gleaned from the reform law general purpose to improve nursing home care.
b structure 
we next address whether the reform law delegating specific tasks to the that congress did not intend to delegate the task of defining nursing or services.plaintiffs note,for example,that the reform law specifies that the secretary should define serious mental illness and specialized services.see e g i,iii.while true that definition of certain terms was expressly left to the secretary discretion,there is nothing to indicate congress intended to prohibit the secretary from defining other where the terms were otherwise left undefined by the reform law.it strains credulity to accept the argument that the secretary may only define terms when expressly authorized to do so by congress,given that congress made no attempt to define the generic,yet vital,phrase nursing or services.
chevron itself acknowledges the possibility of implicit delegation to the agency where the statute is silent.at.further,the secretary undeniably has general authority,a,as well as specific rulemaking authority with respect to nursing homes,id.f,f,and we have regularly applied chevron deference to agency interpretations of the medicare and medicaid statutes,see,alaska dep t of health soc.servs.ctrs.for medicare medicaid,cir.
in addition,contrary to plaintiffs contention,the secretary claimed discretion to define services is not virtually unchecked.there are certain activities that so clearly fall within the ambit of services that the secretary would not be able to reasonably remove them from the definition by regulation.however,feeding residents without complicated feeding problems does not fit so clearly within the plain meaning of nursing related and it is such borderline activities over which the secretary has discretion.to hold otherwise,and conclude that the secretary lacked discretion to define services,would be to leave a critical statutory term incurably vague,frustrating the purpose and effectiveness of the reform law.
plaintiffs final even if the secretary has discretion to define nursing or services,congress did not intend the definition to change based on employment conditions and therefore the current nationwide nurse aide shortage reported by the secretary can not justify a changed also ultimately unpersuasive 
although the secretary examination of the definition of services appears to have been prompted by changed market conditions,the regulations are the result of the secretary subsequent conclus
