john swanson appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to the university of cincinnati uc and university hospital,uhi on his claims of employment discrimination based on disability under titles i and ii of the americans with disabilities act ada,the rehabilitation act,and ohio statute.
we affirm the district court decision that swanson does not qualify as an individual with a disability under the ada,the rehabilitation act,and the ohio statute.as a result,this court need not resolve the issues of whether title ii applies to employment discrimination claims against public entities or whether uhi is a proper defendant.
background 
after completing medical school at the university of nevada,swanson was accepted as a categorical general surgical resident at uc in may uc and swanson entered into a contract,running from july,to june,under which he received a salary and was covered by uc and the house staff association collective bargaining agreement.uc accepts residents under the precept that they will complete their program if they meet expectations.
uc surgical residency program typically involves five years of practicing medicine and treating hospital patients as well as two years of laboratory research.during the first year,swanson had rotations in general surgery,thoracic surgery,transplantation,pediatric surgery,trauma,and burns at various hospitals in cincinnati.after each rotation,the attending doctors and chief residents of the service completed a performance evaluation for each resident in the areas of patient care and clinical judgement,medical knowledge,technical and procedural skills,attitude and professional behavior,and medical record.performance ratings include for distinctly superior to other residents,for at times superior to other residents,for similar to other residents,for at times below other residents,and for clearly below other residents.residents also receive numerical grades with as outstanding,as very good,as good,as adequate,and and lower as below adequate.
during his july rotation in thoracic surgery,swanson sole evaluator assigned him a for attitude and professional behavior,in the other categories,and a grade of,noting no weaknesses.his ratings dropped during his transplantation rotation.one reviewer gave him in the first three categories and in the last two,with an overall score of.the second reviewer assigned him in the first two categories and in the last two,with a score of.the second reviewer commented that swanson had a strong work ethic,but seemed overwhelmed at times and was very slow to pick up how to get the work done.
from september to december,swanson evaluations from his surgery rotations included or for attitude and professional behavior,but fluctuated between and in the areas of patient care and clinical judgment,medical knowledge,and technical and procedural skills.most reviewers noted deficiencies in his technical and organizational skills,particularly prioritization.during this time,swanson took the american board of surgery basic examination,a standardized test measuring general surgery knowledge,and scored poorly.
from january to april,swanson had rotations with pediatric surgery,va medical service,and thoracic surgery.he received two,three,and a for technical and procedural skills three,two,and a in medical knowledge and two,two,and a and in patient care and clinical judgement.scores in attitude and professional behavior and medical record ranged from to.some reviewers noted no weaknesses,while others criticized his aggressive approach in managing staff,deficient technical skills,and ineffective organizational skills.his numerical scores ranged from to.
in may,bower conducted swanson first evaluation based on his performance reviews and his standardized test score.finding swanson performance to be below the level expected,bower placed him on academic probation until september.he also recommended counseling to improve swanson methods of study and ability to organize and prioritize tasks in patient care.swanson was also informed that at the end of probation,a decision would be made whether to extend his academic probation or discontinue his residency training.
from may to june,swanson evaluations dropped significantly on his burns and surgery rotations.he received a and four in patient care and clinical judgment,a and four in medical knowledge,and two and a in technical and procedural skills.his score for medical record hovered at and attitude and professional skills ranged from to.his overall score was between and.
based on the recommendation of fischer,who evaluated him in june,swanson sought help from barker,a psychiatrist in july.she diagnosed him as suffering from major depression arising from the of a significant relationship,his parents separation while he was in college,and other personal losses.swanson told barker that he had been experiencing poor concentration,an inability to speak,tearfulness,and feeling withdrawn and exhausted.he stated that he only slept four to five hours per night,but his sleep was not disturbed.in her mental status exam,barker found that swanson thought processes were logical and coherent,and he was cognitively intact.
though he resisted at first,swanson began to take paxil,an antidepressant,on july,and his condition improved.because his medication had a sedative effect,barker switched him to prozac on august.during the transition,swanson symptoms recurred and his dosage was increased until it was therapeutically effective.barker states that prozac optimal effect occurs after a four week period swanson also had therapy sessions with barker in july and august,but none between early august and november due in part to his work schedule.
from july to september,swanson surgery and trauma rotations yielded mediocre reviews.he received a,two,three,and two for patient care a,three,two and two for medical knowledge,and two,two,a,and two for technical skills.some reviewers noted continuing problems with organization and prioritization,bad rapport with other hospital staff,and unreliable clinical assessments,while others noted improvements in his patient care and medical knowledge.his overall scores ranged from to.
during his september meeting with bower regarding his progress,swanson stated that he believed his medication was helping his concentration and that his clinical performance had improved.from his observations during this meeting,bower believed that the counseling and medication had improved swanson attitude and ability to converse.subsequently,bower received swanson july to august evaluations which demonstrated some improvement in medical knowledge but swanson organizational skills,clinical assessment abilities,technical skills,and rapport with staff were deficient.on september,the residency review committee approved bower recommendation to terminate swanson residency.when swanson and bower met on september,bower informed him that his probation was extended for at least another month but most likely,his contract would not be renewed.based on swanson evaluations,bower pointed out that he improved while working in a structured environment but his performance deficiencies reappeared when he was assigned to a busy service with numerous patients.bower recommended that because surgery may not be the best fit,swanson should consider applying to another specialty for a residency.
swanson october evaluations from his trauma rotation demonstrated no improvement from prior months.he received two and a in patient care a,and in medical knowledge,and a and two in technical skills.his numerical score fell between and.on october,bower presented the resident review committee termination recommendation to the entire faculty and it was approved.swanson was informed that the faculty decision to terminate his appointment was effective by letter on october,and that he could present additional information at an internal hearing scheduled to review his termination on november.in addition,the letter stated that his salary and benefits would continue through november.bower also relieved him of his clinical duties.swanson contacted barker regarding his dismissal and her notes state that he was calm and cognitively intact.
at the internal hearing,swanson appeared with his union representative before bower,fischer,hurst,and fegelman.the union representative requested that swanson be reappointed and presented a letter from barker stating that his first year of residency was strongly affected by his depression and it was reasonable to expect improvements in his performance over the next six to nine months.when the review committee declined to reinstate swanson,his union representative requested that he receive a medical leave of absence for an unspecified time due to his depression.this request was denied on the grounds that a surgical residency could not be interrupted and must be completed through consecutive years of training.on november,swanson again asked for a meeting to discuss accommodations but was denied.
on january,uc leased its assets and interest,including swanson surgical residency contract,in the university of cincinnati hospital to uhi.because swanson and uc attempted to negotiate a settlement regarding his termination,his salary and benefits continued until june,when uc advised uhi that swanson had not been reappointed.since that time,swanson obtained a preliminary residency in general surgery with the university of nevada school of medicine and has given a solid performance.
swanson filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc alleging that uc and uhi had terminated him on the basis of his disability,major depression,and denied his request for accommodation.he later filed his initial complaint in the district court.according to his amended complaint,swanson asserts employment discrimination claims against uc and uhi under title i and ii of the ada,a,the rehabilitation act,and ohio et for terminating his residency on the basis of his disability and refusing his requests for reasonable accommodations.uc and uhi filed a motion for summary judgment.
in applying the similar prima facie standard for employment discrimination under title i,the rehabilitation act,and ohio a,the district court ruled only on whether swanson condition qualified him as disabled.the district court ruled that swanson major life activities were not substantially limited by his condition because any restrictions were in nature and mitigated by medication.in addition,his limitations were no greater than those experienced by the average person.swanson also alleged substantial limitation in his ability to work.the district court noted that he did not miss any days of work his reviewers consistently noted he was able to work hard,even at the peak of his illness and his record at the university of nevada indicated swanson could give a solid performance in surgery with proper medication.based on these factors,it held that his depression had only a effect on his performance and he was not substantially limited in the major life activity of working.further,the district court dismissed the title ii claim stating that in parker metropolitan life ins,cir en banc,this circuit ruled that title ii does not cover employment discrimination.
finding that the defendants did not believe swanson was disqualified from performing a broad range of jobs,but rather encouraged him to switch to another medical speciality,the district court rejected his claim that uc and uhi regarded him as disabled.finding that swanson was not disabled within the meaning of the three statutes,the district court granted summary judgment to uc and uhi.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews de novo the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants.see cehrs northeast ohio alzheimer research,cir.under federal rule of civil procedure c,summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see celotex catrett,d.
iii.discussion 
claims under the ada,rehabilitation act,and ohio law 
in his complaint,swanson seeks monetary damages from uc based on its alleged violation of title i of the ada.uc is a public entity operated by the state of ohio as an institution of higher learning.in board of trustees of the of alabama garrett,the supreme court held that the eleventh amendment bars suits by private individuals for money damages under title,d based on garrett,swanson title i claim against uc is barred.
swanson employment discrimination claims under the rehabilitation act and ohio a are not barred and are analyzed under criteria similar to title i claims.see monette electronic data,cir stating that the analysis of claims under the ada and rehabilitation act are similar and citing maddox of tennessee,cir.to establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination based on disability,the plaintiff must show that 
he is an individual with a disability according to the statute 
he is otherwise qualified to perform the job requirements,with or without reasonable accommodation 
he suffered an adverse employment decision 
the employer knew or had reason to know of his disability and 
the position remained open after the adverse employment decision or the disabled individual was replaced.
see monette,at.in addition,the plaintiff must establish that the relevant program or activity is receiving federal financial assistance under the rehabilitation act.see maddox,at.
when a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of employment discrimination,the employer then bears the burden of production and must assert a legitimate,justification for its action.monette,at.if the employer presents evidence of a legitimate reason for the adverse action,the burden returns to the employee who must show that the proffered explanation is a pretext for the employer unlawful discrimination.see id.
in this case,the question is whether swanson is disabled under the federal and state statutes.the ada,the rehabilitation act,and the ohio statute define disability as 
a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual 
a record of such impairment or 
being regarded as having such an impairment.
see ohio a.
while congress has not assigned authority to a federal agency to issue regulations defining the terms mental impairment,substantially limits,or major life activities,the parties accept the eeoc regulatory interpretation of these terms and this court assumes h,i,and j are reasonable.see sutton united air lines,d.the district court assumed,and the parties do not dispute,that major depression is a mental impairment.see pritchard southern,cir see also kocsis management,cir citing miller cas,cir which recognized a manic depressive condition as a mental impairment.in regard to major life activities,the district court and parties also assume that sleeping,concentrating,communicating,and working are major life activities 
the major dispute focuses on whether swanson depression substantially limits these major life activities.substantially limits means 
unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform or 
significantly restricted as to the condition,manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition,manner,or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.
j emphasis added.
swanson argues that he was significantly restricted in his ability to sleep,concentrate,and communicate.factors that should be considered in determining if he qualifies as substantially limited in these major life activities include 
the nature and severity of the impairment 
the duration or expected duration of the impairment and 
the permanent or long term impact,or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment.
taking into consideration mitigating measures,the district court ruled that if swanson was restricted in his ability to perform these activities,the restriction was in nature because of his medicatio
