mike kirkeberg brought claims pursuant to the americans with disabilities act ada,and the minnesota human rights act mhra,alleging that his employer,canadian pacific railway canadian pacific,discriminated against him on the basis of his disabilities and retaliated against him for engaging in protected activity.he also brought claims alleging violations of the age discrimination in employment act,and the minnesota whistleblower act.the district granted summary judgment in favor of canadian pacific.kirkeberg canadian pac,wl.kirkeberg appeals the district court decision regarding his claims under the ada and the mhra.we affirm.
because we are reviewing a grant of summary judgment,we describe the facts in the light most favorable to kirkeberg.kirkeberg worked as the administrator of employee assistance programs eap for canadian pacific from until his termination on may.in that role,he assisted the railway employees with mental health issues,substance abuse problems,workplace conflicts,and traumatic workplace incidents.at one point,kirkeberg took charge of providing eap services to the employees of the delaware and hudson railway in the northeastern united states.
in january,kirkeberg suddenly became legally blind in his left eye after suffering a central retinal vein occlusion crvo.the vision in his right eye,while naturally poor,is almost normal or with the help of a corrective lens.kirkeberg continued working after the incident,but he presented his,gregory simmons,with a letter from his physician,dated february,that said kirkeberg was experiencing significant eye strain as he learned to cope with the loss of vision.the physician stated that kirkeberg would benefit from a shorter work week during this acclimation period,but simmons did not act on this recommendation.
kirkeberg testified in his deposition that because of his partial blindness,e verything is a little more challenging.he stated that he tires easily and finds it harder to navigate on his left side,especially around objects that are low to the ground.despite these difficulties,kirkeberg said that his ability to do his job at canadian pacific was not affected by his condition,even in early,when his right eye became infected for several weeks,and he was unable to wear his corrective lens.kirkeberg could not drive without the lens,but he continued to perform his job.when the infection cleared,kirkeberg resumed driving without restriction.
after the onset of his vision problems,kirkeberg asked canadian pacific for several accommodations,in addition to the shortened work week suggested by his physician.he requested a larger computer monitor to help him read more easily.he asked that his office be reconfigured to prevent him from tripping.he also discussed with simmons the possibility of working from home as his right eye acclimated.he believed that he could perform his job functions from home,and he claimed to know of at least three other canadian pacific employees who were permitted to work from home.canadian pacific provided a bigger computer monitor,but declined to grant the other requests.
in december or january,kirkeberg informed simmons that he had hepatitis c,and that he was considering treatment that might cause him to miss work.he requested that simmons allow him to work from home on days when his treatment made him ill,but simmons did not approve the request.kirkeberg alleges that after he disclosed his hepatitis c to simmons,simmons began to treat him like he was invisible,and stopped responding to his or requests to meet.simmons testified that at about this same time,he began to consider outsourcing the eap to an outside provider.
kirkeberg received a bonus and salary increase in february,and he was informed that he would begin reporting to karen detuncq instead of simmons.kirkeberg told detuncq about his hepatitis c and the extensive treatment that he was considering.she advised him to take leave pursuant to the family and medical leave act.kirkeberg obtained an application for leave but never completed it,because he believed that other employees who missed work for medical treatment were not required to do the same.kirkeberg ultimately did not pursue treatment for hepatitis c before his termination.
on march,a occurred at canadian pacific,and kirkeberg computer was stolen from his office.kirkeberg told simmons that the computer would not have been stolen if he had been permitted to work from home.simmons allegedly became upset over this remark and said that nobody was going to work from home unless he simmons worked from home.later that same day,simmons sent an to his supervisor,glen wilson,concerning the outsourcing of eap services.the,which outlines three eap price structures,is the first documented evidence regarding simmons outsourcing plan.
four days after the to wilson,simmons sent an email to wilson boss,jim cunningham,seeking his preliminary approval for an eap outsourcing plan.simmons provided cunningham with a comparison of the cost of providing eap services internally versus the cost of using an outside provider he estimated an annual savings of.he further suggested that outsourcing would enhance and strengthen the company eap service offerings.simmons mentioned that kathy frankenberg,canadian pacific vice president for labor relations and human resources,already had approved the proposal.
simmons testified that he began discussing the outsourcing proposal with frankenberg and wilson in february,before the march.he also said that he initiated the plan because he believed the role of the eap was expanding,especially with the addition of the delaware and hudson employees,and he wanted a provider with nationwide presence and availability.simmons admitted,however,that he had never told kirkeberg that he was deficient in his administration of the eap.simmons also acknowledged that at the time of his march,in which he recommended a particular provider,he was unfamiliar with canadian pacific formal process for issuing requests for proposal rfp.
in may,cunningham and frankenberg approved simmons reduction in force request,thereby eliminating kirkeberg position in order to pursue,as stated in the request,a business model which can incorporate resources.on may,simmons informed kirkeberg that his employment had been terminated,although canadian pacific had not yet selected an outside provider for the eap.simmons averred in an affidavit that he chose to notify kirkeberg of the decision at that time because canadian pacific was about to solicit bids from providers,including some with whom kirkeberg had worked,and he wanted to spare kirkeberg from learning about the outsourcing of his position indirectly through one of them.
in the fall of,canadian pacific selected wellplace,a firm that had provided backup services when kirkeberg was unavailable,to be the railway eap provider.simmons testified that wellplace was chosen because of its nationwide reach,hour coverage,and comprehensive service offerings.a contract with wellplace was finalized in early,and,according to simmons,canadian pacific achieved a cost savings of approximately during the first year of outsourcing.
kirkeberg filed a charge of discrimination and retaliation with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc after his termination.the eeoc issued a right to sue letter,and kirkeberg filed a complaint in the district court.he claimed,as relevant here,that canadian pacific discriminated against him because of his vision problems and hepatitis c,and terminated his employment in retaliation for his repeated requests for accommodation.on january,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of canadian pacific on all claims.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to kirkeberg,the nonmoving party.mccullough of for med,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
we first consider kirkeberg disability discrimination claims under the ada.a person is entitled to protection under the ada if he is disabled,and kirkeberg contends that the district court erred in concluding that he did not meet that criterion.the ada defines the term disability to include,among other things,a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of an individual.kirkeberg contends that his seeing,walking,reading,concentrating,thinking,driving,and working are major life activities that are substantially limited.
canadian pacific does not dispute that kirkeberg monocular vision and hepatitis c qualify as physical impairments under the ada.see h.nor does the employer appear to dispute that seeing,walking,reading,concentrating,thinking,driving,and working constitute major life activities under the statute,so we assume for purposes of analysis that these activities qualify.see.the disputed question is whether kirkeberg monocular vision and hepatitis c substantially limit these major life activities.
to establish that his conditions are substantially limiting,kirkeberg must demonstrate that he is s ignificantly restricted as to the condition,manner or duration under which he can perform a particular major life activity,as compared to the average person.j ii.this standard requires kirkeberg to show more than a mere difference between his performance and that of the average individual.albertson,kirkingburg.the ada substantially language suggests a difference that is considerable.toyota motor,williams,internal quotation omitted.the evidence in support of this contention must be more than generic evidence of a medical diagnosis of an impairment.ristrom asbestos workers local joint apprentice,cir internal quotation omitted.individuals with monocular vision or hepatitis are not per se disabled,so a diagnosis,standing alone,does not show how kirkeberg in particular is affected.albertson,at furnish svi,cir.therefore,kirkeberg must present evidence showing the degree to which he personally is limited by his conditions.under the law in effect at the time when kirkeberg claims arose,we must also consider the effects of any mitigating measures,including those undertaken by his body own systems.albertson,at 
with regard to kirkeberg monocular vision,an individualized showing of a substantial limitation is essential because of the differences that exist between people with the condition.in particular,individuals vary by the degree of visual acuity in the weaker eye,the age at which they suffered their vision loss,the extent of their compensating adjustments in visual techniques,and the ultimate scope of the restrictions on their visual abilities.albertson,at.as a result,even though people with monocular vision ordinarily will meet the act definition of disability,the ada still requires monocular individuals,like others claiming the act protection,to prove a disability by offering evidence that the extent of the limitation in terms of their own experience,as in loss of depth perception and visual field,is substantial.id.at internal quotation omitted.
kirkeberg failed to show that any restrictions resulting from his monocular vision substantially limited his major life activities.the medical documents he submitted establish little beyond the fact that he suffered a crvo in january,and that he experienced eye strain as his body adjusted to his condition.the february letter from his physician,for example,explained that kirkeberg had become legally blind in his left eye and was experiencing significant difficulties at work.appellant app.at.but the letter also stated as kirkeberg acclimates to the loss of vision in his left eye,the strain will become less on his right eye,but for now i think it would benefit him significantly to have a shorter work week.id.emphasis added.this final statement suggests that kirkeberg right eye would acclimate to his vision loss,potentially rendering his significant discomfort temporary.to be substantially limiting,an impairment must be of an extended or permanent duration,gretillat care initiatives,cir,but kirkeberg offered no medical evidence developed after february to address the degree to which his body acclimated and whether his difficulties were permanent.nor did he present specific medical evidence concerning his loss of depth perception and visual field.albertson,at.
the only evidence that kirkeberg offered concerning the extent of his body adjustments is found in his deposition testimony and affidavit.kirkeberg statements in these materials indicate that he did compensate for his monocularity to a significant degree,and thereby retained much of his depth perception and visual field.kirkeberg testified that his ability to perform his job at canadian pacific was unaffected by his eye problems.he confirmed that he could read fairly normally despite his vision loss.he also stated that except for a short period in early when his right eye became infected,he had no trouble driving and was permitted to do so day and night without restriction.
any restrictions about which kirkeberg did testify do not contradict this conclusion.when asked during his deposition what he could no longer do as a result of his vision loss,kirkeberg responded 
i can read but it limited.reading with one eye is really tiring.everything i do with one eye is really tiring i try to concentrate on things.it really hard to see.and as time passes like for example if i had to read all day,it going to get blurry i am less able to navigate,especially like on foot.i bump into people.trip over things that are low on that side.especially on that side everything is a little more challenging.
kirkeberg affidavit communicated similar problems,namely that his eye gets tired,he wear s out more easily and can not read for as long as a normal person.
that kirkeberg tires more easily because of his condition and finds it more difficult to navigate on foot does not rise to the level of a substantial limitation.on this record,we think the only reasonable conclusion is that while kirkeberg has not completely compensated for his monocularity,he has adjusted such that he is not substantially limited in any major life activity relative to the average individual.therefore,kirkeberg monocular vision is not a disability under the ada.see dyke steel,cir holding that plaintiff monocular vision,which prevented him only from driving at night,working on roofs,holding his head straight when looking left to right,and participating in various recreational activities,was not substantially limiting eeoc ups,cir holding that individuals with no vision in the right eye and problems with vision in the functional eye were not substantially limited under the ada because both could drive,read,use tools,and play sports,and their impairments did not keep either one of them from using his eyesight as most people do for daily life.
we reach the same conclusion with respect to kirkeberg hepatitis c.according to his medical records,kirkeberg was first told he had the condition s ome time in the early,but he claimed in his deposition that the diagnosis came in when he saw a liver specialist after experiencing problems with nosebleeds.regardless of this discrepancy,kirkeberg provided no evidence that he was substantially limited by this impairment.the letter from his diagnosing physician reported the patient states that he feels well he also has occasional aches and pains in his joints when he works out but it is definitely not disabling in any way.he has a history of mild depression that is well controlled the remainder of his review of systems is negative.kirkeberg offered no testimony to supplement or contradict this letter.in fact,other than briefly referencing nosebleeds in his deposition,he failed to testify about any effects from hepatitis.
only in his affidavit did kirkeberg allege having numerous side effects from hepatitis c including bloody noses,brain fog,fatigue,sleep disturbances,painful joints,and depression,all of which made work more difficult and made reading,thinking,and concentrating harder.these conclusory statements,without more,do not show that he was substantially l
