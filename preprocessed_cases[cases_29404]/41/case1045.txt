kenneth schreiber,mary jane lambert,and george vantine appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to their former employer,philips display components company philips display or pdc,and related corporations collectively defendants or philips,dismissing plaintiffs claims that philips breached its collective bargaining agreement cba with,and violated fiduciary duties owed to,plaintiffs when it refused to provide plaintiffs with retiree health benefits.
plaintiffs raise two arguments on appeal.first,plaintiffs representing hourly employees argue that the district court both misinterpreted the cba and failed to properly consider extrinsic evidence in reaching its decision that the parties did not intend retiree health benefits to vest upon retirement.second,both hourly and salaried plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on plaintiffs breach of fiduciary duty claim because philips never properly amended relevant health plans to exclude plaintiffs.
we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

d.the creation of lg philips displays usa.
in,penac parent company,the kobinklijke philips electronics kpenv,in a transaction with lg electronics lg,formed lg philips displays usa,lgp.as part of the transaction,penac conveyed philips display ottawa facility,along with other assets and liabilities,to lgp,effective july.this conveyance included contract obligations and liabilities.
according to defendants,as a result of kpenv and lg creation of lgp,philips display employees including plaintiffs who worked in ottawa and ann arbor on the effective date of the sale immediately became employees of lgp.final br.of at.lgp continued to operate the ottawa facility,through the ann arbor office,with the same employees,cba,and benefits plans.defendants assert,however,that lgp employees left the health insurance programs s that had applied to them during their employment with philips display,and were advised of that fact in writing both before and after the transaction.id.at.
in all relevant aspects,the new health insurance plans resembled the philips display plans.the plan documents stated that penac sponsored and administered the plan,though warren oates,senior assistant secretary for penac,asserted that philips pace,an unincorporated office within penac,provided administrative services,for a fee,to lgp,and,under a local services agreement,certain penac employees provided services to lgp.oates,at oates supp,at these services included some record keeping,including enrollment forms in connection with retiree medical benefits provided by lgp.see also,grissmore,at w hen we went into the joint venture july,even though we used the same documents,we had our own separate plans.

after lgp took over philips display operations,the crt market collapsed and lgp announced that it would be closing the ottawa facility in preparation for this event,lgp and the ibew created a document entitled implementation of contract ottawa lg philips plant closing the implementation agreement for distribution to relevant union employees and human resources personnel see at.lgp and union representatives signed the implementation agreement,which sought to clarify any ambiguities regarding the date on which employees would need to retire in order to continue to receive pension and healthcare benefits in their retirement.under this agreement,employees retiring after the expiration of the cba,but before the exhaustion of cobra coverage,were determined to be eligible to receive healthcare coverage under the plans.the ottawa plant closed on december.
all plaintiffs submitted retirement applications on or after july,and,at the time of retirement,elected to receive retiree healthcare benefits under one of the plans described above.the retirees submitted these applications on forms with penac headers.see.some of the applications also contained an acknowledgment that the retiree understood that the company necessarily reserves the right to end or amend retiree medical coverage for me or my dependants at any time.see,id.at.
on may,lgp sent plaintiffs and class members letters informing them that lgp would be terminating retiree medical plans.five days later,lgp declared bankruptcy.on may,the company terminated retirees health benefits.
procedural background 
in january,plaintiff retirees schreiber,lambert,and vantine brought suit against philips display,penac,and pace on behalf of themselves and similarly situated retirees.schreiber and lambert purport to represent a class of hourly unionized employees who worked at pdc manufacturing facility in ottawa,ohio.vantine claims to represent salaried,workers pdc employed at its headquarters in ann arbor,michigan.
plaintiff hourly retirees sued under the labor management relations act lmra and the employee retirement income security act erisa,alleging that their cba with philips display required defendants to continue to provide retiree healthcare benefits.as a result,plaintiffs argued,the termination of benefits breached the parties cba.in a separate claim,both hourly and salaried plaintiffs alleged that philips violated its fiduciary duty to plaintiffs by improperly excluding them from the relevant health benefit plans.defendants rebutted these arguments,asserting that the documents referenced by plaintiffs did not provide for vested retiree healthcare benefits,that the decision to transfer retiree health liabilities to lgp did not implicate any fiduciary duties,and that plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.schreiber phillips display components,wl,at,after discovery,both parties filed motions for summary judgment.
the district court denied defendants motion regarding plaintiffs failure to exhaust administrative remedies,holding that any such exhaustion would be futile under the circumstances,but granted summary judgment to defendants on the remaining claims.id.at.the court held the cba unambiguous in its failure to vest retiree healthcare benefits and,therefore,refrained from considering evidence extrinsic to the agreement,including the spds that it regarded as extrinsic.the court also found that because defendants transfer of liabilities for retiree healthcare benefits to lgp was a business decision,plaintiffs later loss of benefits did not implicate philips fiduciary duties under erisa.plaintiffs timely appealed.

hourly plaintiffs lmra and erisa claims 
hourly plaintiffs claim their cba with philips display vested employee health benefits and,accordingly,the subsequent termination of retirees health insurance violated a contract between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce under the lmra.a.thus,the lmra a breach of contract the outcome of the erisa claim because i f the parties intended to vest benefits and the agreement establishing this is breached,there is an erisa violation as well as a lmra violation.maurer,at see also armistead vernitron,cir.
a retiree health insurance plan is a welfare benefit plan under erisa.yolton el paso.pipeline,cir.in contrast to pension benefits,t here is no statutory right to lifetime health benefits.golden,cir therefore,courts often look to collective bargaining agreements between unions and employers to see if the parties agreed to vest health benefits.see,yolton,at boyer douglas components,cir see also sprague general motors,cir to vest benefits is to render them forever unalterable.if the parties vested health benefits,an employer unilateral modification or reduction of those benefits constitutes an lmra violation.yolton,at.
this court has previously held that while the enforcement and interpretation of collective bargaining agreements under is governed by substantive federal law traditional rules for contractual interpretation are applied as long as their application is consistent with federal labor policies.uaw,cir see also yolton,at.in the benefits context,such an interpretation should focus on the intent of the parties,looking to the explicit language of the collective bargaining agreement for clear manifestations of intent and interpreting each provision in question as part of the integrated whole,at.when ambiguities exist,courts may also look to other provisions of the cba and extrinsic evidence for guidance.yolton,at citing,at see also golden,the aim in such cases is to settle on an interpretation which is harmonious with the entire agreement.the cba,however,need not contain an explicit intent to vest,in order for courts to find that rights have vested.maurer,at.

explained that retiree benefits are in a sense status benefits which,as such,carry with them an inference that the parties likely intended those benefits to continue as long as the beneficiary remains a retiree.id.at.with regard to the inference,later decisions of this court have stated that does not create a legal presumption that retiree benefits are vested for life.yolton el paso.pipeline,cir.is instead properly understood as creating such an inference only if the context and other available evidence indicate an intent to vest.noe,at.
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in not considering the plan documents in its analysis.the district court held that reference to the spds would be appropriate only if the cba was ambiguous as to whether retiree health insurance vested.schreiber,wl at citing uaw bvr liquidating,cir see also bvr liquidating,at when a contractual provision is ambiguous,the court may turn to extrinsic evidence to discern the intent of the parties.smith abs,cir considering testimony of it being extrinsic order to resolve the ambiguity in the contract uaw industries,wl cir.june,unpublished disposition that both parties have offered plausible interpretations of the agreement drawn from the contractual language itself demonstrates that the provision is ambiguous.neither of the two proffered interpretations is frivolous nor unreasonable on its face,and inquiry should be permitted into extrinsic circumstances.because the district court concluded that the cba contains express,durational language,unambiguously providing retiree medical insurance for its duration,and not beyond,the court refused to consider the spds,which it regarded as extrinsic,or any other extrinsic evidence.schreiber,wl at.therefore,as an initial matter,we must examine the district court decision that the cba is unambiguous 
the hourly retirees look to the relevant portions of the cba to argue that the document is subject to differing,though reasonable,interpretations.final br.of at.notably,these are the same portions of the agreement on which the district court relied in finding the document unambiguously did not vest retiree health benefits.
first,the retirees point to the cba maintenance and amendment requirements as set forth in schedule c.the requirements explain,inter alia,that t he company will maintain during the remaining terms of this agreement employee group insurance of the following types basic medical insurance,major medical insurance at.plaintiffs assert that the language created a general durational limitation that required the company to maintain the insurance for the period specified,but that it did not address or limit the vesting of those benefits upon retirement.in other words,plaintiffs argue that the clause provides that the insurance benefits must be maintained throughout the life of the cba it does not,however,provide that a worker who retires during the life of the cba will lose those benefits when the cba expires.in contrast,philips interprets the clause as a specific durational limitation on the benefits themselves,even after retirement.final br.of at.
both parties cite gilbert,d.the gilbert court held that the clause in provided that t his insurance program shall continue in effect until termination of the collective bargaining agreement of which this is a part referr ed to the duration of the agreement,as opposed to the duration of the benefits described in that agreement.id.emphasis in original.while we do not know the full context of the gilbert insurance program,other case law explains that a bsent specific durational language referring to retiree benefits themselves,courts have held that the general durational language says nothing about those retiree benefits.yolton,at emphasis added see also cole,at yolton requires that a durational limitation must include a specific mention of retiree benefits in order to apply to such benefits.noe polyone,cir.
the clause at issue here can be understood either to relate to the duration of the listed benefits,or to the agreement itself.see gilbert,d at.nonetheless,like the agreements in yolton and noe,there is no language in the cba that specifically states retiree benefits expire upon the termination of the agreement,and therefore the durational provision alone does not manifest a lack of intent to vest healthcare benefits upon retirement.yolton,at see also noe,at noting that the contract language does not state that retiree benefits expire but,rather,speaks generically of all benefits for all employees.we conclude that the district court erred under our precedent in construing the cba as including a specific durational clause limiting retiree healthcare benefits to the duration of the cba noe,at see also maurer,at holding a reservation of rights clause was effective against vesting because the language clearly included retirees and was distributed to them.
the district court also relied on the medical plans section of the refers to retirees who meet the terms of the existing plan and are,therefore,entitled to purchase health insurance coverage on the same terms and at the same employee contribution levels as in effect for active employees in accepting philips argument that the cba only guaranteed retiree benefits for the duration of the agreement.according to defendants,this language recognized that retirees would not receive any set level of benefits but,instead,would only be entitled to those benefits of active employees at the ottawa facility.final br.of at.plaintiffs,however,argue that this clause was a shorthand way to describe the varying rates of contribution available to retirees.final br.of at.
the medical plans section is not a model of clarity with regard to whether retiree health benefits vest.while the court could interpret the language only to provide benefits available to active employees at any moment in time,this is not the most obvious interpretation,and the provision does not provide a clear manifestation of intent that the benefits should or should not vest,at.analyzing a similar provision,this court held that t he language will provide insurance benefits equal to the active group could reasonably be construed,if read in isolation,as either solely a reference to the nature of retiree benefits or as an incorporation of some durational limitation as well.id.at.because schedule c is silent regarding retiree benefits and the medical plans section is ambiguous,the district court erred in concluding that the cba unambiguously states that philips only agreed to provide retirees basic and major medical insurance for the duration of the cba.schreiber,wl at.
philips also argues that a prior arbitration opinion collaterally estops plaintiffs from asserting that the cba is ambiguous on the relevant issue.in an arbitration proceeding between the ibew and philips display,the arbitrator held that philips had no obligation to provide life insurance benefits to retirees who retired after the expiration of the cba.according to philips,plaintiffs claims here amount to a collateral attack on the arbitrator decision.hitchens county of montgomery,cir unpublished disposition d ecisions against a union can bind members in a subsequent action.
