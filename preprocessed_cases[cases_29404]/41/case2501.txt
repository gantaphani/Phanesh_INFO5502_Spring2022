jared dillon,a former employee of mountain coal company,won a jury verdict against mountain coal and its parent companies collectively,mountain coal on his claims of discrimination under the americans with disabilities act of ada,et.thereafter,the district court granted mountain coal motion for judgment as a matter of law,concluding that dillon had not put forth sufficient evidence to show that mountain coal regarded him as disabled.dillon appeals.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
background 
in march,mountain coal hired dillon as an underground maintenance mechanic,or lube man,at west elk mine.dillon testified that his responsibilities included keep ing the essential fluids,hydraulic,gear oil and so forth,at an operable level on the machinery greasing,washing,and maybe replacing a few minor bits here and there.the official job requirements included being able to lift fifty to sixty pounds and being able to swing a sledgehammer.
on april,dillon injured his neck and back when the cover on a mining machine fell and struck him.he returned to work on his next scheduled workday,april,but told his supervisor,bob turner,that he was in a lot of pain.turner assigned dillon to less physically demanding tasks,such as refueling and servicing trucks.dillon saw a doctor on april and again on may,and the doctor restricted dillon work activities to lifting no more than fifteen pounds.the doctor also referred dillon to a second doctor,who restricted dillon from doing any work for one week,and then released him to work without restrictions.
the second day after he had returned to work,on june,dillon told supervisor steve that he was in a lot of pain and that his inability to work at his usual speed might endanger himself and others.told dillon to go home,and he did.after that day,dillon did not return to work at west elk mine.that fall,robert fox determined that dillon was able to move well and that he had reached maximum medical improvement.on january,fox gave dillon permanent lifting restrictions of no more than fifty pounds maximum and pounds occasionally.
dillon testified that he twice called human resources manager edgar langrand to ask when he could return to work.langrand responded that dillon could return to work only if and when he had no restrictions.on january,langrand sent dillon a letter,informing him that according to fox reports and recommended lifting restrictions,dillon was unable to work.the letter also stated that dillon disability period had expired and that because he was unable to return to work,he was being fired.
eventually,dillon and three filed suit against mountain coal,asserting claims as well as discrimination under the ada.after mountain coal filed a motion for summary judgment,the district court dismissed two plaintiffs and limited dillon and michael clawson to their claims under the ada.at the close of the plaintiffs case,mountain coal orally moved for judgment as a matter of law under.a,based primarily on its argument that the plaintiffs failed to prove that mountain coal regarded them as disabled.see c.the court reserved ruling on the motion,and at the close of all evidence mountain coal renewed the motion without further argument.the district court reserved ruling on the motion until after the jury had rendered a verdict.the jury found for both plaintiffs.mountain coal then renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule and filed a detailed brief in support of the motion.the district court granted the motion as to dillon,but denied the motion as to clawson.clawson mountain coal,wl,at,
dillon appeals,asserting three points of error.of primary importance,he contends that the district court erred in holding that there was insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that mountain coal regarded dillon as disabled.he further argues that mountain coal motion for judgment as a matter of law was legally insufficient because it did not identify the specific evidence that he had failed to present.finally,dillon asserts that the district court abused its discretion in excluding certain testimony.

claims under the ada 
the ada prohibits employment discrimination against individuals with disabilities.a as defined by the ada,a disability is a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities b a record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment id.a c.where,as in this case,the plaintiff contends that his employer regarded him as disabled,he must show that he has an impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities but is treated by a covered entity as constituting such limitation.l see also jones united parcel,cir in a suit,a plaintiff must show that an employer has mistaken beliefs about the plaintiff abilities the employer must believe either that one has a substantially limiting impairment that one does not have or that one has a substantially limiting impairment when,in fact,the impairment is not so limiting.quoting sutton united air lines,d.
working is a major life activity.i eeoc heartway,cir.to prevail on a claim that his employer regarded him as substantially limited in the major life activity of working,a plaintiff must demonstrate that his employer regarded him as significantly restricted in performing either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.see heartway,at holding that there must be sufficient evidence that the employer subjectively believed the employee to be significantly restricted as to a class of jobs or broad range of jobs in various classes.the eeoc regulations define a class of jobs as t he job from which the individual has been disqualified because of an impairment,and the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training,knowledge,skills or abilities,within that geographical area,from which the individual is also disqualified because of the impairment.j ii b.a broad range of jobs is defined as t he job from which the individual has been disqualified because of an impairment,and the number and types of other jobs not utilizing similar training,knowledge,skills or abilities,within that geographical area,from which the individual is also disqualified because of the impairment.id.j ii c.
we therefore evaluate a regarded as claim under the ada using a inquiry.first,we must determine whether the employer regarded the employee as significantly restricted in performing his specific job because of an impairment.see heartway,at.next,we determine whether the employer subjectively believed that the employee was significantly restricted in performing either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.id.at.because this type of claim rests heavily on the employer subjective state of mind,we have explained that it is difficult to prove 
proving that an employee is regarded as disabled in the major life activity of working takes a plaintiff to the farthest reaches of the ada.it is a question embedded almost entirely in the employer subjective state of mind.thus,proving the case becomes extraordinarily difficult.not only must a plaintiff demonstrate that an employer thought he was disabled,he must also show that the employer thought that his disability would prevent him from performing a broad class of jobs.as it is safe to assume employers do not regularly consider the panoply of other jobs their employees could perform,and certainly do not often create direct evidence of such considerations,the plaintiff task becomes even more difficult.

sufficiency of the evidence 
we review de novo the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law to mountain coal.see johnsen indep.sch.dist,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate when a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.a.the decisive question is whether the plaintiff has arguably proven a legally sufficient claim.turnbull topeka state,cir.
