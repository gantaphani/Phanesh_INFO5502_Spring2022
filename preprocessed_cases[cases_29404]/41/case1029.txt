jimmy ealy appeals from the district court order affirming the decision of the commissioner of social security denying ealy claim for disability insurance benefits under i,d.we reverse the judgment of the district court with instructions to remand the case to determine whether jobs exist consistent with ealy mental limitations.
background 
factual.medical 
in january,ealy claimed disability for the period beginning december,based on seizures,heart trouble,sleep apnea,restless leg syndrome,trouble with memory,high blood pressure,and gout.ealy had worked as a spray line operator and coiler when he had a stroke in october.at.he returned to work with restrictions that he not climb,operate equipment,or be around heavy equipment.also,before december,ealy was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome and was prescribed medication for swelling in his right ankle.
on december,ealy went to the hospital complaining of loss of consciousness.while in the hospital,he had episodes of slurred speech and spells during which he stared blankly and was unable to speak.at.he was transferred to a different hospital to receive a higher level of care,eventually diagnosed with seizure and focal motor seizure,and given antiepileptic medication.at.the discharge notes on the doctor report stated that ealy was not to work or drive for a month,at which point he could be reevaluated.at.
ealy sought treatment from gregory wheatley,a neurologist,from january through august of.ealy was instructed in january not to drive for six months,not to swim or climb ladders,and to remain off work because of the type of work that he has described and the need to investigate other options.at.by february,wheatley noted that ealy relates no definite episodes of any alterations in awareness at.wheatley also noted that ealy will need to remain on anticonvulsants for the indefinite future.the main concern presently is the choice of anticonvulsants.id.wheatley saw ealy again in march and noted that ealy had not had recurrent seizures.about ealy job,wheatley wrote,h e has not been able to return to work as he does do a heavy,potentially hazardous job.he will be under restriction from this for six months from his last seizure.at.when ealy saw wheatley in may,the doctor noted that ealy relates no convulsive events since i last saw him but he has had some brief episodes in which he believes he may have some brief alteration in his awareness,or some symptoms suggestive of partial seizure.wheatley increased ealy dosage of trileptal and noted,i am not sure if these lesser symptoms are related to any brief partial seizure activity or not.he seems to have done fairly well otherwise.he does have the residual deficits from his remote left hemorrhage.he remains off work and i think that he is going to likely be chronically disabled from employment.at.ealy followed up with wheatley in august.ealy reported and his wife confirmed that he had not had any seizures.at.wheatley wrote that ealy has remained stable from a neurologic standpoint.he is tolerating the trileptal and his seizure control is good.at.wheatley concluded that he did not need any other studies,that ealy would follow up with another doctor locally,and that he would be happy to see ealy if any future seizure problems arose.
meanwhile,in february and may of,ealy had visited his treating physician,rhonda sivley,complaining of among other things shortness of breath.sivley suspected deconditioning and noted in february that the plan was for ealy to increase his exercise and lose weight.at.in may,sivley noted the need for ealy to exercise and lose weight,and also noted that he might benefit from a pulmonary function test.at.in may,ealy underwent a cardiolite stress test that yielded borderline results with a very minimally reversible apical defect which may have represented a very small region of ischemia but the myocardium at risk would be felt to be quite small.at.ealy exhibited normal ventricular function and showed a m ild exercise intolerance for the patient age,sex,and physical condition.at.
sivley referred ealy to barry michelson for evaluation of ealy chest pain and shortness of breath.at.in may,michelson recommended that ealy undergo a cardiac catheterization in order to obtain a definitive diagnosis.at.in june,ealy underwent a heart catheterization and stent placement.at.michelson noted coronary disease and successful deployment of stent.at.upon ealy june discharge,michelson indicated that he could return to work on june,but that he should not lift greater than ten pounds for a period.at.
in july,ealy followed up with michelson for his coronary artery disease.according to michelson notes,ealy did not have chest pain,but he did have breathing problems with activity.at.michelson also noted that ealy does complain of smothering,but is morbidly obese.id.michelson reviewed with ealy the importance of regular exercise and weight reduction and planned a visit in six months.
during his february visit to michelson,ealy reported increasing shortness of breath with activity and a hot sensation in his upper chest and face.at.ealy again underwent a stress test,and in march,michelson conducted a left heart catheterization.michelson noted small vessel disease distal posterior descending artery left dominant system,but normal left ventricular function,and concluded b ecause of the small vessel size,medical management has been recommended.we will add a beta blocker to his therapeutic regimen.at.ealy was again instructed to avoid lifting more than ten pounds for a period.
ealy followed up with michelson in april.although ealy did not have chest pain,he did complain of smothering.at.michelson noted that ealy left ventricular function is normal by catheterization.i do not feel that this is the etiology of his shortness of breath.i have therefore recommended,given his smoking history,that pulmonary function tests be performed.at.in the recommendations portion of his report,michelson wrote that he did discuss with ealy the importance of weight reduction.i believe that this and regular exercise may help his dyspnea shortness of breath as well.at.
in a may pulmonary function study,ealy showed a moderate lung restriction.at.in his may medical appointment,ealy complained of shortness of breath.the advanced registered nurse practitioner who treated ealy assessed hypertension,sleep apnea,and seizure disorder,and recommended additional labs,including bloodwork,but did not indicate that ealy had any physical or restrictions.at.
in march,stacy justice,a medical consultant for the state agency,reviewed the available medical evidence and completed a residual functional capacity rfc assessment.justice concluded that ealy had no exertional limitations,but he could not drive or operate dangerous machinery,or climb ladders,ropes,or scaffolds.at.this rfc was completed before ealy underwent his first stress test and catheterization.in september,carlos hernandez,also a state agency medical consultant,reviewed the available medical evidence and affirmed justice prior rfc.hernandez noted,n ew medical evidence of record does not appear to change initial rfc dated.at.in the time period between the dates of the justice rfc and the hernandez rfc,wheatley had seen ealy two additional times and michelson had performed the first heart catheterization and stent insertion.
the state agency referred ealy to a psychologist,jeanne bennett,who performed a consultative examination on march.bennett observed that ealy attention and concentration were intact,his thoughts were organized in a logical and manner,and his thought content was appropriate to mood and circumstances.bennett characterized ealy recall for recent events as spotty and found his global intellectual functioning to be in the borderline range.bennett noted that ealy avoided eye contact and had a depressed affect.ealy stated that he had a little depression,and bennett wrote that h e appeared very depressed to the examiner as tears roll silently down his cheeks during the assessment.at.relating to stress,bennett wrote,w hen asked about stressors,he replied that he was stressed by his illness.he has also been experiencing grief and loss,even though his son has been deceased for five years.he has coped with stress by taking walks and watching birds.at 
bennett diagnoses were rule out vascular dementia and major depressive disorder,single episode,moderate to severe.id.bennett gave ealy a global assessment function gaf score of,indicating severe symptoms.under functional capacities,bennett concluded that ealy ability to understand,remember,and carry out instructions towards performance of simple repetitive tasks was not affected by his impairments,ealy ability to tolerate stress and pressure of employment was markedly limited,ealy ability to sustain attention and concentration for simple repetitive tasks was moderately limited,and ealy ability to respond appropriately to supervisors,coworkers,and work pressures in a work setting was moderately limited.bennett characterized ealy prognosis for improvement as good with mental health intervention.in the absence of treatment,the prognosis is guarded.
on march,a state agency psychological consultant,stephen scher,reviewed the available medical record,including bennett examination,and completed a psychiatric review technique form and a mental residual functional capacity mental rfc form.scher criticized bennett assessment as involving inconsistent interpretation of evidence.at.scher noted that claimant allegations are credible but not to marked degree of severity for mental.id.scher concluded that ealy retained the mental ability to understand and remember simple instructions,sustain attention to complete simple repetitive tasks for segments over an day where speed was not critical,tolerate coworkers and supervisors in a setting,and adapt to routine changes in a simple work setting.
on july,a second state agency psychological consultant,edward stodola,reviewed the available medical evidence and affirmed scher psychiatric review technique form and mental rfc assessment.at.
the state agency denied ealy claim in october and denied his request to reconsider the same month.
administrative hearing 
the administrative law judge alj held a hearing on june,at which ealy and a vocational expert testified.
ealy testified that he had problems with seizures,heart trouble,high blood pressure,gout,heel spurs,breathing trouble,restless leg syndrome,and sleep apnea.he testified that his seizures occur three to four times per week and that he had had one that morning.ealy mentioned that he had stents put into his heart in december and said that he continues to smother,have chest pain,and have shortness of breath with some regularity.ealy testified that he could stand only two or three minutes before he needed to sit or lie down.he testified that he takes numerous medications for his medical problems,and often lays down because his medicine makes him tired or dizzy.he stated that he does not drive.ealy also testified that he had problems with learning,reading,and spelling.
ealy mentioned that his doctor encouraged him to exercise and that he could walk the to feet to his house.regarding his daily activities,ealy testified that he could dress and groom himself,fold clothes,wash dishes,and fix cereal or an apple to eat.he stated that he spent his time at home lying on a lounge chair and that he accompanied his wife to the store and to church.
after ealy testified,the alj described the following hypothetical to the vocational expert 
please assume,first,someone of ealy age,education,and work experience.and assume this person is limited to simple,repetitive tasks and instructions in work settings,where,based on seizure disorder,they would be precluded from exposure to heights,hazards,climbing,operating dangerous or moving machinery,and driving.also,based upon cardiopulmonary limitations or impairments,assume they should be restricted from exposures to concentrated dust,smoke,fumes,temperature and humidity extremes and the like.
at.the vocational expert testified that manufacturing jobs could accommodate the restrictions,including hand assemblers,jobs,jobs,and related production workers however,the expert agreed with the alj that,if the person is intolerant of routine work setting type stress such that they would not be able to work on an,basis,or maintain a similar sustained schedule,that the person could not do any of those jobs.at.
alj decision 
on september,the alj issued its decision concluding that ealy was not disabled.the alj followed the sequential analysis explained in.the alj found that ealy seizure disorder,history of stroke,sleep apnea,hypertension,obesity,and depression were severe impairments,and that they precluded him from returning to his past occupations.at.the alj further concluded,however,that ealy was capable of performing other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy,and thus he was not disabled for purposes of the social security act.at.
in reaching its decision,the alj determined that ealy testimony concerning the intensity,persistence,and limiting effects of the symptoms of his medical impairments were not entirely credible.at.in particular,the alj found ealy claim of seizure activity times a week to be not entirely credible because the records of ealy treating physician wheatley did not indicate any recent seizure activity.at.concerning ealy mental capacity,the alj agreed with scher in rejecting bennett finding that ealy would have marked limitation in tolerating everyday work stress.the alj explained that bennett conclusion was neither supported by her own materials nor the record as a whole and noted that ealy had not received any mental health treatment nor complained of psychological symptoms while pursuing any other form of medical care.at.the alj also observed that ealy demonstrated no abnormal social behaviors during the hearing and was able to understand and follow the proceedings and all lines of questioning.at.however,the alj noted that ealy has moderate difficulties with regard to concentration,persistence,or pace.at.
the alj found that ealy has the residual functional capacity to perform a full range of work at all exertional levels but with the following limitations no heights,hazards,climbing,operating dangerous or moving machinery,driving,and no exposure to dust,smoke,fumes or extremes.he is limited to simple,repetitive type jobs in a work setting.at.recognizing that ealy limitations compromised his ability to work at all exertional levels,the alj relied on the testimony of the vocational expert that there are significant number of jobs in the national economy for someone of ealy age,education,work experience,and residual functional capacity.at.
the appeals council denied ealy request for review of the alj decision on may.
district court proceedings 
in july,ealy filed a civil action to review the commissioner decision.ealy moved for summary judgment,arguing that the alj had incorrectly relied on the physical assessments of justice and hernandez even though justice and hernandez were not aware of later treatment records reflecting ealy heart catheterization,diagnosis of small vessel disease,and episodes of respiratory distress.ealy also argued that the alj hypothetical was flawed because it omitted bennett findings about ealy limitations concerning the stress of daily employment and the ability to respond appropriately to supervisors and in a work setting,and scher account of ealy limitations as identified in the section i summary conclusions portion of the mental rfc assessment.the commissioner moved for summary judgment.
concluding that the alj took into account all credible information and issued a decision supported by substantial evidence,the district court granted the commissioner motion and entered judgment affirming the agency decision.the district court took issue with the premise of ealy physical assessment argument,explaining that the alj did not adopt the assessment,but instead found ealy to have more restrictions than they did.the district court noted that the alj considered evidence of ealy heart procedures,shortness of breath,and chest pain,and in response it unilaterally added additional restrictions to ealy list of work limitations concerning temperature and airborne contaminants.
the district court also noted that ealy medical records after his heart catheterization did not necessarily contradict hernandez assessment.ealy treating physician,and the surgeon who performed ealy catheterization,michelson,recommended that ealy return to work less than a week after the catheterization and only restricted ealy from lifting more than ten pounds during the week following the procedure.dist.at.when ealy later complained of shortness of breath,michelson indicated that he did not think that ealy heart function was the cause and discussed with ealy the importance of weight reduction and exercise.id.michelson did not recommend any physical limitations for ealy,workplace or otherwise.
regarding ealy argument concerning his mental limitations,the district court concluded that the alj properly discounted bennett assessment because bennett finding that ealy had a marked limitation in tolerating the stress and pressure of employment was not supported by the small portion of her interview with ealy that addressed stress.dist.at.the district court also found that bennett own examination notes and observations did not support her conclusion that ealy would have difficulty responding appropriately to supervisors or in a work setting.id.at.
finally,the district court rejected ealy argument that the alj was obligated to incorporate scher summary conclusions into the hypothetical question to the vocational expert.the district court noted that the form that scher completed required him to explain his summary conclusions in the portion of the form entitled functional capacity assessment and that scher had done just that.dist.at.the district court further concluded that the alj hypothetical question fairly incorporated scher functional capacity assessment.dist.at.
ii.analysis 
legal standards 
we review district court decisions in social security cases de novo.see jordan comm r of soc,cir.however,our review is limited to determining whether the commissioner decision is supported by substantial evidence and was made pursuant to proper legal standards.rogers comm r of soc,cir.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.lindsley comm r of soc,cir quoting richardson perales,d.if the commissioner decision is based upon substantial evidence,we must affirm,even if substantial evidence exists in the record supporting a different conclusion.id.at.
a social security disability determination is made according to the analysis set out in 
first,ealy must demonstrate that he is not currently engaged in substantial gainful employment at the time of the disability application.b.second,ealy must show that he suffers from a severe impairment.c.third,if ealy is not engaged in substantial gainful employment and has a severe impairment which is expected to last for at least twelve months,which meets or equals a listed impairment,he will be considered disabled without regard to age,education,and work experience.d.fourth,if the commissioner can not make a determination of disability based on medical evaluations and current work activity and ealy has a severe impairment,the commissioner will then review ealy residual functional capacity rfc and relevant past work to determine if he can do past work if so,he is not disabled.e.
howard comm r of soc,cir.if ealy impairment prevents him from doing past work,the analysis proceeds to the fifth step the commissioner will consider his rfc,age,education and past work experience to determine if he can perform other work.if he can not perform other work,the commissioner will find him disabled.f.id.
for the fifth step,the burden of proof shifts to the commissioner.see mcclanahan comm r of soc,cir.to meet this burden,
the commissioner must make a finding supported by substantial evidence that ealy has the vocational qualifications to perform specific jobs.varley sec y of health human,cir.this kind of s ubstantial evidence may be produced through reliance on the testimony of a vocational expert ve in response to a hypothetical question,but only if the question accurately portrays ealy individual physical and mental impairments.id.citations omitted.
application 
on appeal,ealy argues that the alj decision was not supported by substantial evidence and does not comply with applicable procedural requirements.first,ealy argues that the alj improperly relied on the residual functional capacity assessments of justice and hernandez even though justice and hernandez were not aware of a later treatment records reflecting ealy heart catheterization,diagnosis of small vessel disease,and episodes of respiratory distress,or b wheatley may statement about ealy disability status.second,ealy contends that the alj did not specifically discuss several notations from wheatley concerning ealy residual deficits from his stroke or wheatley statement.third,ealy argues that the alj erred in determining ealy mental residual functional capacity by rejecting the opinion of bennett,the only mental health source to have examined ealy,and by failing to include scher and stodola accounts of ealy limitations as identified in the section i summary conclusions portion of the mental rfc assessment.
ealy arguments concerning wheatley may statement and the alj failure to discuss certain specific evidence were raised for the first time on appeal.the district court did not have an opportunity to pass on these arguments,and we will not address them.see young sec y of health human,cir a social security disability claimant can not raise an issue before the court of appeals that was not raised before the district court see also kidd comm r of soc,cir unpublished apparent that claimant had a fair opportunity to pursue her argument in the district court where court reasoning echoed that relied upon by the alj.
turning to the arguments that ealy did raise in the district court,we first address the complaint that it was improper for the alj to rely on the rfc assessments of justice and hernandez because they were unaware of ealy shortness of breath,small vessel disease,and heart catheterizations.as a preliminary matter,it appears that the premise of ealy argument is flawed.hernandez september rfc was completed after ealy had undergone his first catheterization june.it appears from the record that hernandez did have these additional medical records before him and thus would have been aware of ealy complaints of shortness of breath,small vessel disease issues,and the resulting first heart catheterization and stenting.
even if hernandez rfc was completed without knowledge of these issues,however,the record reflects that the alj considered them.in its opinion,the alj specifically noted ealy june heart catheterization and stenting and his march heart catheterization.at.the alj also noted ealy small vessel disease and his reports of chest pain and dyspnea or shortness of breath.id.specifically to address these issues,the alj added to the work limitations recommended by hernandez rfc,including restricting ealy exposure to concentrated dust,smoke,fumes,and temperature and humidity extremes.at.further,there is no indication that these additional restrictions reflected insufficient consideration of ealy catheterizations,small vessel disease,and shortness of breath concerns.the physicians who treated ealy for these things never recommended any ongoing significant restrictions.after ealy catheterizations,ealy only restriction was not to lift more than ten pounds within a week he was to return to work within a few days of the procedure.the record contains no restrictions related to the results of ealy later pulmonary function study.
we next address ealy arguments concerning his mental residual functional capacity.first,ealy argues that the alj was incorrect in rejecting bennett opinion as bennett was the only mental health source to have examined ealy.ealy is correct that the alj concurred with scher in rejecting bennett interpretation of the record evidence.in order to determine whether the alj acted properly in disagreeing with a medical source,we must first determine the
