at the time of milholland diagnosis,benny bills was working as the principal of gallatin high school,and milholland husband was a teacher at that school.milholland husband generally discussed milholland health problems with bills,but milholland husband never told bills about milholland specific diagnosis.bills continued to inquire about milholland health at social occasions.bills later became the director of schools for sumner county.
in may,milholland became one of the two assistant principals at knox doss middle school.her principal,mike brown,was aware of her medical condition.milholland had a difficult working relationship with the other assistant principal,rufus lowe.milholland told brown that lowe did not carry his share of the workload.
on march,milholland met with bills to discuss the issues at the school.milholland complained about lowe performance and noted that it was increasing her own workload.bills brought up milholland own performance,and milholland claims that bills said something to the effect of do you think it would be easier on your health if you would just go back to the classroom milholland.bills admitted that he discussed milholland return to teaching,but stated that his comment was not related to milholland health.rather he was only discussing the fact that administrative positions involved more work and stress than teaching positions.after the meeting,milholland sent bills a letter stating that she simply wanted bills to be aware that she strongly felt that she was plenty healthy enough to continue as an administrator,because bills had brought up that question about going back to the classroom.milholland.the letter stated that her illness,thanks to a tremendous rheumatologist and new medications,is well under control.milholland.milholland asked to stay in an administrative position.
in early,brown and bills met to discuss the situation at knox doss middle school and milholland and lowe working relationship.although both brown and bills had greater problems with lowe performance than with milholland,they noted that teachers did not have that working relationship of respect with milholland because there was always fraction,discord between her and lowe.bills.brown and bills decided to solve the problem by transferring both milholland and lowe from the school brown and bills believed that transferring both employees would create a clean slate with faculty,with parents,and with students.bills.brown filled out a request to transfer milholland after the decision was made.
in april,milholland requested to be transferred to one of two positions principal at wessington place elementary school or materials center supervisor at the board central office.brown recommended transfer to the principal position.bills could have approved the transfer without interviewing milholland or offering the position to other applicants,but he chose not to do so.milholland interviewed for the position,but was not chosen.instead,bills transferred milholland to a teaching position at station camp high school.bills told her she was being transferred because she was not getting the job done as vice principal.milholland.
after learning of her transfer,milholland and her husband set up meetings with bills.the first meeting was between bills and milholland husband.milholland husband alleged that,during the meeting,bills told him the transfer was because milholland had missed too many days of work,but that bills did not specifically refer to milholland health.the second meeting included all three individuals,after milholland retained counsel.milholland unsuccessfully attempted to record the conversation on a hidden audio device.milholland alleges that,during the meeting,her husband asked bills if he discussed milholland health during the march,meeting and that bills confirmed that he did.
