plaintiffs mischelle and michael musser,parents of the deceased maverick musser,appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant,gentiva health services,in this medical malpractice case.because the expert medical testimony proffered by the mussers in response to the motion for summary judgment was properly excluded as a sanction under federal rule of civil procedure c,and because under indiana law a prima facie case in medical malpractice can not be established without expert medical testimony,we affirm.
maverick musser was born prematurely on january,at a gestational age of approximately weeks.maverick premature birth led to serious health problems.he suffered from a condition known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia,a chronic lung disease commonly associated with premature birth.tragically,maverick spent his entire life either hospitalized or under hour nursing care at his home.maverick died on august.
along with constant nursing attention,maverick family relied upon various medical devices to sustain his life.maverick was dependent on a type of ventilator called a cpap,which provided continuous positive airway pressure to maverick lungs.the cpap machine was connected to maverick by plastic air hosing attached to a tracheotomy tube,a plastic tube inserted through an opening in the neck that provides a superior airway to the lungs.the tracheotomy tube was secured by velcro ties placed around his neck that prevented decannulation,the accidental removal of the tube.
in addition,three pulse oximeter,an apnea monitor,and a low pressure alarm attached to the cpap used to measure maverick pulse rate and breathing.the pulse oximeter measured oxygen saturation and heart rate if the measurements fell below or exceeded set parameters,an alarm audible throughout the first level of the musser home would sound.the low pressure alarm monitored air pressure in the cpap circuit if pressure outside the parameters occurred or if maverick decannulated,an alarm audible throughout the house would sound.the apnea monitor measured maverick heart rate,respiration rate,and the size and depth of the breaths he took an alarm audible throughout the house would sound if his vital signs fell below or exceeded the proper parameters.
the present appeal arises out of a medical malpractice action brought under indiana law against the nursing service,gentiva,that provided care for maverick maverick mother,mischelle musser,a registered nurse,provided some care to maverick,but gentiva provided most of the nursing service.three gentiva employees monitored maverick on alternating shifts registered nurses jodi inskeep and johanna marshall,and licensed practical nurse dawn kinzer.
on the evening of august,kinzer began her shift at deposition testimony favorable to the mussers establishes that kinzer appeared to be ill and was taking medication,leading to the inference that she was not as alert as she might have been in monitoring maverick.furthermore,kinzer testified at her deposition that maverick physical condition was good when she arrived for her shift.
kinzer did not have the apnea monitor attached to maverick during her shift.she did not observe any movement from maverick for more than five minutes before realizing that there was a problem.at approximately,kinzer recognized that maverick was in distress.kinzer asserts that the pulse oximeter alerted her to this fact,but the mussers stated in their depositions that they did not hear an alarm sound.the pulse oximeter registered zero and showed no pulse.kinzer assessed maverick,and recognized that he had decannulated.kinzer called for help from mischelle musser after calling for help,kinzer unsuccessfully attempted to reinsert the tracheotomy tube that had fallen out.mischelle successfully inserted a different emergency tracheotomy tube.both women performed cpr on maverick,but mischelle testified at her deposition that she corrected kinzer technique.mischelle could not immediately find a needle to inject maverick with epinephrine.emergency personnel arrived and took maverick to the hospital,where he was pronounced dead.
the mussers filed their malpractice complaint against gentiva in the northern district of indiana on february,properly invoking diversity jurisdiction.in due course,as the case was pending,depositions of the witnesses previously disclosed by the mussers were none of those witnesses had been identified as experts.during a hearing on april,deadlines were established for the parties to make their expert disclosures.the deadline for the mussers was set at june.despite this deadline,the mussers did not disclose or identify any witness as an expert nor did they ever exchange or file expert reports.
gentiva moved for summary judgment on october,arguing that the mussers could not present any competent evidence on breach of duty.the mussers,in response on november,presented the deposition testimony of nurses mischelle musser,dawn kinzer,jodi inskeep,johanna marshall,and barbara cromer gentiva highest ranking employee in the fort wayne branch,as well as the deposition testimony of william smits,maverick treating doctor,harvey bieler,a doctor who had treated maverick during a stay at the hospital,and kevin hinton an apria healthcare employee.the mussers assert that,in the aggregate,the fact and opinion testimony expressed by these witnesses raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether kinzer breached her duty of care through inattention to maverick prior to his death and incompetence in attempting to revive him.
countering the mussers response,gentiva sought to strike the expert testimony of those witnesses.gentiva pointed out that the mussers had not identified as medical experts any of the witnesses previously deposed.the district court agreed,granted the motion to strike,and upon the mussers inability to show breach of duty,entered summary judgment in favor of gentiva.
ii.analysis 
federal courts sitting in diversity cases such as this apply the federal rules of civil procedure in procedural matters and the state substantive law that applies to the cause of action.hayes equitable energy res,cir.therefore,the first step here is to assess whether,under the federal rules of civil procedure,the district court properly excluded the expert testimony of witnesses proffered by the mussers.only then can we analyze how,under indiana law,the lack of expert medical testimony affects the mussers claims.
a.the exclusion of expert testimony 
for failure to disclose any of their witnesses as experts,the district court sanctioned the mussers by disallowing any expert testimony to counter the motion for summary judgment.we review a trial court discovery determinations,including the decision to exclude expert testimony,under an abuse of discretion standard.miksis howard,cir.a court does not abuse its discretion unless the record contains no evidence upon which the court could have rationally based its decision the decision is based on an erroneous conclusion of law the decision is based on clearly erroneous factual findings or the decision clearly appears arbitrary.sherrod lingle,cir quotations omitted.
our first inquiry will be to assess the district court application of rule regarding expert witnesses.the district court must apply the correct legal standards and not reach an erroneous conclusion of law in forming the basis for the sanction of exclusion.salgado general motors,cir a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.quoting cooter gell hartmarx,d.if the district court incorrectly found a violation of the rules by the mussers,then excluding the evidence would necessarily be an abuse of discretion.
the other three inquiries under the abuse of discretion standard are guided by federal rule of civil procedure c,the rule relied upon by the district court in excluding the expert testimony.this rule states in pertinent part 
a party that without substantial justification fails to disclose information required by rule a is not,unless such failure is harmless,permitted to use as evidence at a trial,at a hearing,or on a motion any witness or information not so disclosed.in addition to or in lieu of this sanction,the court,on motion and after affording an opportunity to be heard,may impose other appropriate sanctions.
c emphasis added.thus,the text of rule c guides our inquiry into whether the exclusion decision lacked evidence in the record,was based on clearly erroneous factual findings,or was arbitrary.the rule asks whether the sanctioned party had substantial justification for the failure to comply with discovery rules and whether the failure to comply is harmless.c see sherrod,at.therefore,we examine the rationale offered by the district court for exercising its discretion to exclude the mussers expert testimony and substituting our own judgment for that of the district there is a reasonable basis for the finding that the mussers failure to disclose experts lacked substantial justification and was not harmless to gentiva.
in reviewing an exclusion sanction,we shall affirm the judgment of the district court whenever we believe that the district court chose an option that was among those from which we might expect a district court reasonably to choose.salgado,at.furthermore,in a case such as this where exclusion necessarily entails dismissal of the case,the sanction must be one that a reasonable jurist,apprised of all the circumstances,would have chosen as proportionate to the infraction.sherrod,at quotations omitted.as an appellate court,our review of the record is deferential,but where no harm can be found to the party,we will reverse.id.at.
expert disclosure under federal rule of civil procedure 
the federal rules of civil procedure divide potential witnesses into three categories for the purposes of disclosure.the first group,fact witnesses,must be disclosed by sending to the opposing party the name,address,and phone number if known of each potential witness.a a.this includes anyone likely to have discoverable information that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses,unless solely for impeachment,and the disclosure should identify the subjects of the information.id.
the second and third groups,both consisting of witnesses providing expert testimony,are differentiated by the following rule 
disclosure of expert testimony 
a in addition to the disclosures required regarding fact witnesses,a party shall disclose to other parties the identity of any person who may be used at trial to present evidence under rules,or of the federal rules of evidence.
b except as otherwise stipulated or directed by the court,this disclosure shall,with respect to a witness who is retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or whose duties as an employee of the party regularly involve giving expert testimony,be accompanied by a written report prepared and signed by the witness.the report shall contain a complete statement of all opinions to be expressed and the basis and reasons therefor the data or other information considered by the witness in forming the opinions any exhibits to be used as a summary of or support for the opinions the qualifications of the witness,including a list of all publications authored by the witness within the preceding ten years the compensation to be paid for the study and testimony and a listing of any other cases in which the witness has testified as an expert at trial or by deposition within the preceding four years.
c these disclosures shall be made at the times and in the sequence directed by the court 
a emphasis added.thus,all witnesses who are to give expert testimony under the federal rules of evidence must be disclosed under rule a a only those witnesses retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony must submit an expert report complying with rule a b.the commentary to rule supports this textual distinction between retained experts and witnesses providing expert testimony because of their involvement in the facts of the case a treating physician,for example,can be deposed or called to testify at trial without any requirement for a written report,cmt.amendments,subdivision a,para.all of these disclosures should be in writing,signed by counsel,and served to opposing counsel.a.furthermore,each disclosure should be delivered by the deadline for expert disclosures set by the trial judge under rule a c.
the mussers properly disclosed all of the witnesses they proffered under rule a a.in fact,each of these witnesses was deposed by gentiva in the regular course of discovery.the district court,however,did not exclude all of the potential testimony of the mussers witnesses it merely found that the witnesses identified by the mussers should not be permitted to testify as expert witnesses.the district court explained that the error made by the mussers was in confusing rules a and a d isclosing a person as a witness and disclosing a person as an expert witness are two distinct acts.dist.op.at.thus,the witnesses could still testify as fact witnesses,but they could not testify as experts.
the mussers,however,contend that they did comply with rule a a because gentiva was in fact made aware of the identity and records of all of their witnesses,and gentiva had an opportunity to depose these witnesses as to their opinions.the mussers assert that it would be a pointless formality to disclose in writing a list of names of persons already known to gentiva through prior discovery,this time with the designation expert witness.the federal rules of civil procedure,however,demand this formal designation,as discussed above.the district court set a specific date june,for the disclosure of all of the mussers expert witnesses.the mussers failed to comply with this deadline.
formal disclosure of experts is not pointless.knowing the identity of the opponent expert witnesses allows a party to properly prepare for trial.gentiva should not be made to assume that each witness disclosed by the mussers could be an expert witness at trial.patel gayes,cir affirming,under the federal rules of civil procedure,the exclusion of expert testimony as to duty of care from treating physicians when they were not disclosed as experts.the failure to disclose experts prejudiced gentiva because there are countermeasures that could have been taken that are not applicable to fact witnesses,such as attempting to disqualify the expert testimony on grounds set forth in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,retaining rebuttal experts,and holding additional depositions to retrieve the information not available because of the absence of a report.in sum,we agree with the district court that even treating physicians and treating nurses must be designated as experts if they are to provide expert testimony 
the exclusion of expert testimony under federal rule of civil procedure c 
the exclusion of evidence is automatic and mandatory under rule c unless was justified or harmless.finley marathon oil,cir.after determining that the mussers failed to comply with rule a a,the district court appropriately inquired into whether the mussers had a substantial justification for failing to disclose their expert witnesses,and whether the failure was harmless to gentiva.c.after considering these factors,the district court excluded the testimony 
disclosing a person as a witness and disclosing a person as an expert witness are two distinct acts.obviously,opposing counsel will question a witness differently during a deposition or at trial if the witness has been designated as an expert,and is also provided the opportunity to challenge the expert qualifications.in the present case,although gentiva knew that the nurses and doctors were witnesses,gentiva was deprived of the opportunity to question them as expert witnesses.gentiva has clearly suffered a harm.additionally,the mussers have shown no justification for their failure to designate expert witnesses,other than their erroneous assumption that disclosing a witness is the same as disclosing an expert witness.
dist.op.at.the issue,then,is whether the sanction of the exclusion of all the mussers expert testimony was one that a reasonable jurist,apprised of all the circu
