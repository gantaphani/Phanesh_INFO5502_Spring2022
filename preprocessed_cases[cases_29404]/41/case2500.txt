the lawsuit before us arises out of alleged radiation injuries to residents of uravan,colorado,a former uranium and vanadium milling town owned and operated by defendants union carbide corporation and umetco minerals corporation.plaintiffs brought an action in the united states district court for the district of colorado under the act of,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of.they assert claims for personal injury based on disease or death allegedly caused by radiation and claims for medical monitoring to detect the onset of disease in those plaintiffs who were asymptomatic.the district court dismissed all the claims on pretrial motions,and plaintiffs appealed.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm.plaintiffs claims fail for lack of evidence of factual causation.their claims fail for lack of evidence of a bodily injury as required by the act.
background 
factual background 
mining and milling have been conducted in the uravan area for many years.the standard chemical company was producing radium in the region as early as.in defendants purchased standard chemical holdings,and in began milling vanadium and uranium.to accommodate workers,defendants founded the community of uravan,constructing homes and a number of facilities,including a medical clinic,elementary school,community center,tennis courts,and a swimming pool.
defendants ceased operations in uravan in,having produced million pounds of uranium oxide.this production did not come without environmental costs.in the environmental protection agency placed uravan on the national priorities list,see,june,which ranks the nation most environmentally hazardous sites to prioritize remedial action,see a b.about this time,uravan remaining residents were evacuated and remedial activities began.the last structures standing in uravan were razed after this lawsuit was filed.
plaintiffs either resided in uravan during some period between and,or represent decedents who did.for ease of exposition,we shall use the term plaintiffs to refer to those allegedly injured by defendants,whether they be the plaintiffs personally or the plaintiffs decedents.the thrust of their claims is that defendants milling operations exposed uravan residents to various radioactive materials,and that such exposure has caused,or increased the risk of,illnesses.
procedural history 
plaintiffs brought this action under the act,which grants federal district courts jurisdiction over lawsuits arising out of or resulting from a nuclear incident.n.unless inconsistent with of the act,state law supplies the substantive law governing claims under the act.see id.hh.plaintiffs also pleaded seven causes of action under colorado tort law,but the district court ruled that they were preempted by the act because they arose from an alleged nuclear incident,and it converted the claims to federal claims under the act.
plaintiffs are pursuing claims and are pursuing only claims.of the plaintiffs,have been diagnosed with nonthyroid cancer and have been diagnosed with thyroid disease including one case of thyroid cancer.
defendants challenged plaintiffs claims with two motions for summary judgment.one motion argued that the claimants had failed to show the causation required by colorado tort law.the other argued that the claims could not proceed because colorado does not recognize such a cause of action and the plaintiffs had not alleged a bodily injury,as required by the act.
in opposition to the first motion,plaintiffs argued that causation in colorado is determined not by a test but by a substantial factor test requiring only that the defendant tortious conduct be a substantial contributing cause of the injury,vol.xii at.plaintiffs contended that their experts opinions created a triable issue of fact as to whether the defendants emission of radiation over the course of decades substantially contributed to the plaintiffs illnesses.id.at.as for the claims,plaintiffs asserted that they are viable under colorado law and that the bodily injury requirement of the act poses no obstacle because each plaintiff exposure to radiation resulted in dna damage and cell death,vol.viii at.
the district court rejected the argument in support of plaintiffs claims.it stated that a tort claimant in colorado must demonstrate both of two distinct components of causation that but for the defendant conduct the claimant would not have been injured and that the defendant conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.because plaintiffs had submitted no evidence of causation,the court granted summary judgment.
the court also rejected the claims.the threshold issue,the court explained,was whether such claims constitute claims for bodily injury under the act.construing this issue to be jurisdictional,the court treated defendants motion on these claims as a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.it then held that to have a claim for bodily injury under the act,a plaintiff must manifest objective symptoms.id.at.even if the dna damage and cell death purportedly suffered by plaintiffs increased the risk of future illness,reasoned the court,that injury was presently asymptomatic and thus not a bodily injury.accordingly,the court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the claims and dismissed them without prejudice.the court did not address whether claims are recognized under colorado law.
plaintiffs challenged these rulings in a postjudgment motion under federal rule of civil procedure e,which the district court denied.plaintiffs then appealed to this court,presenting the following questions whether plaintiffs were required to show but for causation under colorado law and whether unmanifested,subclinical injuries resulting from exposure to radiation can support a bodily injury claim under the act.
ii.discussion 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.see navair,ifr americas,cir.summary judgment should be granted when there is no genuine dispute over any material fact and a party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.see.c.likewise,w e review a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction de novo,accepting the district court findings of jurisdictional facts unless they are clearly erroneous.montoya chao,cir.
as previously mentioned,actions brought under the act are governed by the substantive rules for decision of the state in which the putative nuclear incident occurred.hh.plaintiffs claim that they suffered harmful radiation exposure at defendants facilities in uravan,colorado,and the parties agree that colorado tort law governs plaintiffs claims.we therefore apply colorado law.see grynberg total,cir adopting parties assumption of applicable law.
in colorado,as elsewhere,a party seeking recovery in tort must demonstrate that the defendant conduct caused the alleged injury.see vigil franklin.the general rule for causation is that the plaintiff must prove that the alleged injury would not have occurred but for the defendant negligent conduct.kaiser found.health plan sharp.plaintiffs do not dispute that proposition but argue that when there are potential multiple or concurring causes for an injury,colorado applies a substantial factor test for causation,not the more stringent test.aplt.br.at.under the test,plaintiffs contend,an actor conduct can be deemed causal where it is of sufficient significance in producing the harm as to lead reasonable persons to regard it as a cause and to attach responsibility.id.at quoting sharp kaiser found.health plan,aff on other grounds,because the illnesses at issue in this case cancer and thyroid disease can have multiple causes,plaintiffs conclude that this more permissive test applies.
the legal issues regarding causation that arise when a disease has multiple possible causes are subtle.plaintiffs statement of the test reflects the difficulty of the issues it relies on certain language from the restatement second of torts but misstates the law by overlooking other language.to better understand the proper test,it is helpful to review the more precise,and clearer,treatment of multiple possible causes in the proposed final draft of the restatement third of torts liability for physical harm we then compare that treatment to the treatment in the restatement second and see that the ultimate legal standards in the two restatements are essentially identical for our purposes.roughly speaking we will become more precise as we discuss the underlying concepts,under the restatements a plaintiff could recover from defendants only if either uravan radiation was a cause of the plaintiff ailments or that radiation either alone or with other factors would have caused the ailments.because colorado law has been consistent with the treatment of causation in the restatements,we presume that it,too,would impose this requirement for recovery.we therefore reject plaintiffs version of the test.
to explain how we have arrived at this conclusion,we turn to an extended discussion of general principles.applying those principles to this case,we then affirm the summary judgment.
general principles 
the term substantial factor appears in the treatment of causation in the restatement second of torts as well as its predecessor,the original restatement of torts.it has been abandoned,however,in the restatement third of torts because of the misunderstanding that it has engendered.see id.cmt.
causation under the restatement third has two components.first,the tortious conduct must be the factual cause of the physical harm to the plaintiff.see id.ordinarily,a cause is a factual cause only if it is a cause,see id,although there is a potential exception,which we will discuss shortly,when there are multiple causes,see id.second,the harm must be among the harms that result from the risks that made the actor conduct tortious.id.traditionally,this second component has been referred to as proximate cause,a term that has baffled law students to say nothing of jurors,lawyers,and judges for generations but the restatement third has wisely redescribed the subject matter as scope of liability.see id.ch,special note on proximate cause id.cmt.b.we need not dwell on this focus of our attention is on factual an illustration in the restatement third conveys what is necessary to show that an injury factually caused by the defendant is within the scope of liability 
richard,a hunter,finishes his day in the field and stops at a friend house while walking home.his friend daughter,kim,greets richard,who hands his loaded shotgun to her as he enters the house.kim drops the shotgun,which lands on her toe,breaking it.although richard was negligent for giving kim his shotgun,the risk that made richard negligent was that kim might shoot someone with the gun,not that she would drop it and hurt herself the gun was neither especially heavy nor unwieldy.kim broken toe is outside the scope of richard liability,even though richard tortious conduct was a factual cause of kim harm.
id.cmt.b,illus.
returning to the concept of factual cause,states that c onduct is a factual cause of harm when the harm would not have occurred absent the conduct.as comment b to the section states,this standard is familiarly referred to as the test.that test requires a counterfactual inquiry in which the court considers what would have occurred if the actor had not engaged in the tortious conduct.id.cmt.e.if the harm complained of would have occurred notwithstanding the actor conduct,then that conduct is not a cause.see id.
section,however,recognizes that it is sometimes appropriate to impose liability even when the harm would have occurred without the defendant act.this exceptional circumstance is narrowly defined to impose liability only when a tortfeasor conduct,while not necessary for the outcome,would have been a factual cause if the other competing cause had not been operating.id.cmt.a.the black letter of states if multiple acts exist,each of which alone would have been a factual cause under of the physical harm at the same time,each act is regarded as a factual cause of the harm.again,an illustration clarifies the concept 
rosaria and vincenzo were independently camping in a heavily forested campground.each one had a campfire,and each negligently failed to ensure that the fire was extinguished upon retiring for the night.due to unusually dry forest conditions and a stiff wind,both campfires escaped their sites and began a forest fire.the two fires,burning out of control,joined together and engulfed centurion company hunting lodge,destroying it.either fire alone would have destroyed the lodge.each of rosaria and vincenzo negligence is a factual cause of the destruction of centurion hunting lodge.
id.cmt.a,illus.
the formulation of the requirements for causation in the restatement third employs different nomenclature from that in the restatement second,but it does not impose a stricter requirement for factual causation.we explain.
section of the restatement second states that a negligent person is liable for another harm only if the negligent conduct was a legal cause of the harm.section then introduces the notion of substantial factor,stating that negligent conduct is a legal cause of harm to another if his conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm and no rule of law exempts him from liability.section sets forth considerations that are important in determining whether the actor conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another.those considerations are 
a the number of other factors which contribute in producing the harm and the extent of the effect which they have in producing it b whether the actor conduct has created a force or series of forces which are in continuous and active operation up to the time of the harm,or has created a situation harmless unless acted upon by other forces for which the actor is not responsible c lapse of time.
restatement second of torts.
reading the black letter of,and,one could easily conclude that courts and juries have substantial leeway to depart from causation in imposing liability.it would appear to be enough if the considerations listed in suggest that liability is appropriate.this is how plaintiffs appear to understand the doctrine.but this conclusion can not stand once one reads,which imposes a requirement for liability that is at least as stringent as the requirement in the restatement third.section sets forth the general requirement of causation and recognizes what has become the exception in restatement third for multiple sufficient causes.section states 
except as stated in subsection,the actor negligent conduct is not a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another if the harm would have been sustained even if the actor had not been negligent.
if two forces are actively operating,one because of the actor negligence,the other not because of any misconduct on his part,and each of itself is sufficient to bring about the harm to another,the actor negligence may be found to be a substantial factor in bringing it about.
thus,as we understand the requirement in the restatement second,it adopts essentially the same standard for factual cause as the restatement third.and that standard is different from what plaintiffs advocate.what plaintiffs would apparently use to determine whether conduct is a substantial conditions set forth in actually limitations on what conduct can qualify as a substantial factor.once conduct satisfies one of the alternative requirements in and which in the restatement third,are the alternative grounds for being a factual must still qualify under if it is to be considered a substantial factor.the counterpart to in the restatement third is,which states that w hen an actor negligent conduct constitutes only a trivial contribution to a causal set that is a factual cause of physical harm under,the harm is not within the scope of liability.an actor trivial contribution thus would still be a factual cause,but the actor would not be liable because the harm was outside the scope of liability.it should be noted that,unlike restatement second,applies only to one of multiple sufficient causes,not to a factual cause 
there are two further nuances regarding factual cause that need to be explained the notion of causal sets and the meaning of the term sufficient cause.the notion of a causal set is a helpful innovation in the restatement third.a number of factors often innocent generally must coexist for a tortfeasor conduct to result in injury to the plaintiff.even when the defendant drives his car into the plaintiff car,no injury would have resulted if the plaintiff had not entered her car and driven to the accident site.that there are many factors does not mean that the defendant conduct was not a cause.as comment c to of the restatement third explains 
a useful model for understanding factual causation is to conceive of a set made up of each of the necessary conditions for plaintiff harm.absent any one of the elements of the set,the plaintiff harm would not have occurred.thus,there will always be multiple some say,infinite factual causes of a harm,although most will not be of significance for tort law and many will be unidentified.that there are a large number of causes of an event does not mean that everything is a cause of an event.the vast majority of acts,omissions,and other factors play no role in causing any discrete event.
this model does not imply any chronological relationship among the causal elements involved,although all causes must precede the plaintiff harm.an actor tortious conduct may occur well before the other person suffers harm and require a number of subsequent events to produce the harm.thus,a gas valve negligently constructed may not fail for many years.toxic substances may be sold without adequate warnings but not produce harm for decades.conversely,the tortious conduct may occur after a number of other necessary events have already occurred but close in time to the occurrence of harm.nor does this model imply any relationship among the causal elements causal elements may operate independently,as when a property owner neglects a patch of ice on a sidewalk and a careless pedestrian fails to notice the condition,producing a fall.
when of the restatement third speaks of multiple sufficient causes,it could more precisely speak of multiple sufficient causal sets.see id.cmt.for example,the evidence at trial may show that conditions a,b,c,d,e,and f were present that if only a,b,and c had been present,the injury would probably have occurred and that if only d,e,and f had been present,the injury would probably have occurred.if f is the defendant misconduct,then f was not a cause of the injury even without f,the injury would have occurred all it took was a,b,and c.but since d,e,and f would also have caused the injury,f is a component of a second causal set.f must,of course,be a necessary component of the second causal set to be a factual cause of the injury.see id.that is,f would not be a factual cause if d and e alone would have been enough to cause the injury f must be a but for component of at least one causal set for liability to attach.
moreover,multiple causal sets may share some components.if a,b,and c would probably have caused the injury with each of a,b,and c being necessary and so would have a,b,and d,the tortfeasor who committed d would be liable.the restatement third provides the following example 
able,baker,and charlie,acting independently but simultaneously,each negligently lean on paul car,which is parked at a scenic overlook at the edge of a mountain.their combined force results in the car rolling over the edge of a diminutive curbstone and plummeting down the mountain to its destruction.the force exerted by each of able,baker,and charlie would have been insufficient to propel paul car past the curbstone,but the combined force of any two of them is sufficient.able,baker,and charlie are each a factual cause of the destruction of paul car.
id.cmt.f,illus.
a example would be a typical asbestosis lawsuit.a person suffering from asbestosis may have been exposed to asbestos from a number of sources say,four,and the total exposure may have been more than enough to cause asbestosis.it may well be that asbestosis would probably have arisen even without exposure of the victim to source a,so source a is not a cause and that source a by itself would not have caused asbestosis.but source a may be a factual cause if it was a necessary component of a causal set that included,say,two of the other sources and the three together would probably have caused asbestosis.see,spaur fiberglas,iowa balbos,restatement third of torts reporters note cmt.
finally,we attempt to dispel some confusion that may arise from use of the word sufficient in the provisions of the restatement second and the restatement third that provide an alternative to causation in limited circumstances.restatement second employs the phrase forces sufficient to bring about harm to another and restatement third is entitled multiple sufficient causes.the use of the word sufficient in both restatements does not mean that either of them would impose liability for conduct that is not a cause if only the conduct could have caused the injury.rather,it is necessary for the plaintiff to show that the conduct or the causal set of which it is a necessary part would in fact have caused the injury.as we all know,in the modern world of many hazardous substances,there may be many possible causes of a particular cancer.each could be said to be sufficient to cause a specific person cancer.but one who suffers that cancer does not have a cause of action based on each such substance to which he was exposed,regardless of how unlikely it is that the cancer resulted from that exposure.only a substance that would have actually that is,probably caused the cancer can be a factual cause without being a cause.this is clear in the black letter of restatement third,which states if multiple acts exist,each of which alone would have been a factual cause under of the physical harm at the same time,each act is regarded as a factual cause of the harm.id.emphasis added.and the illustrations to the section confirm this reading.we have already quoted the illustrations involving two fires,each of which alone would have destroyed the lodge,id.cmt.a,illus,and involving three persons leaning on a car,the combined force of any two of whom is sufficient to propel the car,id.cmt.f,illus.we leave to a footnote a third illustration,the one most pertinent to the case before us,which requires proof that a drug would have caused the birth defect that could also have been caused by an unrelated genetic condition.id.cmt.e,illus.it is not enough that the drug could have caused the defect,as might be inferred from use of the term sufficient cause 
the restatement second is not as clear as the restatement third in excluding conduct that merely could have caused the injury,but the sole illustration to the point in restatement second is essentially the same as the illustration in restatement third.in any event,the very notion of two or more causes or causal sets,neither of which is a cause,necessarily assumes that each of the causes would have caused the injury.say there are two such causes,a and b.the reason that a is not a cause is that the injury would probably have occurred even if a had not been present.but that is merely another way of saying that even in the absence of a,b probably would have caused the injury it would not be enough to prevent a from being a cause that b may have caused the injury on its own but probably would not have 
to sum up,as we understand the restatement second and the restatement third,a defendant can not be liable to the plaintiff unless its conduct is either a a cause of the plaintiff injury or b a necessary component of a causal set that probably would have caused the injury in the absence of other causes.in particular,conduct was not a substantial factor,within the meaning of the term in the restatement second,in bringing about a plaintiff injury unless it satisfied a or b,and also was a sufficiently significant factor under the considerations set forth in restatement second.thus,plaintiffs argument misconceives the meaning of substantial factor in the restatement second.
to be sure,it is colorado law that governs here,not the restatements.the colorado supreme court may have decided to disagree with the restatements and adopt a different standard for causation.but we see no evidence of this.we have reviewed the colorado opinions relied upon by plaintiffs for their view of the standard.none expressly addresses multiple sufficient causes.all but one are fully consonant with our above analysis.the sole exception is the opinion by the colorado court of appeals in sharp,at.that decision held that the trial court had erred in requiring evidence of causation because the plaintiff had been required to show only that the misdiagnosis of her heart condition was a substantial factor in causing her heart attack.in language ultimately derived from restatement second cmt.a,the court said,a defendant conduct is a substantial factor where it is of sufficient significance in producing the harm as to lead reasonable persons to regard it as a cause and to attach responsibility.sharp,at see restatement second cmt.a the word substantial is used to denote the fact that the defendant conduct has such an effect in producing the harm as to lead reasonable men to regard it as a cause,using the word in the popular sense,in which there always lurks the idea of responsibility emphasis added.but the court apparently ignored restatement second,discussed above,which states that conduct is not a substantial factor unless it is a cause or one of multiple sufficient causes.in any event,the state supreme court took the case and affirmed on a different theory.see sharp,at,finding sufficient evidence of causation and affirming court of appeals without reaching its substantial factor analysis.
our role here is to predict what the colorado supreme court would adopt as the governing law.see tmj implants,aetna,cir federal courts applying state law must predict what the state highest court would do internal quotation marks omitted.predicting another court decision is necessarily an uncertain proposition.in our view,however,it would be too adventurous on our part to assume that colorado would depart from the restatements.we therefore hold that defendants would be liable only upon proof of one of the following that exposure of a plaintiff to uravan radiation was a cause of the plaintiff medical condition or that such exposure to uravan radiation was a necessary component of a causal set that would have caused the medical condition.
we now examine whether plaintiffs supplied such evidence.
causation evidence 
plaintiffs failed to raise in district court a genuine issue of fact regarding factual causation.that is,they failed to present to the court evidence,or even an argument,that uravan radiation was either a cause of any medical condition suffered by one of the plaintiffs or that uravan radiation was a necessary component of a causal set that would probably have caused one of those conditions.
plaintiffs presented five expert witnesses.colin hill,who was offered only as an expert with respect to the plaintiffs,testified regarding how radiation injures cells and begins the process that can lead to cancer and other ailments.james ruttenber addressed only general causation,that is,whether radiation at uravan had the capacity to cause the cancers and thyroid diseases that the plaintiffs developed.see neiberger fed ex ground package,cir discussing general and specific causation restatement third of torts cmt.c,c same.owen hoffman provided the raw data upon which the final two experts relied.he estimated the mean dose of radiation received by each plaintiff from uravan operations.and for the plaintiffs claiming thyroid diseases,he estimated their radiation exposure from the detonation of atomic weapons at a testing site in nevada the nevada test site or nts conducted between and.in addition,for the cancer plaintiffs including the one who suffered thyroid cancer he converted the uravan dosage into a figure representing the excess risk of diagnosed cancer and an assigned share figure that can be used to compare the number of cancers expected in a population exposed to that level of radiation to the number that would be expected in an unexposed population,vol.x at.
to prove specific causation for each is,to prove that the uravan radiation caused the specific ailment of which the plaintiff relied on the remaining two experts inder chopra and robert peter gale.chopra addressed the plaintiffs with thyroid disease including the one case of thyroid cancer and gale addressed the remaining plaintiffs,all of whom had suffered cancer.
chopra prepared a report that assessed each thyroid plaintiff and concluded that the plaintiff exposure to radiation from uravan and nts fallout was a substantial factor contributing to the plaintiff thyroid disease.see,vol.ix at.a substantial factor,he explained,is intended to mean that the exposures were one of the variables that contributed to the observed health effect thyroid disease.id.at.he defined substantial as an amount that is not trivial,id,concluding that if the contribution of any one source to a plaintiff total exposure to irradiation was of the total,its contribution was substantial,id.at.because at least of the radiation exposure for each plaintiff came from uravan,the uravan radiation was a substantial contributing factor.chopra report did not,however,state with respect to any plaintiff that uravan radiation was a cause of the plaintiff thyroid disease or was a necessary component of a causal set that probably would have caused the plaintiff to suffer the disease.
for the plaintiffs with cancer other than thyroid cancer,gale report opined that to a reasonable medical probability exposure to ionizing radiations was a substantial factor contributing to each plaintiff developing cancer s.id.at emphasis omitted.the report did not define substantial contributing factor,but it noted that,based on hoffman data,each of the plaintiffs had an assigned share exceeding,and he later submitted a declaration that this meant that there is greater than a likelihood that a plaintiff cancer was contributed to by the additional radiation exposure from defendants uranium operations.id.vol.xii at.as was true of chopra,however,gale did not opine that uravan radiation was either a cause of any plaintiff cancer or was a necessary component of a causal set that would have caused the cancer.
thus,the evidence relied on by plaintiffs did not show that uravan radiation was a factual cause of any of their ailments.in reaching this conclusion we are not being hypertechnical.the problem for plaintiffs is not that their experts failed to utter some magic words,such as but for.nor are we relying on any expertise of this court in analyzing the data and opinions from plaintiffs experts.we claim no such expertise.for all we know,the data would support claims of some,or even all,plaintiffs.the problem for plaintiffs is that they did not make a timely argument that they had produced evidence of causation,and they have never not even in this court contended that they have produced evidence that uravan radiation was a necessary component of a causal set that probably would have caused the plaintiffs ailments.
our conclusion in this regard follows from an examination of how the issue was joined below.the defendants motion on the claims was premised on the absence of evidence.defendants stressed that agents other than radiation can cause the plaintiffs ailments and that neither chopra nor gale had opined that those ailments would not have occurred but for the plaintiffs exposure to the radioactive substances attributable to defendants activities.id.vol.xi at.in response,plaintiffs argued that they need not establish causation and that their chopra and a triable issue of fact by opining that exposure to radiation at uravan substantially contributed to the development of each plaintiff disease.id.vol.xii at.at a hearing on the matter the district court rejected plaintiffs substantially contributed standard and stated that defendants were entitled to summary judgment because the plaintiffs experts ha d not offered the requisite opinion of but for causality.id.vol.xiii at.a few seconds after stating that conclusion,the court asked whether there was a ny need for clarification or further explanation with regard to the ruling on this motion id.plaintiffs counsel responded no,your honor.id.
ten days later plaintiffs filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment under federal rule of civil procedure e.the motion asserted,for the first time,that their evidence could satisfy the requirement if one were erroneously imposed.but even then the specific arguments that plaintiffs raised amounted to no more than the assertion that the test actually subsumes the but for test.id.at.they pointed to no evidence that their ailments would not have occurred in the absence of uravan radiation.moreover,a rule e motion can not be used to advance arguments that could have been raised in prior briefing.see grynberg,at internal quotation marks omitted.
plaintiffs make better arguments on appeal but they come too late.based on the evidence and arguments properly before the district court,summary judgment on all claims was appropriately granted.see hutton contracting city of coffeyville,cir absent special circumstances,we will not reverse on a ground not raised below.
we now turn to the claims seeking payment for medical monitoring to detect the onset of disease.the district court dismissed these claims without prejudice because they do not assert a bodily injury,as required for jurisdiction under the act.we affirm the dismissal 
the act of protects the public while promoting the generation of nuclear power by establishing an insurance and indemnification scheme that caps liability in the event of a nuclear mishap.see duke power carolina envtl.study group,d.the act has been amended on several occasions.in its present form it grants federal district courts jurisdiction to hear public liability action s.n.a public liability action is any suit asserting public liability.id.hh.the term public liability encompasses,with a few exceptions,any legal liability arising out of or resulting from a nuclear incident.id.w a nuclear incident,in turn,is defined as any occurrence causing bodily injury,sickness,disease,or death,or loss of or damage to property,or loss of use of property,arising out of or resulting from the radioactive,toxic,explosive,or other hazardous properties of source,special nuclear,or byproduct material.q emphasis added.
the parties agree that whether the plaintiffs who do not claim to have suffered a sickness or disease can sue under the act depends on whether they have suffered bodily injury.the plaintiffs contend that they have suffered bodily injury in the form of dna damage and cell death resulting from their exposure to radiation at uravan,vol.viii at.although these injuries are having been manifested in any diagnosed disease or contend that the alleged injuries have enhanced the risk that they will develop disease in the future.they seek damages to cover the cost of detecting latent health problems.
in support of this claim,plaintiffs rely on reports prepared by colin hill,a radiation biologist.hill reports explain that when radiation hits a human cell,it can break dna strands in the cell nucleus,by direct or indirect action.although the vast majority of such breaks are properly repaired by the body,some mutations in the dna remain and can lead to the development of a cancerous cell.strand breaks also can result in death of the cell.such cell injury,hill explained,can lead to thyroid disease.hill concluded that although a particular exposure to radiation may not trigger these processes,there is no dosage threshold any exposure to radiation can break dna strands and set the train in motion.
in our view,dna damage and cell death,which creates only a possibility of clinical disease,does not constitute a bodily injury under the act.it is true that a number of courts have recognized claims not brought under the act premised on subclinical effects of toxic exposure.but,tellingly,these courts have not reasoned that subclinical injuries from a toxic agent are bodily or physical injuries.rather,those that have recognized claims absent clinical symptoms have grounded the cause of action on the plaintiff legally protected interest in avoiding expensive medical evaluations caused by the tortious conduct of others.other courts that have permitted relief have required a present physical injury and they have generally presumed that the subclinical effects of toxic exposure do not constitute physical injury 
perhaps more significantly,adopting the plaintiffs understanding of the term bodily injury would render it superfluous in the statute.see mccloy of,cir under a canon of statutory interpretation,one should avoid construing a statute so as to render statutory language superfluous.this superfluity becomes apparent when we review what both plaintiffs and defendants agree to be the requirements for a claim.
the act is limited to claims arising from nuclear incident s,n,which are occurrences caused by radioactive substances,see id.q defining nuclear incident as occurrence arising from the hazardous properties of source,special nuclear or byproduct material id.z defining source material id.aa defining special nuclear material id.e defining byproduct material.in addition,a plaintiff cause of action must be recognized by the law of the state where the nuclear incident occurred.see id.hh.further,the cause of action must be a claim for property damage,see id.q nuclear incident may be occurrence causing loss of or damage to property,or loss of use of property,or a claim for bodily injury,sickness,disease,or death,id.this much,as we understand the briefs before us,is not disputed.given this context,however,what purpose is served by the limitation to bodily injury,sickness,disease,or death if,as plaintiffs contend and we do not question their science,every exposure to radiation causes intracellular damage and such damage is a bodily injury under plaintiffs analysis,every claim that satisfied state law would also meet the requirements of.the term bodily injury as well as the terms sickness and disease would impose no limit on claims it would be superfluous.see dumontier schlumberger tech,cir this interpretation of bodily injury would render the term surplusage,as every exposure to radiation would perforce cause bodily injury.
plaintiffs counter that numerous courts interpreting insurance policies have held that bodily injury for purposes of coverage the duty to defend includes the subclinical injuries that they suffer.aplt.br.at.the insurance cases that they rely upon fall into two categories.one category includes two cases that concerned the allocation of indemnification responsibilities between insurers who provided coverage for different periods during which disease developed.for example,in insurance of north america insulations,cir,the insured manufacturer of asbestos was being sued by persons who had developed asbestosis.asbestosis is a disease that develops from exposure over time to asbestos.see id.at.the insured had obtained coverage from various companies for different periods of time.see id.at.the issue was whether a policy insuring against claims for bodily injury which was defined as bodily injury,sickness,or disease sustained during the policy period,id.at,would provide coverage if the policy was not in effect when the asbestosis was diagnosed,but only when the claimant was exposed to asbestos,see id.the court held that in this context bodily injury encompassed asymptomatic tissue damage from asbestos that was not diagnosable,and a policy in effect at the time of exposure therefore provided coverage.id.at see sandoz,employer liab.assurance,following insulations,in a case involving a different disease,to reject view that bodily injury must be manifest.
the second category of plaintiffs cases includes decisions holding that an insurer providing coverage has a duty to defend against claims when there was an unmanifested injury during the policy period.see guar.ins.azrock indus,cir inhalation of asbestos fibers during policy period triggers insurer duty to defend,abrogated on other grounds by don.supply,onebeacon ins,zurich am.ins.nokia,allegations of cellular injuries from use of cellphones triggered insurers duty to defend.
these insurance cases are readily distinguishable.as insulations recognized,the legal meaning of the term bodily injury depends on context.see at.it observed that other courts had interpreted bodily injury to require a manifest injury when resolving questions regarding a statute of limitations,liability for workers compensation,and coverage.see id.but it decided that none of those decisions would be controlling on the issue before it.see id.most important to the courts in all the cases relied on by plaintiffs was the proposition that they should construe insurance policy thus the term bodily to promote coverage.id.at accord zurich,at we resolve all doubts regarding the duty to defend in favor of the duty.guaranty national,for example,acknowledged that another construction of the term bodily injury was arguably the truest to the policy language,at,yet held that bodily injury encompassed subclinical tissue damage,id.at.
the term bodily injury arises in this case in a substantially different context.here it governs whether plaintiffs can pursue a federal cause of,the act public liability action.hh,w,q.plaintiffs have not directed us to any interpretative canon instructing courts to construe causes of action broadly.indeed,public policy may well argue for denying relief to those without symptomatic,diagnosed ailments so that scarce resources can be directed to compensate those who have suffered more serious harms.see commuter buckley,d in support of decision not to recognize claims for damages under federal employers liability act by plaintiffs who lack manifest symptoms of disease,court notes that permitting claims could threaten both a flood of less important cases potentially absorbing resources better left available to those more seriously harmed and the systemic harms that can accompany unlimited and unpredictable liability for example,vast testing liability adversely affecting the allocation of scarce medical resources citation and internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we see no reason to abandon traditional methods of statutory interpretation and adopt a meaning for bodily injury that renders superfluous several words in q.
finally,we address plaintiffs contention that the legislative history of the act implies that we must interpret the term bodily injury in the act the way it would be interpreted in an insurance policy.the legislative history on which they rely consists of the following sentence in a congressional committee report the words sickness,disease were added following bodily injury in the definition of nuclear incident in order to make it perfectly clear that the extent of bodily injury was the same as the definition of bodily injury as specified by the standard nelia nuclear energy liability insurance association insurance policy,reprinted in,see berg dupont de nemours in re berg litig,cir relying on this history to support proposition that act does not impose liability for purely emotional injuries.we are not persuaded.to begin with,we are reluctant to base our interpretation of a statute on a single sentence in a committee report that does not appear to be addressing the specific issue before,whether asymptomatic,undiagnosable cellular injury constitutes a bodily injury under the act.moreover,inspection of what was apparently the nelia standard policy of the time,see,suggests that bodily injury did not encompass cellular,or any other undetectable,injury.section iv of the policy,entitled application of policy,stated this policy applies only to bodily injury or property damage which results from nuclear incidents occurring during the policy period and which is discovered,and for which written claim is made against the insured,not later than two years after the end of the policy period.id.at emphasis added see current provision with identical language in iv.because the policy covers only discovered bodily injury,it apparently would not insure against claims for undetectable injuries such as those at the cellular level.this is not to say that there would be no compensation under the act for persons with latent injuries that are detected years after the nuclear incident.for example,the government contribution to paying liability claims could include such injuries.see,i c when claims from a nuclear incident may exceed act liability cap,president must submit to congress or more compensation plans that may include recommendations that funds be allocated or set aside for the payment of claims that may arise as a result of latent injuries that may not be discovered until a later date.
in short,under the act the asymptomatic dna damage and cell death that results whenever one is exposed to radiation is not in itself a bodily injury 
iii.conclusion 
the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
i join part of the majority opinion affirming the dismissal of the medical monitoring claims.however,i must respectfully dissent from part of the majority opinion to the extent that it affirms the district judge grant of summary judgment on the personal injury claims of the plaintiffs with thyroid disease.
i acknowledge that the thyroid disease plaintiffs did not timely argue before the district judge that they had produced sufficient evidence of causation.and as the majority indicates on of their opinion,a bsent special circumstances,we will not reverse on a ground not raised below.hutton contracting city of coffeyville,cir.however,assuming that the issue was not raised below,i am convinced that special circumstances are present here.therefore,i conclude that we should exercise our discretion to reverse the district judge erroneous determination that the thyroid disease plaintiffs did not produce sufficient evidence of causation.
whether to address the argument despite the litigant failure to raise it below is subject to this court discretion based on the circumstances of the individual case.united states jarvis,cir citing singleton wulff,d.we have exercised this discretion where the argument involves a pure matter of law and the proper resolution of the issue is certain.id.we have justified our decision to exercise discretion in these situations because no additional findings of fact or presentation of evidence were required for the issue disposition and both parties had the opportunity to address the issue in their appellate briefing.id.the circumstances of the case before us clearly support the exercise of our discretion to address whether the thyroid disease plaintiffs produced sufficient evidence of causation.
first,whether the thyroid disease plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence of causation to survive summary judgment is a legal question.see strate midwest bankcentre,cir t he focus of inquiry at the summary judgment stage always remains on the ultimate question of law whether the evidence is sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact internal quotations omitted charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure,at ed.it has long been established that whether the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to create an issue of fact for the jury is solely a question of law see also shorter icg holdings,cir lucero,dissenting indicating that whether sufficient evidence has been presented to survive summary judgment is a legal question.further,if the thyroid plaintiffs had argued that they produced sufficient evidence of causation,and the district judge had rejected that argument,we would review that rejection de novo.see jarvis,at finding a pure issue of law and stating that h ad the trial court been given the opportunity to rule on the issue first presented on appeal,our review would be de novo,just as it is now navair,ifr,cir we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.
second,taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the thyroid disease plaintiffs,i am convinced that those plaintiffs produced sufficient evidence of causation to survive summary judgment.the thyroid disease plaintiffs relied on the expert opinion of inder chopra as evidence that the defendants operations were a cause of their injuries.chopra opined that i t is more probable than not that each of these two sources,the nevada test site radiation and the radiation from the defendants uranium operations of itself was a substantial c
