medical evidence 
george conner,brown primary care physician,has treated brown since the end of.on march,brown saw conner with complaints of an inability to control her emotions,moodiness,and an inability to sleep.conner diagnosed depression with anxiety and prescribed effexor.then,in january,conner prescribed ativan to brown after she complained of difficulty sleeping and nerves in response to the recent death of her sister.during a examination on february,conner treated brown for,inter alia,anxiety and dysphoria.during the visit,brown stated that ativan helps and prayer helps but that she did not feel able to face her responsibilities at work.
on march,conner opined that brown had,inter alia,resolving and was doing better with her mood,b etter able to concentrate,and less anxious.on august,conner treated brown for,inter alia,anxiety and prescribed ativan.
during brown visits to conner for various ailments in march and june,conner noted brown as having normal mood,memory,judgment,and insight.but on august,brown complained to conner of stress,and conner prescribed lexapro and recommended that she remain off work for two weeks.during a appointment on august,brown reported that she was feeling better but still was not always sleeping at night because sometimes her mind seem e d to keep running when she was tired.conner diagnosed stress,instructed brown to continue lexapro,and continued her work release until september.on september,brown again saw conner,reporting that she was feeling less depressed and still forgetful but was improving with less stress and resting better.brown indicated that she thought she may not go back to work but was undecided.conner assessment was that brown had stress and depression he advised brown to continue taking lexapro.
on february,brown applied for dib.she alleged disability since july,primarily due to anxiety.during an appointment with conner on february,brown complained of problems sleeping and forgetting things,and conner prescribed paxil for anxiety and recommended counseling.thereafter,on april,brown underwent a mental status evaluation by charles spellman.brown reported going to a mental health center for anxiety and depression when she was in her but stated that she had not been back for mental health services since that time.brown told spellman that she was depressed and anxious and that her mind wandered,causing her to lose her attention.in his report,spellman noted that brown was coherent and relevant throughout the evaluation and that she was a pleasant woman who talked too much.he said that she talks constantly,punctuating her sentences with smiles and casting about of her big eyes.she talked about being abused,her depression,her anxiety,and other bad things all the while casting smiles.it was as if she was talking about bad things but enjoying talking about them.he reported that she was animated and never cried or appeared to be in distress in fact,he said that she was quite relaxed.
as to brown stream of mental activity,spellman opined that she was spontaneous and that her thought processes were logical and well organized.her speech was not pressured so much as it was that she seemed to just like to talk a lot.he surmised that brown controls social situations by being facile with words.as to her thought control,he said that brown contact with reality appeared good and that t here was no evidence of hallucinations,delusions,obsessions and unusual powers.when spellman asked brown what she was depressed about,brown replied that she did not know.as to her anxiety,she said,i will tell you the truth,i do know what that means.i just feel funny.my head tingles like your skin does when it is numb.sometimes i just burst out in sweats.spellman opined that brown has heard the word depression paired up with anxiety so she always included them together.although,she did not know the definition of anxiety.she did describe symptoms,which were necessarily anxiety generated.brown reported flashbacks of emotional,mental,and physical abuse during her first marriage,and spellman indicated that this abuse explained her depression.
spellman opined that brown was in contact with reality and had appropriate orientation with respect to time,person,place.he estimated her iq to be to.he observed that although brown complained of memory problems,they did not seem significant enough to warrant a diagnosis at this time.he rated her communication skills as good in all areas.socially,he believed that brown got along fine with others,and he saw no evidence of unusual passivity,dependency,aggression,impulsiveness,or withdrawal.he noted that brown 
fixes complete meals,goes shopping for groceries,drives a vehicle,and attends church regularly.she pays bills.she manages the family money.she has friends she is involved in her daughter school activities a typical day might include visiting her mother,doing housework,checking on her daughter at school her plans are that,perhaps,she would like to travel in the future but not too far at one time.

brown is able to perform work where interpersonal contact is routine but superficial,grocery checker complexity of tasks is learned by experience,several variables,uses judgment with limits supervision required is little for routine but detailed for.
jerry henderson,a psychologist,agreed with gale assessments.
following her examination by gale,brown reported to conner on august,that she was experiencing episodes of fear and worry but could not identify any particular stress.according to brown,she was feeling anxious and not tolerating family stress well additionally,traveling in a car made her very nervous.conner diagnosed anxiety and possible hypertension and prescribed ativan and zoloft.during september,brown complained of feeling anxious and an inability to work.she reported that zoloft was not helping her anxiety,and conner prescribed paxil and lorazepam.in october,conner diagnosed brown with improved generalized anxiety disorder.according to conner notes,brown mood and anxiety seemed better.conner prescribed,inter alia,paxil and lorazepam.
in january,brown complained to conner that she was under a lot of stress at home and not resting well.he again diagnosed her with anxiety and prescribed,inter alia,lorazepam.two months later,he prescribed ambien.on april,brown reported to conner that she was unable to sleep,was stressed a lot,and felt jumpy.conner indicated in his notes that brown does like to take meds.he assessed brown with insomnia,stress,and headaches and prescribed zoloft.a few days later,conner replaced zoloft with lorazepam.on april,brown reported that she was still stressed a lot,was not sleeping well,and was experiencing occasional headaches.conner diagnosed insomnia,headaches,and and prescribed ambien and lexapro.
at the end of april,brown went to baptist memorial hospital in memphis,tennessee baptist,with complaints of nervousness and atypical chest pain.her eck and ecg were normal.andrew watson observed that brown primary care physician had prescribed zoloft but that brown has only taken three doses of it and then quit.a few days after brown hospital visit,she complained to conner that she could not sleep and heard voices when lying down.she also stated that lexapro made her nervous.conner discontinued the lexapro and prescribed seroquel for sleep.brown subsequently complained that seroquel made her break out in a sweat,but conner noted that brown had no other problems with seroquel and that it did help her rest at night with no other side effects.conner diagnosed insomnia and prescribed ambien.
on may,brown was treated at the forrest city medical center triage forrest city for difficulty sleeping.she was diagnosed with depression and anxiety,given an injection,and prescribed ambien.the next day,brown returned to baptist,reporting that she was unable to sleep.she was diagnosed with insomnia and anxiety and prescribed xanax.then,on may,brown was treated at the forrest city emergency room for heart fluttering and nerves.she was diagnosed with anxiety and prescribed ambien for sleep.shortly thereafter,on june,brown again went to baptist,where she was treated for sleep disturbance.she was diagnosed with acute adjustment reaction and psychosocial dysfunction,anxiety state,and insomnia.she was prescribed ativan,in addition to the prozac and ambien that she was already taking.that same day,brown was seen at lakeside behavioral health system lakeside,where she was given a provisional diagnosis of possible depression and anxiety and a global assessment functioning gaf of.medical personnel recorded that brown had no previous treatment for a psychiatric disorder and that she exhibited normal speech and thought processes and fair judgment,insight,and memory.
on june,brown was admitted to the baptist emergency room and diagnosed with psychosis.she received injections of haldol and ativan.brown family agreed to commit her for treatment.a certificate of need for emergency admission to a psychiatric facility was completed,in which steven creasy certified that brown has a mental illness or serious emotional disturbance as evidenced by her sudden onset of delusional,hallucinatory behavior.according to creasy,this was the first episode she has exhibited.
brown was transferred on july,to lakeside for inpatient care.a psychological assessment indicated that when brown husband returned home from work,brown was talking out of her head about religious things and kept chanting,bible,bible,drugs are sin,drugs are sin.brown admitted problems in major life areas,including her lack of employment,loss of energy,social withdrawal,and ability to parent.she was delusional and appeared to be responding to internal stimuli.she could not respond normally to questions and had a vacant look in her eyes.brown was given a provisional diagnosis of psychotic disorder and a gaf of.at the time of her admission,she was only taking buspar.during her hospitalization,she was placed on ambien for sleep and haldol injections twice a day for acute exacerbation of psychotic symptomatology.a psychiatric progress note from radwan khuri on july,indicated that brown general appearance,affect,mood,speech,language,thought process,and thought content were within normal limits.
during her hospitalization,brown told a doctor that about two weeks of poor sleep preceded her delusional episode.she denied any mood problems or depression prior to the episode and stated that she had no history of visual or auditory hallucinations.according to brown,it was right around when she stopped taking xanax that she had this breakdown.brown doctor described brown as,anxious,and oriented with clear and coherent speech.he observed that she was of average intelligence,had fair judgment,impaired insight,and fair impulse control.he assigned brown a gaf score of.on july,khuri discharged brown,diagnosing her with psychosis and assigning her a gaf score of.her discharge medications included abilify,cogentin,and sonata.
on july,brown was admitted to counseling consultants,as an outpatient for treatment of generalized anxiety disorder,psychosis,and possible bipolar disorder with psychotic features.she was prescribed abilify,and the cogentin and sonata were discontinued.during a medication management appointment in late july,brown was assigned a gaf of.
on july,at lakeside direction,brown saw conner for a appointment for her psychosis.his notes indicate that brown was feeling much better and sleeping much better.he stated that brown had no significant anxiety and no obvious psychotic behavior.he found her much improved.he increased her dosage of abilify.a review of the administrative record reveals that although brown continued seeing conner on occasion from august to november,she was seeing conner for medical conditions unrelated to anxiety,depression,or psychosis 
in august,brown saw robert schriner for insomnia.brown had quit taking abilify because it made her too sleepy to function during the day and instead was taking xanax.he diagnosed insomnia related to underlying anxiety and referred her to jack morgan,a psychiatrist.
on december,morgan diagnosed brown with depressive disorder,probable bipolar disorder,with the most recent episode being a psychotic mania,and anxiety disorder.he reported that brown continues to feel significantly better than at the time i first saw her.he stated that brown had difficulty getting to sleep and staying asleep the previous evening but that brown said she had nothing particular on her mind.according to morgan,brown indicated that she get s a little worked up at times when family members discuss their problems with her because she feels there is nothing she can do.brown informed morgan that she had a family christmas dinner at her home the prior evening,which may have affected her sleep,as the family ate later than usual for her.morgan noted that brown was working out on a regular basis and that her m ood seems to be stable.at present,there is any overt psychotic symptomatology,delusional thinking,grandiosity.thought processing integrated.he assigned brown a gaf of.
on january,morgan reported that brown says that she been feeling reasonably well,in terms of mood,level of energy,and interest.brown informed morgan that she was sleeping better,her appetite was good,and she was better able to relax more than i normally do.morgan again noted that brown was working out several times per week.his impression of brown was the same as it had been on december,although he added that brown seems to be less vulnerable to day to day stressors.her coping with normal day to day issues is apparently improved,given reduction in report of stressors or reaction to stressors.he again assigned her a gaf of.
on march,morgan indicated that brown feels that she getting good benefit from her medication and that brown generally felt that she was more relaxed and calmed down.his impression was the same as december and january,but he added that brown is spending more time taking care of herself and that her d ealing with stress is improved.he assigned her a gaf of.a few days later,brown called morgan to report that she was not sleeping in response,morgan increased the dosage of seroquel.
on april,the day of brown administrative hearing,conner wrote a letter on brown behalf,stating 
i have been a primary care provider for bobb ie brown since december of.i have seen her for a variety of complaints and problems.i have seen no evidence of malingering or deceptive behavior.she has suffered from anxiety and illness during the years i have seen her.
last year she suffered with an episode which caused psychosis and required her hospitalization.since that time her emotional state would not allow employment.i have been concerned since that time she would not be able to return to full time employment.she has been in relatively stable condition over the past few months but because of the continued problems she has with stress and anxiety in normal daily activity,she is not able to tolerate full time employment.in my opinion,she is not able to return to work now or in the future.
thereafter,on may,morgan reported that brown has generally been doing fairly well but that there were occasions,such as the recent graduation and subsequent graduation party of her grandson where the task of going about,making preparations caused some feeling of tension or emotional distress.but he noted that this emotional distress was nothing severe.he also observed that brown had experienced no recurrence of psychotic or manic symptoms.his impression was that although brown had a severe episode of illness,it seems that she is reasonably stable.he noted that brown was unclear as to who evaluated her for disability and whether it was an application for ssdi.according to morgan,
i t seems that the agenda may in part be related to the disability question.for the first time in a while,her husband and daughter are both here with her,with various questions about what i think of the issue,whether any company would hire a person who might have to occasionally be off work due to illness.
morgan assigned brown a gaf of and recommended that she see a counselor in addition to taking her medications.
administrative hearing and alj decision 
at the administrative hearing,a vocational expert ve testified that brown past relevant work as an assembly worker was light and unskilled,her past relevant work as a cashier was light and,and her past relevant work as a substitute teacher was light and skilled.the alj then presented the following hypothetical to the ve 
let assume that we have an individual that early.they have a high school equivalency education,two years of college.they ve got the same work history as you just described.they really do have any physical restrictions,but they do have some limitations.but this hypothetical individual should be able to perform work where interpersonal contact is routine,but superficial.complexity of the tasks is learned by experience.several variables.they can use judgment with limits.the supervision required is little for routine,but detailed for.
based on this hypothetical,the alj asked the ve whether this hypothetical individual would be able to work as a cashier,substitute teacher,or assembly line worker.the ve responded that this individual would be able to work as a cashier and assembly line worker but not as a substitute teacher.
the alj evaluated brown disability claim according to the process outlined by the social security regulations.see a f.in his decision,the alj concluded that brown had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the onset of her alleged disability on july,although she had worked as a substitute teacher.he also found that the medical evidence established that brown suffers from a depressive disorder and an anxiety disorder but that brown did not have an impairment that met the requirements of any listed impairments.he also found that brown subjective allegations were not borne out by the overall record and concluded that such allegations were not to be fully credible to the extent alleged.according to the alj,brown had the residual functional capacity rfc to perform activities at the level with no exertional limitations.the alj determined,based on the ve testimony,that brown could perform her past relevant work as an assembly worker and cashier because both jobs were categorized as light and either unskilled or.the alj ultimate conclusion was that brown was not disabled under the social security act.
in reaching his decision,the alj rejected conner opinion that brown was not able to return to work now or in the future.although he acknowledged that great weight must be given to this opinion by reason of the position as the claimant primary care physician,he noted that opinions or conclusions by a treating or examining physician that a claimant is unable to work or disabled are not binding because whether a given claimant meets the definition of disability rests by law with the alj who is charged with the duty of conducting an independent evaluation of the signs and symptoms which led the doctor to his conclusion.additionally,the alj rejected conner opinion because he is the claimant primary care physician and has not had specialized training in treating and diagnosing mental impairments like morgan,the claimant treating psychiatrist.furthermore,the alj found that conner opinion was contrary to morgan opinion.
brown filed a request for review,which the appeals council denied.thereafter,brown sought judicial review of the alj decision in district court.the district court concluded that the alj decision was supported by substantial evidence and affirmed the alj decision.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,brown argues that she is unable to work due to her long history of mental illness.she notes that she has been hospitalized on several occasions because of her illness,including a psychotic episode in june during which she exhibited a sudden onset of delusional,hallucinatory behavior.according to brown,her treating primary care provider,conner,opined that she is incapable of tolerating employment due to her inability to deal with the stress and anxiety in normal daily activity.brown maintains that the alj wrongly disregarded conner opinion and found that brown mental illness only limits her to work.specifically,brown acknowledges that the alj did not have to give conner opinion controlling weight but contends that he should have given the opinion some weight and found brown more significantly limited by her mental impairments.brown asserts that conner opinion should be afforded greater weight because it is based on his knowledge of brown diagnoses,his documentation of her history,her response to various medications that he prescribed,his observations during multiple visits with her,and her treatment at various mental health facilities.
in response,the government argues that the alj finding that brown was not disabled was within the purview of the act and consistent with regulatory criteria.the alj found that brown had the severe impairments of a depressive disorder and an anxiety disorder but that her impairments did not render her disabled.according to the government,substantial evidence supports the alj determination of brown rfc additionally,the alj correctly weighed the medical evidence,including the medical records and opinions from brown treating physician,conner,and brown treating psychiatrist,morgan.the government argues that the alj properly rejected conner statement that brown could not work because conner opined in an area reserved for the commissioner of the social security administration.and,the government contends that conner opinion conflicted with morgan treatment notes,conner own treatment notes,and with brown account of her of activities.
we review de novo a district court decision affirming the denial of social security benefits.we will affirm if the commissioner decision is supported by the substantial evidence on the record as a whole.substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.we consider both evidence that detracts from and evidence that supports the commissioner decision.if substantial evidence supports the decision,then we may not reverse,even if inconsistent conclusions may be drawn from the evidence,and even if we may have reached a different outcome.

we recognize that a treating physician opinion is generally entitled to substantial weight however,such an opinion does not automatically control in the face of other credible evidence on the record that detracts from that opinion.heino astrue,cir internal quotations and citation omitted.moreover,an alj may credit other medical evaluations over that of the treating physician when such other assessments are supported by better or more thorough medical evidence.id.at internal quotations and citations omitted.when deciding how much weight to give a treating physician opinion,an alj must also consider the length of the treatment relationship and the frequency of examinations.casey astrue,cir.when an alj discounts a treating physician opinion,he should give good reasons for doing so.davidson astrue,cir internal quotations and citation omitted.
here,the alj rejected conner opinion for three reasons conner opinion that brown is unable to work usurps an issue that is exclusively within the alj determination conner,as the primary care physician,does not have specialized training in treating and diagnosing mental impairments like morgan,the treating psychiatrist and conner opinion is contrary to morgan opinion.
conner opinion that brown is unable to work 
conner,brown primary care physician,opined that brown is not able to tolerate full time employment and is not able to return to work now or in the future.the alj rejected conner opinion,in part,based on his conclusion that he was not bound by a treating physician opinion on the ultimate a claimant is disabled.
here,t he alj correctly noted that the ultimate conclusion of whether brown could sustain gainful employment is a question for the commissioner.van vickle astrue,cir citing e stormo barnhart,cir t reating physicians opinions are not medical opinions that should be credited when they simply state that a claimant can not be gainfully employed,because they are merely opinions on the application of the statute,a task assigned solely to the discretion of the commissioner.quoting krogmeier barnhart,cir.a medical source opinion that an applicant is disabled or unable to work involves an issue reserved for the commissioner and therefore is not the type of medical opinion to which the commissioner gives controlling weight.ellis barnhart,cir citing stormo,at see also nelson sullivan,f d,cir although beaumier did state that in his opinion claimant could not be gainfully employed,such statements are not medical opinions but opinions on the application of the statute,a task assigned solely to the discretion of the secretary.
nevertheless,brown argues that the alj conclusion is at odds with this court decisions in cox barnhart,cir,and hatcher barnhart,cir.in cox,we concluded that the alj improperly discounted the opinion of the claimant treating physician when he found that the physician opinion was conclusory and invaded the province of the commissioner.cox,at.we noted that none of the alj reasons for discounting the physician opinion were valid justifications for stripping the physician opinion of all its weight.id.in that case,the physician opined that the claimant was not able to be gainfully employed at that time.id.at.we acknowledged that the alj was correct in stating that conclusory statements by a doctor,if unsupported by the medical record,do not bind the alj in his disability determination and that if the physician letter were the only available record from the physician,then the alj would have been correct in giving it little weight due to its conclusory nature.id.at.but the letter was only one part of a larger medical record supplied by the physician and the claimant other treating physicians.id.at.according to the court,v iewed in context of her medical record,the physician letter is a culmination of the numerous visits the claimant had with her past doctors,and his experience with treating her chronic pain.see also hatcher,at the instant matter is almost indistinguishable from cox.here,as in cox,the treating physician opined that the claimant was unable to work.as in cox,all of the treatment notes support the claimant complaints and her claimed limitations.as in cox,there is nothing in the record that contradicts the claimant physician opinion aside from the opinion of the expert.
but cox and hatcher are distinguishable from the present case because the larger medical record does not support conner conclusory opinion.here,conner opined on august,that brown was unable to work even though he had not been the primary doctor treating her for her anxiety since her entry into lakeside in june.although conner did see brown in july,it was a appointment following her discharge from lakeside in which conner actually denied that brown had any significant anxiety.specifically,he noted that brown had no significant anxiety and no obvious psychotic behavior.he found her much improved.additionally,even though brown saw conner periodically from august to november,she was seeing him for medical conditions unrelated to anxiety,depression,or psychosis.
conner lack of specialization in treating and diagnosing mental illness 
the alj second reason for discounting conner opinion was that conner is the claimant primary care physician and has not had specialized training in treating and diagnosing mental impairments like morgan,the claimant treating psychiatrist.
greater weight is generally given to the opinion of a specialist about medical issues in the area of specialty,than to the opinion of a.thomas barnhart,app x,cir unpublished per curiam citing cfr d d hinchey shalala,cir see also qualls apfel,cir more importantly,although a treating physician opinion is considered to be significant,specialists opinions are generally afforded more weight.
in hinchey,the claimant argued that the alj should have given more credit to her family practitioner,who was more familiar with her conditions,instead of giving greater weight to the opinion of a specialist in cardiology.at.we rejected the claimant argument,explaining 
given the fact that,at a minimum,the cardiologist is at least one of two treating physicians,the court committed no error in giving greater weight to his expertise.the secretary regulations for evaluating medical opinions specify,we generally give greater weight to the opinion of a specialist about medical issues related to his or her area of specialty than to the opinion of a source who is not a specialist.d.we conclude that the alj committed no error in giving greater weight to the opinions of the cardiologist as the treating specialist in this case.
