background 
in,at age,rush began taking prescribed estrogen products manufactured by wyeth for symptoms related to menopause.rush physician,cynthia frazier frazier,prescribed hrt for the treatment of vaginal atrophy.before beginning the therapy,frazier discussed with rush the benefits and risks of the medications.
in,an abnormality was discovered in rush breast.at that time,frazier discussed with rush the association between breast cancer and hrt and that rush may want to stop hormones.after another breast abnormality was found the next year,rush stopped the hrt treatment for eight months before deciding to resume hrt.
rush took the product premarin until,when her new gynecologist,karen kozlowski kozlowski,switched rush to prempro.kozlowski told rush with hrt there was a slight risk of cancer.rush took these drugs for nearly ten years until,in june,she was diagnosed with breast cancer.
rush relied solely on her doctors advice in deciding to take hrt.rush did not rely on any product advertisements.rush did receive patient information sheets with her monthly premarin and prempro prescriptions.these information sheets explicitly warned that some studies suggested breast cancer was a possible danger or risk of the medications if taken for prolonged periods of time and especially if higher doses are used.while rush admits receiving the information sheets,she denies ever reading them.
during the entire time rush was taking premarin and prempro,and continuing to this day,these drugs were approved by the federal drug administration fda as safe and effective.before the fda approved prempro,the fda specified the wording and placement of breast cancer warnings on the product labeling.
on march,rush filed her lawsuit alleging wyeth hormone drugs caused her breast cancer.the case filing was nearly six years after rush was diagnosed with breast cancer.
ii.discussion 
jury instructions 
jury instructions are reviewed for abuse of discretion.slidell,millennium inorganic,cir.we afford the district court broad discretion in choosing the form and language of the instructions and will reverse a jury verdict only if the erroneous instruction affected a party substantial rights.id.o ur review is limited to a determination of whether the instructions,taken as a whole and viewed in the light of the evidence and applicable law,fairly and accurately submitted the issues to the jury.id.
assumption of ordinary care instruction 
arkansas model jury instruction ami states,every person using ordinary care has a right to assume,until the contrary is or reasonably should be apparent,that every other person will use ordinary care.to act on that assumption is not negligence.rush asserts the district court erred in giving this instruction because only a never a assume that others will use ordinary care based upon the arkansas supreme court interpretation in england costa,generally speaking,when the instruction is utilized in a contributory negligence case,the phrase every person in the instruction is intended to refer to the plaintiff.
wyeth counters that justice imber concurring opinion in england specified t he instruction is not limited to plaintiffs alleging negligence against defendants.id.at imber,concurring.further,wyeth notes the ami commentary states,england held that ami should only be given where there is evidence of negligence on the part of a party claiming damages.model jury,civil ami cmt.
wyeth asserts evidence of rush negligence was presented,thereby rendering this instruction proper.specifically,wyeth asserts rush admission,that she never read the warnings wyeth included with each prescription,was evidence of negligence.furthermore,reading england to restrict the instruction only to a case where a plaintiff is alleging contributory negligence may be overly restrictive.in any event,england does not apply directly to the facts of this case and is not controlling.
even if giving the assumption of ordinary care instruction was erroneous under england logic,this instruction did not affect rush substantial rights.the instruction did not direct the jury to find wyeth was not negligent if rush did not read the warnings.instead,the instruction only explained wyeth was not negligent in assuming rush would read the warnings.the jury could still have found wyeth negligent and wyeth warnings were inadequate.thus,assuming this instruction was given in error,the instruction was not unfairly prejudicial and any error was harmless.the district court decision to include this instruction was not an abuse of discretion.
failure to warn instruction 
rush challenges instruction,regarding the failure to warn,because this instruction directed the jury that it must find for wyeth if the jury found rush was aware of the dangers posed by using premarin with progestin or prempro before rush breast cancer diagnosis.in an action for negligent failure to warn,this court has held,if a user is already aware of the dangers,the lack of warning is not the proximate cause of the injury.crook kaneb pipe line operating,cir.as such,the focus is on whether or not rush was aware of the dangers posed by the wyeth drugs,premarin with progestin and prempro.
arkansas recognizes the existence of the learned intermediary doctrine.see hill searle,cir.under this doctrine,a physician acts as a learned intermediary between a pharmaceutical manufacturer and the physician patient.as such,a warning to the physician is deemed a warning to the patient.ehlis shire richwood,cir internal brackets omitted.a dequate warnings to prescribing physicians obviate the need for manufacturers of prescription products to warn ultimate consumers directly.id.
while the learned intermediary doctrine provides that adequate warning to a patient physician can suffice to defeat a patient failure to warn claim,this doctrine does not preclude informing a patient directly.i f a user is already aware of the dangers,the lack of warning is not the proximate cause of the injury.crook,at.the goal is to assure either the patient or the patient physician,as a proxy for the patient,is aware of the dangers.if the patient is independently aware of the dangers,then a failure of the manufacturer to warn adequately of the danger is irrelevant.
the district court instruction accurately reflects arkansas law and did not prejudice rush.rush assertion,that this portion of the law created a total bar to recovery under the doctrines of assumption of risk and contributory negligence,is incorrect.rush claim is a negligence claim based upon wyeth failure to warn.the district court jury instruction accurately reflected arkansas law because the jury was only directed to find for wyeth if the jury determined rush was aware of the dangers before her diagnosis with breast cancer.the trial court did not abuse its discretion.
failure to instruct on fraud 
wyeth moved for summary judgment on rush fraud claim,which the d
