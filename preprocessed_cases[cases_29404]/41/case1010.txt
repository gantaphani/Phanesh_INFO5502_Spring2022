the state of tennessee state appeals the district court denial of its motion under federal rule of civil procedure rule b.the sole issue on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion when it refused to vacate all outstanding court orders and consent decrees granting injunctive relief injunctive relief.this injunctive relief arises from the district court original ruling that the state was violating the substantive due process rights of mentally retarded mr residents at arlington development center adc,a home for mr individuals.the state argues that this injunctive relief,which has remained in place for over a decade,should be lifted because a significant change in law has occurred since the original judgment.the united states department of justice civil rights division united states and people first of tennessee people first,a certified class of mr adults that benefits from the injunctive relief,oppose the state request.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
the united states brought this suit against the state and some of its officials in january,pursuant to the civil rights of institutionalized persons act.the complaint alleged,among other things,that the state failed to ensure that adc residents received adequate medical care,were free from neglect and abuse,and were not subject to undue bodily restraint.in support of its complaint,the united states argued that the state was violating the substantive due process rights of the mr residents at adc,as established by the supreme court in youngberg romeo.in youngberg,the mother of an involuntarily institutionalized mr man held at a institution brought suit against the state on her son behalf.id.at.she contended that the state owed her son substantive due process rights under the fourteenth amendment because of his involuntary confinement.id.the court agreed and stated that when an individual is involuntarily institutionalized through state legal proceedings,he has a substantive due process right to adequate food,shelter,clothing,and medical care,as well as reasonable safety,freedom from unnecessary bodily restraint,and reasonable habilitation youngberg rights.id.at.the united states argued that sufficient state action existed at adc to trigger these youngberg rights.the united states noted that the state ultimately decided to accept an mr individual into its care,adc was a facility,tennessee law limited the circumstances under which a resident could be discharged from the facility,and the state controlled virtually every aspect of the lives of adc residents once admitted.
in march,the state moved to dismiss the complaint.the state argued that the supreme court decision in deshaney winnebago county department of social services,stood for the proposition that the state did not owe youngberg rights to adc residents.in deshaney,the mother of a boy who was rendered profoundly retarded by his father beatings brought suit on the boy behalf against social workers and other local officials who knew that he was at risk of injury by his father but did nothing.id.at.even though the boy was not in state custody at the time of his abuse,he claimed that the government officials failure to affirmatively act to protect him from his father deprived him of his due process clause right to liberty.id.the court disagreed and held that youngberg rights did not exist in this circumstance.id.at.it reasoned 
in the substantive due process analysis,it is the state affirmative act of restraining the individual freedom to act on his own incarceration,institutionalization,or other similar restraint of personal is the deprivation of liberty triggering the protections of the due process clause,not its failure to act to protect his liberty interests against harms inflicted by other means.
id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court limited its holding in youngberg to stand only for the proposition that when the state takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will,the constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and general.id.at.
the state argued that,in accordance with deshaney,youngberg did not apply because residents were not at adc due to affirmative acts by the state.it reasoned that,with rare exception,parents or other legal representatives placed residents at adc.similarly,the state maintained that it did not engage in state action to involuntarily keep adc residents at the facility because these same parents or other legal representatives could remove a resident at any time.
the district court denied the state motion to dismiss in august.united states tennessee.the district court discussed youngberg and deshaney in detail and determined that under certain circumstances the state has a duty to provide services and care to institutionalized individuals,such as when a person is wholly dependent on the state.id.at.despite the fact that parents or other legal guardians voluntarily placed most adc residents into the state care,the court determined that the united states had alleged enough state action at adc to implicate youngberg rights.id.at.it noted that the state had accepted adc residents into its care and thus accepted responsibility for their needs.id.the district court emphasized ann,which mandated that,once admitted to adc,a resident was under the exclusive care,custody and control of the commissioner and superintendent.id.the district court further noted ann.b,which suggested that the superintendent had discretion to deny a resident discharge request.id.at.lastly,the court underscored that state actors controlled every aspect of residents daily life,including treatment,care,and movement in and out of adc.id.at.
in may,tennessee repealed ann.and amended its laws to make clear that the superintendent was required to discharge any individual within twelve hours upon request however,a person lacking capacity still needed a parent or other legal guardian to make this request.see ann.in july,the state filed a second motion to dismiss based upon,among other things,these changes to tennessee law.nevertheless,after a bench trial on the merits that began in august,the district court issued an oral opinion in november,held the state liable for violating adc residents youngberg rights,and ordered the state,in cooperation with the united states,to submit a plan to remedy the constitutional violations at adc.the court issued supplemental findings of fact in february,where it more specifically identified which conditions at adc violated residents youngberg rights.these conditions included,inter alia,substandard training of staff,deficient supervision of residents who posed dangers to themselves and others,inadequate medical care and related health services,inadequate habilitation and psychological services,and improper feeding practices.the court found that these failures had led to thousands of injuries over the years.
in august,the parties submitted a comprehensive stipulated remedial order to address the concerns raised in the district court opinion.the remedial order included more than one hundred requirements that pertained to how the state would operate adc in a constitutionally acceptable manner and a schedule for meeting these new requirements.the order included a plan to reduce the population of adc by transitioning some current residents to arranged community living,an agreement to cease new admissions at adc without court approval,a guarantee to provide some services to former adc residents,and new staffing and services requirements.the order also stated that a monitor would oversee the state compliance with the remedial plan.in september,the district court approved the remedial order.the district court entered judgment in favor of the united states in august.the state did not appeal this judgment.
during this time period,another case with similar allegations proceeded against the state.people first filed that suit in december and,in january,the parent guardian association of arlington development center pga intervened.in september,the district court extended its liability finding and remedial order in this case to that parallel case.the district court also permitted people first and pga to intervene in this case.furthermore,the district court approved a plaintiff class in this case defined as individuals who had resided,were residing,or were at risk of residing at adc,and it appointed people first as class representative.pga appealed the district court class certification decision,and the sixth circuit affirmed the creation of this plaintiff class and the district court designation of people first as class representative.people first of arlington developmental,table,wl,at cir per curiam.
also in,the district court held the state in contempt for failure to comply with the remedial order.in the ensuing years,litigation between the parties has resulted in multiple findings of contempt,additional plans of corrections,settlement agreements,and consent orders.the injunctive relief has endured throughout this time.in its current form,the injunctive relief oversees benefits for a plaintiff class that encompasses approximately individuals,most of which do not live at adc.the injunctive relief guarantees class members comprehensive daily care in matters such as health,safety,and nutrition.it mandates funding for programs such as a healthcare program,a housing subsidy,a transportation subsidy,dental benefits,vision benefits,and advocacy services.a monitor continues to oversee the injunctive relief.the state maintains that the injunctive relief causes it to spend around a year more than it would if it treated the class members like other similarly situated mr persons in tennessee.
in september,the state filed this rule b motion and asked the district court to vacate the injunctive relief and dismiss the case.in support of its motion,the state argued that continuing the injunctive relief was inequitable because of changes in law that now made clear that the mr residents at adc were not entitled to youngberg rights because these residents resided voluntarily in the state care.the state noted that,since,tennessee had amended its laws to guarantee discharge from a institution upon request.it further pointed to this court unpublished decision in higgs latham,table,wl cir per curiam,and decisions from our sister circuits that it argued supported its argument.the united states,people first,and pga opposed this motion 
the district court held that the state had failed to establish the existence of a significant change in law and denied the motion.united states tennessee,at.the court acknowledged that,in some other circuits,the determination of whether an individual is entitled to youngberg rights depends upon the method of the mr adult confinement.id.at.nevertheless,it determined that adc residents remained involuntarily committed because,although tennessee had amended its laws to guarantee discharge at the request of a resident with capacity,the mr residents at adc still depended upon the request of a parent or other legal representative to be discharged.id.at.in support of this conclusion,the court cited doe austin,cir,to hold that the law of this circuit remained that mr residents of facilities are involuntarily committed into the state care as a matter of law when another person instigated the commitment on behalf of the mr individual.id.at.the court also rejected the state contention that this court unpublished decision in higgs,which predated the original judgment in this case,could satisfy the requirement of showing a significant change in law simply because,according to the state,this circuit rules regarding unpublished opinions had changed since the refusal to dismiss the complaint.id.at.lastly,the district court held that the injunctive relief should remain in force even if adc residents voluntarily resided in state custody because they still retained certain substantive due process rights,such as freedom from undue restraint and physical abuse,that justified continuing the injunctive relief.id.at.the state appeals.
ii.legal standard 
federal rule of civil procedure b allows a court to grant relief from a final judgment when applying it prospectively is no longer equitable.b.we review a denial of a rule b motion for abuse of discretion.brown.dep t of fin,cir.a court abuses its discretion when it commits a clear error of judgment,such as applying the incorrect legal standard,misapplying the correct legal standard,or relying upon clearly erroneous findings of fact.in re ferro.derivative,cir.the supreme court has noted that i t is true that the trial court has discretion,but the exercise of discretion can not be permitted to stand if we find it rests upon a legal principle that can no longer be sustained.agostini felton.
the supreme court recently addressed how courts should approach rule b motions in the context of institutional reform litigation in horne flores.the court noted that federal encroachment upon states rights is more likely to occur in institutional reform litigation and determined that courts must take a flexible approach to rule b motions addressing such decrees.id.at quoting rufo inmates of suffolk county jail.specifically,the horne court directed courts not to focus on a party failure to appeal when considering a motion under rule b in institutional reform litigation.id.at.instead,courts must conduct 
the type of rule b inquiry prescribed in rufo.this inquiry makes no reference to the presence or absence of a timely appeal.it takes the original judgment as a given and asks only whether a significant change either in factual conditions or in law renders continued enforcement of the judgment detrimental to the public interest.
id.at quoting rufo,at see generally sweeton brown,cir en banc neither the doctrines of res judicata or waiver nor a proper respect for previously entered judgments requires that old injunctions remain in effect when the old law on which they were based has changed.
accordingly,despite the state failure to appeal the original judgment entered by the district court,we now employ a rufo analysis.we take the original judgment as a given,and,because the state does not argue that a subsequent change in factual conditions has occurred,we determine whether a significant change in law has occurred since the original judgment.the state bears the initial burden of showing a significant change in law because it is the party seeking modification.rufo,at see also brown,at noting some subsequent changes in decisional law and stating that the remaining question is whether tennessee has carried its burden of proof.to meet this burden,the state must put forward new court decisions or statutes that make legal what once had been illegal.associated builders contractors.dep t of labor econ.growth,cir.generally,for a new court decision to make legal what was once illegal,it must be a subsequent published decision of the sixth circuit or a decision from the united states supreme court.see,doe briley,cir affirming district court order vacating injunctive relief where the constitutional claim upon which the initial decree was based was utterly indistinguishable from the claim rejected by the supreme court in an intervening case,and brown,at cir applying rufo and citing an intervening published sixth circuit decision to vacate the relevant part of a settlement.
the state employs several arguments in an attempt to convince this court that a significant change in law has occurred.we consider each argument in turn.
iii.analysis 
many of the state arguments focus on the supreme court decision in deshaney and its as the state arguments did in its march motion to dismiss.we begin by noting that deshaney,decided in and discussed and distinguished at length in the district court august ruling on the motion to dismiss,is not a new court decision.associated builders,at.as a result,deshaney can not satisfy the state initial burden under rufo.
for the same reason,our unpublished opinion in higgs does not help the state.in higgs,a mentally ill patient,admitted into a mental hospital and subsequently sexually assaulted by another patient,unsuccessfully sued the state for violating her substantive due process rights.higgs,wl,at.applying deshaney,we held tha
