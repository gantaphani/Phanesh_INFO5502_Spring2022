employee health plan trust trust is a voluntary employees beneficiary association under c.as such,much of its income is,although a e imposes limits on the amount of income the trust can receive from its investments.this case requires us to determine whether investment income that a voluntary employees beneficiary association has spent on reasonable costs of administration during a year counts against the a e limit.the tax court found against the trust and ruled that its tax payment had been deficient.we hold that the limit contained in a e applies only to those assets accumulated but not spent during the course of the year,and we reverse the tax court.
background 
statutory background 
the trust is a voluntary employees beneficiary association,or veba,that was established in to fund the health care benefits provided to the company employees,retired employees,and their families.during the years at issue in this case,the trust had over participants.it has been recognized as a veba under c since.like universities that sponsor credit cards or charities that sell their mailing lists to supplement their income,the trust engages in certain activities that are not themselves directly related to its mission of providing health care benefits.see,rita marie cain,marketing activities in the lessons regarding tax implications,am.bus,see also marilyn phelan,nonprofit enterprises corporations,trusts,and associations,at describing nonprofit organizations increasing use of businesses to supplement income.
as a veba recognized under c,the trust is generally exempt from the federal income tax.a.however,recognizing that some entities exempt from the income tax under c had undertaken more activities that brought them into direct competition with,enterprises,congress in provided that c exempt organizations would be taxed on certain income that was unrelated to the purpose constituting the basis of the organization exemption.see jacob mertens,the law of federal income taxation.this tax on unrelated business taxable income is codified at a,and the term unrelated business taxable income,or ubti,is defined in.
generally speaking,a veba ubti is calculated by taking its gross income and subtracting any allowable deductions,excluding from all calculations any exempt function income.a a.exempt function income is that income on which the organization is not taxed,in accord with the organization c exemption.for purposes of this case,exempt function income is defined as follows 
t he term exempt function income means the gross income from dues,fees,charges,or similar amounts paid by members of the organization as consideration for providing such members or their dependents or guests goods,facilities,or services in furtherance of the purposes constituting the basis for the exemption of the organization to which such income is paid.such term also means all income other than an amount equal to the gross income derived from any unrelated trade or business regularly carried on by such organization computed as if the organization were subject to paragraph,which is set aside 
i for a purpose specified in section c,or 
ii in the case of an organization described in paragraph of section c,to provide for the payment of life,sick,accident,or other benefits,
including reasonable costs of administration directly connected with a purpose described in clause i or ii.if during the taxable year,an amount which is attributable to income so set aside is used for a purpose other than that described in clause i or ii,such amount shall be included,under subparagraph a,in unrelated business taxable income for the taxable year.
id.a b.in other words,a c organization must pay tax on its gross income unless that income qualifies as exempt function income.exempt function income is commonly classified as being of two types member income,which consists of income from members and is described in the first sentence of a b,and passive income,which generally consists of investment income and qualifies as exempt function income only if it is set aside for the purposes of charitable gifts,see id.c,for the payment of benefits,or for administrative costs related to such purposes.see id.a b.
concerned that vebas were using this set aside provision to accumulate income in an amount that far exceeded the quantities the vebas actually needed in order to provide benefits,in congress imposed a limit on the amount of certain income that a veba could set aside under a b.see staff of the joint committee on taxation,general explanation of the revenue provisions of the deficit reduction act of joint comm.print the congress believed that there should be reasonable limits on the extent to which a entity,such as a voluntary employees beneficiary association veba could accumulate income on a basis.the limit is codified at a e as follows 
e limitation on amount of setaside in the case of organizations described in paragraph,or of section c.
i in the case of any organization described in paragraph of section c,a for any purpose specified in clause ii of subparagraph b may be taken into account under subparagraph b only to the extent that such does not result in an amount of assets set aside for such purpose in excess of the account limit determined under section without regard to subsection f thereof for the taxable year not taking into account any reserve described in section c a for medical benefits.
a e.the limit on is thus determined by reference to,which provides as follows 
c account purposes of this section 
in as otherwise provided in this subsection,the account limit for any qualified asset account for any taxable year is the amount reasonably and actuarially necessary to fund 
a claims incurred but unpaid as of the close of such taxable year for benefits referred to in subsection a and 
b administrative costs with respect to such claims.
additional reserve for medical and life insurance account limit for any taxable year may include a reserve funded over the working lives of the covered employees and actuarially determined on a level basis using assumptions that are reasonable in the aggregate as necessary for 
a medical benefits to be provided to covered employees determined on the basis of current medical costs 
id.c.this case requires us to determine whether passive income that the trust set aside and actually spent on administrative costs during the year counts against a e limit.if a e limit applies only to income that is accumulated and remains in the fund at the close of the year,then the trust is well within its limitation on income,and the income at issue here is exempt function income.
b.the present case 
following an audit,the commissioner determined that the trust had underreported its unrelated business taxable income for the years and.specifically,the commissioner determined that the trust had improperly deducted in administrative costs for and in administrative costs for based on those calculations,the commissioner filed a notice of deficiency alleging that the trust owed in taxes for and for.the trust filed a petition in the tax court to challenge the determination.
before the tax court,the trust did not argue that the administrative costs were deductible,but instead argued that the income used to pay for those costs was exempt function income and thus.that is,the trust claimed that the administrative costs were paid for using investment income that the trust had set aside to pay for administrative costs connected to the payment of benefits,and that the income was thus exempt under a b.the parties agreed that the trust had incurred and spent from and from on administrative costs connected to the provision of benefits they asked the tax court to determine whether the investment income the trust had set aside and spent to pay those costs counted against the limit in a e.
the tax court held that the limit in a e applies to all income set aside for the administrative costs of the provision of health benefits,whether or not the funds were actually spent.see.employee health plan trust comm r,wl.the tax court focused primarily on the trust argument that a e limits only income set aside under a b ii,which
