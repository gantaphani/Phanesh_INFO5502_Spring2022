physicians healthsource appeals from judge underhill dismissal of its class action complaint asserting violations of the telephone consumer protection act of,as amended by the junk fax protection act of,the tcpa.the complaint alleges that appellees collectively boehringer sent an unsolicited fax invitation for a free dinner meeting to discuss ailments relating to appellees business.according to appellant,this fax constituted an unsolicited advertisement prohibited by the tcpa.
judge underhill dismissed appellant complaint for failure to state a claim holding that no facts were pled that plausibly showed that the fax had a commercial purpose.while we agree that a fax must have a commercial purpose to be an unsolicited advertisement,we hold that the district court improperly dismissed appellant complaint.where it is alleged that a firm sent an unsolicited fax promoting a free event discussing a subject related to the firm business,the complaint is sufficient to state a claim.
we therefore vacate and remand.
background 
in reviewing a fed.civ.b dismissal of a complaint,we accept all factual allegations as true,drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.see chambers time warner,cir.
the complaint alleges that,on april,boehringer,a pharmaceutical company,sent an unsolicited fax to appellant,inviting one of appellant doctors to a free dinner meeting and discussion entitled,it time to talk recognizing female sexual dysfunction fsd and diagnosing hypoactive sexual desire disorder hsdd.app x at.the invitation stated that 
boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals,cordially invites you to join us for a dinner meeting entitled,it time to talk recognizing female sexual dysfunction and diagnosing hypoactive sexual desire disorder.based on recent data from a large us study preside,of us women aged years have experienced a sexual problem in their lives and of the same group of women have experienced decreased sexual desire with distress.this program has been developed to discuss female sexual dysfunction fsd,including hypoactive sexual desire disorder hsdd including pathophysiology models,epidemiology,and diagnosis.we hope you will join us for this informative and stimulating program.
id.the fax provided registration details and revealed that the speaker at the dinner meeting would be david portman.
on march,appellant filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of more than forty individuals against boehringer,alleging that the fax violated the tcpa as an unsolicited advertisement without a proper notice.id.at.according to the complaint,the fax was an unsolicited advertisement because it promote d the services and goods of boehringer.id.appellant sought an award of statutory damages in the minimum amount of for each violation of the tcpa,and to have such damages trebled.appellant also requested injunctive relief to enjoin boehringer from sending similar faxes in the future.
boehringer moved to dismiss,arguing that appellant failed to state a claim under the tcpa because the unsolicited fax was not an advertisement.in its motion to dismiss,boehringer asked the district court to take judicial notice of public records of the food and drug administration fda a request that was unopposed and that the court granted.these records showed that,at the time it faxed appellant,boehringer had submitted for approval by the fda to market a drug named flibanserin.the drug was intended to treat hsdd.because flibanserin had yet to be approved by the fda,boehringer was forbidden to promote it.see a prohibiting,inter alia,pharmaceutical companies from promoting drugs not yet approved by the fda.
the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim under fed.civ.b.physicians healthsource,boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals,sru,wl,at.the court interpreted federal communications commission fcc regulations as requir ing plaintiffs to show that an unsolicited fax has a commercial pretext for it to violate the tcpa.id.at.the court determined that n othing in the f ax indicates that the dinner was a pretext for pitching a boehringer product or service.id.at.the court noted that,e ven drawing the inference that boehringer sponsored the dinner in order to inform potential future prescribers of flibanserin about the existence and nature of hsdd,the hypothetical future economic benefit that the boehringer defendants might receive someday does not transform the f ax into an advertisement.id.
discussion 
as noted,we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to rule b.see chambers,at.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly.as the supreme court has stated,
a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.the plausibility standard is not akin to a probability requirement,but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant liability,it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.
ashcroft iqbal,citations omitted quoting twombly,at.
under the tcpa,it is unlawful for any person within the united states to send a fax that is an unsolicited advertisement unless,inter alia,the fax has an notice meeting certain requirements.b c.the act creates a private right of action,providing for statutory damages in the amount of for each violation as well as injunctive relief against future violations.b.
the parties do not dispute that boehringer fax lacked any notice,and the question is,therefore,whether it was an unsolicited advertisement.the act defines unsolicited advertisement as any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property,goods,or services which is transmitted to any person without that person prior express invitation or permission,in writing or otherwise.a.exercising its delegated rulemaking authority over the tcpa pursuant to b,the fcc has promulgated a rule elaborating on the act definition of unsolicited advertisement.rules and regulations implementing the.consumer prot.act of junk fax prevention act of,fed.reg,may,the rule.the rule states,in relevant part,that 
facsimile messages that promote goods or services even at no cost,such as free magazine subscriptions,catalogs,or free consultations or seminars,are unsolicited advertisements under the tcpa definition.in many instances,free seminars serve as a pretext to advertise commercial products and services.similarly,free publications are often part of an overall marketing campaign to sell property,goods,or services.for instance,while the publication itself may be offered at no cost to the facsimile recipient,the products promoted within the publication are often commercially available.based on this,it is reasonable to presume that such messages describe the quality of any property,goods,or services.therefore,facsimile communications regarding such free goods and services,if not purely transactional,would require the sender to obtain the recipient permission beforehand,in the absence of an established business relationship.
id.the rule itself comports with the statutory language,which defines offending advertisements as those promoting the commercial availability or quality of the firm property,goods,or services.a.
the district court interpreted the rule as requir ing plaintiffs to show that the fax has a commercial pretext,that the defendant advertised,or planned to advertise,its products or services at the seminar.physicians healthsource,wl,at quoting bais yaakov of spring valley richmond,the am.int l in london,cs,wl,at.we do not disagree.but,at the pleading stage,where it is alleged that a firm sent an unsolicited fax promoting a free seminar discussing a subject that relates to the firm products or services,there is a plausible conclusion that the fax had the commercial purpose of promoting those products or services.businesses are always eager to promote their wares and usually do not fund presentations for no business purpose.the defendant can rebut such an inference by showing that it did not or would not advertise its products or services at the seminar,but only after discovery.this interpretation comports with the rule.in interpreting an administrative regulation,as in interpreting a statute,we must begin by examining the language of the provision at issue.resnik swartz,cir.the rule states that it is reasonable to presume that such messages advertising free seminars describe the quality of any property,goods,or services,potentially violating the tcpa.rule,fed.reg.at quoting a.
of course,as other courts have ruled not every unsolicited fax promoting a free seminar satisfies the rule.there must be a commercial nexus to a firm business,its property,products,or services that,in our view,is satisfied at the pleading stage where facts are alleged that the subject of the free seminar relates to that business.the rule does not aim at faxes promoting free seminars per se but states only that,i n many instances,free seminars serve as a pretext to advertise commercial products and services.rule,fed.reg.at m essages that promote goods and services even at no cost,such as free seminars,are unsolicited advertisements under the tcpa definition.in a different but relevant context,the rule states that a trade organization newsletter sent via facsimile would not constitute an unsolicited advertisement,so long as the newsletter primary purpose is informational,rather than to promote commercial products.id.
requiring plaintiffs to plead specific facts alleging that specific products or services would be,or were,promoted at the free seminar would impede the purposes of the tcpa.see gager dell fin,llc,cir.because the tcpa is a remedial statute,it should be construed to benefit consumers.physicians healthsource,alma lasers,c,wl,at,congress enacted the tcpa to prevent the shifting of advertising costs to recipients of unsolicited fax advertisements.citing,at,at,reprinted in,u nsolicited calls placed to fax machines,and cellular or paging telephone numbers often impose a cost on the called party fax messages require the called party to pay for the paper used.and unless plaintiffs actually attended the free seminar in many cases it will be difficult for plaintiffs to know whether it was in fact used to advertise a defendant products or services.see arista records,llc doe,cir.the twombly plausibility standard,which applies to all civil actions does not prevent a plaintiff from pleading facts alleged upon information and belief where the facts are peculiarly within the possession and control of the defendant.internal quotation marks omitted.
two fanciful examples illustrate the distinction.if a complaint alleged that the handy widget company funded a professorship at a local law school in the name of its deceased founder and faxed invitations on its letterhead to an inaugural lecture entitled the relevance of greek philosophers to deconstructionism,the complaint would not state a claim under the tcpa because the handy widget company is not in the business of philosophical musings.in contrast,if the handy widget company faxed invitations to a free seminar on increasing widgets usefulness and productivity,a claim under the tcpa would be validly alleged.of course,the handy widget company could rebut at the summary judgment stage with evidence showing that it did not feature its products or services at the seminar.
boehringer fax advertised a dinner meeting to discuss two medical conditions female sexual dysfunction fsd and hypoactive sexual desire disorder hsdd and their pathophysiology models,epidemiology,and diagnosis.app x at.as a pharmaceutical company,boehringer was generally in the business of treating diseases and medical conditions,such as fsd and hsdd.moreover,the fax makes clear to the invitee that the dinner meeting was sponsored by boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals,id.the fax invitation was sent to a doctor,whom boehringer would presumably hope to persuade to prescribe its drugs to patients.therefore,facts were alleged that boehringer fax advertised a free seminar relating to its business.
in addition,boehringer seeking approval from the fda for the marketing of flibanserin is relevant,although not dispositive.although not approved,the drug is intended as a remedy for the ailments to be discussed at the event.to be sure,boehringer was prohibited from,inter alia,promoting an unapproved drug,a,but that prohibition is not necessarily inconsistent with the free dinner mentioning the possible future availability of the drug.nothing in the statute or rule limits their scope to the advertisement of products or services then available.
in defense,boehringer can present,inter alia,testimony of the dinner meeting participants as well as provide the meeting agenda,transcript,presentation slides,speaker list,or any internal emails or correspondences discussing the meeting.see physicians healthsource,stryker sales,supp,holding that the tcpa text does not require a court to put on evidentiary blinders in deciding whether a particular fax amounts to an advertisement and allowing parties to present evidence beyond the four corners of the fax such as presentation slides to determine if a fax promoting a free seminar was pretextual.it is also possible that boehringer used the seminar to advertise other drugs or services in its inventory which would certainly support finding a violation of the tcpa.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i concur in my colleagues opinion.i agree fully that the complaint plausibly states a claim under b c and a,as elucidated by the rule promulgated by the federal communications commission fcc or the commission,fed.reg,may.
i write separately,however,speaking for myself alone,and speaking only to state courts and federal courts outside this circuit,to air a somewhat different possible understanding of the rule,which,while supporting the same conclusion as to the sufficiency of the complaint,may better reflect the text of the commission rule.
the complaint alleges that the defendant,boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals,sent an unsolicited fax message without the required notice to the plaintiff,physicians healthsource,as well as to other doctors the fax message invited jose martinez apparently one of the doctors of physicians healthsource to a free dinner and lecture sponsored by the defendant,at which david portman,would discuss female sexual dysfunction fsd and hypoactive sexual desire disorder hsdd at the defendant request,in deciding the motions to dismiss the complaint,the court took judicial notice of records of the food and drug administration fda showing that the defendant had submitted an application for the fda approval to market a new drug flibanserin for the treatment of hsdd,the condition that was to be the subject of the free lecture.
the defendant argued in the district court that because its fax transmission consisted of an invitation to a free dinner and lecture,and did not on its face make any suggestion of a commercial nature or refer in any way to flibanserin,it did not come within the statute definition of an unsolicited advertisement material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property,goods,or services.a.the plaintiff countered that the fcc rule made clear,for purposes of the statute,that an unsolicited facsimile message promoting free goods and services is an unsolicited advertisement.the plaintiff argued further that,given the defendant pending application for fda approval to market a drug for the treatment of hsdd,and the allegation of an invitation addressed to doctors to hear a medical lecture about hsdd,the complaint plausibly alleged an overall marketing campaign and commercial purpose to get the doctors to prescribe the defendant drug to patients suffering from hsdd,once the defendant obtained fda approval for the drug.the district court accepted the defendant arguments and dismissed the complaint.
the majority opinion reverses the district court dismissal of the complaint,essentially adopting the plaintiff fallback argument that,in view of the defendant intention to market a drug for the treatment of hsdd,its offer of a free seminar for doctors discussing hsdd is plausibly alleged to be a commercially motivated advertisement of its product.on the other hand,the majority opinion rejects the plaintiff argument that the fcc rule treats this offer of a free seminar per se as an advertisement of the commercial availability of a product.it reasons that the fax offering free goods or services would constitute an advertisement only if the offer of the free seminar turned out to be a pretext or prelude for a commercial promotion,and asserts that the defendant can rebut such an inference of intent to promote a commercial product by showing after discovery that it did not or would not advertise its products or services at the seminar.although recognizing that b usinesses are always eager to promote their wares and usually do not fund presentations for no business purpose,the opinion asserts that,if the defendant can show after discovery that at the free dinner and seminar no reference whatsoever was made to the defendant drug for treatment of hsdd or any other products or services it offered,the defendant would prevail in the litigation.id.at.
i agree fully with the majority conclusion that the complaint,as supplemented by the information about the defendant commercial product that the defendant added to the record on the motion to dismiss,plausibly supports an intention on the part of the defendant to foster future sales of its drug.it seems obvious that,when a pharmaceutical company,which is preparing to market a drug for the treatment of hsdd,invites doctors to a free dinner and lecture on hsdd,the objective of the event is to get doctors to eventually prescribe the company drug to their patients,even though the company might be forced by legal requirements not to speak about the drug itself as opposed to the condition until fda approval is secured.
i believe,in addition,that other courts might read the fcc rule to mean that,at least when sent by commercial,entities,faxes offering free goods or services are deemed to be advertisements and unsolicited advertisements if sent without the prior permission of the recipient,regardless of whether the offer of free goods and services was a pretext or preliminary to explicit promotion of commercial products and services.
in enacting the telephone consumer protection act of,as amended by the junk fax prevention act of,congress undertook to limit the use in commerce of certain methods of communication that impose costs,hardships,and annoyances on unwilling recipients.section focuses,in part,on the transmission of unsolicited advertisement s to telephone facsimile machine s fax machines the sending of unsolicited advertisements to a fax machine is expressly prohibited except in specified circumstances which include the requirement that the message include a notice conforming to specifications that the recipient may opt out of further receipt of such messages.see b c it shall be unlawful for any person within the united states to send,to a telephone facsimile machine,an unsolicited advertisement,unless emphasis added 
the statute defines unsolicited advertisement to mean any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property,goods,or services which is transmitted to any person without that person prior express invitation or permission.id.a.the statute goes on to direct the fcc to prescribe regulations to implement the requirements of this subsection and to initiate a rulemaking proceeding concerning the need to protect residential telephone subscribers privacy rights to avoid receiving telephone solicitations to which they object.see id.b and c.the fcc promulgated the rule.
the rule is not written in the manner of a conventional regulation.it is a rambling discussion,in which some sentences assert normative rules and definitions,others describe arguments that have been submitted to the agency by commentators and the commission responses to them,and yet others explain the commission observations and reasoning that led it to its conclusions.
a chapter of the rule specifically addresses facsimile messages that contain offers for free goods and services,and the question whether such messages constitute unsolicited advertisements.
if one reads this passage precisely,sentence by sentence,giving each sentence its natural meaning,it can be read to establish a rule that differs significantly from the majority opinion interpretation of it.
the first sentence can be read to state a categorical conclusion as to the meaning of unsolicited advertisement as applied to faxes that offer free goods or services.
the commission concludes that facsimile messages that promote goods or services even at no cost,such as free magazine subscriptions,catalogs,or free consultations or seminars,are unsolicited advertisements under the tcpa definition.
rule,fed.reg.at emphasis added.
the next four sentences appear to recount what the commission observed and how those observations led it to adopt the categorical rule stated in the first sentence.these four sentences explain 
in many instances,free seminars serve as a pretext to advertise commercial products and services.similarly,free publications are often part of an overall marketing campaign to sell property,goods,or services.for instance,while the publication itself may be offered at no cost to the facsimile recipient,the products promoted within the publication are often commercially available.based on this,it is reasonable to presume that such messages describe the quality of any property,goods,or services.
the final sentence of the passage follows the commission factual observations described in the prior four sentences with the word,therefore,and then essentially restates the categorical rule of the first sentence that facsimile messages offering free goods and services are treated as advertisements so that the sender must obtain the recipient permission beforehand,in the absence of an established business relationship.id.
in view of the apparently categorical assertion of the first sentence repeated in substance in the final sentence that facsimile messages that promote goods or services even at no cost are unsolicited advertisements under the tcpa definition another court might well disagree with the majority opinion view that the rule does not aim at faxes promoting free seminars per se.nothing in the text suggests that the commission observation of the frequency with which free offers lead to commercial solicitation was intended as limiting the commission categorical proposition announced in the first sentence,rather than providing an explanation for it.
in addition,a court might conclude that the majority opinion selective quotation and characterization of the last two sentences of the passage on free goods and services change their meaning.the majority opinion describes the rule as stating that,because of the reasonableness of the presumption adopted by the fcc that messages advertising free seminars in fact describe the quality of any property,goods,or services,such messages potentially violat e the tcpa.id.at.the rule,however,after noting the reasonableness of that presumption,goes on to say that fax messages offering free goods and services t herefore would require the sender to obtain the recipient permission beforehand.rule,fed.reg.at emphasis added.this passage,read literally,says that,unless the recipient gave permission,the fax message offering free goods or services does violate the tcpa not that it potentially violates the tcpa.
the rule,in other words,can be read to say,in sum because of the frequency,observed by the commission,that messages offering free goods or services in fact mask or precede efforts to sell something,the commission has adopted a prophylactic presumption that fax messages offering free goods or services are advertisements and thus are prohibited by unless they are either sent with the consent of the recipient or meet the requirements for the statutory exception.
