this is an action by retired employees and their union against rockwell international corporation and its successor companies.the plaintiffs sued the defendants under of the labor management relations act lmra and the employee retirement income security act erisa to enforce what they contend was a promise by the defendants in the applicable collective bargaining agreements cbas to provided retirees and their surviving spouses with lifetime healthcare benefits.finding that the cbas contained such enforceable promises,the district court granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
rockwell international corporation,a diversified manufacturer that supplied parts to the automotive industry,owned industrial plants throughout the united states.in,rockwell spun off its automotive division,which became meritor automotive.meritor merged with arvin industries,in,forming arvinmeritor.arvinmeritor manufactures automotive integration systems,modules,and components for manufacturers of passenger vehicles,commercial trucks,trailers,and original equipment.between the late and,either rockwell or arvinmeritor closed the twelve plants at issue in this litigation,which were located in illinois,indiana,kentucky,michigan,ohio,and wisconsin.
all of the hourly employees at the closed plants were represented by the united automobile,aerospace,and agricultural implement workers of america the uaw.and the uaw have engaged in collective bargaining for decades,producing a succession of cbas.the cbas typically covered a period and followed a consistent format,including a master agreement the national agreement and several supplemental agreements addressing different topics that were expressly incorporated into the national agreement.for example,the supplemental insurance agreement always exhibit b and its accompanying insurance program always exhibit addressed the health insurance coverage at issue in this case.retiree healthcare benefits were established in,with rockwell paying half the cost.in the cba,rockwell agreed to pay the full cost of retiree healthcare benefits.the core benefits language at issue in this case first appeared in the cba and continued in the,and cbas.over those years,benefits improved in various ways,but the core language regarding retiree healthcare coverage remained essentially unchanged.see cole arvinmeritor,d,summary judgment order.
in,rockwell began to require that retirees participate in a mandatory and program.but this change did not fundamentally alter benefits it simply changed the mechanism for buying drugs and actually resulted in a savings to retirees.see cole arvinmeritor,d,preliminary injunction order.
the uaw agreed to a change in benefits in that adversely affected employees who retired from the oshkosh plant before.as a result,affected employees copayments for generic drugs went from to,while their copayment for drugs more than to.
in,arvinmeritor unilaterally froze medicare part b premium reimbursements at levels for retirees age or older.the practical impact of this change for retirees was an increase of hundreds of dollars per year in the net amount of their medicare premiums.later,in,arvinmeritor unilaterally eliminated dental,vision,and coverages for retirees.it also increased deductibles,copays,and maximums.finally,arvinmeritor announced plans in to eliminate all healthcare benefits as of the next year for all retirees,dependents,and surviving spouses age or older.
procedural background 
in april,the uaw brought suit against arvinmeritor and rockwell in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan.it asserted claims under of the lmra,and a b of erisa,a b.later,the uaw amended its complaint to add robert cole,john adams,and richard lanter,retirees from rockwell plants in ashtabula,ohio,detroit,michigan,and winchester,kentucky respectively,as representatives for a class of similarly situated retirees and surviving spouses from eleven different plants.the lawsuit was based on arvinmeritor unilateral reduction of benefits and increase in expenses for retirees in.
in september,the uaw,along with class representatives bernard faust,lois last,david reamer,and charles schmidt,filed a substantially identical lawsuit in the eastern district of michigan on behalf of retirees and surviving spouses from rockwell plant in oshkosh,wisconsin.that case was consolidated with the cole case in october.the district court eventually certified a class of approximately retirees along with spouses and eligible dependents from the defendants plants in illinois,indiana,kentucky,michigan,ohio,and wisconsin who currently or formerly received retiree healthcare benefits from the defendants.
while the lawsuit was proceeding,arvinmeritor made the announcement in that it was eliminating all healthcare benefits for retirees age or older.this caused the plaintiffs to file a motion for a preliminary injunction to force arvinmeritor to continue providing those benefits.after an evidentiary hearing,the district court granted the preliminary injunction.cole,d at.the court found that the contracting parties intention to provide lifetime retiree health coverage was expressed in the explicit language of the cbas.id.at.according to the district court,this intention was confirmed by contractual context written lifetime assurances to employees,retirees,and surviving spouses by multiple company officials decades of booklets and summary plan descriptions spds promising that healthcare benefits will be continued during retirement for both retirees and eligible dependents numerous explicit oral assurances of lifetime coverage made by company officials in various plants over the decades the early expression of the intent for benefits to continue for life in the rockwell benefits book and the retiree insurance cards issued in,and and the testimony and declarations of witnesses demonstrating that the negotiated security of lifetime pension and healthcare benefits was widely known,understood,and communicated for decades among employees,supervisory employees,and company and union officials who negotiated the cbas and the agreements.id.at.
the district court also applied a series of precedents that it referred to as the decisions.these are sixth circuit and eastern district of michigan cases that the court characterized as mirror images of the instant case,some addressing the actual cbas at issue,some addressing virtually identical cba language,and some addressing similar language.all of the decisions enforced promises of lifetime retiree healthcare benefits.see cole,d at.
following the entry of the preliminary injunction,each side moved for summary judgment,with the defendants essentially repeating the arguments they had made at the stage.the district court granted the plaintiffs motion,denied the defendants motion,and permanently enjoined the defendants from altering or canceling retiree healthcare benefits.cole,d at.quoting the language of the cba,the court concluded 
this language,tying pension status to retiree health providing that the health benefits at the time of retirement shall be continued thereafter for retirees and any eligible dependants constitutes an enforceable contractual promise of lifetime retiree health benefits to accompany lifetime pension benefits 
the court thus interprets the relevant cbas as unambiguously promising health benefits for each retiree lifetime and for the lifetimes of each retiree eligible dependents and surviving spouses.
the court found that the lifetime promises were confirmed by the following 
the virtually identical precedents,
the contractual context,including 
a caps on retiree healthcare benefits extending well beyond the expiration of the cbas,and 
b duration limits on healthcare benefits for those or on leave,in contrast to no duration limits on retiree healthcare benefits,
the substantial evidence of written assurances of lifetime healthcare benefits,including 
a lifetime letters sent between and,
b for life prescription cards issued between and,
c the rockwell for life healthcare benefits booklet,and 
d company booklets and spds issued between and,which assured that health benefits will be continued during your retirement for yourself and for your eligible dependents,and 
oral lifetime assurances made over four decades by company officials.
id.at.in conclusion,the court noted that e ven if the court had found the contract language ambiguous,the extrinsic evidence supports the conclusion that the parties intended that retiree health benefits were vested for life.id.at.
upon the defendants request,the district court later vacated the summary judgment order and issued a replacement order that was nearly identical except that it reserved a determination of the details of the permanent injunctive relief for later proceedings.the defendants then timely appealed to this court.
ii.analysis 
vesting of plans 
there are two types of employee benefit plans pension plans and plans.noe polyone,cir.although pension plans are subject to mandatory vesting under erisa,plans are not.id.retiree plans,such as those involved here,are plans vesting only occurs if the parties so intended when they executed the applicable labor agreements.id.a court may find vested rights under a cba even if the intent to vest has not been explicitly set out in the agreement.id.quoting maurer joy,cir.if the rights to healthcare coverage have vested,then the unilateral termination of coverage violates of the lmra.id.employers are free,on the other hand,to terminate any unvested welfare benefits upon the expiration of the relevant cba.id.
this circuit leading case for determining whether the parties to a cba intended benefits to vest is international union,united automobile,aerospace agricultural implement workers of america,cir.instructs that basic rules of contract interpretation apply,meaning that the courts must first examine the cba language to see if clear manifestations of an intent to vest are present.id.at.furthermore,each provision of the cba is to be construed consistently with the entire cba and the relative positions and purposes of the parties.id.the terms of the cba should be interpreted so as to avoid illusory promises and superfluous provisions.id.at.also explained that retiree benefits are in a sense status benefits which,as such,carry with them an inference that the parties likely intended those benefits to continue as long as the beneficiary remains a retiree.id.at.with regard to the inference,later decisions of this court have stated that does not create a legal presumption that retiree benefits are vested for life.yolton el paso.pipeline,cir.is instead properly understood as creating such an inference only if the context and other available evidence indicate an intent to vest.noe,at.
where an ambiguity exists in the provisions of a cba,the court may resort to extrinsic evidence to ascertain whether the parties intended for the benefits to survive the agreement.int l union,united auto.aerospace agric.implement workers of am.bvr liquidating,cir.if an examination of the available extrinsic evidence fails to conclusively resolve the issue and a question of intent remains,then summary judgment is improper.int l union,united mine workers of am.apogee coal,cir.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.nichols moore,cir.likewise,de novo review applies to questions of contract interpretation.yolton,at.
terms of the cba 
we must first assess the explicit language of the cbas and apply basic principles of contract interpretation,at.accordingly,we will address the district court conclusion that the language of the insurance program specifically provides for vested lifetime retiree healthcare benefits.in our review of the language at issue,we note that the numbering of various sections of the cbas changed over the years,but that the substance of the text remained unchanged.the district court,for example,refers to of the insurance agreement,discussed in detail below,as,based on the numbering in the cba.we will instead reference the numbering used in the cba,where the language at issue in this case first appeared.
the shall be continued language of the insurance program 
the cornerstone of the district court and decisions was its finding that language from article iii of the insurance document incorporated into the provides for lifetime retiree healthcare benefits.article iii is titled health care benefits.the fifth section of that article is titled continuance of health care coverages upon retirement or termination of employment at age or older.section a addresses,among other things,the continuance of healthcare coverage for both and retirees.it provides in pertinent part 
the health care coverages an employee has under this article at the time of retirement or termination of employment at age or older shall be continued thereafter provided that suitable arrangements can be made with the carrier s.contributions for coverages so continued shall be in accordance with article i,section b.
emphasis added.this language,the district court concluded,unambiguously promises lifetime health benefits.cole,d at.
there is substantial precedential support for the district court conclusion in the form of the line of cases,which it called mirror images of the instant case.cole,d at.the precedents are composed of mccoy meridian auto,dist.lexis,granting a preliminary injunction for retirees based on the cba mccoy meridian auto,cir upholding judge preliminary injunction mccoy meridian auto,wl,dist.lexis,granting summary judgment for retirees based on the cba golden.gadola,granting a preliminary injunction for retirees based on language virtually identical to that in the cba golden,cir affirming judge gadola decision to grant a preliminary injunction and golden.gadola granting summary judgment for retirees.
based on the precedents,which addressed either the same cbas at issue here,or virtually identical language from other cbas,the district court concluded that the shall be continued thereafter language from the insurance program created an enforceable promise of lifetime benefits.but because none of the decisions in the line of cases addressed the effect of the durational limitation imposed by of the insurance agreement,we will examine below the potential limiting effect of that provision.
section durational limitation 
the defendants have argued at every stage of this litigation that of the insurance agreement expressly limits retiree insurance coverage to the duration of the cba.section provides as follows 
this insurance agreement and insurance program as modified and supplemented by the insurance agreement shall continue in effect until the termination of the collective bargaining agreement of which this is a part.
ins.agreement at.the district court rejected the defendants arguments regarding that section,characterizing as only a general durational clause.cole,d at.in doing so,it noted the rule in this circuit that general durational clauses can not trump contractual promises of lifetime retiree healthcare benefits.id.g eneral durational provisions only refer to the length of the cbas and not the period of time contemplated for retiree benefits.absent specific durational language referring to retiree benefits themselves,courts have held that the general durational language says nothing about those retiree benefits.yolton,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the yolton court interpreted similar concurrent language in the cba at issue in that case as doing 
nothing to those employees who have already retired under the plan.the durational language only affects future is,someone who retired after the expiration of a particular cba would not be entitled to the previous benefits,but is rather entitled only to those benefits newly negotiated under a new cba.thus,the retirement package available to someone contemplating retirement will change with the expiration and adoption of cbas,but someone already retired under a particular cba continues to receive the benefits provided therein despite the expiration of the agreement itself.
id.at second emphasis added.
the district court also relied on contextual clues from other portions of the cbas in suppo
