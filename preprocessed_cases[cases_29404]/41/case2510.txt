in litigation arising from the secretary of health and human services hhs decision not to enter into a contract with the southern ute indian tribe,the district court issued two operative orders the first order determined that the hhs decision was unlawful,granted summary judgment to the tribe,and ordered the tribe to prepare a form of an order for injunctive relief for hhs approval.the parties could not reach an agreement,which resulted in continued litigation and culminated in the district court second order,which found in favor of the hhs approach as to the start date of the contract and to specifics regarding funding of the contract ancillary costs.the tribe appeals from this second order.hhs argues that the second order is not a final judgment on the merits,depriving this court of jurisdiction,and we agree.
background 
a.the indian and education assistance act reflects congress commitment to tribal.
in,congress enacted the indian and education assistance act,et isda,in large part to strengthen collaborative relationships with native american tribes.the isda,as amended,allows native american tribes to enter into contracts with the secretary of hhs,and under these contracts,the tribes themselves,rather than hhs,provide health service programs to their members.should a tribe wish to control its programs,the isda essentially directs the secretary of the interior and the secretary of hhs,upon the request of an indian tribe,to turn over the direct operation of its federal indian programs to that tribe.once a tribe requests control of its programs,hhs and the tribe enter into a contract,which the statute specifies must incorporate the provisions of a mandatory model contract included in the text of the isda.in return,hhs agrees to reimburse the tribes for administrative expenses and overhead costs called contract support costs incurred in the provision of these services.see also a.
under title i of the isda,tribes are entitled to enter into these contracts,defined as contracts for the planning,conduct and administration of programs or services which are otherwise provided to indian tribes and their members pursuant to federal law.j.the government must enter into contracts allowing tribal organizations to plan,conduct,and administer certain federal programs,including programs for the benefit of indians because of their status as indians.id.a e.
hhs acted upon congress express wish to transfer responsibility for the administration and management of these programs and services to the tribe 
the congress declares its commitment to the maintenance of the federal secretary unique and continuing relationship with and responsibility to the indian people through the establishment of a meaningful indian policy which will permit an orderly transition from federal domination of programs for and services to indians to effective and meaningful participation by the indian people in the planning,conduct,and administration of those programs and services.
the indian health service ihs is the primary federal health care provider for tribes and is the major source of tribal contracts,the type at issue here 
contract support costs include a variety of indirect administrative costs.
contract support costs generally encompass indirect administrative costs,such as special auditing or other financial management costs,a a ii direct costs,such as workers compensation insurance,a a i and certain startup costs,a.pueblo of zuni united states.most contract support costs are indirect costs generally calculated by applying an indirect cost rate to the amount of funds otherwise payable to the tribe.cherokee nation of leavitt,d.funding of indirect contract support costs is based on a variety of factors,including specific terms of each negotiated isda contract,each tribe annual indirect cost rate,the amount of funding made available by congress in the annual ihs appropriation and ihs policies and procedures for the calculation and distribution of indirect contract support costs.pueblo of zuni,at.
c.the hhs procedure upon receipt of a contract proposal 
upon receipt of a contract proposal,hhs must review and approve or decline the proposal within failure to act within the period results in the award of a contract by operation of law.a.hhs may decline a proposal for one of five specific reasons listed in a hhs may consider the program service to be unsatisfactory determine that the proposal does not assure adequate protection of trust resources conclude that the proposed contract can not properly complete or maintain the proposed project calculate that the contract proposed funding level exceeds the total amount of funds to be paid under the contract under a or conclude that the proposal services or functions are beyond the scope of programs that the contractor may lawfully engage in.if the hhs declines a proposal,a tribe may file an appeal through the administrative process or initiate an action in federal court.b.
the leading supreme court case involving the isda is cherokee nation leavitt,d,which provides much of the backdrop for the current litigation.in cherokee nation,the government entered into isda contracts with the cherokee nation and the tribes of the duck valley reservation collectively,the tribes.in two separate actions,the tribes submitted claims for fiscal years through.after hhs refused to pay,the tribes sued for breach of contract.in one case,this court upheld the hhs decision,and in the second action,the court of appeals for the federal circuit upheld a board of contract claims decision favoring the cherokee nation tribe.at.the supreme court consolidated the appeals.
in cherokee nation,the government promised to pay,and,citing a lack of sufficient funds,simply failed to pay,the costs at issue.between and,congress annually appropriated billion to billion to the ihs to execute the isda.at.justice breyer,writing for the majority,recognized that these amounts far exceeded the amounts that the tribes claimed id.the congressional appropriations were in amounts,without any statutory restrictions applicable to these claims.id.at.
justice breyer explained that the government isda contracts with the tribes are akin to regular government procurement contracts.in the case of normal procurement contracts,when congress appropriates sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay contracts at issue as part of a appropriation,the government is legally bound to pay those claims.id.at.t he government normally can not back out of a promise to pay on grounds of insufficient appropriations,even if the contract uses language such as subject to the availability of appropriations,and even if an agency total appropriation is insufficient to pay all the contracts the agency has made.id.at.
the court rejected the government attempt to avoid its obligations by arguing the contracts were unique and subject to special treatment.id.at.the court recognized that many isda contracts include the phrase,subject to the availability of appropriations,but noted that the phrase purpose is not to give the government a way out of the contract,but rather to secure contracts that the parties negotiate in advance of congressional appropriation,which,in pertinent years for the tribes,congress did appropriate.cherokee nation,at.quoting b.
since,congress has adopted a revised appropriation structure that is no longer a simple appropriation with recommendations on the amount that ihs should expend on contract support costs.beginning with fiscal year appropriation,congress explicitly limited the amount that ihs could expend on contract support costs by imposing a cap directly in the appropriations act.see pueblo of zuni,at.the cherokee nation court did not address what liability the government might incur when there is a capped appropriation for the total amount of funds owed to all isda contracts.id.finally,in addition to the availability of appropriations,hhs is not required to reduce funding for programs,projects,or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe or tribal organization under this act.b.we now apply this statutory and regulatory scheme to the facts of this case.
procedural background 
beginning on january,with the tribe submission of a proposal pursuant to to contract for the administration of the southern ute health center,the parties engaged in correspondence,and subsequent negotiations,regarding the proposal.over the course of the next eight months,the tribe granted three extensions of the mandatory term of decision to the ihs.
in the negotiations,hhs noted that there was a cap on funds that ihs could use to cover contract support costs,and that the hhs appropriation does not include any funds for new or expanded program assumption by indian tribes.rec.vol.ii,doc,at.hhs argued that language must be inserted into any new contract stating there are no contract support cost funds available for the fiscal year.id.at.congress had appropriated to ihs to pay contract support costs and stated that money expended for contract support costs was not to exceed this amount.this amount does not represent sufficient money to pay contract support costs for any new or expanded program assumption under the act.id.at.
the tribe in turn,refused to agree to the ihs required additional restrictive language.the tribe indicated that it was able to implement the proposal for the southern ute health center without the contract support cost funding,but would not waive the statutory right to the funding.id.at.
on august,defendant director of the area,james toya,sent a letter to the tribe declining its proposal.the letter noted the five declination criteria from the isda,a a through e and lists a,c,d,and e as the bases for declination.as the district court noted,
in explaining this declination,toya noted that the tribe was refusing to recognize in the contract that contract support costs are not available and that this has the effect of meeting criteria c,d,and e.toya then concluded that criteria a was met because the tribe had not shown it would be able to operate and maintain the programs and provide satisfactory services without contract support cost funds.the letter then lists an additional twelve reasons the proposal would have been declined even if the tribe had agreed to the contract support costs.there is no evidence in the record that any of these twelve issues had been discussed with the tribe during negotiations.
rec.vol.ii,doc,at emphasis supplied.
after sending a response letter declaring the declination unlawful,in september,the tribe filed a complaint for damages and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in federal court,which also alleged a violation of the administrative procedure act.hhs sought summary judgment,and the parties agreed to consolidate the motion for preliminary injunction with the merits of the case.the district court treated the parties respective motions as for summary judgment.
the district court rejected the hhs declination,noting that a lack of sufficient congressional appropriations does not supplant the agency statutory obligations and concluding that hhs could not condition its approval of the contract based on language absent from the statutory model agreement.further,the district court recognized that the model agreement,required to be part of a contract,also contains a provision making the contracts subject to the availability of appropriations,which should allay the hhs concerns.c rec.vol.ii,doc,at.
the district court thus rejected the hhs reasons for declining the contract.the district court granted summary judgment to the tribe on its first two claims.the court ordered the tribe to prepare a draft order of injunctive relief for the parties to sign.if the parties could not agree as to the order,the tribe could seek a presentment hearing.rec.vol.ii,doc,at.the district court noted that the tribe administrative procedure act claim and damages were remaining issues.id.at.
the court acknowledged that hhs is between a rock and a hard place if it has no discretion to decline contracts,no discretion to pay less than full contract support costs on all outstanding contracts,and receives inadequate appropriations to meet its obligations.id.at.the district court alluded to the supreme court suggestions in cherokee nation,that the government obligation to pay contract support costs may be different when there are no unrestricted funds available to pay them.id.citing,d.however,the court also noted that the government must refrain from making less essential contractual commitments and protect funds needed for more essential purposes so as to avoid making commitments it can not fulfill.at.but t he g overnment can not speculate that the supreme court will require it to pay obligations for which there are no unrestricted funds available and the government can not engage in statutory amendment to avoid the anticipated result of such a decision.rec.vol.ii,doc,at.
after the grant of summary judgment,the parties could only partially agree on a form of order for injunctive relief.the tribe submitted a contract containing certain statutory model language,but refused to include the hhs proposed language that hhs currently could not pay contract support costs.the tribe submitted a motion requesting a presentment hearing it also indicated the contract starting date would be october,which was the date originally proposed,according to the tribe.rec.vol.ii,doc.
hhs filed a motion for clarification and suggested language that would reflect that defendants currently owe the tribe in contract support costs on the basis that the tribe has not incurred any costs,and because no funds are available to be dispersed that the contract support costs amount reflecting plaintiff required contract support costs will be calculated but in view of the congressional earmark for contract support costs,the amount will be placed on the shortfall list for payment if and when funding becomes available.govt jurisd.br.at quoting rec.vol.ii,doc,at.as to the start date,hhs argued the october,start date made little sense as the tribe had provided no health care services as of that date,and would not incur costs until at the earliest the contract execution.
in its second order,the district court sided with hhs.the court determined that the isda did not prohibit that hhs version of the terms for the annual funding agreement.the tribe would be paid now,would be placed on the shortfall list,and would be paid contract support costs if and when funds became available.id.at.the court noted that the omission of such language would compel hhs to enter a contract that it must immediately breach,opening the door to perhaps of contract claims.id.at.
the court denied the tribe motion for a presentment hearing,granted the hhs motion for clarification,and ordered that the following occur 
the parties shall meet and resume obligations for entering a cont r act which includes a start date of the date the tribe undertakes operation of the southern ute health clinic 
the contract will include the secretary version of the annual funding agreement language which is described in this order 
the southern ute indian tribe will be placed immediately on the secretary shortfall list,which the secretary has represented it will do,and which the secretary represent s allows payment on the basis of need 
within six weeks of the date of this order,parties shall complete negotiations and submit a form of order for injunctive relief to the court,
and that within the six week period allowed for renegotiating the contract,parties shall advise the court regarding the status of the tribe third count in the complaint,alleging a violation of the administrative procedure act.
rec.vol.ii,doc,at.the tribe determined it would not participate in negotiations and filed this appeal.
ii.discussion 
before we can turn to the merits,we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to hear the tribe appeal.see generation transmission ass n,shoshone river power,cir.generally,we are limited to consideration of final orders that are accompanied by the entry of judgment.see.
however,a provides that courts of appeal shall have jurisdiction to hear matters arising from orders granting,continuing,modifying,refusing,or dissolving injunctions,or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.a.the dis
