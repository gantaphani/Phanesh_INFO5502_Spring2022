the plaintiff,pearlie talley,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants,family dollar stores of ohio family dollar,john parker,vincent cowles,and ric spring,on her claims of discrimination in violation of the americans with disabilities act ada and ohio statute and her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.for the reasons set forth below,and because we conclude that there is a material dispute of fact about whether talley abandoned her job or was discharged,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
talley began working for family dollar as a cashier on january.her position involved operating the cash register,cleaning the store,and stocking shelves.during her eight years with family dollar,talley worked at several of the store locations and had several managers.three of the managers are the individual defendants in the plaintiff suit based on violations of ohio law.john parker worked for family dollar as a store manager before being promoted to assistant district manager in and district manager in.he resigned from his position on approximately september,prior to talley last day of employment.vincent cowles became the store manager at the location where talley worked in late may.cowles supervised talley at one other location,but did not have any supervisory role over her after may.ric spring became the store manager at the hawkins store where talley was assigned to work in august.he remained her supervisor until the last day of her employment.
several times during the course of her employment,talley took medical leave from her job due to health issues.throughout her time with family dollar,talley suffered from degenerative osteoarthritis of her cervical and lumbar spine.talley alleges that the disease creates such pain in her legs and back that she is unable to stand or sit for long periods of time.in october,the plaintiff tore the cruciate ligament in her knee which forced her to take medical leave for several months.in april,talley had a heart attack and underwent quadruple bypass surgery,which necessitated another five months of leave from work.on march,she slipped on recently waxed floors while at work.after her fall,talley continued to work but as her pain increased she could not stand for more than fifteen minutes without experiencing severe pain.talley contends that while some of her supervisors allowed her to bring a stool to work to use at her cashier station,others forbade this practice.she alleges that in march,cowles objected to her use of the stool because other employees had complained that talley was receiving unfair treatment.without the use of a stool to sit upon while working the register,she was unable to perform her position and,as a result,she took medical leave in may.
in july,talley informed parker that she had received medical clearance and could return to work as of august.according to talley,parker insisted that she provide a doctor note that did not place any restrictions or limitations on her ability to work.she provided a note to parker that gave her permission to return to work with no restrictions.that note is part of the record.at.talley alleges that prior to returning to work she gave spring,her direct supervisor,a different notice that required that talley be permitted to use her stool 
talley alleges that prior to her returning to work on september,spring asked her to sign a letter that stated that she understood that she would not be permitted to use a stool at work and that she would be limited to three five minute breaks during a shift.instead of signing the letter,talley wrote a letter explaining that she could not sign the letter because it would prohibit her use of a stool.she agreed to obtain a doctor note that would state that she could perform her duties as required if she had a stool to sit upon.she promised to provide this statement on friday,september,
on september,the plaintiff returned to work and did not use a stool during her shift.within two hours of beginning her shift on september,however,she complained of severe pain and inquired whether she could have her sister deliver the stool to the store.spring refused and allegedly gave talley two options either she could finish her shift without a stool or she could get a doctor note that indicated that she needed a stool to perform her job.talley chose the latter option and secured a note from her doctor that same day which provided 
the above named patient is under my medical care.it is my opinion that will be able to return to work with the following restrictions 
patient is to stand no longer than minutes at a time.
this is to be followed by minutes of sitting a stool would be beneficial.
at.she returned to work with the note and gave it to spring who allegedly refused to open the note.he indicated that he would schedule a meeting among himself,talley,and the district manager to resolve the issue.talley then left the store,without finishing her shift,and never returned.
after september,talley alleges that she attempted to call spring several times to arrange the meeting but that the meeting never took place.in february,family dollar discharged the plaintiff citing job abandonment as the reason.
on september,the plaintiff filed a complaint in the summit county court of common pleas seeking damages relating to her termination.on october,the defendants removed the case to federal court.the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on july,alleging that family dollar had violated the ada,and that defendants family dollar,parker,cowles,and spring were liable for violations of ohio statute.the plaintiff also brought a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.on march,the defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.
the district court granted the defendants motion on june.with regard to the plaintiff ada and state law discrimination claims,the court found that the plaintiff had failed to make a prima facie case of discrimination under either the ada or ohio law because it found that the plaintiff had not shown that she was either expressly terminated or constructively discharged from her employment.specifically,the court reasoned that the plaintiff failure to return to work after september,was not the result of the employer intentional effort to terminate her employment,but instead was due to the plaintiff failure to comply with the management request for a doctor note and talley departure from the store without resolving the issue.because the plaintiff failed to show evidence of an adverse employment action,the plaintiff ada and state law claims were dismissed.additionally,the court granted summary judgment on the plaintiff intentional infliction of emotional distress claim because it found that she had not demonstrated that the defendants engaged in outrageous or extreme behavior or that she suffered severe emotional distress.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
plaintiff ada discrimination claims 
the ada provides,in relevant part,that n o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures,the hiring,advancement,or discharge of employees,employee compensation,job training,and other terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.a.where,as here,the plaintiff seeks to establish discrimination through indirect,rather than direct,evidence,we require the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case,followed by the familiar mcdonnell douglas.once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination,the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.gribcheck runyon,cir quoting mcdonnell douglas green,d.if the defendant can satisfy its burden,the plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the proffered explanation is a pretext for discrimination.id.to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ada,a plaintiff must show that she or he is an individual with a disability,who was otherwise qualified to perform a job requirements,with or without reasonable accommodation and who was discriminated against solely because of the disability.mahon crowell,cir.the third element requires that the plaintiff suffer an adverse employment action.plautz potter,cir.we agree with the district court finding that the plaintiff implicit claim is that she was constructively discharged from her job because of her disability.but this case is more complicated than the traditional constructive discharge case because the plaintiff alleges that the defendants failure to accommodate her disability was the impetus for her involuntary resignation.thus,the central issue is whether the defendants alleged refusal to provide talley with a reasonable accommodation converted her resignation into a constructive discharge.
before we decide whether the defendants actions constituted an adverse employment action,we must first address the threshold issue of whether talley is disabled,as defined by the ada.an individual is considered disabled under the ada if she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual,has a record of such impairment,or is regarded by her employer as having such an impairment.gruener ohio casualty ins,cir quoting sullivan river valley sch,cir see also.the plaintiff argues that she is both actually disabled and that she was by her employer.with respect to the claim,the defendants argue that the plaintiff first raised this claim in her memorandum in opposition to summary judgment and that we should disregard this claim as untimely.for the purposes of this appeal,we will assume without deciding that because the statute defining disability includes discrimination,the original complaint may have implicitly encompassed a claim.see beery hygienic,cir.the ada provision is designed to stamp out the stereotyping of and discrimination against persons with disabilities in all their forms.ross campbell soup,cir.a n individual may fall into the definition of one regarded as having a disability if an employer ascribes to that individual an inability to perform the functions of a job because of a medical condition when,in fact,the individual is perfectly able to meet the job duties.id.the supreme court has provided further guidance for courts when analyzing the prong of the ada 
there are two apparent ways in which individuals may fall within this statutory definition a covered entity mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities,or a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual,nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities.in both cases,it is necessary that a covered entity entertain misperceptions about the must believe either that one has a substantially limiting impairment that one does not have or that one has a substantially limiting impairment when,in fact,the impairment is not so limiting.
sutton united air lines,d.the plaintiff asserts that she met the prong because she was regarded as disabled by her supervisors and,many of whom testified that they recognized her obvious discomfort when she was working at her register.that the defendants and other recognized that talley had severe health problems and physical impairments does not satisfy the prong.rather,talley would either have to show that the defendants mistakenly believed that she had a limiting impairment when in fact she did not an argument she does not make or that the defendants believed she had a limiting impairment when that impairment,in fact,was not so limiting she does not argue that the defendants believed she was incapable of working the register due to her impairment.there is no indication in the record that family dollar ascribed to talley an inability to perform the functions of her job instead,the company clearly believed that she could continue to work the register if she was given the proper accommodation.therefore,the plaintiff failed to show that she was.
we agree with the district court that the plaintiff created a genuine issue of material fact regarding the plaintiff claim that she is actually disabled because she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual.the district court found that the plaintiff created a genuine issue of material fact with regard to this element because she had produced an expert report from her doctor that concluded that she was disabled the plaintiff alleges that she is substantially limited in her ability to sit,walk,stand,climb,breathe,work,and care for herself.the equal employment opportunity commission has issued regulations that provide some guidance regarding the terms substantially limits and major life activities.the regulations explain that major life activities include functions such as caring for oneself,performing manual tasks,walking,seeing,hearing,speaking,breathing,learning,and working.i.an impairment will be found to substantially limit a major life activity if the individual is u nable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform or if the individual is s ignificantly restricted as to the condition,manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition,manner,or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.j.
talley has raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether her physical impairment substantially limits various major life activities including walking,standing,and lifting.she does not allege that she is disabled from working rather,talley claim is that she is substantially limited in her ability to walk,stand,and lift objects and that the defendants failed to accommodate her needs following her various injuries.according to her testimony,the manner and duration under which she can perform these activities is significantly restricted due to severe pain.talley testified at length regarding her various injuries and their impact on her ability to walk,stand,and lift as compared to an average person in the general population.she also produced deposition testimony from who claimed that talley often appeared to be in severe pain when she was working at her register.further,at least one expert has concluded that she is disabled due to her injuries.a reasonable jury,based upon the evidence,could find for the plaintiff and conclude that she is disabled.
in order to make a prima facie claim of discrimination,the plaintiff must also show that she suffered an adverse employment action due to her disability.an adverse employment action is a materially adverse change in the terms or conditions of employment because of the employer conduct.mitchell vanderbilt,cir quoting kocsis,cir.the plaintiff alleges that she suffered an adverse employment action when she was constructively discharged from her employment,which occurred when she was no longer put on the schedule and she was refused a reasonable accommodation.a constructive discharge claim depends upon the facts of each case and requires an inquiry into the intent of the employer and the reasonably foreseeable impact of the employer conduct upon the employee.smith henderson,cir.it requires a finding that working conditions would have been so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee shoes would have felt compelled to resign.held gulf oil,cir quoting bourque powell,cir.talley claim of constructive discharge is premised upon a finding that her working conditions were made intolerable,and it was foreseeable she would resign when she was denied a reasonable accommodation.
the ada prohibits discriminating against a qualified individual with a disability,a,and defines discrimination to include not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability,id.b a.the act defines reasonable accommodation to include
