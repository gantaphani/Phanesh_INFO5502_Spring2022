david gicla had his joint replaced with an implant at a veteran administration medical center in chicago.after the implant failed to relieve the chronic pain and swelling that gicla was experiencing,a series of five additional surgeries followed,culminating in the amputation of his right leg below the knee.gicla filed this suit for malpractice against the united states and various va medical personnel pursuant to the federal tort claims act,et.the individual defendants were dismissed from the suit,and the case was tried to the bench.the magistrate judge,presiding with the parties consent,entered judgment in favor of the united states,finding that the va medical personnel who treated gicla did not breach the duty of care that they owed to him.gicla appeals.he primarily challenges the district court refusal to exclude the testimony of a defense expert for a purported violation of federal rule of civil procedure,after the expert disclosed on that just before taking the witness stand he looked at that he had not previously reviewed in rendering his opinion on behalf of the united states.gicla also contends that the district court erred in crediting the united states witnesses over his own.finding no error,we affirm the judgment.
in,gicla consulted with john grady,director of the podiatry service at the westside va medical center in chicago.gicla had severe arthritis in his right ankle stemming from a fracture he suffered in a motorcycle accident some twenty years earlier,while he was serving in the navy.the arthritis caused him to experience extreme pain and swelling.after nonsurgical efforts at relieving his symptoms proved unsuccessful,and after discussing his options with grady,gicla agreed to have his ankle joint replaced using the depuy agility total ankle system,an implant which had only recently been approved by the food and drug administration.gicla was years old at that time.
the surgery,performed in april,was the first occasion on which va physicians had used the depuy agility implant.grady performed the surgery with the assistance of resident jonathan norton.during the procedure,they removed a screw that had been used to repair the fracture gicla had suffered years before.the head of the screw broke off as the surgeons tried to remove it.because they lacked an trephine to hollow out the bone around the screw and facilitate the screw removal,they were forced to use an osteotome and mallet,which may have resulted in the removal of more bone surrounding the screw than a trephine would have.also during the surgery,either when the implant was inserted or when the ankle was flexed following the implantation,the lower portion of gicla fibula calf bone,also known as the lateral malleolus,cracked.such fractures are a known risk of implant surgery.the surgery was otherwise uneventful.
the implant did not improve gicla discomfort,however,and a series of surgical procedures ensued.in july,grady and norton removed a bony regrowth from his right ankle and lengthened his achilles tendon to increase the range of motion in his foot.in august,grady removed the implant and the ankle joint was fused.one year after that,much of the remaining hardware in the ankle was removed.the following year,yet another surgery was performed in an effort to salvage the fusion.still,gicla continued to experience pain and difficulty using his right leg.ultimately,in october,gicla had his right leg amputated eight to ten inches below the knee.the final three surgeries were performed in milwaukee,where the giclas had relocated.
gicla filed this suit in october complaining of medical malpractice.gicla alleged that he was too young for the implant procedure performed in given the expected life of the implant and that he was not properly advised of the risks attendant to an ankle replacement.he also alleged that grady and norton made certain mistakes in performing the initial surgery in april and the surgery in july which contributed to the failure of the implant to resolve his discomfort,including using the implant,removing too much bone in extracting the broken screw,failing to use bone wax to prevent bone growth in unwanted areas,the area around the removed screw,fracturing his fibula,failing to stabilize the implant,failing to use a bone stimulator to hasten bone regrowth in desired areas,and damaging or displacing his deltoid ligament during the surgery.
at trial,george vito testified as an expert witness on the government behalf.federal rule of civil procedure a b requires the party who proffers an expert to make certain disclosures,including,among other things,i a statement of the opinions the expert will express,along with the bases and reasons for those opinions,ii any data or other information considered by the expert in forming his opinions,and iii any exhibits that will be used to summarize or support those opinions.if the initial disclosure is incomplete,or if there is a subsequent addition to or change in the information disclosed,the expert proponent has an obligation to supplement its disclosure pursuant to rules a d and e.rule c in turn calls for the exclusion of an expert testimony if the requisite disclosures have not been made,unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.consistent with rule a b,the government in advance of trial disclosed vito opinions,the rationale for those opinions,and the information he considered in forming them.one source of information that vito did not consult in forming his opinions was a series of twenty to thirty of gicla ankle that were taken at various times before and after his implant surgery in april.rather than reviewing the himself,vito relied on the radiological findings as to what those revealed.this was known to gicla counsel,presumably as a result of both the government rule disclosures and discovery as to vito opinions.gicla counsel planned to drive home this point in vito at trial and to suggest to the court that his opinions should be given less weight than gicla own expert,who had examined the.but when the time came to vito,gicla counsel was surprised to learn from vito that he had reviewed the earlier that day,before he took the witness stand.tr.vito confirmed that he had not looked at the in forming his opinions prior to trial his first and only review of the had taken place earlier that day.tr.vito also testified that the had not altered his views.my opinion has not changed.tr.when asked if they had confirmed or aided his analysis,vito said that if anything,they helped me expand upon my testimony right now tr.but vito never explained how the helped him to elaborate on his opinions,as gicla counsel elected not to question him further on that subject.instead,he moved to strike vito testimony altogether.
gicla counsel took the position that it was a violation of the government obligations under rule for vito to testify as an expert when his opinions were now informed by his review of the,and when his belated review of those had not been disclosed to gicla in accordance with the rule.gicla was prejudiced by the violation,his attorney argued,because counsel had planned vito believing that vito had rendered his opinions without reviewing the.vito unexpected disclosure that he had taken a look at the and that they did not change his opinion blocked the line of attack that gicla counsel had intended to pursue and left him unprepared to question vito about what he saw or did see in the.counsel added that he was unable to consult with gicla expert who was not present at the trial in order to prepare appropriate questions for vito now that vito had seen the.
the district court declined to strike vito testimony.the court was critical of the government for having shown vito the on the morning of his testimony.tr.the government obviously had done this to neutralize the anticipated of vito,tr,and in the court view,the government should have shown vito the at an earlier date and disclosed this to the plaintiff,so that gicla would have had an opportunity to question vito before trial as to what the revealed,tr.but the court saw any violation of rule a as harmless.tr.in response to questions posed by gicla
