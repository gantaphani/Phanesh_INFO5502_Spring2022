robert house appeals the district court order affirming the decision of the commissioner of social security to deny house application for disability insurance and supplemental security income benefits under title ii,title xvi,and title xviii of the social security act.see et,et,et the parties agree that the critical issue on appeal is whether substantial evidence supports the administrative law judge alj decision to give little weight to a treating physician opinions that house can not tolerate even one hour of prolonged sitting and must have the ability to elevate his legs at least parallel to the ground to avoid worsening the chronic lymphedema condition in his lower left leg.after careful review of the administrative record focused on this issue,we affirm.
house claims that he is disabled from a combination of impairments including chronic lymphedema in his lower left leg,recurrent deep vein thrombosis clotting in his legs which has caused pulmonary embolisms,obesity,depression,and borderline intellectual functioning.these conditions severely limit his ability to stand and walk.after a hearing,the alj denied the claim.the commissioner appeals council remanded,primarily for further consideration of the opinions of house treating physician,bret mcfarlin,as those opinions might be clarified and supplemented on remand.the alj held two additional hearings and again denied the claim,finding that house has severe impairments that leave him unable to perform his past relevant work but is not disabled because he retains the residual functional capacity to perform certain unskilled sedentary jobs such as parking lot cashier,cafeteria cashier,hand packager,and office helper.
the medical evidence in the record reflects that house was hospitalized for three days in march when he experienced swelling and pain in his lower left leg after working eleven hours the prior day at a construction job.he was with the leg elevated and treated with medications until testing revealed no deep vein thrombosis.mcfarlin stated on a hospital discharge report that house was fitted for compression hose and told to exercise and change his diet no work restrictions were noted.
on may,house was hospitalized with shortness of breath from a pulmonary embolism.mcfarlin stated in his discharge report that house was released five days later with a prescription for coumadin,an,and a work restriction of n o prolonged standing greater than hours.on july,he was again hospitalized,this time for six days,for a pulmonary embolism after he stopped taking coumadin.mcfarlin discharge report noted that coumadin was again prescribed and that house was instructed about his need to keep active.no work restrictions were noted.in september mcfarlin saw house for a regular monthly and noted that his lymphedema was chronic but stable.
in a december residual functional capacity assessment,lawrence staples noted that house left lower extremity lymphedema was stabilizing.staples opined that house could lift twenty pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently,could stand or walk six hours and sit six hours in a work day,and was therefore capable of work activities.
in a june disability letter,mcfarlin described house treatment since march and opined that house had severely limited range of motion and ability to ambulate,stand for extended periods or time,or bear any significant weight on his left lower extremity.mcfarlin noted that lymphedema is a permanent,irreversible state with no satisfying therapy and therefore house will be doomed to a life of anticoagulation therapy and a limited physical activity.in july,mcfarlin notes from a periodic stated 
lymphedema,this appears to be a permanent,irreversible,disabling condition for this individual,greatly limiting his ability to ambulate or pursue meaningful levels of activity.even two hours of mostly sedentary but standing work will greatly increase his symptoms and diminish his ability to ambulate without assistance.i have encouraged him to again pursue a disability application.
in november,another physician in mcfarlin clinic noted that house was doing very well.he had lost weight,there was less swelling in his left leg,and he was walking and exercising more.in december,house sprained his ankle while raking leaves.in january,his physical therapist noted he was walking without difficulty,except for the sprained ankle,and was on a home exercise program for strength and cardiovascular fitness.in march,house reported no changes in left leg swelling and said he tries to keep his legs elevated as much as possible.in august,he told a physician assistant that his left calf hurt if he danced or walked a lot.
on september,mcfarlin wrote the iowa division of vocational rehabilitation that house suffers from a chronic and permanent disabling condition,explaining that recurrent deep vein thrombosis required a lifelong course of anticoagulation and severe lower left leg lymphedema caused swelling and pain that will greatly limit house ability to perform any meaningful act of employment that might involve walking,standing,ambulating,or lifting to any significant degree.however,mcfarlin added,it is not unrealistic to think that house could perform a sedentary occupation without worsening his health problem.
house was hospitalized for pneumonia in january.mcfarlin discharge report stated that house could return to work.at a may,house reported no pain in his legs,which he felt were staying the same size.mcfarlin described the lymphedema as stable.
in june,mcfarlin responded to a request from house attorney to clarify prior descriptions of house condition.mcfarlin wrote that his prior use of the word sedentary did not mean the social security definition,but rather that house could not be expected to spend significant periods of time ambulating,standing upright,or sitting without aggravating the lymphedema emphasis added.mcfarlin then opined that house could not tolerate an workday with any periods of lifting,standing,sitting,or walking for periods of time measured even in multiple minutes,let alone hours.a job involving prolonged periods of sitting would necessitate a special prosthetic chair with the ability to elevate legs.
at the november supplemental hearing,the vocational expert testified that he had never seen a special prosthetic chair in the workplace.he opined that the need to elevate one legs to or higher would preclude employment,but the need to raise house legs onto a box underneath his feet could be accommodated.after the hearing,house submitted a second letter from mcfarlin explaining that his reference to a special prosthetic chair was not intended to prescribe a specific chair.ideally,mcfarlin opined,house left leg would be elevated as much as possible at least parallel with the ground in a chair whose capacity equaled or exceeded house substantial weight.in concluding,the letter stated mcfarlin intent to clarify and reiterate my strong belief that house is a legitimate candidate for long term and permanent disability.
the alj lengthy opinion described house extensive medical history and his subjective complaints in detail.in determining residual functional capacity,the alj gave significant weight to mcfarlin opinion that house has severe limitations in his ability to stand or walk.however,the alj gave little weight to mcfarlin opinions that prolonged sitting,measured in terms of minutes,not hours,and the inability to elevate his legs at least to waist level while working would exacerbate house leg problems.these opinions,the alj explained,were not supported by the medical evidence and house own testimony,which indicate that house lower leg condition will not be exacerbated if he is employed at a sedentary job where he is allowed to get up and move around every to one hour during the day.the alj then found that house severe leg impairments preclude him from performing his past relevant work and many tasks,but he retains the residual functional capacity to lift and carry up to twenty pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently,to sit for thirty to sixty minutes at a time for about six hours in an work day,and to stand or walk a total of about two
