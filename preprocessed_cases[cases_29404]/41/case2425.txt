christopher columbus log records the first european encounters with tobacco.his crew observed indians carrying a charred,hollow wood in their hands and herbs to smoke in this wood,which they are in a habit of doing.bartolemé de las casas,a contemporary who witnessed columbus return to seville,described the consequences 
these muskets as we will call them,they call tabaco.i knew spaniards on this island of española san domingo who were accustomed to take it,and being reprimanded by telling them it was a vice,they made reply that they were unable to cease from using it 
five centuries later,the surgeon general came to the same conclusion.in,he formally classified nicotine as addictive,publishing a report whose title,the health consequences of smoking nicotine addiction,left little to the imagination fda commissioner david kessler spent most of the trying to regulate tobacco products because of the threat that addiction posed to the public health.and,in the fall of,chandler was berated by ross,phoebe and the rest of the gang for his inability to quit in short,the addictive qualities of tobacco are a cultural fixture,and have been for quite some time.
plaintiff maher soliman nevertheless claims he had no idea that cigarettes were addictive for the first years that he smoked them.he says that he did not discover the truth until october,when he saw a television interview of jeffrey wigand,the industry insider so to speak who made damaging revelations of nicotine manipulation by tobacco companies.soliman sued the tobacco industry for making him an unwitting slave to the leaf,for demolishing his lungs and for causing him psychological distress.the district court dismissed because it found his claims were barred by the statute of limitations.
soliman alleges that he has smoked cigarettes since the late,when he was fourteen.he is by now addicted to nicotine.he tried to quit fifty times,but has never lasted more than three days at the time he filed his complaint,he was only but had the lungs of an year old.he suffers from a variety of respiratory disorders,including dyspnea and orthopnea,which impair his lung function and make it hard for him to breathe except in an upright position.he claims that smoking has afflicted him with physical distress,depression,extreme anguish,nervousness,tension,anxiety and loss of sleep.am.compl.and,still,he continues to smoke,unable to quit.
in october,soliman watched an msnbc interview of jeffrey wigand,who revealed that the tobacco industry had suppressed information about the harmful effects of smoking.a few months later,he was diagnosed with the abovementioned respiratory disorders and began to research the industry in earnest.he claims that,in the course of this research,he made the discovery that at the center of this lawsuit smoking is addictive.only then,claims soliman,did he discover that smoking was an addiction and that he was and is addicted to tobacco product.am.compl.he could not have discovered,prior to the interview of wigand on msnbc,the addictive nature of nicotine in cigarettes and the health hazards of tobacco,because the tobacco industry ha d actively and fraudulently concealed and suppressed that information.id.indeed,soliman claims,t he addictive nature of nicotine is a defect which is virtually impossible to identify and detect by the consumer.id.
soliman sued various tobacco companies in state court in march,seeking million in general and compensatory damages,a further million in punitive damages and equitable relief in the form of a fund to pay his future medical bills.he invoked a number of theories,including product liability,negligence,breach of warranty,fraud,misrepresentation,conspiracy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the thread running through his complaint is that cigarettes cause addiction and other health problems,and defendants must pay for inflicting these ailments upon him.
defendants removed to federal court and,once there,moved to dismiss on the ground that the suit is untimely.defendants are skeptical of soliman claim that,despite having smoked for years,he did discover any of his health problems until a few months before he filed.they argue that soliman had at least constructive knowledge much earlier.
the district court denied soliman motion to remand to state court and dismissed the complaint as barred by limitations.soliman filed an amended complaint,but the district court held that the claims were still untimely and dismissed without leave to amend.
soliman observes that the original removal notice was defective because it was signed by all defendants.the district court,however,allowed defendants to cure this defect by amending the notice pursuant to.a procedural defect existing at the time of removal but cured prior to entry of judgment does not warrant reversal and remand of the matter to state court.parrino fhp,cir.
soliman also contends there is no complete diversity of citizenship as required by.soliman is a citizen of california.none of the named defendants is a citizen of that state,but the complaint lists several doe defendants,whose capacities and relationship to other defendants are unknown but who are,soliman claims,responsible for the acts complained of.am.compl.in his appellate brief,soliman for the first time identifies one of the mystery company in oakland,california,which he refers to as dna plant technology corporation.soliman claims that this firm genetically engineered a tobacco plant known as for brown williamson,who grew it in brazil and then secretly shipped it to the united states.he intends to substitute this newly identified for one of the does.
the citizenship of fictitious defendants is disregarded for removal purposes and becomes relevant only if and when the plaintiff seeks leave to substitute a named defendant.a,e superseding bryant ford motor,cir en banc.soliman failed to do so before the district court entered judgment against him,and his attempt has no jurisdictional significance.see bryant ford motor,cir.
we therefore reach the central soliman claims are timely.because the district court dismissed the case on the pleadings,we can affirm only if untimeliness is apparent on the face of the liberally construed complaint.see pisciotta teledyne,cir.
product liability claims are subject to a statute of limitations in california.this provision bars untimely personal injury claims based on defective products regardless of the particular legal theory invoked.see nodine shiley,cir clark baxter healthcare,th,d.the statute of limitations normally begins to run when the claim accrues,that is,when the cause of action is complete with all of its elements.norgart upjohn,cal th,d,witkin,california procedure ed.when a plaintiff is unaware of his cause of action,the discovery rule may postpone accrual until he either discovers or has reason to discover it.norgart,cal th at d,witkin,california procedure,supra.a plaintiff has reason to discover the cause of action when he has reason at least to suspect a factual basis for its elements.norgart,cal th at,d,emphasis added.
soliman argues that the statute of limitations did begin to run until he was aware,not only of his injuries,but also of defendants specific wrongful particular,their fraudulent concealment of the health hazards of smoking.but under california law,a plaintiff need not be aware of the specific facts necessary to establish the claim in order for a cause of action to accrue.jolly eli lilly,cal d.nor need he be aware of the particular legal theory that will support it.norgart,cal th at,d.his claim accrues when,simply put,he at least suspects that someone has done something wrong to him.id.quoting jolly,cal d at.a smoker who is injured by a product he believed to be safe has reason at least to suspect that its manufacturer or seller has done something wrong.see nicolo philip morris,cir plaintiff knew her addiction was attributable to defendants.this alone put her on inquiry.arnold reynolds tobacco,o nce a plaintiff is aware that he has been injured by a product,he has enough information to commence a products liability action based on that injury.the statute of limitations began to run when soliman should first have suspected that defendants tobacco products had injured him,whether or not he knew of defendants wrongful conduct 
soliman also argues that the statute of limitations did begin to run until he was diagnosed with dyspnea and orthopnea in january.the relevant date,however,is not when soliman knew about these particular injuries,but when he should have known of any significant injury from defendants wrongful conduct 
w here an injury,although slight,is sustained in consequence of the wrongful act of another,and the law affords a remedy therefor,the statute of limitations attaches at once.it is not material that all the damages resulting from the act shall have been sustained at that time,and the running of the statute is not postponed by the fact that the actual or substantial damages do not occur until a later date.
nodine,at quoting spellis lawn,d.i f the statute of limitations bars an action based upon harm immediately caused by defendant wrongdoing,a separate cause of action based on a subsequent harm arising from that wrongdoing is normally barred.miller lakeside vill.condo.ass n,th,d see also witkin,california procedure,supra.a lthough a right to recover nominal damages will not trigger the running of the period of limitation,the infliction of appreciable and actual harm,however uncertain in amount,will commence the statutory period.davies krasna,cal d.soliman alleges that he suffered a number of significant injuries from the cigarettes he smoked.the injury he should have known about first is the one that starts the statute of limitations 
soliman alleged addiction as one of his distinct injuries.am.compl.that might conceivably be a cognizable theory of recovery under california law.tobacco addiction entails physical loss of control any california can ostracism.some putative class actions have been premised entirely on the theory that addiction itself is an injury.see,castano am.tobacco,cir noting addiction as injury as a novel theor y of recovery.we need not decide the matter here,however,because soliman ca claim that his addiction is an appreciable injury and,at the same time,ask us to ignore it in determining when his claim accrued.if soliman had actual or constructive knowledge of his addiction before he was diagnosed with respiratory illness,the date of actual or constructive knowledge of addiction would govern.
soliman complaint does state when in his year smoking history he became addicted to nicotine he contends only that he first discover ed his addiction while researching the tobacco industry after his january diagnosis.am.compl.however,the date that soliman actually discovered his addiction is irrelevant if a reasonable person would have discovered it sooner.see norgart,cal th at,d.soliman constructive knowledge of his own addiction depends to some extent on whether he should have known that smoking is addictive.he alleges that he did discover,and could have discovered,the addictive qualities of nicotine before he saw the television program featuring jeffrey wigand in october.but the dangers of nicotine addiction have been in the public spotlight for many years.the surgeon general concluded that nicotine is addictive in,based on the abundant scientific literature demonstrating that c igarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting.fda brown williamson tobacco,d quoting surgeon general report,supra,at.he determined that the pharmacological and behavioral processes that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine.id.quoting surgeon general report,supra,at.at congressional hearings in,fda commissioner david kessler testified at length about nicotine addictive properties.see regulation of tobacco products part hearings before the house subcomm.on health and the environment of the comm.on energy and commerce,cong.he noted that more than million americans try to quit each year and fail.id.at.the fda asserted jurisdiction over tobacco products in precisely because of their addictive effects.see nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco is a drug and these products are nicotine delivery devices under the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act jurisdictional determination,see also brown williamson,at.acknowledging that tobacco use is one of the most troubling public health problems facing our nation today,but holding that the fda had exceeded its statutory authority.these are hardly obscure details in the historical record.
the california legislature acknowledged some time ago that the inherent risks of smoking are commonly known to the people of the state.in,it enacted an immunity statute that shielded manufacturers and sellers of tobacco products from liability for the commonly known risks of smoking.see act of,ch,cal.stat,codified at cal,repealed in relevant part by act of,ch,cal.stat.the california supreme court interpreted this statute in naegele reynolds tobacco,cal th,d.the plaintiffs in that case alleged that the tobacco industry had lied about the addictive nature of smoking,disseminate d deceptive statements about the addictive nature of cigarettes,and control led the nicotine content of their cigarettes.id.at,d,internal quotation marks omitted.the court held that the immunity statute barred these claims,reasoning that t hese allegations do not suggest that the cigarettes plaintiff smoked exposed him to dangers other than those inherent in cigarette smoking of which the public had a general understanding.id.at,d,internal quotation marks omitted.the premise of the immunity statute was that certain products are inherently unsafe,but the public wishes to have them available despite awareness of their dangers.id.at,d,internal quotation marks omitted see also barker brown williamson tobacco,th,d regardless of any concealment by tobacco companies,it has been a matter of common knowledge since at least that cigarette smoking is not healthy.
under california law,addiction is a commonly known risk of smoking and is therefore a danger of which a plaintiff is presumed to be aware because the immunity statute was repealed in relevant part in,nicotine addiction claims are no longer categorically barred.see act of,ch,cal.stat.but they are still subject to limitations.for precisely the same reason a plaintiff could avoid the immunity statute by claiming ignorance of the risk of nicotine addiction,naegele,cal th at,d,he ca now avoid the statute of limitations based on the same claim.
a smoker may have a timely suit for addiction injury if he did become addicted until the year before filing suit.but that not what soliman claims he says only that he did discover his addiction until recently the final question,therefore,is whether by california law to know that smoking causes reason to suspect that he himself was addicted.see norgart,cal th at,d.
the question answers itself.it a syllogism that if you are aware that a certain activity carries a risk,and you engage in that activity,you may suffer the consequences of that risk.replacing are aware with should be aware does change the logic of this inference.soliman knew he was a smoker.under california law,he was presumed to know that smoking can cause addiction.even if we assume that soliman had no direct evidence of his addiction,he is charged with the obvious inferences he should have drawn about the consequences of his conduct.see id.a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff has reason to discover it.he may not have had a reason to know for sure that he was addicted until he tried to quit.but he at least should have suspected he had succumbed to that risk at some point during the years that he smoked.a longtime smoker who alleges addiction as an injury may not invoke the discovery rule based solely on the industry alleged concealment nicotine addictiveness is a matter of public record,and addiction is a predictable consequence of using an addictive product because soliman is charged with this knowledge,the district court properly dismissed his complaint as barred by the statute of limitations 
soliman argues that,whether or not his other claims are untimely,his fraud claim is viable b
