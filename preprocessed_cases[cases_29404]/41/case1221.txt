defendants,james sylvester milan,and sharn raynard milan,appeal from the judgments issued by the united states district court for the western district of tennessee,entered on september,and september,respectively,finding defendants guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of fifty grams or more of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base,in violation of a.for the reasons set forth below,as to sharn raynard milan,we vacate the district court judgment and remand the case for and,as to james sylvester milan,we affirm the district court judgment.
procedural history 
a federal grand jury returned an indictment on july.a superseding indictment was filed on october,charging defendants with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of fifty grams or more of a mixture and substance containing cocaine base,in violation of a possession with intent to distribute and distribution and conspiracy.
on october,a plea agreement for sharn raynard milan sharn was entered.on october,a plea agreement for james sylvester milan,james was entered.
on september,judgment was entered,finding james guilty of the conspiracy and sentencing him to a term of months.on september,judgment was entered,finding sharn guilty of the conspiracy and sentencing him to a term of months.after entry of judgment,each defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.on june,pursuant to the government motion for a reduction in sharn sentence for substantial assistance,see fed.crim.b,the district court reduced sharn sentence to months.
the presentence investigation reports of james and sharn offer identical accounts of the substantive facts,stating that a confidential informant had indicated 
that sharn raynard milan and stephen dorrell milan were major distributors of crack cocaine in trenton,tennessee,and that james sylvester milan,and andre anderson were selling crack cocaine for them provided information that led to the introduction of a drug task force undercover agent to members of sharn raynard milan organization.during the course of this investigation,participated in several controlled purchases of crack cocaine involving andre anderson,sharn raynard milan,and james sylvester milan,jr 
undercover agents arranged and executed numerous purchases of crack cocaine from defendants.on august,another confidential informant arranged a purchase from sharn of a quantity of crack cocaine that was later measured to be grams.on later dates,arranged by phone to purchase crack cocaine from anderson then,with a listening device and accompanied by an undercover to anderson residence and completed these purchases of crack cocaine.
on september,with an agent listening to the call,arranged by phone to purchase crack cocaine from sharn raynard milan through james sylvester milan,at.then,agent eric holmes and entered james sylvester milan,residence and in their own vehicle subsequently followed a vehicle driven by james sylvester milan,to the residence of sharn raynard milan where james sylvester milan,entered the vehicle driven by agent holmes and.at.and agent holmes purchased from james a quantity of crack cocaine that was later measured to be grams.
on september,at sharn residence,undercover agents purchased from james a quantity of crack cocaine that was later measured to be grams during the purchase,james sylvester milan,went into the residence and sharn raynard milan came outside and looked at the agent.at.on october,an undercover agent purchased a quantity of crack cocaine that was later measured to be grams from james at sharn residence during the purchase,t he undercover agent observed james sylvester milan,walk over to sharn raynard milan and receive a package from him the package contained the crack cocaine.at.in the course of these arrangements,an incident occurred in which james came uninvited to residence and accused of being a federal agent believed that james had a firearm in his pocket,due to james gestures.
on july,a federal grand jury indicted sharn and james.a superseding indictment was filed on october,charging defendants with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of fifty grams or more of a mixture and substance containing cocaine base,in violation of a possession with intent to distribute and distribution and conspiracy.on october,and october,respectively,sharn and james pled guilty.
on september,sharn gave a proffer statement to agents,admitting to having sold cocaine on various occasions.on september,james gave a proffer statement to agents,stating,inter alia,that sharn was his first cousin and describing both his own role and sharn role in crack cocaine distribution.
discussion 
defendants initially raised four arguments in this case.sharn argued,first,that his rights under sentencing guidelines manual were violated when his sentence was calculated based on drug amounts referred to in his proffer statements and those of his second,that the offense level was improperly increased for possession of a firearm during the offense,pursuant to and,third,that the offense level was improperly increased for a leadership or organizer role,pursuant to a.finally,james argued that the district court erred in using the proffer statements of his to calculate his offense level,in violation of.
however,on june,after briefs were filed in this appeal,the supreme court issued its decision in blakely washington,d,in which the court invalidated the state of washington determinate sentencing system on sixth amendment grounds.in response to blakely,sharn and james moved for leave to file supplemental briefs on the sixth amendment implications of their sentencing determinations.we have reviewed the defendants supplemental briefs as well as the government responses.now,with the supreme court ruling in united states booker,d,to guide us,we conclude that sharn case must be remanded for.as to james,we conclude that his sentencing determination was proper,even in light of booker.however,these holdings do not completely dispose of the case.defendants claim that the district court failed to comply with remains for us to consider.we do so infra at part iii of this opinion,where we hold that remains binding on the district courts after booker and the district court did not violate in this case because in determining defendants sentences it considered only the proffer statements of the,not those of defendants themselves.in determining sharn sentence on remand,therefore,while the district court is bound by booker instruction that its sentencing determination be reasonable and by congress command that the sentence not exceed the statutory maximum the court is free to consider the proffer statements of sharn.as to james,we hold that his sentence is consistent with the sixth amendment and with of the guidelines and therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
we turn now to the sixth amendment claims of each defendant.
sharn pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of fifty grams or more of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base.sharn made no further factual admissions beyond those implicit in his guilty plea.at sharn september,sentencing hearing,the district court determined that the base offense level was because the presentence investigation report pir attributed at least kilograms of crack cocaine to sharn.see c.next,the court applied a enhancement under b on the strength of the government allegation that sharn possessed a firearm during the commission of the offense to which he pled.the court then applied a enhancement under a because it found that sharn was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.id.the court then proceeded to reduce sharn offense then stood at follows first,the court applied a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.second,the court granted the government motion under and applied a further reduction,agreeing with the government that sharn had provided substantial assistance.when all modifications were complete,sharn had an offense level of and a criminal history category of ii,which warranted a sentence between and months under the guidelines.thus,on september,the court sentenced sharn to months,the sentence he now appeals.
however,after the parties filed their briefs in this appeal,the district court further reduced sharn sentence.at some point during the spring of,the government filed a motion with the district court for a reduction of sharn sentence on the grounds of substantial assistance.see fed.crim.b.on june,the court granted the motion,reduced sharn offense level from to,and sentenced sharn to months.some three weeks later,on july,sharn submitted a supplemental brief urging us to remand for on all of the claims he raises in light of the supreme court decision in blakely washington.sharn did not apprise us of the june,reduction in his sentence,but the government,not surprisingly,did so in its reply brief.however,despite the government suggestion to the contrary,and in light of the supreme court decision in united states booker,we conclude that sharn does have standing to challenge his sentence on sixth amendment grounds.
we reach this conclusion because sharn at its current reduced level of not authorized by the facts to which he admitted.and as the court held in booker any fact other than a prior conviction which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.booker.at.at.sharn did not admit to anything beyond conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute and to distribute grams or more of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base.accordingly,the proper base offense level is.see.with sharn criminal history category of ii,the maximum sentence authorized by law is months.see sentencing table.similarly,sharn two possession of a firearm,and for being an organizer or leader of a criminal activity,a were not based on facts he admitted.consequently,both sentencing enhancements and the base offense level calculation are controlled by the supreme court decision in united states booker.however,because sharn first raised his sixth amendment argument during this appeal,we must determine whether his sentence,which depends on facts not admitted by him nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,constitutes plain error.if it does,we must remand for in light of booker.
initially,we explain why plain error review is warranted.in booker,the supreme court made clear that its holdings in the case may have implications for many cases presently on review in the courts of appeal as these dispositions indicate,we must apply today holdings to all cases on direct review.booker,at.at citing griffith kentucky,d other citations omitted.this is not to say,as the court further reasoned,that every sentence gives rise to a sixth amendment violation nor that every appeal will lead to a new sentencing hearing.id.our duty,in light of the supreme court instruction on the matter,is to apply ordinary prudential doctrines,to determine,for example whether the issue was raised below and whether it fails the plain error test.id.it is not surprising that the court would so instruct us,in light of united states cotton,d,in which the court reviewed for plain error a federal defendant claim that his sentence conflicted with apprendi new jersey,d which was decided during the pendency of the defendant the indictment under which the defendant was charged omitted a fact that enhanced the maximum sentence he could receive.see cotton,at.
the supreme court endorsement of plain error review in booker is also consistent with rule b of the federal rules of criminal procedure which provides that a plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court attention.fed.crim.b.thus we think it appropriate to apply plain error review in this instance,see also united states ameline,cir reviewing for plain error a sixth amendment claim not raised at trial but raised on appeal pursuant to blakely,just as we already have in similar contexts.see united states stewart,cir holding that a constitutional challenge to a federal sentence,although not available at the time of sentencing because the supreme court decision in jones united states,d had not yet issued,must be reviewed for plain error.
under the plain error test,before an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial,there must be error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.johnson united states,d quoting united states olano,d see also cotton,at.if we find that all three conditions are met,we may then exercise our discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.johnson,at.quoting olano,at.cotton,at.
we do not find it difficult to conclude that sharn sentence was the result of plain error.to address the first two requirements of plain error review,we note that where,as is the case here,the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal,it is enough that an error be plain at the time of appellate consideration johnson,at.accordingly,the imposition of a sentence in excess of the maximum authorized by the facts sharn admitted was a plain error.see booker,at.at holding that such sentences violate the sixth amendment.it is equally clear that the error affected sharn substantial rights.as the supreme court has reasoned,this usually means that the error must have been prejudicial it must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.olano,at.see also cotton,at.in sharn case the error determined the outcome of the district court proceedings in the sense that the sentence sharn under mandatory on the consideration of facts he did not admit and which were not proven to a jury.indeed,sharn month sentence is months longer than the maximum sentence authorized by the facts he admitted when he pled guilty.we decline to hypothesize alternative sentences the district court might have imposed had it anticipated booker.it is clear that had the district court not found facts on its own at sentencing,which under booker constitutes a violation of the sixth amendment,sharn sentence would have been materially different.just as we have held that unwarranted reductions of sentences affect substantial rights,see united states bostic,cir a sentencing error affects substantial rights when it affects the outcome of the case by substantially reducing the defendant sentence.citation omitted,we must hold that unconstitutional enhancements of sentences do so as well.
finally,we further conclude that it is proper for us to consider the merits of sharn admittedly forfeited claim because,under booker,sentencing a defendant on the basis of judicial is an error that seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.johnson,at.quoting olano,at.significantly,this is not a case where a jury considered overwhelming evidence tending to attribute more than grams of cocaine base to sharn.cotton,at.finding no plain error where the evidence at trial that the conspiracy involved at least grams of cocaine base was overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted footnote omitted.instead,like booker,this is a case where the judge alone found the facts that determined the defendant sentence.see booker,at.at the jury never heard any evidence of the additional drug quantity,and the judge found it true by a preponderance of the evidence.as we have made clear,sharn sentence was materially enhanced as a result of a sixth amendment violation.we are satisfied that an error of this sort seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.johnson,at.quoting olano,at.see also bostic,at a sentencing error that leads to a substantial departure affects the fairness and integrity of judicial proceedings because permitting sentencing courts to disregard governing law would diminish the integrity and public reputation of the judicial system quoting united states,cir.
accordingly,we hold that the district court committed plain error when it sentenced sharn to months of imprisonment.by pleading guilty,sharn admitted involvement with no more than grams of cocaine base,which supports a base offense level of.furthermore,sharn did not admit he possessed a firearm or was an organizer of a criminal activity.with his criminal history category of ii,therefore,the maximum lawful sentence under booker is months.see sentencing table.consequently,we remand sharn case for in light of booker.
in addition,we note that our plain error analysis is in step with the decision of our court in united states oliver,wl cir.oliver,which is the first published opinion interpreting booker for the sixth circuit and therefore controls in this case found plain error where the defendant sentence exceeded the maximum authorized by the jury verdict and his prior convictions.see oliver.at,wl,at.this result is consistent with the fourth circuit controlling interpretation of booker.see united states hughes,cir.the error at sharn it was in oliver and the imposition of a mandatory sentence based upon judicial in excess of the maximum authorized without judicial.we are aware that two circuits have concluded that because the supreme court remedy was to render the guidelines advisory,rather than to invalidate them in toto or graft onto them a sentencing jury requirement,sixth amendment violations may not constitute plain error.see united states rodriguez,wl cir,united states crosby,wl cir.indeed,it appears that in the eleventh circuit,most sixth amendment errors will not result in remands for resentencing because the appealing defendant will not be able to demonstrate a reasonable probability that he was prejudiced by the booker error.see rodriguez,wl.the second circuit approach will be to remand to the district court in all cases.see crosby,at,wl,at.under crosby,however,the district court is not to automatically resentence but instead must itself conduct a plain or harmless error inquiry in order to determine whether it ought to resentence the defendant.see id.
in our judgment,a critical aspect of booker has escaped the eleventh and second circuits thinking on these,that the supreme court remanded booker case for resentencing.it is certainly our obligation as courts of appeal to carefully consider what the supreme court said in booker.nevertheless,we can not ignore what the court did.at the very least,a remand for resentencing of booker must rest on a decision that the error in his case was reversible,was not harmless and affected booker substantial rights.see fed.crim.a any error that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.in fact,as our colleagues observed in oliver,we can safely conclude that,in the ordinary case,a sixth amendment violation affects substantial rights.see oliver,at,wl,at noting that booker presumes that any sixth amendment error is not harmless see also booker,at.at i n cases not involving a sixth amendment violation,whether resentencing is warranted or whether it will instead be sufficient to review a sentence for reasonableness may depend upon application of the doctrine.but the supreme court treatment of booker case may suggest something more.it turns out that booker did not make a sixth amendment objection to his sentence in the district court.in fact,booker sixth amendment challenge first appeared in a supplemental brief to the seventh circuit,which he filed soon after the supreme court decision in blakely.the government pointed this out in its petition for certiorari,see pet.for,wl,at,but,inexplicably,the supreme court did not address whether booker sentence was plain error.yet the most reasonable reading of the court disposition of booker case suggests that the court thought it was.after all,in booker,the supreme court quite explicitly instructs reviewing courts to determine whether an appealing defendant made a sixth amendment argument in the district court and to review for plain error if he did not.see booker,at.at.we can not fathom why the court would not follow its own instruction,although it may be for the simple,and strange,reason that the seventh circuit declined to address the question of plain error because the government apparently did not raise the issue.see united states booker,cir 
still,it would be improper for us to assume that booker sentence was plain error because the court did not say that it was.instead,the court simply remanded booker case for resentencing,having found that his sentence violated the sixth amendment.as we indicate supra,this the very a holding that sentencing booker in a manner that violated the sixth amendment affected his substantial rights.it is hard to see how the eleventh circuit decision in rodriguez is consistent with this result.in rodriguez,the court centered its plain error analysis on whether the defendant,whose sentence violated the sixth amendment,could show that the constitutional violation prejudiced him.see rodriguez,at,wl.as we have made clear,both by way of its analysis of the sixth amendment issue and by way of its disposition of the remand for supreme court held that booker was prejudiced by the constitutional violation in his case finally,we note that just as rodriguez appears to conflict with booker,so,too,does crosby,albeit less dramatically.the supreme court in booker instructed reviewing courts to determine whether a sentencing error was plain.we think this precludes the ingenious approach adopted by the second circuit in crosby.the supreme court phrased its instructions to reviewing courts in terms of what has long been accepted practice in the federal courts and did not suggest that this accepted practice must change in the wake of booker.indeed,in booker the supreme court itself reviewed booker case and remanded for resentencing it did not see fit to remand to the district court to determine in the first instance whether resentencing was warranted.consequently,we think it proper that the court of appeals itself review a claimed error for whether it is plain,or whether it is harmless,and remand for resentencing in appropriate cases.sharn is such a case and we are confident that a remand for resentencing is the correct result under booker.
james also submitted a supplemental brief to the effect that his sentence is inconsistent with the sixth amendment.however,james did not receive a sentence in excess of the maximum sentence authorized by the facts he admitted in his guilty plea.james received a sentence of months of imprisonment.because he pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of at least grams of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base,james base offense level was see c.with his criminal history category of iii,the maximum sentence allowable under,under the facts james be months.see sentencing table see also booker,at.at holding that the sixth amendment requires sentences to be based on facts admitted by the defendant or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.consequently,it is clear that the sentence james actually received is lower than the maximum sentence permitted under booker.therefore,james is not entitled to on the grounds that his sentence violates the sixth amendment 
we now consider the argument of both defendants that the district court violated in calculating their base offense levels.we held supra that sharn case must be remanded for in light of booker because he did not admit to involvement with kilograms of cocaine base,nor to possessing a firearm,nor to being an organizer of a criminal activity.in contrast,we held that,under booker,james sentence is consistent with the sixth amendment.these holdings do not dispose of the case.we must still address both defendants claims that the court violated of the guidelines in determining the amount of cocaine base attributable to them.section of the guidelines prohibits use of a defendant proffer statements in determining his sentencing range.see.in booker,the supreme court rendered the sentencing guidelines.see booker,at.at severing the portions of the guidelines that made them mandatory.nevertheless,the court held,the guidelines are to be considered by the district courts w
