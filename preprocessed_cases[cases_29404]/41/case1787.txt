the administrative committee sought reimbursement from the settlement proceeds for the benefits it had paid on behalf of jose,relying on a provision in the associate benefits book that gives the plan the right to recover or subrogate percent of the benefits paid or to be paid by the plan for covered persons where there has been a judgment,settlement or payment made or to be made,because of an accident.id.at.the associate benefits book also obligates covered persons to cooperate in order to guarantee reimbursement to the plan.id.the gamboas refused to reimburse the plan out of the settlement proceeds,asserting that jose written release rendered the settlement proceeds solely for the benefit of his wife and children.the administrative committee rejected this argument,asserting that the associate benefits book clearly creates a right of reimbursement whenever settlement proceeds are paid because of an accident,as occurred in this case.

the district court refused to enforce the administrative committee decision to seek reimbursement as provided in the associate benefits book.the district court concluded that the associate benefits book did not fit within the plan wrap document definition of a welfare program,and thus,the committee decision to treat it as a plan document was contrary to the plain language of the plan wrap document.the court granted summary judgment to the gamboas and dismissed the case with prejudice.the administrative committee appeals,arguing that the district court erred in not deferring to its reasonable interpretation of the plan.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,using the same standard as the district court,and we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see alliant techsystems,marks,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the evidence of record demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.the plan wrap document gives the administrative committee,as the plan administrator,complete discretion to interpret the terms of the plan.accordingly,we are limited to reviewing the administrative committee interpretation of the plan for an abuse of discretion.see kennedy.pac,cir stating,w e review de novo the district court application of the abuse of discretion standard to a plan administrator interpretation of an employee benefit plan.where the plan administrator offers a reasonable interpretation of a plan,the district court should not substitute a different,though also reasonable,interpretation that could have been made.see clapp citibank,disability plan,cir cash group health plan,cir.in applying an abuse of discretion standard,we must affirm if a reasonable person could have reached a similar decision,given the evidence before him,not that a reasonable person would have reached that decision.groves metro.life ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
