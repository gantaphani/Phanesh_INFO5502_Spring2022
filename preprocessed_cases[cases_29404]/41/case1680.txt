david riehm was a high school student who wrote an essay detailing a fantasy inspired by the school shooting that took place at columbine high school in littleton,colorado.he left the essay with his teacher,who read it and reported it to law enforcement.he was taken from his home in cook county,minnesota,by court order,underwent a psychiatric evaluation and was released after hours.he and his mother,colleen riehm,brought this lawsuit against cook county and two of its employees,steven diercks and ann debevec collectively,the county defendants,seeking damages on the grounds that david detention violated his first amendment right to free speech and fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures and colleen fourteenth amendment right to familial integrity,and that the county failure to pay david medical bills violated colleen fourteenth amendment substantive due process right,as well as minnesota state law.the district court granted the county defendants motions for dismissal and summary judgment,and the riehms appeal for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
background 
in january,david was seventeen years old and a student at cook county high school in grand marais,minnesota.during ann mershon creative writing class,david wrote three essays that mershon found disturbing,the last of which mershon viewed as a personal threat.
david first essay,poor john redfield,written in the fall of,described a student who had a nocturnal emission,fell and penetrated his anus on a toy,slipped on his own blood and was run over by a bus,which collapsed his head in a red misty explosion.according to david,the moral of the story was do have wet dreams or you die a horrible death.mershon returned the essay with comments indicating that she found it offensive and wanted him to make changes.
david wrote his second essay,consisting of two parts,view number one and view number two,around the same time.in view number one,he wrote that he usually thought about life in general,and you know,life is not g rated.there is violence,language,sexual content everywhere.he stated,violence is on the news,that does mean its sic pornography.in view number two,he criticized an old fashioned,narrow minded,uncreative,paranoid,jealous english teacher pejoratively named cuntchenson.he described her as an old cranky teacher,with absolutely no comprehension whatsoever of life.he wrote,from her perspective,if a particular student writes about a violent or gory story,then of course i automatically assume that they have a problem with obsessive focus on sex and potty language.mershon read the essay and informed david that they should talk about it.mershon discussed the first two essays with david mother,colleen,at a conference and believed that the issue had been resolved.
david titled his third essay bowling for cuntchenson.the essay called cuntchenson a bitch who is way out of line.the is expelled from cuntchenson english class and dreams about a smoking gun next to a clump of blood matted hair.the hair belonged to an unrecognizable head.the student wakes up,packs his bag and begins an interesting day.he eats alone in the cafeteria like a prisoner sentenced to death.sitting alone,trying to force down their sic last meal into their sic nervously wrecked and knotted stomach,knowing all to sic well their sic wasted life will be ended shortly.in cuntchenson class,he finds himself unable to free myself from her satantic grip and is kicked out of her class,leaving in a fit of rage,ready to explode out like a million shards of glass in search of flesh to mangle.he stumbles into a church and bumps into a gun taped underneath a pew.maybe it was a sign,a sign from god,a sign that i should do something.then i got the most horrific idea that i had ever had,but yet,maybe it was the best.the student then,on a mission,returns to school where the other students had no idea of what was about to happen.the student raises the gun,aims at cuntchenson and smirks at the wide eyed look horror sic in her face.he winces as the bullet replaced her left eye.in an instant a red mist was produced from the wound,followed by a stead sic flow of blood,tissue,and bone fragments.i felt the warm mist speckle onto my face.the splatter distance was incredible.the student licks his lips and tastes b lood too,her blood,her blood that i had spilt.the student then commits suicide and concludes,it was all totally worth it.the narrator fades to a movie theater,where he leaves with his friends and discusses the movie they just watched,presumably bowling for columbine 
mershon required students to submit essays in a personal folder she established for each student in a filing cabinet in her classroom.david alleges that he completed his third essay in early october before placing it in his folder in the filing cabinet.mershon claims she did not see david third essay until the weekend of january and.when she read it,she felt threatened,scared and hurt.she reported her concerns to the school principal,john engelking.engelking suspended david on monday,january.engelking called colleen to inform her of david suspension.
engelking and mershon gave david essays to cook county deputy sheriff joseph zallar.zallar took a statement from mershon and gave her statement and the essays to assistant cook county attorney michael boese and to the cook county department of health and human services.steven diercks,a cook county social worker,discussed david essays with zallar and boese.diercks opened a child welfare assessment case with the approval of his supervisor,ann debevec.
on january,diercks prepared two petitions,one for a child in need of protection or services chips petition,and the other an ex parte petition for emergency protective care ex parte petition.diercks based his chips petition on david essays,particularly the third essay veiled threat and many threats,and upon mershon statement that she feels very threatened and is very afraid about what this student may do.diercks stated that david was a child in need of protection or services,one whose behavior,condition,or environment is such as to be injurious or dangerous to the child or others,subd.
ordinarily,after a chips petition has been filed,the parties appear before the court voluntarily,or the court issues a summons for a hearing concerning the allegations,subd.an exception exists,however,that allows immediate custody of a child prior to a hearing for emergency protective care.the statute provides that,
if the court makes individualized,explicit findings,based on the notarized petition or sworn affidavit,that there are reasonable grounds to believe the child is in surroundings or conditions which endanger the child health,safety,or welfare that require that responsibility for the child care and custody be immediately assumed by the responsible social services agency and that continuation of the child in the custody of the parent or guardian is contrary to the child welfare,the court may order that the officer serving the summons take the child into immediate custody for placement of the child in foster care.
subd.see.juv.prot,subd.b.diercks prepared an ex parte petition for emergency protective care referring to this provision.the ex parte petition also relied on the contents of david three essays as well as mershon concerns and concluded that immediately taking david into protective custody was warranted.boese personal notes indicated that he found no basis for criminal prosecution or civil commitment and that the essays may have been in mershon filing cabinet for,but his notes also indicated that he believed a chips petition would be appropriate.
diercks and boese signed both sworn petitions.diercks then submitted the petitions to cook county district court judge kenneth sandvik.that day,january,judge sandvik executed an order ex parte order authorizing david immediate detention at miller dwan adolescent mental health unit and scheduled an emergency protective care hearing for january.that evening,diercks and zallar went to the riehms home,seized david,and placed him in protective custody.
diercks and zallar transported david to duluth,minnesota,approximately miles from his home.because miller dwan was full,david was placed in the adult psychiatric ward at nearby luke hospital.the following night,january,an ambulance service transferred him to miller dwan.peder svingen,a psychiatrist,examined david on january and concluded that he suffered from adjustment disorder but was not mentally ill or dangerous.david remained in detention at miller dwan that night.david was transported to court on january for his hearing.at the hearing,boese recommended unconditional dismissal of the chips petition,which the court granted,and david was returned to colleen custody.
colleen did not pay the medical bills from miller dwan,luke,or the ambulance service,totaling.debevec wrote colleen and requested the riehms health insurance information.she explained that cook county policy required patients to submit health insurance information and that any bills unpaid by the insurance company would then be paid by the county.miller dwan sent a similar letter and warned that if she refused to provide her insurance information,her account would change to status.the ambulance service also sent a letter and warned of future collection efforts.miller dwan collection agency made a negative credit inquiry against colleen.colleen claims that her bank denied a consolidation loan to her on account of that negative credit inquiry,which cost her in interest she would have saved over five years.
the riehms brought suit under for constitutional violations and under minnesota law.david alleged that his first amendment right to free speech was violated because he was detained based on the contents of his creative writing essay.he also argued that his detention violated his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures because diercks could not have relied upon the ex parte order in good faith,diercks ex parte petition contained material omissions,and the detention was executed unreasonably.colleen asserted that her fourteenth amendment right to familial integrity was violated when david was taken,and she claimed that cook county failure to pay david medical bills violated substantive due process under the fourteenth amendment.they also brought state law tort and constitutional claims.the district court granted the county defendants motions for dismissal and summary judgment.the riehms appeal 
ii.discussion 
the county defendants successfully moved for judgment on the pleadings or for summary judgment.the district court did not explicitly state on which basis it made its decision.the riehms argue that the district court dismissed the claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.however,if matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court,the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under rule.fed civ.d see gibb scott,cir.in this case,after the riehms filed their amended complaint,they offered four affidavits from colleen and affidavits from david,six of david classmates,and a newspaper reporter,along with declarations from the riehms attorney.several creative writing samples from david classmates were submitted.the record also contains numerous other pieces of evidence,including boese notes composed prior to the application for the ex parte order,svingen examination notes,a transcript of the chips hearing,diercks subsequent resignation from his social worker position,and newspaper articles discussing the incident.the county defendants and the riehms relied on this evidence in their filings,and the district court considered and cited the evidence in its order.because the riehms presented evidence outside the pleadings that the district court considered,we will review the district court decision as a grant of summary judgment 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.russell hennepin county,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.we view the facts in the light most favorable to the party.id.
federal claims 
in a action,state actors may be entitled to qualified immunity.qualified immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.malley briggs,d.we first ask whether the plaintiff allegations establish a violation of the constitution.sherbrooke city of pelican rapids,cir.if there is no violation,then we need not inquire further.hayek city of paul,cir.if there is a constitutional violation,we ask whether it was clearly established at the time of the violation such that a reasonable person would have known that his actions violated a constitutional right.sherbrooke,at.
as a preliminary matter,we find that the riehms have not presented sufficient evidence regarding any first or fourth amendment violations by cook county or by diercks supervisor,ann debevec.the county can not be held vicariously liable for its agents actions under.see monell dep t of soc,d.instead,the riehms must identify a county policy or custom that caused their injuries,which they fail to do.see brockinton city of sherwood,cir.additionally,a supervisor may be held individually liable under if s he directly participates in the constitutional violation or if s he fails to train or supervise the subordinate who caused the violation.brockinton,at.the riehms present no evidence that debevec was directly involved in the alleged constitutional violations or that she failed to train or supervise diercks therefore,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to debevec and the county,and our analysis focuses on the actions of diercks.
first amendment claim 
david claims that he was seized and detained in retaliation for the exercise of his free speech rights under the first amendment.the first amendment does not protect a true threat,a statement that a reasonable recipient would have interpreted as a serious expression of an intent to harm or cause injury to another.doe pulaski county special sch,cir en banc.additionally,david speech occurred in the special context of the school environment,where schools may regulate some speech even though the government could not censor similar speech outside the school.see morse frederick,d internal quotation omitted.
in pulaski,a student received a letter from her expressing the desire to molest,rape and murder her.the author wrote that he intended to lie under the student bed with a knife and kill her in her sleep.even though the letter was composed months before the student received it and even though the student received the letter from a third party rather than directly from the author,we concluded that the letter was a true threat and would not receive first amendment protection.pulaski,at.we emphasized that in the wake of columbine and jonesboro,we expect reasonable school officials to take some action based on violent and disturbing content.id.at.the school board expelled the author,and we found that the expulsion did not violate the first amendment.the letter exhibited pronounced,contemptuous and depraved hate for the student and contained numerous obscenities.id.at.we noted that the letter was extremely intimate and personal,containing violence directed unequivocally at the student,and that the author never attempted to alleviate the student concerns.see also ponce socorro indep.sch,cir concluding that a student creative writing diary that described a group,injuries to students,and a shooting was not protected by the first amendment.
while david lacked the history of violent tendencies we found relevant to the true threat analysis in pulaski,the other factors considered in our analysis establish that david third essay qualifies as a true threat.while the author of the threat in pulaski did not give his letter to the subject of the threat,david provided his essays directly to mershon,and he submitted them on the school campus.his first essay,discussing a student nocturnal emission,penetrating his anus on a toy,slipping on his own blood,and getting run over by a bus,contained troublesome descriptions.although his second and third essays do not specifically name mershon or david,the context of these essays leaves little doubt that david was referring to mershon and himself.his second essay reflected hatred for mershon,pejoratively naming her cuntchenson and criticizing her as,uncreative,paranoid,and jealous.his third essay went significantly farther and expressed,in graphic terms,a plan to kill her and himself.the details of the in the essay occur in the context of references to the movie bowling for columbine.david begins the essay with a dream about a gun and eating lunch like a prisoner sentenced to death.after his satanic visit to his teacher class,he feels a sign from god as he takes a gun from church.david mentions that other students had no idea of what was about to happen.he describes the murder of his teacher in gruesome detail,including shattering her eye with a bullet and licking her blood from his lips.he then describes the shooter suicide.this lengthy essay describing an obsession with weapons and gore,a hatred for his english teacher with a similar name who had been critical of his prior essays,a surprise attack at a high school,and the details of his teacher murder and the narrator suicide lead to the inescapable conclusion that it was a serious threat directed at mershon.although the third essay was allegedly written months earlier,just like the letter in pulaski,mershon reacted immediately after she received it,and she quite reasonably felt personally threatened.we conclude that as in pulaski,david third essay constitutes a true threat and is not protected under the first amendment.
fourth amendment claim 
the district court applied the rooker feldman doctrine to david fourth amendment claim and held that it is not the role of this court to oversee the propriety of the state judge decision to issue the order.riehm engelking,wl,at.if the rooker feldman doctrine applies,federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction.simes huckabee,cir.we review the district court determination of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.simes,at.
rooker feldman is a narrow doctrine.lance dennis,d.it applies only to cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d.the rooker feldman doctrine may be inapplicable where federal plaintiffs have not been given a reasonable opportunity to raise their federal claims in the state proceedings.simes,at see skit,dac techs.of,cir.rooker feldman does not apply where the federal plaintiff was not a party in state court.lance,at.
we conclude that the rooker feldman doctrine does not apply to david fourth amendment claim.first,the riehms could not be considered parties to the ex parte petition.they had no opportunity to participate in the state court proceeding,either the chips petition proceeding prior to the february hearing or the ex parte petition proceeding in which the court issued the ex parte order.second,the riehms do not seek to overturn the ex parte order by this action.rather,they seek redress under for an alleged unconstitutional seizure of david.it is possible for a action to implicate rooker feldman.see,prince.bd.of exam rs in psychology,cir holding that after plaintiff litigated revocation of his psychology license in state court,he could not bring a federal suit under alleging additional claims.nevertheless,as the ninth circuit has explained 
if a federal plaintiff asserts as a legal wrong an allegedly erroneous decision by a state court,and seeks relief from a state court judgment based on that decision,rooker feldman bars subject matter jurisdiction in federal district court.if,on the other hand,a federal plaintiff asserts as a legal wrong an allegedly illegal act or omission by an adverse party,rooker feldman does not bar jurisdiction.
noel hall,cir cited favorably in exxon,at.david claim is actually an independent claim,because it alleges unconstitutional actions by diercks in seeking and executing the ex parte order.see exxon,at.the riehms are not challenging the state court issuance of the ex parte order.therefore,the rooker feldman doctrine does not apply.
turning to the merits of david fourth amendment claim,we explained in heartland academy community church waddle that the fourth amendment requires that the protective seizure of children occur pursuant to a court order,or,in the absence of a court order,pursuant to probable cause or exigent circumstances,cir.in this case,diercks acted pursuant to a court order.he prepared and filed the ex parte petition and the chips petition with a detached and neutral judge who signed the ex parte order authorizing david seizure.
david argues that diercks could not rely in good faith on the ex parte order because the order was so lacking in the indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence unreasonable.see malley,at.citing united states leon,d.he argues that the petitions were so lacking in an adequate basis to show that david welfare was in danger and that custody with colleen was contrary to his welfare that diercks could not reasonably rely on judge sandvik issuance of the ex parte order.see,subd.if an officer relies on an ex parte order in good faith,then he is entitled to qualified immunity.malley,at.in assessing good faith reliance on an order,we consider the totality of the circumstances,including any information known to the officer but not included in the affidavit.united states grant,cir,cert.denied,d.officers can have reasonable,but mistaken,beliefs as to the facts establishing the existence of probable cause or exigent circumstances,for example,and in those situations courts will not hold that they have violated the constitution.saucier katz,d.
diercks seized david pursuant to an ex parte order duly issued by cook county district court judge sandvik pursuant to minnesota law,a law that authorizes the removal of children from parental custody in any case in which continued custody poses an immediate threat to the child health or welfare.see county of crow wing,cir finding that the minnesota child protection statute is not limited to instances of abuse or neglect investigations.the ex parte petition extensively detailed that david essays were disturbingly violent,that the essays grew more personalized towards mershon,that the third essay was a veiled threat towards mershon,that the essay included many threats toward his teacher,that the student in the essay shoots the teacher in a fit of rage as a directive from god,and that mershon felt very threatened and very afraid because of the obvious parallels between david essay and her own relationship with david.in addition to the contents of the ex parte petition,diercks was aware of mershon report to law enforcement that she had spoken to colleen about david first and second essays and believed they were on the right track until she subsequently read the bowling for cuntchenson essay.diercks had a reasonable basis to believe that david apparent threat to murder mershon and commit suicide placed david welfare at risk and that allowing david to remain in his mother custody,in light of mershon previous ineffective discussion with colleen about the first two essays,was contrary to his welfare.the ex parte order was not so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render diercks reliance on it unreasonable.therefore,diercks good faith reliance on the ex parte order was reasonable.
david also claims that diercks omitted material facts from the ex parte petition and that had this information been included,judge sandvik would not have issued the ex parte order a warrant based upon an affidavit containing deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth violates the fourth amendment.bagby brondhaver,cir quoting franks delaware,d.the party challenging the ex parte petition must show that the petitioner omitted facts with the intent to mislead or with reckless disregard for the truth and that the ex parte petition,if supplemented by the omitted information,would not have been sufficient to support a finding of probable cause.id.at.
david argues that our heartland decision is analogo
