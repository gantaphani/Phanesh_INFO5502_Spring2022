during the next several years,webb continued to suffer from lower back pain and hypertension.he went on and off a variety of medications.although some had positive results,their side effects were often intolerable.because of his ailments and the side effects of their treatment,webb stopped working.

relevant legal framework 
the social security act defines disability as the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.d a.a claimant bears the burden of establishing disability under the act.tackett apfel,cir.to determine whether a claimant has established disability,an alj must evaluate the evidence adduced by following a,sequential analysis.at step one,the alj examines whether the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful employment activity.id.a i.at step two,the alj assesses whether the claimant has a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments that significantly limits his ability to do basic work activities.id.a ii.the ability to do basic work activities is defined as the abilities and aptitudes necessary to do most jobs.b.for purposes of webb petition,the most relevant activities include the ability to perform physical functions such as walking,sitting,lifting,pushing,pulling,reaching,carrying,or handling.id.an impairment is not severe if it is merely a slight abnormality or combination of slight abnormalities that has no more than a minimal effect on the ability to do basic work activities.p.if the alj finds that the claimant lacks a medically severe impairment,the alj must find the claimant not to be disabled.however,if the alj concludes that the claimant does have a medically severe impairment,the alj proceeds to the next steps in the sequence.
steps three through five require the alj to evaluate whether the claimant impairment satisfies certain statutory requirements entitling him to a disability finding.if the impairment does not,the alj must assess whether the claimant remains capable of doing his prior work or engaging in alternative employment.a iii v.
findings by the alj 
in assessing webb petition,the alj first determined that webb was not engaged in any gainful employment activity.at step two,the alj found that webb did not have a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments prior to the lapse in his insurance coverage in.having made that finding,the alj ended his inquiry because there was no way that webb could prove he was disabled within the meaning of the act.it is this preemptive finding that webb challenges.
an impairment or combination of impairments may be found not severe only if the evidence establishes a slight abnormality that has no more than a minimal effect on an individual ability to work.smolen,at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added see yuckert bowen,cir.the commissioner has stated that i f an adjudicator is unable to determine clearly the effect of an impairment or combination of impairments on the individual ability to do basic work activities,the sequential evaluation should not end with the not severe evaluation step.step two,then,is a de minimis screening device used to dispose of groundless claims,smolen,at,and an alj may find that a claimant lacks a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments only when his conclusion is clearly established by medical evidence.thus,applying our normal standard of review to the requirements of step two,we must determine whether the alj had substantial evidence to find that the medical evidence clearly established that webb did not have a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments.see also yuckert,at despite the deference usually accorded to the secretary application of regulations,numerous appellate courts have imposed a narrow construction upon the severity regulation applied here.
in this case,the alj found that webb lacked a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments despite objective medical evidence demonstrating back pain,hypertension,knee pain,hip pain,visual disturbances,memory loss,diverticulitis,lack of sleep,difficulty performing physical tasks and lack of employment from through.although the medical record paints an incomplete picture of webb overall health during the relevant period,it includes evidence of problems sufficient to pass the de minimis threshold of step two.see smolen,at.and although webb ultimately bears the burden of establishing his disability,see bowen,at,the alj had an affirmative duty to supplement webb medical record,to the extent it was incomplete,before rejecting webb petition at so early a stage in the analysis.see e.in social security cases the alj has a special duty to fully and fairly develop the record and to assure that the claimant interests are considered.brown heckler,cir per curiam.the alj duty to supplement a claimant record is triggered by ambiguous evidence,the alj own findin
