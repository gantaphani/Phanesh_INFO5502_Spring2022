is a child with educational disabilities who attends minneapolis public schools in minnesota special school district the district.the individuals with disabilities education act idea provides that is entitled to a free appropriate public education fape that includes special education and related services tailored to her unique needs.see d a.in may,dissatisfied with the results of a mediation agreement,parent,requested a due process hearing under idea and state law.see f,subd.alleged that the district had imposed suspensions,exclusions,and administrative transfers that denied her right to a fape during the and school years.
after a hearing,the state administrative law judge alj determined that the district violated the idea in both school years and awarded hours of compensatory educational services.then filed this action seeking an award of costs and attorney fees.see i b.the district filed a counterclaim,challenging the alj decision.the district court reduced the compensatory services award by eight hours and awarded substantial costs and attorney fees.special sch.dist,wl.the district appeals.reviewing the district court ultimate determination that did not receive a fape de novo,we reverse.see cjn minneapolis pub,cir,cert.denied,d standard of review.
i.the burden of proof issue 
consistent with minnesota law,the alj ruled that the district must prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that it is complying with the law and offered or provided a fape to the child in the least restrictive environment,subd.following the hearing,the supreme court held that,if state law is silent,the burden of persuasion in an idea proceeding lies with the party seeking relief,here,schaffer weast,d.the court declined to decide whether this rule would apply in states such as minnesota that explicitly assign the burden elsewhere.id.at.however,we subsequently held that it was error to assign the burden of persuasion to a minnesota school district in an action to enforce the procedural and substantive requirements of the idea.school bd.of renollett,cir.
though schaffer and renollett were decided after the due process hearing,they apply to this pending case.see harper.of taxation,d.the district court noted but declined to follow our decision in renollett,concluding that a close reading of schaffer does not support the idea preemption of minnesota law on this point,wl at.this was fundamental error.our decision in renollett is controlling until overruled by our court en banc,by the supreme court,or by congress.though the district court described our discussion of the issue as cursory,our opinion in renollett cited the page in schaffer that left the question open,and we then decided the question for the courts of this circuit.
placing the burden of proof on the incorrect party is reversible error unless the error relates to an immaterial issue.west platte sch.dist.wilson,cir citations omitted.we further conclude that the alj award of compensatory educational services and the district court award of attorneys fees under the idea must be reversed on the merits.
ii.the school year 
emotional and behavioral issues were noted as a secondary disability when began receiving special educational services in the third grade.serious behavioral issues emerged in april,during her sixth grade year,when she brought a four and inch serrated steak knife to franklin middle school.explained that she brought it to school in response to threats by two female classmates.an assistant principal recommended that be expelled.instead,the district provided her homebound instruction for the remainder of that school year and transferred her to the lucy laney community school laney that fall.
when began the school year at laney,the district at request educational needs and performance and concluded that she continued to be eligible for special educational services.the evaluation identified emotional,social,and behavior as now being primary disability,snap her secondary disability and speech language an additional disability.the november individualized education program iep set emotional and behavioral goals addressing frequent talking in class kicking and hitting other students at least eight times a day sleeping and refusing to work three to five days a week and completing just of her assignments.the iep set educational goals in math,reading,and speech articulation,and the iep team developed a behavior intervention plan designed to decrease inappropriate behavior and increase her work completion through closer supervision and tangible reinforcers.
in february,was suspended when she got into a fight with another student and kicked and punched a staff member who intervened.the iep team determined that the setting here at lucy laney is not appropriate,extended the suspension to ten days,and reported that will be transferred to another school.the report stated that left the meeting early upset,but she did not request a due process hearing.was administratively transferred to olson middle school olson on march,where she completed the school year.a june,assessment reported that made adequate progress on her reading and math goals but insufficient progress on her behavioral goals.a social worker at olson testified that made behavioral progress in the spring of.
the alj concluded that was denied a fape during the school year because suspensions from school and the district failure to review and revise her iep before she was transferred from laney to olson caused a loss of educational benefit.the alj awarded twenty hours of compensatory special education services.the district court reduced the award by eight hours but held that failed to make adequate progress toward her goals between november and her transfer to olson in march,and the district violated her fape rights when it did not review and revise the iep prior to the transfer.
in the fall of,enrolled at the colonel charles young military academy,a charter school not part of the district.however,one month later,at olson.relying on three prior decisions the district argues that the alj lacked jurisdiction to hear claims from the school year because,by withdrawing from the district without first requesting a due process hearing,waived her right to challenge educational services provided by the district before the withdrawal.
as the alj and the district court noted,our prior cases involved students who were no longer attending school in the school district when the due process hearing was requested.minnesota law then provided that the hearing be initiated and conducted by and in the district responsible for assuring that an appropriate program is provided,subd.we therefore held that challenges to the student previous education become moot because the new school district is responsible for providing a due process hearing.thompson,at.this was a ruling on the merits failure to state a claim,not a denial of subject matter jurisdiction.here,in the district schools long before requested the due process hearing.the district argument that either the alj or the district court lacked jurisdiction is without merit.
on the other hand,the alj and the district court ignored an additional basis for our decision in thompson 
the purpose of requesting a due process hearing is to challenge an aspect of a child education and to put the school district on notice of a perceived problem.once the school district receives notice,it has the opportunity to address the alleged problem.
at.after was suspended for assaulting another student and a member of the laney staff,left the iep team meeting convened to consider the problem,did not request revisions to iep,did not protest the transfer to olson or request a due process hearing,and then enrolled outside the district that fall.though at olson shortly thereafter,this sequence of events gave the iep team and the district no timely notice of a claim that otherwise appropriate iep should have been revised before her transfer to olson.the idea required the district to revise iep as appropriate to address any lack of expected progress toward the annual goals and in the general education curriculum.d a ii i.input from was a critical par
