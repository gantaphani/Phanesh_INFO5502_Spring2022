appellant avril adams appeals the district court dismissal with prejudice of her complaint against appellees the california department of health services cdhs cdhs employees donnata moreland,la vonne coen,patricia echard,paulette baker,and patrick kennelly and oaktree investigations and its employee,laurence corbin.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm the district court dismissal of adams complaint.
background 
in january,adams applied for a food and drug inspector fdi position with cdhs.food and drug inspectors are peace officers and carry firearms investigate violations make arrests and travel to food storage,processing facilities,and farms.adams was offered the position she sought,but her actual hiring was conditioned upon her successful completion of a background investigation,including medical and psychological evaluations.
adams passed the psychological evaluation,but stephen weyers notified her that he had recommended restrictions on her ability to perform activities that required maximal exertion and balance.cdhs then advised adams it was unable to accommodate her medical restrictions,and it withdrew the conditional job offer.thereafter,adams took a new treadmill stress test,and weyers medically approved her without limitation for the food and drug investigator position.
cdhs then withdrew its medical disqualification of adams and notified her it would resume her selection process.adams objected to further investigation.thereafter,on march,cdhs sent adams a letter notifying her that it had rescinded its conditional offer of employment.four days later,on march,the state personnel board spb ruled on adams appeal of weyers decision to disqualify her for medical reasons.because weyers had subsequently approved her,the spb granted adams appeal and advised her she would be appointed to the fdi position within days unless she was unsuccessful in the balance of the selection process.
according to adams,cdhs then engaged oaktree investigations to interview cdhs employees about adams behavior during the selection process.laurence corbin of oaktree investigations interviewed cdhs employees echard,kennelly,moreland,coen,and baker on march,and memorialized the results of the interviews in a report dated april.
on april,adams filed a petition for rehearing with the spb,arguing that she should be appointed to the fdi position immediately because the selection process ended when she was deemed medically qualified.cdhs filed a response to adams petition on may,stating that it withdrew adams conditional offer of employment the second time because,during the completion of the investigation process,questions arose regarding adams suitability as a peace officer.the response detailed adams behavior during the selection process,which behavior included challenging a cdhs employee to a race during the spb hearing making numerous phone calls and sending emails and letters to cdhs employees in which adams tone was rude,discourteous,abrupt,angry,and challenging in a demeaning way.the response concluded that adams did not possess the interpersonal skills,sound judgment,or the ability to follow directions necessary for being an effective peace officer.the spb denied adams petition for rehearing on june.
adams filed a complaint in state court on november,naming cdhs,coen,moreland,and weyers as defendants.adams asserted claims for retaliation in violation of violations of the americans with disabilities act,and the california fair employment and housing act,cal.gov t code denial of due process and civil rights in violation of,breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing negligence and declaratory relief.adams sought damages and a declaration from the court that cdhs withdrawal of the conditional offer of employment was unlawful.
adams complaint also detailed the facts behind the reopening of the background investigation to support her claims for negligence,violations of,breach of contract,and declaratory relief.in her complaint,adams did not allege separate claims under the fair credit reporting act fcra,or state privacy law,although she alleged that the act of resuming the background investigation was prejudicial,illegal,unreasonable,discriminatory,retaliatory,and arguably illegal in violation of the fcra and due process.
adams action was removed to federal court on december.adams cal.dep t of health,no.cal.filed.the district court issued a scheduling order setting march,as the deadline for filing motions to amend the complaint or add additional parties.
on july,well past the march,deadline set in the scheduling order,adams filed a motion for leave to amend her complaint.adams wanted to add as defendants oaktree investigations and oaktree investigator corbin,as well as cdhs employees echard,baker,and kennelly.in her proposed amended complaint she alleged four additional claims violation of the fcra violation of the california investigative consumer reporting agencies act icra,cal.infringement of her civil and constitutional rights in violation of,and declaratory relief.
finding that adams failed to demonstrate good cause for the undue delay in seeking leave to amend,and that granting her motion to amend would prejudice the defendants already named in her complaint,the district court denied adams motion as untimely.the action then proceeded to trial,and a jury found in favor of the defendants.adams appealed the denial of her motion for leave to amend,among other issues,to our court.in a memorandum disposition,we affirmed the district court decisions and the judgment in that first case.adams state of cal.dep t of health.cir.
on september,after the district court denied her motion for leave to amend in the first case,adams filed the complaint in this present case.in her complaint in this case,adams set forth the four additional claims she had sought to add by her previously denied motion for leave to amend her complaint in the first case.in the present case,the district court determined that adams newly filed complaint was duplicative of the complaint she had previously filed in the other case,and the court dismissed the new complaint with prejudice.this appeal followed.

iii.discussion 
adams filed her present complaint in an attempt to avoid the consequences of her own delay and to circumvent the district court denial of her untimely motion for leave to amend her first complaint.however,as the tenth circuit stated in hartsel springs ranch of colorado,bluegreen,the fact that plaintiff was denied leave to amend does not give h er the right to file a second lawsuit based on the same facts,cir internal quotation marks omitted.plaintiffs generally have no right to maintain two separate actions involving the same subject matter at the same time in the same court and against the same defendant.walton,at see also curtis,at serlin arthur andersen,cir oliney gardner,cir zerilli evening news ass n,sutcliffe storage warehouse united states,cir.
we find that adams complaint is duplicative of her complaint and,further,that given the circumstances of this case,the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing adams complaint with prejudice 
duplicative complaint 
to determine whether a suit is duplicative,we borrow from the test for claim preclusion.as the supreme court stated in the haytian republic,the true test of the sufficiency of a plea of other suit pending in another forum i s the legal efficacy of the first suit,when finally disposed of,as the thing adjudged,regarding the matters at issue in the second suit.see also hartsel springs ranch,at i n the context,the appropriate inquiry is whether,assuming that the first suit were already final,the second suit could be precluded pursuant to claim preclusion.curtis,at t he normal claim preclusion analysis applies and the court must assess whether the second suit raises issues that should have been brought in the first.davis sun oil,cir per curiam referring to the doctrine against as the other action pending facet of the res judicata doctrine.
thus,in assessing whether the second action is duplicative of the first,we examine whether the causes of action and relief sought,as well as the parties or privies to the action,are the same.see the haytian republic,at.there must be the same parties,or,at least,such as represent the same interests there must be the same rights asserted and the same relief prayed for the relief must be founded upon the same facts,and the essential basis,of the relief sought must be the same.internal quotation marks omitted curtis,at holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing curtis ii claims arising out of the same events as those alleged in curtis i,which claims would have been heard if plaintiffs had timely raised them serlin,at a suit is duplicative if the claims,parties,and available relief do not significantly differ between the two actions.internal quotation marks omitted.
same causes of action 
we examine first whether the causes of action in adams two suits are identical.to ascertain whether successive causes of action are the same,we use the transaction test,developed in the context of claim preclusion.whether two events are part of the same transaction or series depends on whether they are related to the same set of facts and whether they could conveniently be tried together.western,ulloa,cir citing restatement second of judgments.in applying the transaction test,we examine four criteria 
whether rights or interests established in the prior judgment would be destroyed or impaired by prosecution of the second action whether substantially the same evidence is presented in the two actions whether the two suits involve infringement of the same right and whether the two suits arise out of the same transactional nucleus of facts.
costantini trans world airlines,cir.the last of these criteria is the most important.id.at.
here,it is clear that the two actions share a common transactional nucleus of facts.the first complaint detailed the factual allegations surrounding the reopening of adams background investigation and used those allegations to support claims under the legal theories of negligence violations of,breach of contract and declaratory relief.adams first complaint specifically cited as support for her claims against coen,moreland,and weyers under,the same negative comments from cdhs employees during the selection process that she used to support her claims in the present action.the present complaint differs only in that it identifies the cdhs employees who made the negative comments,names those cdhs employees and corbin and oaktree investigations as defendants,and advances two new legal theories of recovery under the fcra and the icra.the two other under,and one seeking declaratory identical to those asserted in the first complaint.as adams herself concedes,the claims in both complaints relate to the same set of facts and form a convenient trial unit because they disclose a cohesive narrative of adams relationship with cdhs and the disputed withdrawal of the conditional job offer after the continuation of the background investigation.mpoyo litton,cir.
in addition,any judgment in the present action necessarily would destroy or impair rights and interests established by the judgment in the first action.as adams alleges in her present complaint,both the fcra and the icra require consent to and disclosure of an investigation.see b cal.civil code.however,the central issues raised in the present complaint surrounding the legality of the reopening of adams background the selection process was complete after adams was medically cleared,whether cdhs lost the right to resume the background investigation when it rescinded for the first time adams conditional offer of employment,or whether the background investigation had never been completed and adams consent to the investigation remained squarely raised and argued by adams in her claim for declaratory relief in the first complaint.
furthermore,although adams argues that the additional report she uncovered on january,written by oaktree investigations and containing affidavits from kennelly,echard,and baker,constitutes new evidence,the report can not be said to be new in any sense because,as adams states in her complaint,it was dated april,and was provided to adams by cdhs during discovery in the first action.in addition,the report is merely cumulative of cdhs response of may,to adams petition for rehearing before the spb,which explained that cdhs had withdrawn adams conditional offer of employment because of her behavior in the balance of the selection process.adams in her first complaint quotes liberally from cdhs response as factual support for her claims.thus,the additional evidentiary detail surrounding echard and baker comments in the oaktree investigations report is scarcely enough to establish that the instant lawsuit arises out of a different transactional nucleus of facts than that which generated the first suit.costantini,at int l union of operating eng constr.indus.pension,welfare training trust funds karr,cir the fact that some different evidence may be presented in this action does not defeat the bar of res judicata.
in addition,the key evidence presented during trial in the first action regarding adams claim of retaliation was the testimony of cdhs employees moreland and coen concerning adams behavior during the selection process.kennelly,echard,baker,and corbin all submitted declarations in the first action regarding the information gathered during the reopened background investigation in support of cdhs motion for summary judgment.as the district court stated in its order denying adams motion for a new trial in the first action,t his case largely turned on the jury assessment of the credibility of the defendants,who explained why they determined not to finalize their conditional offer of employment to adams.
finally,although the fcra and the icra establish distinct rights enforceable by litigants,this factor alone does not differentiate the causes of action.derish san bd.of realtors,cir,overruling on other grounds recognized by eichman fotomat,cir.indeed,in the claim preclusion context,the most significant factor is that the causes of action arise from a common transactional nucleus of facts.see,western,at anderson lemos,cir costantini,at.moreover,adams seeks substantially the same relief in both,exemplary,and punitive damages for the reopening of the background investigation and the withdrawal of her conditional offer of employment,allegedly in violation of her statutory and constitutional rights,and a declaratory judgment that cdhs unlawfully reopened her background investigation and withdrew her conditional offer of employment.
it is clear that the claims in adams present complaint arise out of the same transactional nucleus of facts asserted in her first action and that rights established by the judgment in the first action would be destroyed or impaired by a judgment in the present action.it is also plain that substantially the same evidence was and would be presented in both actions.thus,under the costantini factors,we conclude that the two suits involve the same cause of action.
