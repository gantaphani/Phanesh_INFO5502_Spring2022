this appeal grows out of a medical malpractice action brought under diversity jurisdiction.see a.the district court jettisoned the action at the summary judgment stage.the plaintiffs appeal.discerning no error,we affirm.
background 
we rehearse the facts limned in the summary judgment record,taking them in the light most hospitable to the plaintiffs.alt.concepts,synopsys,cir.we add more detail in our later discussion of the plaintiffs specific claims.to the extent that we refer to the allegations of the complaint,we caution that mere allegations are not entitled to weight in the summary judgment calculus.id.
we start with the cast of characters.the plaintiffs are artemio borges and kimberly wetherell,husband and wife,who sue on behalf of their minor daughter,stephanie marie.there are a plethora of defendants but,for present purposes,the only two who matter are alfonso serrano and hospital interamericano de medicina avanzada the hospital.
serrano practices obstetrics and gynecology in puerto rico.wetherell who,like all the plaintiffs,claims florida citizenship became pregnant,and enlisted serrano services.serrano treated her from and after february.wetherell pregnancy was unremarkable,her prenatal course uneventful,and her prognosis good.
at around on june,wetherell was admitted to the hospital for induction of labor.following wetherell admission,serrano,together with the hospital nurses and other staff,took charge of her care.
serrano decided to deliver the baby by cesarean section.he says that he made this decision because the baseline fetal heart rate,which he characterized as low but within normal limits,indicated the wisdom of this method of delivery.the plaintiffs do not accept this explanation,suggesting that an emergency was required because of the presence of fetal bradycardia that is,a sustained,abnormally low fetal heart rate.
whatever the reason for deciding to deliver the baby by,wetherell signed a consent form for the procedure at.she was taken to an operating room at anesthesia was administered at.she gave birth to stephanie at 
in the course of performing the,serrano discovered an occult cord prolapse.the hospital records show that the was well underway when that discovery occurred.
at birth,stephanie was an apparently healthy baby.she cried and suckled normally.a cranial sonogram,a neurological consultation,and a pulmonary evaluation revealed no problems.
the hospital discharged wetherell on june.it sent stephanie home six days later.
on october,the plaintiffs sued for medical malpractice.the complaint alleges that stephanie has experienced serious physical and neurological deficits,global developmental delay,and low muscle that allegedly require,and will in the future require,continuous physical,occupational,and speech therapies.the complaint attributes these maladies to injuries sustained at birth,specifically,intrapartum anoxia secondary to umbilical cord prolapse and delay in calling for and performing the.
the plaintiffs claimed that serrano was liable for his own negligence and that the hospital was liable both vicariously for serrano carelessness and by virtue of its independent negligence.both the doctor and the hospital denied these claims.
a period of pretrial discovery began,during which both sides retained experts.following the completion of discovery,serrano moved for summary judgment,arguing that he had provided treatment that fully comported with the applicable standard of care and that the plaintiffs had failed to show that any negligence on his part had caused harm to stephanie.two days later,the hospital likewise moved for summary judgment,arguing that the plaintiffs had failed to show a basis for any liability vicarious or direct on its part.
the district court granted both motions.see wetherell hosp.interamericano de medicina avanzada,wetherell ii,d,granting the hospital motion wetherell hosp.interamericano de medicina avanzada,wetherell i,wl,at,granting serrano motion.in its thoughtful opinion allowing serrano motion,the court held that the plaintiffs had failed to show either that serrano had transgressed his duty of care or that a causal nexus existed between serrano conduct and stephanie alleged injuries.wetherell i,wl,at.in a separate opinion,the court held that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the hospital could be found either independently negligent or vicariously liable.wetherell ii,d at.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,the plaintiffs challenge the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of both the hospital and serrano.we first delineate the summary judgment standard then clarify a procedural point and,finally,examine sequentially the two challenged rulings.
a.the summary judgment standard.
we review orders granting summary judgment de novo,considering the facts of record and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see houlton citizens coal.town of houlton,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the undisputed facts show that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
the vocabulary of summary judgment is.an issue is genuine if the evidence of record permits a rational factfinder to resolve it in favor of either party.see reynolds tobacco,cir.a fact is material if its existence or nonexistence has the potential to change the outcome of the suit.see martínez colón,cir.
the moving party bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for his motion and identifying the portions of the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,admissions,and affidavits,if any,that demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact.celotex catrett.once the moving party has accomplished this feat,the burden shifts to the nonmoving party,who must,with respect to each issue on which she would bear the burden of proof at trial,demonstrate that a trier of fact could reasonably resolve that issue in her favor.id.at denovellis shalala,cir.as a general rule,that requires the production of evidence that is significant ly probative.anderson liberty lobby.if the nonmovant fails to make this showing,then summary judgment is appropriate.celotex,at.
b.the deeming order.
the local rules of the united states district court for the district of puerto rico require that parties make certain filings in connection with motions for summary judgment.the movant must support his motion with a separate,short,and concise statement of material facts,set forth in numbered paragraphs,as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue of material fact to be tried.b.each fact asserted in the statement shall be supported by a record citation id.
if the target of the motion chooses to oppose it,she must file with her opposition a separate,short,and concise.c.th is opposing statement shall admit,deny or qualify the facts supporting the motion for summary judgment by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party statement of material facts and unless a fact is admitted,shall support each denial or qualification by a record citation id.
these the movant and the nonmovant must satisfy specific commands 
facts contained in a supporting or opposing statement of material facts,if supported by record citations as required by this rule,shall be deemed admitted unless properly controverted.an assertion of fact set forth in a statement of material facts shall be followed by a citation to the specific page or paragraph of identified record material supporting the assertion.the court may disregard any statement of fact not supported by a specific citation to record material properly considered on summary judgment.the court shall have no independent duty to search or consider any part of the record not specifically referenced in the parties separate statement of facts.
when serrano and the hospital filed their respective summary judgment motions,each of them filed the required statement the plaintiffs filed oppositions,admitting some of the declared facts and purporting to dispute or qualify others.the plaintiffs,however,neglected to observe the strictures of the local rule and omitted appropriate citations to the record with respect to their denials and qualifications.accordingly,the district court deemed admitted the properly supported facts set forth by the defendants in their respective statements.
the district court deeming order is unimpugnable.see ruiz rivera riley,cir explaining that failure to present a statement of disputed facts,embroidered with specific citations to the record,justifies the court deeming the facts presented in the movant statement of undisputed facts admitted.indeed,deeming is precisely the remedy that the local rule envisions for failures of compliance.see e.thus,we treat the facts expressly admitted by the plaintiffs,as well as those deemed admitted by the district court,as uncontested.
liability of the hospital.
we move next to the plaintiffs challenge to the entry of summary judgment in favor of the hospital.we need not tarry.
the plaintiffs brief is devoid of any developed argumentation as to the issue of the hospital liability.it offers only an oblique suggestion that the hospital was vicariously liable for the acts of serrano ostensibly an independent contractor and a conclusory assertion that stephanie injuries were the result of the hospital condonation of negligent acts and malpractice on the doctor part.appellants br.at.this sparse rhetoric falls well short of satisfying the imperative that an appellant brief must set forth her contentions and the reasons for them,with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.fed.a a.
to say more about this assignment of error would be supererogatory.by their failure to present any developed argumentation with respect to the hospital liability,the plaintiffs have waived their claim that the district court erred in granting the hospital motion for summary judgment.see adorno crowley towing transp,cir declining to address argument that district court erred in granting summary judgment because appellants brief failed to develop any argument sufficiently to put the correctness of the summary judgment rulings in dispute united states zannino,cir explaining that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.
liability of serrano.
we turn now to the entry of summary judgment in favor of serrano.because this is a diversity case,the substantive law of puerto rico controls.erie tompkins,corporación insular de seguros,cir.to make out a prima facie case for medical malpractice under the civil code,laws ann.tit,a plaintiff must adduce evidence sufficient to establish three elements i the duty owed,the minimum standard of professional skill and knowledge required in the relevant circumstances,ii an act or omission transgressing that duty,and iii a sufficient causal nexus between the breach of duty and the harm claimed,at lama borras,cir mun y of san juan,cir.
under this framework,breach of duty is an essential element of a cause of action for malpractice.to consider whether a breach has been shown,we first must understand the nature of the duty owed.
the general parameters of the duty of care that a physician owes to a patient under puerto rico law are uncontroversial.the physician must employ a level of care consistent with that set by the medical profession nationally,at.thus,an obstetrician,like serrano,must use the same level of care that is generally accepted as good practice in the obstetrical subspecialty,nationwide.id.
puerto rico law affords a physician a presumption that he has provided an appropriate level of care.id.it is the plaintiff obligation to refute this presumption by adducing evidence sufficient to show both the minimum standard of care required and the physician failure to achieve it.id.
the plaintiffs argue that they adequately rebutted the presumption that serrano used a reasonable degree of care and that,therefore,the district court erred in concluding that they failed to show a breach of duty.an appraisal of this argument begins with an acknowledgment that serrano motion and supporting statement of undisputed facts were adequate to shift to the plaintiffs the burden of providing evidence reflecting a genuine issue of material fact.see celotex,at.in an effort to satisfy this burden,the plaintiffs asserted that serrano breached his duty of care in two interrelated ways i by inordinate delay in calling for and performing an emergency and ii by failing properly to diagnose and treat intrapartum anoxia secondary to cord prolapse.we evaluate these assertions in the cold light of the summary judgment record.
the charge of inordinate delay focuses on the gap of roughly one hour and minutes between the time that wetherell signed the consent form for the and the time when she was wheeled into the operating room.the claim is that serrano,in the exercise of due care,should have performed the as soon as he knew or had reason to know that stephanie,while in utero,was suffering from fetal bradycardia.the plaintiffs say that serrano knew or should have known of that fact when,or very shortly after,wetherell arrived at the hospital.the relevant facts are as follows.
during labor,the fetal heart rate is monitored and contemporaneous tracings are available to the attending obstetrician.fetal bradycardia is a slowing of the fetal heart rate.a normal fetal heart rate ranges from to beats per minute.a fetal heart rate below beats per minute is termed bradycardia subject,however,to the limitation that bradycardia requires this low fetal heart rate,according to the plaintiffs obstetrical expert,steven weissberg,to be constant and for a certain period of time not just fractions of seconds.
here,the plaintiffs did not adduce any evidence that stephanie in fact had bradycardia.to establish bradycardia,the plaintiffs rely almost exclusively on weissberg review of the fetal heart rate tracings.those tracings showed an occasional dip in the fetal heart rate below,but weissberg did not envision this as an aposematic sign.he freely admitted that a momentary fetal heart rate under beats per minute is not in itself sufficient to show bradycardia that the presence of bradycardia ordinarily would be manifested by a fetal heart rate staying below beats per minute constant ly and for a certain period of time and that the infrequent occasions when stephanie heart rate fell below beats per minute were fleeting and not sustained.fairly read,weissberg testimony undercuts,rather than supports,the proposition that stephanie was experiencing bradycardia.
in an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning,the plaintiffs argue that an excerpt from weissberg report constitutes significantly probative evidence that serrano did not act quickly enough to perform a while stephanie was experiencing bradycardia the excerpt states 
in my opinion,i feel the care rendered kimberly wetherell fell below the standard of care because of the failure to perform a timely cesarean section.the patient had been informed and signed for a cesarean section at,and she alleges she was told an operating room was not available,and did not enter the operating room for another hour and minutes,an excessive delay.during this entire period of time,the fetal heartbeat remained low.
we do not think that this passage creates a triable issue as to any material fact.weissberg opinion is premised on the assumption that,during wetherell entire waiting time,the fetal heart rate was low.but there is no evidence of this rather,the evidence belies the assumption of a persistently low fetal heart rate.an expert opinion grounded on a nonexistent fact is not significantly probative.see,guile united states,cir holding that expert opinion based on incorrect factual assumptions was insufficient to create triable issue of fact.
indeed,weissberg admitted in his deposition that the fetal heart rate tracings showed that the times stephanie heart rate went below beats per minute were brief,not sustained,and did not occur in a pattern consistent with a diagnosis of bradycardia.thus,weissberg deposition testimony,given after he wrote his report,conclusively shows the absence of any si
