this case requires us to examine the rights of a disabled child under the individuals with disabilities education act idea.the principal issue,scantily addressed in the case law,involves how judicial review should proceed when the last individualized education program iep proposed by the school system is incomplete.
here,the district court found that the iep incompleteness was due to the parents obstruction of the developmental process.it proceeded to consider extrinsic evidence and concluded that,had the parents permitted the process to run its course,the school system would have provided the child with a satisfactory iep.on that basis,it decreed that the parents were not entitled either to reimbursement for costs incurred in a private placement or to compensatory education benefits.
the parents now appeal.we conclude that the lower court committed no clear error in weighing the facts.while we reach the same ultimate conclusion as did the court below,that court meticulous factfinding allows us to take a different,more direct analytic path.in the end,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
the district judge,in the first instance,referred this case to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.see b.b.the magistrate judge canvassed the record,made extensive findings of fact,and set forth various conclusions of law.five town cmty.sch,civ,wl.the district judge,in a summary order,adopted the magistrate judge recommended analysis in its entirety and entered judgment accordingly.five town cmty.sch,civ.for simplicity sake,we do not distinguish further between the magistrate judge and the district judge but,rather,take an institutional view and refer only to the district court.
we recount the background facts as supportably found by the district court.and are the parents of,a teenage girl who suffers from an emotional disability.the family resides in camden,maine.five town community school district the school district is the school system in which is entitled to receive public education.
the parents first met formally with five town about potential to qualify for services under the idea on march.they requested that the school district pay for,who was then fourteen years old,to enroll in a private residential placement.before the school district could evaluate the bona fides of this request,hit a crisis point and her parents unilaterally transferred her into a private residential placement outside of maine.the parents do not seek to recover the costs of that placement in this appeal,so we make no further mention of it.
notwithstanding efforts on the part of the school district to the idea eligibility process,nothing of consequence happened for well over a year.in the interim unbeknownst to the school district,returned to maine,enrolled for several months as a residential student in a private school,and upon leaving spent two additional months without any scholastic affiliation.
in june of,parents demanded a due process hearing under the idea.see f.the school district sought to meet with them in order to resume the earlier eligibility discussions.the due process hearing was deferred pending the completion of this attempt to reach a consensus.
the common practice is to form a team of parents,teachers,school administrators,and others to evaluate a child with a disability and,if she is found eligible for remedial services,to develop an iep.see id.d b d.in maine,this cohort is called a peer evaluation team pet.see.the school district assembled such a team and scheduled the initial pet meeting for september.during that session,the parents agreed that an independent evaluator,frank mccabe,could assess 
after the pet participants received the evaluator report,the school district scheduled a second pet meeting for october.at that session,the participants discussed the evaluator assessment,concluded that qualified for services as a disabled child,and began work to develop an iep.the participants jointly delineated the main components to be included in the iep and noted areas of the iep that would require additional input from,her therapist,and her parents.
during the same meeting,some placement options were discussed.the independent evaluator indicated that could receive an adequate and appropriate education in a public school day program.in response,the school district described some public school options,including camden hills regional high school chrhs and the zenith program.previously had attended chrhs,and her parents expressed concern about a placement there.they seemed willing,however,to learn more about the zenith day program or any similar regime.
the school district indicated that it would send the parents a copy of a proposed iep prior to the next pet meeting.on october,it transmitted an iep document to the parents by facsimile.the october version of the iep included the main components of the program to which the participants previously had agreed.consistent with the discussions at the october conclave,however,the iep left open other areas for later development.it is plain from even a cursory inspection of the october submission that the iep was not intended to constitute a completed iep 
the next pet meeting took place on october.at that session,the participants discussed placement options.the meeting was very contentious.five town,wl,at.the participants quickly reached an impasse the parents insisted that be educated in a therapeutic residential setting,whereas the school district insisted that a public school placement could provide with an adequate and appropriate education.the meeting ended abruptly when the parents announced that they had decided to send to the chamberlain school an residential institution and would seek reimbursement for the costs incurred.the meeting never progressed to a discussion either of the iep or of how to fill the gaps in it.
parents memorialized their unilateral placement decision in a letter sent the following week to the school district.given this parting of the ways,the due process hearing moved forward.arguing that the school district proposed iep and refusal to sanction a residential placement betokened a failure to provide with a free and appropriate public education fape,the parents sought compensatory education reimbursement for the expenses incurred in educating at chamberlain.the school district denied any breach of its duties under the idea.the hearing went forward,and the hearing officer ultimately rejected the parents entreaties.
undaunted,the parents shifted the battleground to the federal district court.see i a.as previously noted,the district judge,on de novo review of the magistrate judge report and recommendation,upheld the hearing officer ukase.this appeal followed.

here,the parents chief argument is that the district court applied an improper legal rule in evaluating the october iep.in turn,this argument depends on whether the iep was complete and if not,why not.in addressing it,we will first step back and sketch the architecture of the idea.once this is done,we will consider the completeness of the proffered iep,the cause of its stunted growth,whether the die was cast at that point,and the parents prayers for relief.
a.the idea.
congress designed the idea as part of an effort to help states provide educational services to disabled children.each state receiving federal funding through its provisions must ensure that every disabled child receives a fape.a a.a fape encompasses special education and support services provided free of charge.see id.a school system has met this obligation as long as the program that it offers to a disabled student is reasonably calculated to deliver educational benefits.hendrick hudson bd.of educ.rowley,d see warwick sch,cir.
at bottom,this obligation is an obligation to provide an adequate and appropriate education.the idea does not place school systems under a compulsion to afford a disabled child an ideal or an optimal education.see lenn,at.
if a school system is unable to furnish a disabled child with a fape through a public school placement,it may be obliged to subsidize the child in a private program.see burlington sch.comm.dep t of,d.in such circumstances,the school system will be responsible for the reasonable costs incident to that private placement.see id.at.puerto rico,cir.
it is common ground that the idea manifests a preference for mainstreaming disabled children.see,rowley,at.roland,at.this entails ensuring,t o the maximum extent appropriate,that disabled children are taught with nondisabled children.a a.the goal,then,is to find the least restrictive educational environment that will accommodate the child legitimate needs.see see also honig doe,d kathleen.dep t of,cir.
the method of the idea is straightforward.under it,school systems must take steps to identify children who may qualify as disabled,evaluate each such child to determine his or her eligibility for statutory benefits,and develop a customized iep designed to ensure that the child receives a level of educational benefits commensurate with a fape.a,a b.the iep must include information about the child disabilities,a statement of educational goals,a description of the measures that will be used to determine whether the child has met those goals,and a compendium of special education and related services that will be furnished to the child.see id.d a see also roland,at describing iep requirements under the precursor to the idea.those related services typically will consist of individualized services tailored to address the child particular needs.see d a see also burlington sch,at.
the development of an iep is meant to be a collaborative project.a team must be identified for that purpose.it should include the parents,teachers representing various parts of the educational spectrum that is,teachers with training in both regular and special education,officials of the school system,and sometimes others with expertise in the nature of the disability or the provision of particular services.see d b.
if no consensus emerges from these collective endeavors,the parents may challenge either the school system handling of the iep process or the iep itself.the first step in this adversarial pavane is a due process hearing.see id.f.either party may then seek judicial review of the hearing officer decision by prosecuting an appeal to a state or federal court.id.i a.
to determine whether an iep provides the requisite educational benefit in a given case,some courts will in some circumstances consider only the final version of the iep that the school system offered during the iep process.see,county sch.bd.of henrico,cir knable bexley city sch,cir.the thinking behind this four corners rule is that when the iep process has run its course and the school system has made its last,best offer of an iep,a reviewing court faced with a substantive challenge will have a clear record of what placements and educational services were offered.see union sch.dist.smith,cir see also alexandria city sch,cir.this circuit has yet to decide whether or not to adopt the four corners rule and,as we explain below,we have no occasion to consider the advisability of that course today.
if there is no last,best is,if the parents have initiated the adversary process in advance of the development of a final makes very little sense to consider only the latest version of the iep.this is especially true where the school system has acted expeditiously and the development of a final iep has been frustrated by the parents refusal to cooperate fully in the collaborative process.see loren atlanta indep.sch,cir mm sch.dist.of greenville,cir.in such circumstances,it would be wrong to put blinders on a reviewing court and restrict its inquiry to the partially completed iep.roland,at warning that courts ought not to allow parents to prevail when the inadequacy of an iep was created by their own obstructionism.
when this sort of scenario arises,the court should proceed to consider issues such as the way in which the iep process unfolded and the relative responsibility of the participants for the breakdown of the process.in exploring such issues,the court is entitled to look at the totality of the circumstances,consider extrinsic evidence if necessary,and judge the parents claims accordingly.
incompleteness of the iep.
in this case,the district court determined that the october iep was not final because the parents had disrupted the iep process midstream.five town,wl,at.having made that finding,the court proceeded to consider information outside the iep to assure itself that the school district partially formulated position was consistent with its responsibilities to under the idea.see id.it concluded that,had the parents continued to cooperate and allowed the school district to fill in the gaps,the result would have been a satisfactory iep that provided with a fape.see id.at.
the parents primary challenge to this conclusion contests the finding that the iep was incomplete.in that regard,they point out that the school district special education director,cindy foreman,stated during the october pet meeting that the october iep was final.based largely on that utterance,the parents assert that the district court inquiry should have been restricted as a matter of law to the four corners of the october iep.the school district rejoins that foreman comment can not be taken literally,that the october iep was obviously incomplete,and that the district court acted appropriately in looking beyond the four corners of that document.the parents can not be heard to complain about the incompleteness of the iep,the school district adds,because their refusal to cooperate in the iep process obstructed the development of a iep.
the district court,like the hearing officer,resolved this contretemps in favor of the school district.as a matter of fact,we discern no clear error in that ruling on its face,the october iep was manifestly incomplete.while it contained the main components of an individualized plan,it was missing several subsidiary components such as the behavioral support and crisis management plans.on this record,the district court finding that the iep was incomplete was virtually inevitable.
foreman comment that the iep was final does not require a different result.taken in context,that remark does not seem to mean what the parents suggest.conversation is not trigonometry,and in informal settings spoken language is rarely used in mathematically precise ways.in that connection,we have acknowledged that words are like chameleons they frequently have different shades of meaning depending upon the circumstances.united states romain,cir.
here,the record considered as a whole plainly indicates that while the main components of the iep including the school district decision to accommodate needs in a setting may have been final in,the iep most assuredly was not.given the obvious gaps in the iep,it would have been absurd for the district court to have treated foreman awkward locution as sufficient to transmogrify a partially completed iep into a fully completed one therefore,even in those jurisdictions that have adopted the four corners rule,the rule would not apply.
obstructive conduct.
the district court also found,as had the hearing officer,that the parents precipitous actions had prevented the consummation of the iep.see five town,wl,at.the court found that the parents harbored a fixed purpose to effect a residential placement for their daughter at the school district expense,come what may.see id.at.once the parents realized that the school district was focused on a placement,they essentially lost interest in the iep process.see id.that finding,which was not clearly erroneous supported an inference of parental obstruction.see mm,at.in turn,the finding of obstructionism,coupled with the finding of incompleteness,underbraced the court decision to consider extrinsic evidence.
viewed in context,that decision makes perfect sense while considering extrinsic information in the adequacy calculus may not be appropriate in the of cases,that course is peculiarly appropriate where,as here,the record reveals with conspicuous clarity that all the participants in the october pet meeting wanted miller input in order to develop a proper crisis plan and positive behavior support plan for as part and parcel of a final iep.neither plan had been formulated when the school district transmitted the october iep to the parents.the parents can not ignore these facts,nor expect a reviewing court to blind itself to them.doe defendant i,cir approving consideration of extrinsic information when parents,as part of the team,had all of the information required,even though all the particulars were not contained within the four corners of the iep.
from this point forward,the court,like the hearing officer,considered whether a public school day placement was appropriate and what benefits a finalized iep would have provided.see five town,wl,at.it supportably concluded that a public school placement constituted the least restrictive environment.it also concluded that,had the parents allowed the process to run its course,the school district would have developed a sound behavioral support plan and formulated a menu of psychiatric services to be offered to which were in line with the goals limned in the proposed iep.id.at.and,finally,it held that because the resultant iep would have been adequate to afford a fape,the parents claim failed.id.at.
in the last analysis,we need not probe too deeply into the adequacy of the iep.given the district court comprehensive factual findings,we can decide this case on a less nuanced ground.we explain briefly.
congress deliberately fashioned an interactive process for the development of ieps.in so doing,it expressly declared that if parents act unreasonably in the course of that process,they may be barred from reimbursement under the idea.see a c iii iii providing that t he cost of reimbursement may be reduced or denied upon a judicial finding of unreasonableness with respect to actions taken by the parents.
here,the school district argues persuasively that the parents conduct was unreasonable and that this unreasonableness precludes relief.although the district court drew no conclusions with regard to this provision of the idea,we are free to affirm its decision on any alternative ground that is evident from the record.see intergen grina,cir united states flemmi,cir.moreover,where the evidence supports a district court findings of fact,we may realign those findings under a different legal matrix and decide the case on that basis.see,wine spirits retailers,rhode island,cir explaining that a trial court findings of fact,made in connection with one legal theory,may often be treated as fungible in connection with another legal theory ferrara united states,cir relying on district court subsidiary findings of fact to decide appeal under a different articulation of the applicable rule of law see also societé des produits nestle casa helvetia,cir.
this is such a case.the district court supportably found that the parents actions disrupted the iep process,stalling its consummation and preventing the development of a final iep.moreover,the court found,the parents did so despite their knowledge that the school district planned to complete the unfinished portions with the parents help.tellingly,the court determined that the cause of the disruption was the parents refusal to consider any placement other than a residential one.five town,wl,at.such boulwarism,whether or not,constitutes an unreasonable approach to the collaborative process envisioned by the idea.see roland,at.here,that attitude sufficed to undermine the process.
to sum up,the district court found that the october iep was incomplete and that the parents unreasonable actions had frustrated the completion of the iep process given these warrantable findings of fact,section a c iii iii provides a solid ground for resolving the case against the parents.their unreasonable obstruction of an otherwise promising iep process fully justifies a denial of reimbursement under the idea.see mullica tp.bd.of,d,denying reimbursement because parents failed to cooperate in completion of iep.
substantive adequacy.
the parents challenge to the lower court decision has a further dimension.they assert that the iep process,whether or not still ongoing,had effectively reached a dead end in their view,the partially completed iep includes so many wrong choices that a finding of inadequacy would have been inevitable and so,completing the iep process would have been an exercise in futility.the force of this assertion hinges on the parents insistence that the school district arbitrarily ruled out a residential placement even though such a placement was the only feasible way to provide with a fape.
this insistence flies in the teeth of the school district evidence and the independent evaluator recommendations.after canvassing the record,we conclude that the need for a residential placement was fairly debatable.crediting the independent evaluator views and the school district testimony,the district the hearing that the least restrictive educational environment would have been in a public placement.five town,wl,at.given the truism that courts should recognize the expertise of educators with respect to the efficacy of educational programs,rowley,at,we see no clear error in this finding and,thus,no basis for setting aside the district court decision.
the parents remaining arguments on this issue need not occupy us for long.the few themes that they spin either mischaracterize the iep provisions or seek to have us undertake a de novo balancing of the facts.we are not swayed by the former,nor are we permitted to indulge the latter.
in all events,the best that can be said for the parents position is that the evidence may support competing viewpoints.that circumstance dooms their challenge we are not at liberty to reject the district court plausible interpretation of the facts simply because the record also might sustain a conflicting interpretation.see anderson bessemer city,d where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.nor may we reject an adequate public school placement for an optimal private placement.see rowley,at.see also lenn,at explaining that federal law requires school districts to provide a reasonable level of educational benefit to disabled children,not an optimal level.
requests for relief.
this essentially ends our inquiry.although reimbursement of parental expenses for private residential placements sometimes is available under the idea,such reimbursement is contingent upon a showing that the parents diligently pursued the provision of appropriate services from the public school system,yet the school system failed to provide those services and that the private placement is a suitable alternative.see florence cty.sch.dist.four carter,d burlington sch,at.when the parents make a unilateral choice,they must bear the associated risk if the conditions for reimbursement are not met,the financial burdens are theirs.burlington sch,at.roland,at.
that is precisely what transpired here.the parents made a unilateral choice to abandon the collaborative iep process without allowing that process to run its course.thus,the parents are precluded from obtaining reimbursement for the costs of the chamberlain school placement,see supra part ii c,and a fortiori,they have not satisfied that prong of the reimbursement analysis 
the parents alternative claim for compensatory education is easily dispatched.compensatory education is a surrogate for the warranted education that a disabled child may have missed during periods when his iep was so inappropriate that he was effectively deni
