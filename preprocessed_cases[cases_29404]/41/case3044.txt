this appeal arises from charges of patent and copyright infringement based on a system of administering emergency procedures,primarily cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr.donald hutchins charged zoll medical corporation with infringement of hutchins united states patent the patent entitled cpr computer aiding.hutchins also charged zoll with copyright infringement and with breach of a contract between hutchins and zoll.the united states district court for the district of massachusetts granted zoll motions for summary judgment of on the patent and copyright counts,and that there was no breach of contract hutchins appeals the rulings and assigns error to various procedural rulings he also seeks to reopen the case based on charges of fraudulent by zoll of relevant information.

patent infringement 
patent infringement requires that every element and limitation in a correctly construed claim is embodied in the accused system either literally or,if embodied by an equivalent,in compliance with the rules of equivalency as set forth in festo shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki,d and hilton davis chemical,d and implementing rulings.
the patent describes and claims an interactive system for guiding emergency rescue personnel in conducting administration of cpr.the system instructs rescue personnel to input certain characteristics of the victim,such as the victim age and state of consciousness the system then provides detailed procedures to be followed by the rescuer in order to administer cpr and resuscitate the victim.features of the system described in the patent include automated voice and visual signals and instructions,animated images,and audible speech prompts.claim is the broadest claim 
a general purpose computer system adapted for cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr aiding to provide guidance to rescue personnel trained in cpr for resuscitating a victim under an emergency condition,comprising 
a computer terminal,including,
an output comprising a display and an electroacoustical transducer and 
an input comprising an interactive display input,wherein the interactive display unit is adapted for selecting from image or text viewed on the display that is representative at least of characteristics of said victim.
zoll accused device,trademarked aedplus,is a portable computer system and defibrillator that provides automated voice and visual signals and instructions to guide rescue personnel through the steps to administer cpr to the victim and to defibrillate if necessary.
the elements of the patent claims on which the district court relied are general purpose computer and interactive display input.the district court found that neither of these elements is present in the zoll system,and on this basis granted summary judgment of.
all of the claims require a general purpose computer system that is adapted to the specified purposes.the definition of general purpose computer was agreed by the parties as 
a computer capable of running multiple unrelated programs,which are selected by the user and loaded into the device.it must feature at least a central processing unit,one or more input devices that are not specific to any one program,memory,mass storage devices such as a disk drive for storing large amounts of data,and one or more output devices.
zoll device contains a hitachi superh risc reduced instruction set computer microprocessor.the district court observed that the specification is specific to a general purpose computer and that all of the claims were so limited during prosecution.the court found that it was implausible for a risc microprocessor to be deemed a general purpose computer,for risc microprocessors have limited functionality.thus the court held that general purpose computer,as that term is used in the patent,does not read on a risc microprocessor and that the zoll system thereby avoids infringement.
hutchins argues that his invention is readily performed using a risc microprocessor.he points out that the zoll system is intended to interface and work in conjunction with a standard,which is a general purpose computer,and that the zoll device includes an interface for connection to a personal computer for purposes of review and archiving of data associated with a rescue the zoll manual states the minimum criteria for the personal computer as windows or higher computer,mb ram,vga monitor or better,drive,irda port,disk space.
the district court accepted the definition of general purpose computer that had been agreed by the parties the court found that a risc microprocessor does not meet that definition,and that the potential for connecting to a personal computer did not meet the claim limitation.we do not discern error in this finding,for the term general purpose computer was added to hutchins claims during prosecution in order to distinguish the invention from prior art that showed similar devices with dedicated microprocessor units.this produced an estoppel against reading the term general purpose computer to include a dedicated microprocessor such as a risc,for the claims had been amended in response to the pto rejection,thereby estopping recovery of the same subject matter that the claims had been amended to exclude.see alloc int l trade comm n,statements made during prosecution surrendering subject matter binding on later interpretation of the claims see also festo,at.estoppel arises upon amendment to surrender the particular equivalent in question bayer ag elan pharm.research,an aspect expressly disavowed during prosecution of the patent can not be reached under the doctrine of equivalents.the district court ruling on this aspect is affirmed.
hutchins also argues that the term general purpose computer is not present in each claim of the patent.that is incorrect,for the term is recited in each independent claim and accordingly is incorporated into every dependent claim.see,a claim in dependent form shall be construed to incorporate by reference all the limitations of the claim to which it refers.independent claim recites a general purpose computer system,with dependent claims.independent claim recites a general purpose computer network system,with dependent claims.independent claim recites an article of manufacture adapted for use in a general purpose computer,with dependent claims.independent claim recites a computer program that is readable by a general purpose computer,with dependent claims.independent claim recites a method for use in cpr with a general purpose computer,with dependent claims.no claim is free of this limitation.
the district court also ruled that the claim term interactive display input could not be found by a reasonable jury to be present in the zoll apparatus.the parties had agreed on the following definition for this term 
a device for communicating with a computer which allows a user to respond to options presented by the computer by selecting from a menu displayed on a screen.
in the interactive display input described in the patent,rescue personnel select certain characteristics of the victim relevant to proper performance of cpr techniques.these characteristics include factors such as the consciousness of the victim,whether adult or child or infant,whether the victim is choking,and whether resuscitation is required.the display responds to this information and provides guidance that can include pictorial and animated instructions.
the zoll device requires no input from the rescuer,who places electrical contacts as directed by the device the device then monitors the victim heart and determines whether cpr or an electric shock is necessary.the district court observed that although the zoll system analyzes
