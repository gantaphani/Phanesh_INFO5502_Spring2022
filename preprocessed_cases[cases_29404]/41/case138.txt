plaintiffs appeal,arguing,inter alia,that the evidence supports a claim for failure to stabilize under emtala.finding no error,we affirm.
factual background 
on appeal from a grant of summary judgment,we state the facts in the light most favorable to the.levesque doocy,cir.
at,on january,adalberto martínez lópez martínez came to the ryder memorial hospital,ryder emergency room complaining of chest pain and bleeding from a femoral dialysis catheter site.martínez was years old at the time and an renal disease dialysis patient.his vital signs were taken,and at martínez was examined by griselle pastrana,an emergency room physician.pastrana documented that martínez was actively bleeding from the catheter site and that he was weak and dizzy.she described his general condition as alert,oriented and mildly pale,and noted his renal disease.pastrana ordered a variety of tests for martínez,including a chest,an ekg,and a type and cross for four units of packed red blood cells.
at,pastrana discussed martínez case with enrique,a nephrologist at ryder.then ordered martínez admission to ryder medicine floor and the completion of the tests ordered by pastrana.martínez was admitted to the medicine floor at,with orders for bed rest,testing of vital signs every four hours,and hemodialysis and a blood transfusion the next morning.
martínez did not arrive in his room on the medicine floor until.when he arrived,he was described as alert,but pale,feverish,and complaining of chest pain.the catheter site remained bloody.at,the nephrologist,baquero,was contacted and informed of martínez vital signs.baquero prescribed,among other things,an antibiotic and tylenol,which were administered at.at,january,gave a telephone order to change the bandage on martínez catheter site,apply pressure,and prepare for a blood transfusion in the morning.
however,martínez continued to bleed throughout the night,and his bandages had to be changed several times.at,a relative accompanying martínez complained to the nursing staff that the bleeding was profuse.staff contacted,who requested a consultation with a ryder surgeon,sotomayor.vital signs taken at reflected that martínez blood pressure had dropped and his temperature had increased.nurses called an physician,juan gómez lópez,who examined martínez and ordered a blood transfusion.he then discussed martínez condition with over the phone.
at,staff contacted again and informed him that sotomayor was not available.requested that luis canetti,another ryder surgeon,evaluate the patient.nurses noted that when cannetti removed the bandages to examine martínez,bleeding continue d profusely and abundantly.canetti determined that martínez required surgery but that he could not perform it,and he recommended that martínez be immediately transferred to auxilio mutuo hospital for an fistula revision.at,was notified of the recommendation and order ed the patient to be transferred as soon as possible.the blood transfusion ordered by gómez lópez began at 
sometime between and,nurses discovered that martínez was not breathing.cpr was performed,but martínez could not be revived.he was pronounced dead at,january.
proceedings in the district court 
on january,martínez surviving wife and children,including tony martínez taveras,a child from another relationship,brought suit against ryder,pastrana,and an unnamed physician.the second amended complaint,which also named as defendants gómez lópez and cannetti,alleged violations of emtala by ryder malpractice by pastrana,gómez lópez,and cannetti and several other claims 
after defendants motions to dismiss were,for the most part denied,a long and contentious period of discovery ensued.at its completion,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment on november,on all of plaintiffs claims,concluding that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a claim under emtala against ryder for failure to screen or stabilize and that emtala did not support claims against the individual physicians who had treated martínez.it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims pursuant to c.
plaintiffs timely appealed.on appeal,they argue that the district court erred in dismissing the emtala claim for failure to stabilize,that no emtala claims were brought against individual physicians,and that the district court retained jurisdiction over claims brought by tony martínez taveras on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.
emtala claims against ryder 
emtala is designed to prevent hospital emergency rooms from refusing to accept or treat patients with emergency conditions if the patient does not have medical insurance.correa hosp.san francisco,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.to this end,emtala imposes duties on covered facilities to a provide an appropriate medical screening examination for those who come to an emergency room seeking treatment,and b provide,in certain situations,such further medical examination and such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition.a,b a see hawayek,cir.
to establish a violation of the screening or stabilization provisions in emtala,a plaintiff must prove that 
the hospital is a participating hospital,covered by emtala,that operates an emergency department or an equivalent facility the patient arrived at the facility seeking treatment and the hospital either a did not afford the patient an appropriate screening in order to determine if she had an emergency medical condition,or b bade farewell to the patient whether by turning her away,discharging her,or improvidently transferring her without first stabilizing the emergency medical condition.
in this case,the district court determined that plaintiffs had failed to establish a violation of either the screening or stabilization provisions.plaintiffs appeal only the stabilization ruling.they argue that,properly construed,emtala imposes an unqualified duty to stabilize once it is determined that the patient has an emergency medical condition,and this duty begins upon admission to the hospital and follows the patient to any hospital department.they suggest that ryder violated this duty by failing to dispense any meaningful treatment to stabilize martínez condition until it became apparent that he was about to die.in the alternative,plaintiffs argue that even if the duty to stabilize applies only when a patient is transferred,transfer does not require a patient to physically leave the hospital,but only for a physician to enter an order of transfer.any other interpretation,plaintiffs say,would undermine the purpose of emtala.thus,on plaintiffs view,triggered the stabilization duty by entering an order of transfer for martínez.
we agree with the district court that plaintiffs have failed to establish a violation of the emtala stabilization provision.the duty to stabilize under emtala does not impose a standard of care prescribing how physicians must treat a critical patient condition while he remains in the hospital,but merely prescribes a precondition the hospital must satisfy before it may undertake to transfer the patient.hosp.hermanos,cir unpublished.thus,a hospital can not violate the duty to stabilize unless it transfers a patient,as that procedure is defined in emtala.see correa,at to establish a violation of the duty to stabilize,the plaintiff must prove,inter alia,that the hospital bade farewell to the patient.
as the eleventh circuit has explained,this conclusion follows from the statutory definition of to stabilize.harry marchant,cir en banc.the stabilization provision requires a covered hospital,within its staff and facilities,to provide an individual it determines has an emergency medical condition with such
