wilhemenia wildman appeals the decision of the commissioner of the social security administration commissioner denying her applications for disability insurance benefits dib under title ii of the social security act,et,and supplemental security income benefits ssi under title xvi of that same act,id.et.an administrative law judge alj upheld the commissioner decision and the appeals council denied review,making the alj decision the final decision of the commissioner.wildman then appealed to the district court which affirmed the commissioner decision.wildman now appeals,and we affirm because the commissioner decision is supported by substantial evidence.
background 
wilhemenia wildman was born on january,attended high school through the ninth grade,and later earned her general equivalency diploma ged.she has a sporadic work history that includes jobs as a janitor,hand packager,salvager can sorter,and cleaning supervisor.wildman admits that she has a long history of drug and alcohol abuse that likely contributed to her current liver problems and depression.in,wildman protectively filed applications for dib and ssi,claiming she became disabled on september.the commissioner denied her applications initially and on reconsideration,and the alj affirmed that denial.the alj first determined that wildman met the insured status requirements for entitlement to dib through december.then,he held that wildman impairments included a history of multiple surgeries on the right shoulder fatty liver disease with steatohepatitis and fibrosis pancreatitis diabetes mellitus an abdominal hernia allegations of medically determinable impairments resulting in complaints of pain in the back,leg and left shoulder dysthymia major depression and polysubstance abuse.
following the regulatory disability analysis set forth in and,the alj concluded at step one that wildman had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since september,alleged disability onset date.then,at steps two and three,the alj determined that while wildman impairments were severe,they did not reach the level of severity contemplated in the listing of impairments,pt,subpt.p,app.finally,at step four,the alj determined that wildman had the following residual functional capacity rfc 
she can lift pounds maximum occasionally and pounds frequently and and sit six hours in an eight hour day.she can occasionally bend,stoop,squat,kneel,crawl and climb.she can occasionally work with the right arm above shoulder level.she is able to do at least simple,routine,repetitive work not requiring constant close attention to detail or use of independent judgment.she needs occasional supervision and can work at a regular pace.she should not perform high stress work.
based on this rfc,a vocational expert testified that wildman could return to her past relevant work as a sorter.accordingly,the alj determined at step four that wildman was not disabled at any time through the date of his decision and denied wildman applications for dib and ssi.
on appeal,wildman argues that the alj erred in failing to include all of her impairments in the rfc assessment and in the hypothetical provided to the vocational expert.specifically,wildman argues that if the alj had properly weighed the opinions of treating,examining,and nonexamining medical professionals,and wildman credibility,the alj rfc would have included pace and attendance limitations.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court decision to affirm the denial of social security benefits de novo.brown barnhart,cir.in doing so,we determine whether the alj decision to deny benefits is based on legal error,and whether the findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.id.internal quotation omitted.substantial evidence is less than a preponderance,but is enough that a reasonable mind would find it adequate to support the commissioner conclusion.mckinney apfel,cir.to determine whether substantial evidence supports the decision,we must consider evidence that both supports and detracts from the decision.id.if substantial evidence supports the alj decision,we will not reverse the decision merely because substantial evidence would have also supported a contrary outcome,or because we would have decided differently.id.
medical opinions 
burstain opinion 
on june,todd burstain,wildman treating physician,completed several forms describing wildman physical ailments and physical limitations.on the forms,burstain noted that wildman suffered from liver disease,chronic alcoholic pancreatitis,and flares of acute pancreatitis that occur about monthly.as for wildman physical limitations,burstain concluded that wildman could only work one hour per day,sit a total of one hour per workday,stand a total of one hour per workday,lift ten pounds occasionally,and lift five pounds frequently.the alj gave little weight to this opinion,emphasizing,among other reasons,that the opinion was conclusory and did not take wildman noncompliance into consideration.
wildman argues that the alj erroneously discounted burstain opinion.we disagree.generally,a treating physician opinion is due controlling weight if that opinion is by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the record.brown,at alteration in original internal quotation omitted.however,a n alj may discount or even disregard the opinion of a treating physician where other medical assessments are supported by better or more thorough medical evidence,or where a treating physician renders inconsistent opinions that undermine the credibility of such opinions.goff barnhart,cir internal quotation omitted.
first,the alj properly discounted burstain opinion because it was conclusory.the opinion consists of three checklist forms,cites no medical evidence,and provides little to no elaboration.the checklist format,generality,and incompleteness of the assessments limit the assessments evidentiary value.holmstrom massanari,cir.indeed,a treating physician opinion deserves no greater respect than any other physician opinion when it consists of nothing more than vague,conclusory statements.piepgras chater,cir.
furthermore,the alj properly discounted burstain opinion because it did not take wildman noncompliance into account.a claimant noncompliance can constitute evidence that is inconsistent with a treating physician medical opinion and,therefore,can be considered in determining whether to give that opinion controlling weight.owen astrue,cir.while our review of the record confirms that wildman suffered from abdominal pain flares about monthly,a closer look at burstain notes reveals that a vast majority of such flares were precipitated by wildman failure to comply with her prescribed diet and medications,and her failure to totally abstain from drugs and alcohol.
first,wildman failed to completely abstain from drugs and alcohol.on november,wildman sought treatment in the emergency room for abdominal pain.the physician on duty attributed wildman pain to pancreatitis and instructed her to stop alcohol consumption.yet,burstain treatment notes reveal that wildman subsequently suffered from abdominal pain flares after drinking alcohol in and using three lines of cocaine at a party in.
wildman also failed to take her medications as prescribed.on june,burstain noted that wildman was suffering from another pancreatitis flare.when burstain questioned wildman about whether she had been taking her creon wildman said yes,but now says that she has actually not been using that.burstain concluded that wildman chronic pancreatitis is worse right now,probably secondary to noncompliance of the creon.i have emphasized the importance of going back on that.on july,burstain noted that wildman still has not filled her creon prescription and he again encouraged her to get the creon filled.
finally,wildman repeatedly failed to follow her prescribed diet.on february,wildman reported to burstain with a pancreatitis flare and burstain instructed her to limit her diet to simple starches.the following week,wildman told burstain that she thought the pancreatitis flare may have been trig
