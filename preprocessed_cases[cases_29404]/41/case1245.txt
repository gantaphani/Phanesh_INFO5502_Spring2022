this case arises from the tragic death of terance anthony graham graham died in police custody shortly after secretly ingesting large quantities of cocaine upon being arrested for an unrelated marijuana offense.carolyn graham,the personal representative of graham estate,sued washtenaw county pursuant to,claiming that the county policy regarding the provision of medical care to prisoners in the county jail contributed to graham death.the district court granted the county motion for summary judgment.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
the facts giving rise to this case are,for the most part,undisputed.on may,at approximately in the evening,deputy sinks arrested graham for possession of marijuana.a few minutes after the arrest,the deputy permitted graham to go behind a tree,allegedly to relieve himself.it was later determined that while behind the tree graham had swallowed approximately an ounce of cocaine,which is a felony under michigan law.graham was escorted into the county jail at approximately.most of the events occurring inside the jail were captured on videotape.shortly after his arrival,jail personnel observed graham walking and acting erratically.at one point,he pulled down his pants in full view of everyone in the booking area.jail personnel asked him several times,what did you take instead of revealing that he had ingested cocaine,graham stated that he had smoked marijuana and drank alcohol.after witnessing graham erratic behavior,a deputy requested that he be medically examined.
at approximately,tracy lakatos,a licensed practical nurse,responded and examined graham.nurse lakatos was an employee of securecare,a company that the county had hired to provide medical care to prisoners in the county jail.graham told her that he had been drinking and using marijuana that evening and that he had asthma.nurse lakatos gave him two doses of albuterol,a medication used to treat asthma that has a known side effect of causing an accelerated heart rate.at,nurse lakatos and deputy sinks took graham to an interview room after a blood alcohol test indicated that graham was not intoxicated,nurse lakatos said that deputy sinks could interview graham and she left the room at.
after providing a statement about his marijuana event prompting his.graham was turned over to another deputy and was scheduled to be booked and then released.at this point,jail personnel observed him sweating profusely and using his shirt,which he had removed from his body,to wipe off the sweat.jail personnel determined that he was not well enough to go through the booking process,so they placed him in a general population cell at.
while inside the cell,graham admitted to a cellmate that he had ingested cocaine,but insisted that he did not want the jail personnel to find out.statements from his cellmates indicate that while in the cell graham could barely talk,was staggering,looked sick,and was holding his stomach and rubbing his throat.at approximately,a cellmate pounded on the plexiglass window and yelled he hurt witnesses reported that graham appeared to be having a seizure and that he had a blank look on his face and his eyes were real glassy.
nurse lakatos responded and asked what was wrong.again,instead of telling nurse lakatos the truth,graham only said that he had swallowed some pills.nurse lakatos used a pulse oximeter to determine his heart rate.one cellmate observed that the pulse oximeter indicated a high heart rate,which nurse lakatos apparently explained was due to the marijuana.satisfied that graham needed no additional medical care,nurse lakatos left the cell at approximately.
at,nurse lakatos responded to another cry from a cellmate that graham had passed out.at this point,he was taken to the medical room in the jail building,requiring assistance from jail personnel to stay on his feet.at approximately,he began to have multiple seizures,at which point an ambulance was summoned.he was transported to a hospital emergency room a few minutes later and was pronounced dead at.
on may,carolyn graham,the personal representative of graham estate,filed a complaint against the county,its sheriff and certain officers.she filed an amended complaint four days later.the claims against the sheriff and officers were subsequently dismissed,leaving a section municipal liability claim against the county,which is the only claim at issue in this appeal.the essence of the municipal liability claim is that the county contract with securecare constituted a municipal policy that led to a deprivation of graham constitutional right to adequate medical care while in police custody.specifically,the complaint alleges that the contract impermissibly creates a policy of automatic deference by jail personnel to the decisions of securecare staff concerning the medical treatment of prisoners and the contract improperly permits licensed practical nurse perform duties that exceed their competence under michigan law.
on august,the county filed a motion for summary judgment,which was supplemented on august.on october,the district court denied the motion without prejudice and allowed graham additional time to conduct further discovery and to amend her complaint.she made no attempt to file an amended complaint during the allotted time.on february,the county renewed its motion for summary judgment and,on february,filed a motion for sanctions pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure based upon graham failure to withdraw the case in light of this court decision in watkins battle creek,cir.in watkins,we affirmed an award of summary judgment to individual and municipal defendants in a section case arising out of the death of an individual who,like graham,died in police custody after secretly ingesting cocaine upon his arrest.id.
on february,without requesting leave of the district court,graham attempted to file an amended complaint that purportedly clarified her claim against the county and asserted additional section claims,as well as a medical negligence claim against various new defendants,including securecare.the district court sua sponte rejected the attempted filing.on february,graham filed a motion for leave to file the newly amended complaint.
on march,the district court held a hearing during which the following ruling was made from the bench 
it appears to the court that at this time it must grant the defendant motion for summary judgment because there is no showing of any unconstitutional custom or policy on the part of the washtenaw county jail which required the deliberate indifference which could have led to the plaintiff death.indeed any other ruling here would be extremely detrimental to prisoners who are incarcerated in michigan jails because the presence of medical personnel is essential to their safety and their health.unfortunately the plaintiff here,as watkins,in his case,was the only person who knew what he had ingested,and he was asked on several occasions by the medical personnel and others,apparently,at this jail what was wrong,and he did not disclose what his medical need was.so i have to grant the motion for summary judgment in this case.
after granting the county motion for summary judgment,the district court denied graham motion to file the amended complaint.graham later filed a motion for reconsideration,which was denied on april.she also filed a medical malpractice action against securecare and other defendants in michigan state court,which apparently is still pending.
after the completion of appellate briefing in this case,this court decided weaver shadoan,cir,another case involving the death of an individual in police custody after secretly ingesting cocaine.in weaver,we relied upon our recent decision in watkins to reverse the district court denial of summary judgment to individual defendants on the plaintiff section claims.id.
on appeal,graham argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the county,in denying her motion to file an amended complaint and in denying her motion for reconsideration.we find these arguments to be without merit.
