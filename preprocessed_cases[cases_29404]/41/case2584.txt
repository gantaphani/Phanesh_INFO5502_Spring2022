nancy metzler metzler was formerly an employee of federal home loan bank of topeka fhl bank of topeka fhlb.fhlb terminated metzler from her position as a database and systems analyst in november.metzler then filed an action under the family and medical leave act,fmla against fhlb alleging interference with her rights in violation of a and retaliation for exercising her rights under the fmla in violation of a.the district court granted summary judgment for fhlb on both claims.applying the appropriate summary judgment standard of review we affirm.
although metzler began her employment with fhlb on october,the real conflicts that form the basis of her complaint and this appeal began in september after the information technology it department,with whom she had worked since,reorganized and placed her under a new supervisor.both before and after the reorganization,metzler worked as a database and systems analyst dba.the formal job description for this position remained unchanged throughout her employment metzler was responsible for maintaining fhlb relation database operating system,called microsoft structured query language server sql server installing updates and maintaining the databases,which included data backups,fine tuning,creating indexes,and reviewing and implementing the designs of the bank application developers and assisting programming staff in technical aspects of application selection,development,and support.
from june until metzler termination,phil andruss was the it director.prior to the reorganization,metzler worked in the networks and systems group of the it department under two different immediate supervisors,both of whom lacked the experience needed properly to manage a dba like metzler from until april,metzler immediate supervisor was steve montgomery,the network and systems manager and from april until the reorganization,kathleen grote was metzler supervisor.
on september,the it department was reorganized.the reorganization created a new group within the it department called the projects and support group.with this reorganization,among other things,the responsibilities for functions involving data transformation services dts packages,which are standard sql server tools that any experienced sql server administrator should know how to use,and documentation of dtss and backup procedures moved from the programmers and developers to the new projects and support group.metzler had used dts for limited purposes prior to the reorganization.
chris miller,who was familiar with sql server and the duties of a dba and had previously performed dts packages,became the head of the new project and support group.although miller had not previously acted as metzler immediate supervisor,miller had managed projects in which metzler participated.over the years,miller and metzler had developed professional differences of opinion about the manner in which metzler operated,or should have operated,her databases.
three days before the reorganization,andruss met individually with every it department employee who would be reporting to a new manager after the reorganization.during his meeting with metzler,he informed her that she would be transferred to the new projects and support group and placed under miller supervision.metzler responded that she would rather be fired.
metzler missed work on the first day of the reorganization and worked only part of the next day before going home sick and visiting a doctor.the physician diagnosed metzler with stress,depression,anxiety,and related symptoms,and ordered her to stay off work for two weeks.on september,the physician ordered her to stay off work for one more week.on october,the physician issued metzler a work release order permitting her to return to work.metzler returned to work on october,working four hours per day until fhlb terminated her employment on november.at some time prior to metzler return to work on october,miller understood that metzler planned to request retroactive fmla leave for the time she had been absent.on october,metzler submitted that request for fmla leave retroactive to september,due to her serious health condition,and fhlb approved the leave on october.metzler was therefore deemed to be on fmla leave from september until her return to work on october,and then on reduced schedule leave upon her return to work.
upon her return to work on october through her termination,metzler maintained the same job title,the description of her position remained unchanged,and she received the same pay and benefits that she received both prior to the reorganization and prior to her fmla leave.however,as andruss had informed metzler on september,she was now part of the new projects and support group and under miller supervision.the duties and tasks assigned to metzler in this new group required her to use more advanced features of certain tools than she had previously used.
the day after metzler returned to work,miller and michael smith,an outside consultant with expertise as a dba,met with metzler.miller and smith testified that metzler ignored miller and avoided communicating with her during the meeting.metzler acknowledges that it is possible she sat with her back to miller throughout the meeting.that same day,miller wrote a formal counseling document october counseling document,which reproved metzler for being uncommunicative,rude behavior,and the unproductive use of her time,and required metzler to correct these deficiencies.it also required metzler to update miller daily regarding her project status and imposed an october deadline for a specific assignment.the october counseling document concluded 
we need you and your background knowledge,but we can not afford an employee that can not work as part of the team and be productive.if these items do not dramatically improve within the next weeks or other deadlines established,you will be counseled further,up to and including termination.
miller gave the document to metzler at the end of metzler work day on october.miller testified that she issued the october counseling document because she observed that metzler unproductive habits and attitude problems were recurring and she wanted metzler to understand such problems were no longer acceptable.
metzler signed the document,noted her disagreement,and later submitted a response to it.however,metzler failed to provide miller with the daily status reports required by the counseling document until october because metzler erroneously believed that miller had access to metzler electronic payroll timesheets,which would have reflected the same information.
on october,miller assigned metzler the task of adjusting certain numbers in one of fhlb databases with a deadline of the following day,believing the task should take approximately two hours.metzler explained to miller,in her report on october,that the task would actually take approximately four hours.metzler completed the assignment seven days later,on october.miller also assigned metzler the task of reviewing documentation for a backup of a particular system,the network,and the hot site with deadlines of october,and,respectively for each task.metzler completed the assignments on november.
on october,metzler met with miller and dina cox,fhlb director of human resources,to discuss the october counseling document.metzler testified that she told miller and cox she thought she was being treated unfairly because of her fmla leave.during that meeting,metzler admitted that she missed some deadlines,but expressed her belief that many of these deadlines were unreasonably short.after revisions by andruss and cox,miller completed a final version of a written response to metzler objections to the october counseling document,which stated,among other things 
i strongly disagree with nancy metzler position that she should not have to perform like everyone else because she has been ill.nancy her doctor decided the appropriate time she could come back to work and that she would be able to work hours per day.the expectation is that she would work and be productive for those hours each day.nancy seems to think she should have a transition period of showing up for work but not having to really do anything.
on november,miller assigned metzler to write a series of six dts packages to transfer data from one database to another.miller estimated that the first package would require three hours and the other five would require two hours total of set the deadlines for these tasks as november,and.before delivering these assignments to metzler,miller had her time estimations reviewed by smith,the outside consultant with expertise as a dbs andruss,the it director and bill mcspadden,the bank applications development manager,to ensure the amount of time given was reasonable.all three told miller her time estimations were reasonable.
on the same day that miller gave metzler the assignments and corresponding deadlines,metzler complained about one particular deadline to her,anita wright.wright,in turn,spoke with cox and told her that it looked like a couple more hours needed to be added to several of miller time estimates.cox,in turn,spoke to miller about one specific deadline,and miller extended it from three to twelve hours.between november,when the tasks were assigned,and november,when fhlb terminated her,metzler worked forty hours.as of her termination,however,metzler had not completed any of the six dts packages assignments.
miller drafted another counseling document on the same day she extended metzler deadline by nine hours,which criticized metzler for lack of productivity and missed deadlines.after miller gave the document to cox for review,cox advised miller not to deliver it to metzler.instead,over the next few weeks cox held several one on november and another on november herself,metzler,miller,and at least once,andruss,to attempt to improve metzler productivity and communications between metzler and miller.during these meetings,metzler was not informed that her work performance was so deficient that her job was in jeopardy.
on november,miller prepared a memorandum to andruss and brad hodges,fhlb senior vice president for housing,technology and planning,recommending that metzler employment be terminated november memo.then,on november,miller prepared another counseling document that she intended to deliver to metzler,but she first gave to it cox to review.cox advised miller to proceed with termination rather than deliver the counseling statement.
later that day,miller,cox,andruss,and hodges met to discuss whether metzler was able to meet her assigned job responsibilities or whether fhlb needed to find someone else who could produce the level of work required.cox testified that the decision to terminate metzler due to the effect of metzler failure to meet deadlines,her uncooperativeness,and the effect of her negative attitude on the whole team was made jointly and based,at least partially,on miller november memo.fhlb terminated metzler employment effective november.
metzler then brought an action in federal district court for the district of kansas alleging violations of a and of the fmla.in an order dated september,the district court granted summary judgment for fhlb on the a claim after finding that metzler failed to state a viable interference claim and that her claim was more properly analyzed as a retaliation claim.the district court further found that metzler failed to show pretext and granted summary judgment for fhlb on the a retaliation claim.on appeal,metzler argues that she stated a viable claim for fmla interference and that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for fhlb on both her a and claims.
discussion 
this circuit has recognized two theories of recovery under a an entitlement or interference theory arising from a,and a retaliation or discrimination theory arising from a see smith diffee,cir.the distinction between these two theories is important because the elements and burdens of proof that apply to a claims differ from those that apply to a claims,see id.at,and we therefore analyze metzler claims separately.
retaliation claim 
retaliation claims under the fmla are subject to the analysis of mcdonnell douglas green,d.see doebele mgmt,cir.under this analysis,the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation.id.if the plaintiff does so,then the defendant must offer a legitimate,reason for the employment action.id.the plaintiff then bears the ultimate burden of demonstrating that the defendant proffered reason is pretextual.see also gunnell utah valley state,cir explaining that plaintiff has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that the challenged employment decision was the result of intentional retaliation.
prima facie case of retaliation 
to state a prima facie case of retaliation,metzler must show that she engaged in a protected activity fhlb took an action that a reasonable employee would have found materially adverse and there exists a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.see argo,at chavez,at.the first two of these requirements are clearly met in this engaged in a protected activity by taking fmla leave for a serious health condition and fhlb was aware of such leave,and any reasonable employee would have found termination materially adverse.the third element,then,remains the only one on which it is questionable whether metzler made a sufficient showing.
to establish the third element of a prima facie case of retaliation,metzler must show a causal connection between her protected activity of taking fmla leave and fhlb decision to terminate her employment.the critical inquiry at this prima facie stage is whether the plaintiff has demonstrated that the employer action occurred under circumstances which give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.garrett,cir quotations omitted.we have repeatedly recognized temporal proximity between protected conduct and termination as relevant evidence of a causal connection sufficient to justify an inference of retaliatory motive.see,haynes.we have emphasized,however,that a plaintiff may rely on temporal proximity alone only if the termination is very closely connected in time to the protected activity.anderson coors brewing,cir emphasis in original.
here,the record indicates that metzler submitted her formal request for retroactive fmla leave on october,and that fhlb approved it the following day.viewed in a light most favorable to metzler,the record also indicates that miller knew of metzler intent to invoke fmla rights for her absence sometime between the beginning of metzler absence from work september and her return to work october.as a result,metzler termination occurred at most about weeks after fhlb knew metzler intended to engage in protected activity and within as little as four weeks of metzler request for leave.because her termination was therefore very closely connected in time to her protected fmla activity,she has established the third,and final,element of her prima facie case.compare ramirez.of mental health,cir holding that a one and month period between the protected activity and the adverse action may,by itself,establish causation,overruled on other grounds by ellis of.med,cir,with richmond oneok,cir deciding that a period of three months between the protected activity and the adverse action,standing alone,is not sufficient to establish causation.
legitimate,nonretaliatory reason for termination 
having established her prima facie case,the burden under mcdonnell douglas then shifts to fhlb to demonstrate a legitimate,nonretaliatory reason for its termination decision.see doebele,at.fhlb asserts that it fired metzler due to her poor job performance,poor attitude,and failure to maintain adequate skills.because these reasons are not facially prohibited,the district court correctly concluded that fhlb articulated a legitimate,nonretaliatory reason for terminating metzler employment.
to defeat summary judgment,then,metzler must show that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether fhlb explanations for terminating her employment are pretextual.see mickelson new york life ins,cir chavez,at.to establish pretext,metzler relies on six pieces of circumstantial evidence allegedly establishing the proximate timing of her termination a pattern of retaliatory conduct fhlb prior treatment of her fhlb action contrary to its handbook policy fhlb documentation of her file in anticipation of litigation and proof that fhlb explanation is unworthy of credence.
timing of metzler termination 
it is undisputed that fhlb discharged metzler during her fmla leave.although temporal proximity is one relevant factor to be considered by the courts in determining whether the employer explanation is a pretext for retaliation,this court has refused to allow even very close temporal proximity to operate as a proxy for th e evidentiary requirement that the plaintiff demonstrate pretext.annett of,cir medina income support,cir temporal proximity is not alone sufficient to defeat summary judgment.quotations omitted.to raise a fact issue of pretext,metzler must therefore present evidence of temporal proximity plus circumstantial evidence of retaliatory motive.see,pastran,cir.here,metzler relies on the five other pieces of circumstantial evidence to demonstrate that fhlb alleged explanation for her termination,in addition to the temporal proximity of her termination and exercise of protected rights,was a pretext for retaliatory discharge.
a pattern of retaliatory conduct 
relying on our decision in marx schnuck markets,cir,metzler contends that fhlb engaged in a pattern of retaliatory conduct beginning soon after she returned on reduced schedule fmla leave,which she argues demonstrates pretext.specifically,metzler alleges that pattern began with fhlb issuing the october counseling document continued when fhlb assigned new job duties to metzler,failed to give her adequate training to perform those new duties,then imposed unreasonable deadlines for completion of those duties and ultimately culminated in terminating her employment.although a pattern of retaliatory actions taken by a defendant may preclude summary judgment,id.at,metzler has not established a pattern of conduct giving rise to an inference of retaliatory animus.
even assuming metzler was assigned new duties upon her return from fmla leave,rather than upon the it section reorganization there was no evidence that the duties were assigned to her in retaliation for taking fmla leave.metzler therefore failed to set forth,by sufficient affidavits or other evidence,that she was assigned new duties in retaliation for exercising fmla rights.
additionally,the record does not support her claim that fhlb failed to provide sufficient training and resources regarding these allegedly new duties.metzler job description explicitly stated that she was expected to be able to quickly assimilate and use new technology required to perform her responsibilities.metzler acknowledged that dts was a standard dba tool and that the use of that tool for applications could be learned from manuals and online help resources available to metzler.thus,metzler has also not raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the training or resources provided by fhlb suggests pretext.
finally,nothing about the time estimates within which metzler was to complete the new job duties suggests pretext.the record indicates that the deadlines imposed on metzler were developed by miller who metzler describes as having at least some background in sql servers,and were reviewed by michael smith an outside consultant with dba expertise and bill mcspadden fhlb applications development manager who also had some experience as a dba.the record also indicates that both smith and mcspadden assured miller that her time estimates for the assignments were reasonable,and that miller adjusted the one time estimate brought to her attention by metzler as mistaken.thus,nothing in the record suggests that the deadlines imposed on metzler were generally unreasonable or that any mistake in the time estimations was the result of retaliation rather than oversight.flasher,cir a mistaken belief can be a legitimate reason for an employment decision and is not necessarily pretextual.
this leaves only the october counseling document.a single event can not logically constitute a pattern of retaliatory conduct sufficient to raise an inference of pretext.in any event,we note that fhlb expressed some concern about metzler performance and attitude before she took leave,which weakens the relevance of the temporal proximity between the october counseling document and the protected activity.see smith allen health,cir evidence that the employer had been concerned about a problem before the employee engaged in the protected activity undercuts the significance of the temporal proximity.accordingly,metzler has not demonstrated a pattern of retaliatory conduct beginning soon after she engaged in protected activity and culminating in her eventual discharge that gives rise to the inference that her termination was retaliatory.
fhlb prior treatment of metzler 
metzler asserts,as her third piece of circumstantial evidence demonstrating pretext,that fhlb treatment of her after she invoked her fmla rights differed from fhlb prior treatment of her.metzler contends that,prior to october,she had never received a written counseling statement from any of her managers.additionally,metzler received overall performance ratings of meets expectations on her performance evaluation in,and her final year reviewed.for each of these years,metzler also received ratings of successful in the areas of works well with others and works efficiently.after her reduced leave schedule began,metzler received the october counseling document,was required to attend at least two counseling meetings november and november,and was then discharged on november for poor performance and attitude.metzler claims that this evidence raises an inference of retaliatory motive under our holding in simms oklahoma ex rel.of mental health,cir.
while e vidence of pretext may include prior treatment of plaintiff,id.at see also garrett,at same,the record does not support metzler claim that her evaluations after october differed materially in an unexplained way from her evaluations before that date instead,the record indicates that metzler last three annual evaluations contained negative comments about her job skills attitude.additionally,the record indicates that multiple fhlb managers or consultants expressed doubts about metzler performance months before the reorganization and her invocation of fmla rights.for example,in march of,brad hodges it director andruss supervisor stated,in a memo to andruss,that he believed metzler had retired on the job and suggested that she be asked to resign to replace the position with needed skill set.andruss described metzler as on the bubble and in need of immediate improvement of her skill set,and recommended,in a report dated august,that metzler be put on an probation so that a recommendation will be developed to either retain nancy or if she is unable to adjust to the new reporting structure and discipline imposed she will be replaced.
additionally,people outside the chain of command at fhlb expressed concern about metzler.in april or may,michael smith,who was hired by fhlb as an outside manager consultant,interviewed each of the employees of the it department in an attempt to assess where they might fit in a reorganized department.after his interview with metzler,he stated in his june report that 
i have struggled for the past couple of months to examine the future of nancy metzler with fhlb i feel that her skills are adequate,but not exceptional.i believe that nancy can do the job that she is responsible for,but i am not sure how dedicated she is to that effort.
overall,i feel that nancy is a possible fit for fhlb.with bill montgomery evaluation as she reports to him,fhlb will be able to know if nancy skills will be a good fit for the bank.
thus,as the district court found,the documentation of plaintiff job skills and attitude prior to october is not so distinctively different from documentation of the same after that date 
although metzler evaluations before her fmla leave are to some extent similar to her evaluations after her leave,we have previously held that prior negative comments on their own do not automatically negate an inference of pretext.see garrett,at stating that the mere fact that the employee evaluations bear evidence of past criticism of his work habits does not negate the possibility that the justifications given for the employee negative evaluations are pretextual.a jury could reasonably infer that the employee supervisors discriminated against him by inflating and exaggerating critiques of his performance as a means of exercising racist and ageist animus towards him.however,there is no evidence in this case to suggest that fhlb criticism of metzler was inflat ed and exaggerat ed as a means of retaliating against metzler.instead,the evidence indicates that any change in fhlb treatment of metzler coincided with her placement under a new the reorganization.
we have previously held that a plaintiff may show pretext by providing evidence that he was treated differently from other employees who violated work rules of comparable seriousness.kendrick penske transp,cir.in this context,we have defined similarly situated employees as those who deal with the same supervisor and are subject to the same standards governing performance evaluation and discipline.rivera city and county of denver,cir quotations omitted.based on this definition,we have held that pretext can not be inferred where,for example,one supervisor treats one employee one way and another supervisor treats another employee a different way,reasoning that d ifferent supervisors will inevitably react differently to employee insubordination.id.quoting kendrick,at.
although metzler does not claim that she was treated differently than other fhlb employees,she does assert that fhlb treatment of her prior to taking fmla leave differed from fhlb treatment of her after taking such leave.applying the appropriate analog from cases like kendrick and rivera,we do not infer pretext from fhlb different treatment of metzler where the alleged different treatment was inflicted by different is,treatment by her supervisors montgomery and grote as compared to treatment by her supervisor miller because any difference may be the result of different supervisor reactions considering that one of the major reasons for reorganizing the it department was to have a team in place that affords a reasonable probability of success in effectively developing and implementing fhlb technology plan,the imposition of stricter work standards is reasonable.thus,even if the october counseling document reflects these stricter standards or higher expectations by a new manager,it does not constitute evidence that miller or the other fhlb supervisors,for that of those standards was pretextual.ultimately then,on this record,metzler has not established that the change in fhlb treatment of metzler was based on her invocation of fmla rights rather than the imposition of different standards of behavior and performance by her new supervisor.
fhlb action contrary to handbook policy 
metzler contends that,according to the fhlb employee handbook,it was written company policy that an employee will be informed if corrective action is necessary as soon as possible after any deficiency in standard of behavior or performance has been identified.we agree that demonstrating that the defendant acted contrary to a written company policy prescribing the action to be taken by the defendant under the circumstances may in an appropriate case give rise to a fact issue regarding pretext.kendrick,at.however,the facts of this case do not support such a conclusion.
here,even if fhlb employee handbook is interpreted to require fhlb to warn employees that identified deficiencies could result in termination rather than merely requiring fhlb to inform employees of the deficiencies,the uncontested facts show that fhlb provided such a warning to metzler.the october counseling document,which metzler admits receiving,explicitly warned that if certain deficiencies do not dramatically improve within the next weeks or other deadlines established,you will be counseled further,up to and including termination.emphasis added.fhlb therefore complied with its employee handbook policy.metzler therefore has not raised a genuine fact issue regarding whether fhlb complied with the written company policies in its employee handbook.
fhlb documentation of metzler file in anticipation of litigation 
the fifth piece of circumstantial evidence upon which metzler relies to show pretext consists of fhlb documenting metzler file in anticipation of litigation.we have previously held that a reasonable jury might consider testimony that documents were prepared in anticipation of litigation as circumstantial evidence of retaliatory motive.pastran,at.metzler asserts that this case is analogous to pastran because miller acknowledged in a november,memo that she was to document problems with metzler enough so the bank was not at risk of losing a lawsuit for unjustified termination,and because she did in fact so document the file with the assistance of andruss and cox.
we agree with the district court conclusion that pastran,as well as other appellate decisions recognizing documentation in anticipation of litigation as evidence of pretext,are distinguishable from this case.in pastran,the employee called his employer to ask whether he had lost his job.at.after replying that he was not sure,the manager consulted with his supervisor and the employer legal department about preparing statements regarding past employment action taken in relation to the employee.id.the suspicious timing of that the fact and in anticipation of gave rise to an inference of pretext.id.at compare walton nalco chem,cir holding that a jury reasonably could have found that the employer orchestrated the employment document as pretextual support for its discriminatory decision to discharge the employee,where the document was prepared only after the employer received notification from the employee attorney claiming age discrimination centennial wireless,cir stating that pretext may be established with evidence that nondiscriminatory reasons were justifications,provided subsequent to the beginning of legal action,with shorette rite aid of maine,cir holding that the employee failed to demonstrate that the employer reasons for demoting the employee were pretextual where there was no evidence that management notes were produced after the employee filed suit instead of contemporaneously with the employee training.
here,miller testified that she documented the performance of metzler,and all of her other subordinates,contemporaneously with her dealings with them.and no evidence suggests otherwise.although miller statement in her november memo that part of her goal was to document metzler file to avoid the risk of losing a lawsuit for unjustified termination because fhlb may have a lawsuit problem with metzler gives rise to an inference of retaliatory motive,we do not understand why it is improper for an employer to maintain records regarding an employee conduct even if it recognizes that the record may be useful in defense against a discrimination claim.indeed,it would be expected that an employer would do exactly that.billet cigna,cir,overruled in part on other grounds by mary honor ctr.hicks,d,and by consolidated coin caterers,d.we therefore conclude that fhlb contemporaneous documenting of metzler file does not suggest that fhlb created the documents as pretextual support for her retaliatory termination,even if the documents were in part created to avoid or defend against possible future litigation.
proof that fhlb explanation is unworthy of credence 
relying on reeves sanderson plumbing,d,the final piece of circumstantial evidence that metzler claims demonstrates a pretextual explanation for her termination consists of proof that fhlb explanation is unworthy of credence.specifically,metzler relies on the united states supreme court explanation that 
in appropriate circumstances,the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose moreover,once the employer justification has been eliminated,discrimination may well be the most likely alternative explanation,especially since the employer is in the best position to put forth the actual reason for its decision.
id.at.citations omitted see also kendrick,at a plaintiff typically makes a showing of pretext with evidence that the defendant stated reason for the adverse employment action was false.
metzler asserts that fhlb explanations of her performance and poor false.in regard to poor performance,metzler does not controvert fhlb evidence that she missed most,if not all,of the deadlines imposed for her tasks from october to the date of her termination.instead,metzler again argues that several of miller time estimates were unreasonable and that a reasonable jury could thus infer a retaliatory motive for fhlb termination of her employment.
metzler mere allegation that miller did not honestly believe her time estimations were reasonable,without any supporting evidence,does not raise a genuine issue of material fact,especially in light of other undisputed evidence in the record.see cone longmont united hosp.ass n,cir stating that allegations alone will not defeat summary judgment.specifically,the record indicates that miller delivered to metzler the time estimates for her assignments only after she had them reviewed by smith and mcspadden,both of whom assured miller that the time estimates were reasonable.the fact that the time estimates may have been incorrect does not give rise to an inference that miller,smith,or mcspadden did not honestly believe miller time estimations were reasonable because a mistaken belief can be a legitimate reason for an employment decision and is not necessarily pretextual.flasher,at see also mcknight kimberly clark,cir explaining that the test for converting an articulated motivating reason into pretext is good faith belief.
furthermore,the actual decision to terminate her was made by cox,andruss,hodges,and andrew jetter,fhlb president.although the evidence indicates that decision was based on miller november memo outlining metzler performance and attitude problems and her failure to meet project deadlines,there is no evidence to support a claim that the fhlb did not honestly believe the reasons stated in miller november memo this is important because we have held that a challenge of pretext requires us to look at the facts as they appear to the person making the decision to terminate plaintiff.kendrick,at see also pastran,at explaining that t he pertinent question in determining pretext is not whether the employer was right to think the employee engaged in misconduct,but whether that belief was genuine or pretextual quotations omitted.without evidence indicating that these did not honestly believe the reasons expressed in miller november memo,metzler has not raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding fhlb explanation that metzler was terminated,in part,because she repeatedly missed deadlines.
fhlb also claims that it terminated metzler because of her poor attitude and failure to maintain adequate skills.metzler generally disputes that her attitude was as fhlb describes and that her knowledge and performance were as fhlb assessed.even assuming metzler subjectively believed she did not have a poor attitude or that her knowledge and performance were up to par,i t is the manager perception of the employee performance that is relevant,not plaintiff subjective evaluation of her own relative performance.furr seagate,cir.no evidence suggests that miller,or the fhlb,did not genuinely perceive metzler as having a poor attitude and inadequate job skills.accordingly,metzler has not raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding fhlb explanation that metzler was terminated,in part,because of a poor attitude and lack of adequate job skills.
conclusion 
while evidence of temporal proximity in combination with additional circumstantial evidence may give rise to an genuine issue of material fact regarding whether an employer offered a pretextual reason for terminating an employee,see marx,at,the record in this case indicates that metzler was terminated for her failure to meet deadlines and other poor job performance,poor attitude,and failure to maintain adequate skills.without evidence to demonstrate that fhlb given reasons for terminating her are so weak,implausible,inconsistent,incoherent,or contradictory as to support a reasonable inference that fhlb did not act for those reasons,see medina,at,we conclude that metzler has failed to meet her burden to demonstrate pretext.accordingly,we affirm summary judgment in favor of fhlb on metzler fmla retaliation claim.
ii.interference or entitlement claim 
the fmla guarantees the substantive rights of up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave for eligible employees of covered employers for serious health conditions and reinstatement to the former position or an equivalent one upon return from that leave.a,a.under the fmla,an employer may not interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise,any right provided under the fmla.id.a.to prevail on an interference or entitlement theory,the plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she was entitled to fmla leave,that some adverse action by the employer interfered with his or her right to take fmla leave,and that the employer action was related to the exercise or attempted exercise of his fmla rights.jones,at.under this theory,a denial,interference,or restraint of fmla rights is a violation regardless of the employer intent,bones honeywell int l,cir citing smith,at,and the mcdonnell douglas analysis does not apply to interference claims,smith at.
section a is nevertheless not a strict liability statute.see a b nothing in this section shall be construed to entitle any restored employee to any right,benefit,or position of employment other than any right,benefit,or position to which the employee would have been entitled had the employee not taken the leave.a an employee has no greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if the employee had been continuously employed during the fmla leave period.see also smith,at a n employee who requests fmla leave would have no greater protections against his or her employment being terminated for reasons not related to his or her fmla request than he or she did before submitting the request.quotations omitted.thus,an employee may be dismissed,preventing her from exercising her statutory right to fmla leave or reinstatement after leave if the dismissal would have occurred regardless of the employee request for or taking of fmla leave.smith,at citing gunnell,at.the burden to demonstrate that an employee,laid off during fmla leave,would have been dismissed regardless of the employee request for,or taking of,fmla leave is on the.id.at see also a an employer must be able to show that an employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time reinstatement is requested in order to deny restoration to employment.
fhlb stipulated that metzler was entitled to fmla leave for a serious medical condition,thereby establishing the first element of her prima facie case.in regard to the second element,metzler contends the defendant interfered with her fmla substantive rights by wrongfully terminating her employment for deficiently performing new job duties,which were assigned to her upon her return from fmla and for which fhlb failed adequately to train her to perform by terminating metzler employment,fhlb interfered with her right to take up to the twelve weeks to which she was entitled under a and denied her the right to be reinstated to her former position or an equivalent one upon her return to work,thereby establishing the second element of metzler prima facie interference claim the critical inquiry,then,is whether metzler has alleged and presented evidence that there is a causal connection between her termination and her exercise of fmla third element of her prima facie case.
metzler contends that a causal connection exists based on the following chain of events metzler took reduced leave,as a result fhlb adjusted her duties but failed to adequately train her for them,as a further result she performed the duties deficiently,and as an ultimate result
