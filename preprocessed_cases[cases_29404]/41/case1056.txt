paul volkman applied for a federal registration to dispense controlled substances.the drug enforcement agency denied his application,concluding that volkman registration was not in the public interest.the dea reached this conclusion based on its finding that volkman prior prescribing practices violated state and federal law.paul volkman,denial of application,fr,may.volkman petitions this court for review of the dea denial of his application.because the dea determination is in accordance with law and is supported by substantial evidence,we deny volkman petition.
volkman holds an and a from the university of chicago.in,after large medical malpractice settlements and judgments left him unable to purchase malpractice insurance,volkman started working at healthcare,a pain clinic in portsmouth,ohio.denise huffman,who is not a physician or a healthcare professional,owned and paid volkman a week to start.volkman says that he was never a employee,and was,instead,an independent contractor.as required by the controlled substances act,volkman applied for a dea registration to prescribe controlled substances from office.the dea granted his application.
soon after he began working at,pharmacists in the area started complaining to the ohio state board of pharmacy about volkman prescribing practices.one pharmacist said that volkman was writing large quantities of narcotics and benzodiazepines and that many of his patients were prior problem patients of a physician who had been convicted of drug trafficking.that pharmacist refused to fill any of volkman prescriptions.a second pharmacist complained that volkman was prescribing duplicate therapy of narcotics.yet another told the board that he was having trouble with volkman patients,and that they smelled of beer and dope.these calls continued throughout the summer of.around the same time,volkman applied to the board for a terminal distributor of dangerous drugs license a state license that allows a clinic to buy controlled substances and dispense them directly from the clinic.the board inspected clinic and,despite the complaints,granted volkman application for the distribution license.
once volkman had both a dea registration and a state license,using volkman dea registration number,started ordering dosage units of oxycodone and a combination of hydrocodone and acetaminophen.the volume of drug purchases was,compared to other practitioners,very large during the last six months of,purchased more than times the amount of oxycodone purchased by the next largest practitioner.and in,was the largest of oxycodone in the united states.
the dea office in columbus,ohio also received complaints about volkman.one pharmacist in kenova,ohio reported that volkman was prescribing numerous prescriptions for oxycontin and percocet in very large quantities.he reported that the customers with prescriptions from volkman were lining up outside of his pharmacy to get them filled.the columbus dea office got a call from a fellow agent in texas passing along a report from a drug distributor there that volkman had ordered large quantities of combination hydrocodone and acetaminophen.in november,an area physician called the dea to report that numerous volkman patients were seeking detoxification treatment because volkman was prescribing excessive amounts of opiates such as oxycontin,percocet,and hydrocodone.in response to these complaints,the dea obtained pharmacy records and a list of all the scheduled drugs dispensed under volkman prescriptions.
later in,moved its clinic to a new location.the move triggered another inspection by the ohio board of pharmacy.this time,the state agent inspecting found several violations,including incomplete records and dispensing logs.he also noted some remarkable differences between and your normal doctor office,including a glock handgun,two night sticks and a club with leather in the area where the clinic dispensed drugs.the agent also observed that the clinic owner appeared over medicated and received reports that sometimes twenty to thirty cars were lined up outside the clinic.all this led the state agent to suspect that volkman was running a prescription mill.but this suspicion did not induce the board to withhold the clinic state license instead,it issued the license on february,after volkman sent a letter stating that was in compliance with all issues.
there was little activity on the part of the dea or the ohio state board of pharmacy for the following year and half until june,when the dea executed a search warrant at and seized controlled substances,patient records,invoices,dea forms,and financial records.one dea investigator interviewed denise huffman,who reported that the clinic was a full cash business,charging for an office visit.huffman said that her daughter,alice huffman,and volkman were in complete control of the dispensing center.alice huffman confirmed this and provided the agent with the names of two patients who had died from drug overdoses.she also admitted that she was supposed to keep the records,including dispensing logs,but did not and was not sure if inventories existed at all,nor whether any records that might exist would be accurate.the dea agents tried to take an inventory of the drugs they seized by checking dispensing logs against records from the drug distributors.but the agents did not find any initial or biennial inventories of the drugs,nor any dispensing logs for the year.according to the dea,the clinic could not account for over one million products or tablets of the audited controlled substances.denise huffman later produced logs for,but admitted that there were no records for.
volkman continued working at for a few months after the raid,but then quit and started seeing patients out of his apartment.in october,the portsmouth police department executed a search warrant there and seized volkman patient files.the department never filed any charges but issued a condemnation notice for the apartment.
volkman then moved about an hour north to chillicothe,ohio and applied to modify his dea registration to reflect this new location.some four months later,dea investigators obtained a search warrant for the chillicothe clinic,which they executed on february,by,according to volkman brief,sweeping in with helicopters,guns,and masked agents in a shock and awe raid.three days later,the dea served volkman an order to show cause,informing him that his dea registration to distribute controlled substances would be suspended immediately under d because his continued registration constituted an imminent danger to the public health and safety.the next day,volkman filed a written request for an expedited hearing and asked for full access to his records.he later applied for a renewal of his dea registration.
volkman dea hearing started on december,and continued until december.on december,the hearing was adjourned and resumed on january.among other witnesses,two physicians,douglas kennedy and wayne wheeler,testified as experts on behalf of the dea.volkman testified in his defense,as did a former employee and two employees who worked for volkman after he left.both sides also submitted written evidence to the administrative law judge.
the administrative law judge issued her recommendation in june.she found that volkman unlawfully prescribed controlled substances,failed to adequately monitor patients,which directly contributed to the deaths of at least sixteen patients,improperly dispensed controlled substances,did not maintain adequate records or inventories,and repeatedly refused to take responsibility for his behavior.she recommended revocation of his dea registration and denial of any pending applications.
the dea deputy administrator reviewed the evidence and the administrative law judge recommendations and concluded that granting volkman application for a new registration would be inconsistent with the public interest,in contravention of f,based on volkman experience in dispensing controlled substances,his lack of compliance with state and federal law relating to controlled substances,and other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.the deputy administrator also considered and rejected volkman claims that he was denied due process and that the decision was in conflict with the supreme court decision in gonzales oregon,d.volkman petitions this court for review.
the deputy administrator factual findings are conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence.the administrative procedures act provides the applicable standard of review for the deputy administrator exercise of discretion.hoxie dea,cir.thus,this court will set aside a revocation of a dea certificate if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.quoting a.the record must reflect a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.id.
volkman challenges the denial of his application for dea registration on several grounds.first,he argues that the dea adjudication denied him due process by providing him inadequate notice and opportunity to be heard.next,he contends that the dea denial of his controlled substances act registration is unlawful because it is an impermissible determination of what is legitimate medical practice by a federal agency that lacks the expertise or authority to make such a determination.the dea denial of his registration,he argues,was an unauthorized attempt to define the substantive standards of medical practice in violation of the supreme court decision in gonzales oregon,d.finally,he argues that the dea factual determinations are not supported by substantial evidence.we consider each of these arguments.
a.the dea adjudication satisfied due process requirements 
the due process clause forbids an agency from using evidence in a way that forecloses an opportunity for a party to offer a contrary presentation.bowman transp.freight,d.in addition,the administrative procedures act,which provides the procedures for agency adjudication,states that p ersons entitled to notice of an agency hearing shall be timely informed of the time,place,and nature of the hearing the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held and the matters of facts and law asserted.b.the dea regulations further require that an order to show cause contain a summary of the matters of fact and law asserted.c.
volkman procedural attack focuses on his notice of the charges against him.he argues that the record from the agency proceeding exhibits a shocking litany of new charges,modified charges,reduced charges,enhanced charges,patients,unidentified patients,new evidence,suspicious evidence,no evidence,hearsay,rampant speculation,and wholly irrelevant and prejudicial testimony.more specifically,he argues that the dea presented evidence at the hearing that grossly exceeded the scope of the february show cause order.
the order to show cause alleged that eleven of volkman patients had died from the effects of drugs that volkman had prescribed.although the order itself did not identify the names of the patients,the dea provided those names in its march statement.as the hearing approached,the dea indicated to volkman that it did not intend to introduce patient files into evidence,yet the dea delivered nine patient files to volkman counsel four days before the hearing convened.among these files were the six patient files ultimately reviewed by the dea expert,kennedy.one of the patients included in the case,charles robert jordan,was not included in the order to show cause.although initially volkman had only four days to review the files and prepare for the hearing after the dea had provided him with the patient files supporting its expert testimony,the administrative law judge adjourned the hearing for approximately one month and also allowed volkman to defer his until then.
volkman also complains that at the hearing itself,the government witnesses brought forth information,without a single chart in evidence,about at least patients.volkman maintains that he could never be certain how many patients were at issue,who the specific patients were,what their charts showed or did not show,and what criticisms were being leveled at him.the dea deputy administrator considered this argument,and,after finding that volkman did not preserve it because he did not provide specific and complete citations of the pages of the transcript,observed that she nonetheless did not rely on this portion of the evidence.thus,even if the administrative law judge erred by admitting certain exhibits,the error was not prejudicial because the deputy administrator did not rely on the exhibit with additional patients in reaching her determination.
volkman compares the dea treatment of his case to the federal trade commission handling of a charge in bendix,cir.in bendix,this court vacated the ftc decision and remanded because the commission decided the case on a theory of illegality which was never charged,raised,nor tried during the administrative hearing never presented for consideration by the hearing examiner and not raised as an issue or discussed in the appeal,id.at,thus denying bendix notice and an opportunity to present evidence in defense.id.
the case against volkman bears no resemblance to the procedural violations in bendix.here,among other allegations,the show cause order specifically alleged that volkman had prescribed multiple controlled substances to persons who,within days,died from overdoses of the drugs.it also alleged that he was ordering excessive quantities of controlled substances,far more than his peers,and that volkman did not perform physical examinations or keep proper dispensing records.these were the same theories that the dea advanced throughout the proceedings against volkman,including at the hearing before the administrative law judge.the specificity and detail of the show cause order,as clarified by the brief,provided volkman with notice with the nature of the dea case.indeed,unlike in bendix,volkman knew from the beginning the nature of the dea basis for suspending and later denying his registration to distribute controlled substances.moreover,the administrative law judge adjourned the hearing to provide volkman ample time to review the specific patient files that supported the government case.and at the hearing,volkman counsel was able to the dea witnesses and probe their testimony for weaknesses.we therefore conclude that the agency adjudication was procedurally adequate and provided volkman with a meaningful opportunity to prepare and present his defense.
b.the dea denial of volkman registration was authorized by the controlled substances act 
we next consider volkman challenge to the dea denial of his registration against the backdrop of the controlled substances act and the supreme court decision in gonzales oregon,d.
a main objective of the controlled substances act is controlling illegitimate traffic in controlled substances,by placing substances in one of five schedules based on their potential for abuse or dependence,their accepted medical use,and their accepted safety for use under medical supervision.id.at.to prevent diversion of controlled substances with medical uses,the csa regulates the activity of physicians.to issue lawful prescriptions of schedule ii drugs,physicians must obtain from the attorney general a registration issued in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by him.id.quoting a.
under the controlled substances act,the dea may deny an application for a practitioner registration upon a determination that the issuance of such registration would be inconsistent with the public interest.f.in determining whether a registration is in the public interest,the attorney general shall consider these factors 
the recommendation of the appropriate state licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.
the applicant experience in dispensing,or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.
the applicant conviction record under federal or state laws relating to the manufacture,distribution,or dispensing of controlled substances.
compliance with applicable state,federal,or local laws relating to controlled substances.
such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.
