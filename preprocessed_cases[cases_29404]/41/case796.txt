washington county hospital association wcha terminated louis gabaldoni clinical privileges and denied his application for reappointment to the medical staff.gabaldoni filed a lawsuit alleging various contract and tort claims against wcha and antietam,wcha sister company.the district court granted summary judgment to wcha and antietam on all of gabaldoni claims.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
louis gabaldoni is an who first became a member of the medical staff of private hospital located in hagerstown.like any other member of the medical staff,gabaldoni was required to apply for reappointment to the medical staff every two years.
in july,gabaldoni submitted his biannual application for reappointment to wcha.after various committees reviewed gabaldoni application,the wcha board of trustees board elected both to terminate his clinical privileges and to deny his application for reappointment to the medical staff.the board notified gabaldoni about its decision by letter,in which the board explained its reasoning as follows 
the findings and conclusions of the grievance committee clearly indicate a serious transgression on your part with respect to a patient medical chart.furthermore,your record indicates there have been two other grievances within the last two years and a total of four grievances within the last ten years,in addition to this most recent grievance some of the more significant aspects reviewed by the board and which influenced their decision are your record of multiple grievances,reviews of your clinical judgment and performance in several cases,your behavior indicating a lack of regard for rules and regulations,multiple suspensions for failure to complete medical charts,and your record of suits and complaints alleging professional negligence.
in the same letter,the board also notified gabaldoni of his right to a hearing regarding the board decision to deny his reappointment.
gabaldoni elected to request such a hearing,and a hearing committee comprising an ad hoc group of doctors was convened to hear the evidence,render findings of fact,and recommend to the board whether gabaldoni should be reappointed.gabaldoni attorney called witnesses and presented numerous supportive affidavits from patients and physicians at the hearing.thereafter,the hearing committee recommended to the board that gabaldoni be conditionally reappointed and that a letter of censure be placed in his file.
after reviewing the record,the board again elected to terminate gabaldoni clinical privileges and deny his reappointment,contrary to the recommendation of the hearing committee.in a letter to gabaldoni,the board explained the basis for its decision as follows 
the board decision was to terminate your medical staff membership and clinical privileges on the basis of the most recent grievance and your record of prior grievances.the hearing committee found as a fact that you inappropriately altered a patient original chart and failed to document an important aspect pertinent to the patient care.the board was aware of an inordinate number of previous grievances against you as well as their frequency and nature,especially the fact that one of the previous grievances established that you altered a medical record.the board feels your record indicates a pattern of failure to adhere to established and basic tenets of ethical and professional behavior.
the board also decided to deny your application for reappointment and renewal of your clinical privileges.in reaching the decision the board considered not only the most recent grievance but your entire record of performance and behavior at the hospital five grievances,multiple suspensions from the medical staff for failure to complete medical charts in timely fashion,four malpractice suits of which one is pending and three have been settled by substantial payments by you or your insurance company,and approximately,professional opinions indicating multiple breaches in standards of care and deficiencies in your clinical judgment.
gabaldoni subsequently filed this lawsuit against wcha and antietam,a medical service organization that is wholly owned by washington county health systems,wcha parent company.he alleged that wcha breached its bylaws by denying his reappointment and terminating his clinical privileges and by disseminating information to hospital personnel and third parties regarding the same.he also alleged that wcha and antietam tortiously interfered with his contractual and business relations.the district court granted summary judgment to wcha and antietam on all counts of the complaint,and this appeal followed.
the district court granted summary judgment to wcha on gabaldoni breach of contract claims which were based upon wcha alleged breach of the bylaws on the ground that wcha was entitled to immunity from damages under the health care quality improvement act hcqia.see a.the hcqia provides a professional review body with immunity from damages whenever a professional review action is taken 
in the reasonable belief that the action was in the furtherance of quality health care,
after a reasonable effort to obtain the facts of the matter,
after adequate notice and hearing procedures are afforded to the physician involved or after such other procedures as are fair to the physician under the circumstances,and 
in the reasonable belief that the action was warranted by the facts known after such reasonable effort to obtain facts and after meeting the requirement of paragraph.
a professional review action shall be presumed to have met the preceding standards necessary for the protection set out in section a of this title unless the presumption is rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.
a.due to the presumption of immunity contained in section a,we must apply an unconventional standard in determining whether wcha was entitled to summary a reasonable jury,viewing all facts in a light most favorable to gabaldoni,could conclude that he had shown,by a preponderance of the evidence,that wcha actions fell outside the scope of section a.see,sugarbaker ssm health care,cir brader allegheny general hospital,cir.
on appeal,gabaldoni challenges the district court grant of summary judgment on the ground that he presented sufficient evidence to create a jury issue with regard to every element in section a.like the district court,we reject gabaldoni arguments and hold that there was insufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that the board actions fell outside the scope of section a 
first,to receive hcqia immunity,the professional review action must be taken in the reasonable belief that the action was in furtherance of quality health care.gabaldoni argues that because several committees without final decisionmaking authority recommended reappointment there is a genuine issue of material fact about whether the action taken by the board in denying reappointment and terminating gabaldoni privileges was in furtherance of quality health care.we disagree.
we apply an objective test which looks to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether a professional review action was undertaken in the reasonable belief that quality health care was being furthered.imperial,at emphasis in original.as the board explained in its letters to gabaldoni,he had been the subject of multiple malpractice lawsuits,suspensions,and grievances.moreover,two of those grievances were related to the tragic death of his patient.thus,the record is replete with objective evidence of gabaldoni deviations from hospital policy and the applicable standard of care the board reasonably relied on,and even cited,such evidence in support of its decision to deny reappointment and terminate his privileges.furthermore,even the committee reports relied upon by gabaldoni acknowledged that there were problems with his performance and thus proposed that conditions be placed on his reappointment.
accordingly,we agree with the district court that l ooking objectively at the totality of the circumstances there was clearly enough evidence against gabaldoni for the board to believe that it was furthering the quality of health care in terminating his p
