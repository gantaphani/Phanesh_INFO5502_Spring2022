health center claiborne is a skilled nursing facility in franklin,tennessee that participates in the federal medicare program.the united states department of health and human services requires facilities that participate in the medicare or medicaid programs to comply with certain minimum standards of care.inspections completed in august and september of revealed that claiborne was noncompliant with a number of these standards.based upon those findings,the united states centers for medicare and medicaid services cms imposed a civil money penalty cmp and a denial of payment for new admissions dpna.these sanctions were sustained by an administrative law judge alj on the basis of one finding of noncompliance from each inspection,although both inspections found multiple instances of noncompliance.with some adjustments,the alj findings were affirmed by the appellate division of the departmental appeals board dab.claiborne appeals,and for the following reasons,we affirm.
although the administrative proceedings encompassed a wide range of factual issues,this appeal is focused on the care claiborne provided to two of its residents,resident and resident,a male resident,was admitted to claiborne in september with a diagnosis that included diabetes,dementia,and depression.totally dependent on claiborne staff,he could not eat or drink without assistance,could not chew solid food,and had difficulty swallowing pureed food and thickened liquids.because of these conditions,claiborne determined that was at risk for malnutrition,dehydration,and weight loss.accordingly,care plan contained several interventions.these included maintaining daily records of his food consumption and fluid intake him his meals,which consisted of pureed food helping him to drink thickened liquids and providing nutritional supplements.
on june,weight was recorded as pounds.by late june and through the first half of july,diet flow sheets indicate that his food intake decreased markedly.the next time claiborne weighed,on july,his weight was recorded as pounds,revealing a loss of pounds during this period.the weight loss was reported to claiborne dietary manager,who then instructed the staff to.a few days earlier,on july,doctor visited,and during that visit discussed aspects of condition with claiborne staff members.
on the afternoon of july,before he was,was unresponsive and in respiratory distress.claiborne then contacted his family and his doctor,and was immediately transferred to a hospital where his weight was recorded as pounds.he died on july.
the second incident involves claiborne care of,a female resident.as of august,had been placed on claiborne focused hydration list,indicating that claiborne was to provide with extra fluids in order to help treat her urinary tract infection.however,diet flow sheets for august,august,and september,failed to show that her fluid intake even met her estimated daily need of cubic centimeters.
ii.the regulatory landscape 
to be eligible for reimbursement for services provided to patients under the federal medicare and medicaid programs,skilled nursing facilities must comply with the requirements set forth in and et.to determine compliance,the secretary of the united states department of health and human services secretary contracts with state agencies to conduct inspections known as surveys.during the surveys,the state agency records any noncompliance that it discovers and notes its severity.id.b.the severity categories range from the lowest,n o actual harm with a potential for minimum harm,to the highest,noncompliance that causes immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety.id.instances of noncompliance are called deficiencies.id.
the regulations define immediate jeopardy as a situation where the noncompliance has caused,or is likely to cause,serious injury,harm,impairment,or death to a resident.such a finding exposes the medicare provider to a cmp ranging from to per day.see id.e ii,a i.cms may impose cmps ranging from to per day for deficiencies of lesser severity that are substantial but do not reach the immediate jeopardy level.id.a ii.
iii.the administrative proceedings 
the tennessee department of health began a survey of claiborne in the summer of.the initial survey was completed on august,and surveys were completed on september and october of the same year.the august survey found seven deficiencies that reached the immediate jeopardy level.based upon these findings,cms imposed a cmp of per day,effective july.cms also imposed a dpna effective august.the september survey found that the immediate jeopardy level of noncompliance had been rectified.this finding ended the imposition of the per day penalty on september.however,three additional deficiencies remained.cms therefore imposed a per day cmp,effective september,and kept the dpna in effect.the october survey found that claiborne was in substantial compliance with all regulations as of september.the per day cmp and the dpna accordingly ended on september.
claiborne filed an administrative appeal challenging the survey immediate jeopardy and noncompliance findings.the alj accumulated a voluminous record consisting of documentary evidence and extensive briefing by both parties.although the august survey found seven deficiencies,the alj upheld the immediate jeopardy level cmp by addressing only the care of.because cms imposed the minimum penalty here,the presence of only one such immediate jeopardy level deficiency would be sufficient to sustain the penalty amount.in upholding cms decision,the alj concluded that claiborne failure to immediately contact family and doctor regarding the change in his condition resulted in noncompliance with b,which provides in pertinent part 
notification of changes.i a facility must immediately consult with a resident physician and notify the resident legal representative or an interested family member when there is b a significant change in the resident physical,mental,or psychosocial status,a deterioration in health,mental,or psychosocial status in either conditions or clinical complications.
the alj agreed with the august survey finding that claiborne noncompliance with b had put the health and safety of and the other residents in immediate jeopardy.the alj also agreed that claiborne did not prove that it corrected this noncompliance before september,and upheld the per day cmp and the dpna remedies in full.
claiborne appealed the alj decision to the dab,which upheld the alj decision as to the per day cmp and the dpna on substantially similar grounds.the dab agreed with cms and the alj that food intake diminished sharply in june and july.it also agreed that prior to july,when claiborne spoke with doctor,claiborne should have recognized that decreased food intake constituted a significant change.the dab also agreed that because claiborne had not properly notified family or doctor about the significant change in his condition,it failed to comply with b,and the deficiency reached the immediate jeopardy level of severity.
in his initial decision,the alj also upheld the per day cmp spanning september through september.the dab overturned this cmp and remanded back to the alj,who upheld the cmp on other grounds that were again rejected by the dab on appeal.after rejecting this second cmp,the dab eschewed another remand to avoid delay,and itself reviewed the september survey finding of noncompliance in relation to claiborne care of.in so doing,it reviewed the finding under the de novo standard that the alj would have applied.
the september survey concluded that claiborne failure to properly document its hydration procedures in case resulted in noncompliance with j,which required claiborne to provide each resident with sufficient fluid intake to maintain proper hydration and health.the dab further agreed that although the potential for harm was more than minimal,the noncompliance did not rise to the level of immediate jeopardy.as a result,a cmp of per day was imposed from september,to september,which is the minimum penalty allowed under the regulation.after this final review by the dab,claiborne filed this petition for review.
