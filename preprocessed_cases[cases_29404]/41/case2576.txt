city of hobbs,new mexico,police officers rodney porter and sergeant walter pope,appeal a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff jimmie marshall for violation of his fourth amendment right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure.the officers do not dispute that they violated marshall fourth amendment rights when they ordered a warrantless,nonconsensual blood test for an alleged misdemeanor.nevertheless,the officers contend the district court erred in denying their motion for judgment as a matter of law based on qualified immunity because no clearly established law precluded the test.we affirm the district court.
background 
factual history 
we described the factual history of this some of the troubles of the city police marshall columbia lea regional hospital,cir marshall i 
on december,marshall,an electrician,was driving his gold toyota pickup in hobbs,new mexico,when he noticed a police car parked by the side of the road with its lights off.according to marshall,the police identified as officer rodney his pickup for several blocks.while marshall was stopped at an intersection with his signal blinking,officer porter pulled up alongside the pickup and gaz ed intently at marshall face,which marshall infers was for the purpose of ascertaining his race.officer porter contends that marshall failed to stop at the stop sign,which marshall denies.
officer porter then activated his emergency lights,but marshall continued to drive for more than two miles before coming to a stop at his residence.marshall claims that he evaded the officer for several miles because he was fearful to stop his vehicle outside of the presence of witnesses,on account of the reputation of the hobbs police department for racist practices.at that time,marshall did not know officer porter and did not have any information about him.in the criminal complaint filed as a result of the incident,officer porter stated that marshall accelerated to miles per hour,drove through a stop,and weaved from lane to lane,which marshall denies.however,officer porter made no mention of these allegations in the affidavit he filed in this case describing the events of december,nor were they mentioned in defendants later pleadings.
on the street in front of marshall residence,the two men emerged from their vehicles.officer porter had drawn his pistol.his first words were to accuse marshall of being on crack,which marshall has consistently denied.defendants have proffered no evidence in support of this accusation.officer porter states that marshall had the odor of alcohol on his breath,which marshall does not deny,stating that he had imbibed one drink with his brother alfred.officer porter arrested marshall on various charges,including the traffic violation,driving under the influence,and resisting arrest.on the written citation form,in the space for indicating the gender of the person receiving the citation,officer porter wrote,presumably meaning black male.
after arresting marshall,officer porter proceeded to search marshall truck.the search revealed a caliber pistol under the driver seat apparently lawful,and officer porter claimed also to have found a small amount of a green leafy substance,a contention marshall denies.marshall was taken to the city jail,where several sobriety tests were performed on him.marshall passed two breathalyzer tests,but had difficulty completing the recitation of the alphabet the abc test.there is conflicting testimony about whether the horizontal gaze stymosis test was administered,and whether marshall passed the test.
officer porter then transported marshall to the columbia lea regional hospital for blood testing.marshall claims his request to put on his shoes was refused,despite the winter weather,and that his socks became soaked with urine that had pooled on the back floor of the police car.while waiting for sergeant roye to arrive at the hospital,officer porter interrogated the handcuffed marshall for over twenty minutes,again accusing him of being on crack.i know you came from a crack house.you might as well admit it,because i know you went there to get some crack.during this interrogation marshall stated that the blood test might test positive for marijuana.
thereafter,sergeant roye and nurse iris goad entered the room.when nurse goad approached marshall,he said,you do have my consent oral or written to take my blood.but if you i rather you not stick me with that needle.but if you go going to take my blood,i not going to resist,but you do have my consent oral or written.at that point sergeant roye told nurse goad,and give it to him.i consent.marshall then held his handcuffed arms in front of him for the blood test.the record contains a consent form,initialed by officer porter,which states refused to sign.gave verbal consent.two vials of blood were taken.the laboratory tests subsequently found no evidence of alcohol or other illegal drugs,but revealed the presence of thc,the active ingredient in marijuana,in marshall bloodstream.
after the events in the hospital,marshall was returned to the jail,where he was confined for several hours before his mother obtained his release on bail.later,he was charged in a criminal complaint with i possession of a controlled substance marijuana,ii resisting,evading or obstructing a police officer,iii negligent use of a firearm possession while intoxicated,iv reckless driving,v running a stop sign,and vi driving under the influence.in may,the da entered a nolle prosequi because the evidence obtained in the case had been suppressed.the record does not contain any further information about that proceeding,or the legal basis for the suppression of the evidence.

procedural history 
in november,marshall filed a action in federal district court against the officers,the police chief,the hospital,and the nurse who administered the blood test.in june,the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants.in marshall i,we reversed the district court in part,holding that critical questions of fact remained with respect to marshall equal protection,fourth amendment,and related claims against the officers and the city.id.at.
on remand,the district court held a bifurcated trial.in the first phase of the trial,which involved claims against the officers,the jury rendered a special verdict in favor of marshall on his fourth amendment claim against officers porter and roye.the jury awarded marshall compensatory damages of from both officer porter and officer roye,and punitive damages in the amount of against officer porter and against officer roye.
in the second phase,the court granted judgment as a matter of law to the city on the supervisory and municipal liability claims.following entry of judgment,the officers filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law based on qualified immunity.the district court denied the motion.
ii.discussion 
the officers contend that the district court erred when it denied their motion for judgment as a matter of law based on qualified immunity.they maintain that,at the time they ordered the nurse to draw marshall blood against his will,no clearly established law precluded a warrantless nonconsensual blood test.hence,they argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.escue,cir.the supreme court has recognized that qualified immunity embodies an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation,conditioned on the resolution of the essentially legal question whether the conduct of which the plaintiff complains violated clearly established law.mitchell forsyth,d.
rule a motion requirements.
we begin by sua sponte addressing one procedural hurdle.although the officers raised the qualified immunity defense in their answer to marshall amended complaint,in their motion for summary judgment prior to the first appeal in this case,and later in their motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule b c,the officers apparently did not raise qualified immunity in their rule a motion which is a prerequisite to a motion under rule b the renewed motion under rule b can not assert grounds for relief not asserted in the original motion.see anderson united,cir using the directed verdict and judgment nomenclature of rule prior to its amendment in mccardle haddad,cir in sum,a posttrial motion for judgment as a matter of law can properly be made only if,and to the extent that,such a motion specifying the same grounds was made prior to the submission of the case to the jury.to hold otherwise would be in contravention of the purposes of rule a.miller eby realty group llc,cir.
the provisions of rule a and b thus serve two purposes they protect the seventh amendment right to trial by jury,and ensur e that the opposing party has enough notice of the alleged error to permit an attempt to cure it before resting.id.quoting fslic reeves,cir.marshall does not mention this issue in his response brief before us,although at oral argument,counsel reminded the panel that qualified immunity was not raised until after the jury reached its verdict.marshall failure to challenge the rule b motion in his brief specifically on the grounds that the issue was waived by an inadequate rule a motion results in a waiver of the issue.state farm fire cas.mhoon,cir stating that failure to raise an issue in appellate brief waives the issue.we thus proceed to qualified immunity issue.
review of rule b motion.
we next consider what impact the officers rule b motion has upon our standard of review.where,as here,defendants assert qualified immunity after undergoing trial on a claim,a grant of immunity would still confer a benefit by shielding them from any liability for the monetary damages awarded by the jury.monroig,cir emphasis added.we note that this order of procedure is designed to spare a defendant not only unwarranted liability,but unwarranted demands customarily imposed upon those defending a long drawn out lawsuit.wilson layne,d.
moreover,whether an asserted federal right was clearly established at a particular time such that a public official who allegedly violated the right has no qualified immunity from suit is a mixed question of law and fact we review de novo.see mitchell,at.cruz city of laramie,cir.because the defendants appeal from a denial of qualified immunity motion raised after the jury verdict,the evidence is construed in the light most hospitable to the party that prevailed at trial.iacobucci boulter,cir.that is,we consider whether the evidence is so that defendants were entitled to prevail as a matter of law on the constitutional claim.hill mckinley,cir.in this procedural posture,deference should be accorded the jury discernible resolution of disputed factual issues.id.
when evaluating a claim of qualified immunity,we must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of a constitutional right at all,and if so,proceed to determine whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.wilson,at.quoting conn gabbert,d.
for a constitutional right to be clearly established,its contours must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.that is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful,but it is to say that in light of law that unlawfulness must be apparent.
hope pelzer,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
in discussing the degree of factual similarity that is required to conclude that the law is clearly established,the supreme court has noted that all that is required is that prior case law provide fair warning that an officer conduct would violate constitutional rights.thus,officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.denver justice peace,city of golden,cir quoting hope,at.citations omitted.
deprivation of an actual constitutional right 
in evaluating a qualified immunity defense,the first inquiry must be whether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged.saucier katz,d.we need not linger on this threshold question because the defendants do not dispute that they violated marshall f ourth a mendment rights by forcing him against his will to produce a blood sample.aplts app.vol.i,at dist.order,filed may,reply br.at.
c.the constitutional right was clearly established 
since the jury found a violation of marshall fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches,we next consider whether the right was clearly established at the time of the incident.first,the officers take exception to the district court conclusion that it was clearly established that a nonconsensual warrantless blood test for a misdemeanor offense,conducted upon probable cause but in violation of state law,fell outside the exigent circumstances exception recognized in the supreme court decision in schmerber california,d.specifically,they contend that when this case arose,a the law was unsettled as to whether violation of a state law barring nonconsensual blood testing would also amount to a violation of the fourth amendment and b the law did not clearly indicate that classification of a driving under the influence dui offense as a misdemeanor would preclude a finding of exigent circumstances to sustain a warrantless blood test.
exigent circumstances under schmerber california 
indeed,as the supreme court has noted,it is clearly established that blood tests constitute searches under the fourth amendment.schmerber,d marshall i,at anthony city of,cir citing schmerber ellis city of san diego,cir citing schmerber.in schmerber,the court emphasized that the overriding function of the fourth amendment is to protect personal privacy and dignity against unwarranted intrusions by the state.at.similarly,warrantless compulsory blood tests are unreasonable unless supported by both probable cause and exigent circumstances.ellis,at requiring a search warrant absent an emergency citing schmerber,at.emphasis added marshall i,at.because probable cause is not in question,our focus is on the latter factor,the requirement of an emergency,or exigent circumstance.
in schmerber,the police arrested the defendant for driving under the influence of alcohol.at.although ultimately prosecuted for a misdemeanor,he was subject to prosecution for a felony because of the injury to the passenger.marshall i,at.there was no question the police had probable cause to arrest schmerber.schmerber,at.schmerber refused the police request to submit to a breathalyzer test.id.at.thus,the police had only one way to obtain the necessary evidence,a blood test.the police then compelled the defendant,over his objections and without a warrant,to provide blood samples to determine the percentage of alcohol in his blood.id.at.
the court noted that the percentage of alcohol in the blood begins to diminish shortly after drinking stops,as the body functions to eliminate it from the system.id.at.because the percentage of alcohol in a person blood is evanescent,the court noted that under the special facts of the case,there was no time to seek out a magistrate and secure a warrant before the blood alcohol level had diminished.schmerber,at.marshall i,at.because the delay necessary to obtain a warrant threatened the destruction of the evidence,the court upheld the warrantless seizure of blood.schmerber,at.
further,in delineating the special facts or exceptions to the warrant requirement,we have pointed out that the supreme court 
reach ed this judgment only on the facts of that specific record.the integrity of an individual person is a cherished value of our society.that we today h old that the constitution does not forbid the states minor intrusions into an individual body under stringently limited conditions in no way indicates that it permits intrusions under other conditions.
marshall i,at quoting schmerber,at.emphasis added see also skinner ry.labor executives ass n,d in light of our society concern for the security of one person,it is obvious that this physical intrusion,penetrating beneath the skin,infringes an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.the ensuing chemical analysis of the sample to obtain physiological data is a further invasion of privacy interests.citations omitted california acevedo,d stating that searches conducted outside the judicial process,without prior approval by judge or magistrate,are per se unreasonable under the fourth only to a few specifically established and exceptions quoting mincey arizona,d.
the officers argue that a reasonable officer in could have reasonably understood that a warrantless blood test performed under the exigent circumstances as described in schmerber would not violate the fourth amendment,even if the blood test was conducted in violation of state law.at the time of the officers conduct,however,it was that the scope of a warrantless search must be commensurate with the rationale that excepts the search from the warrant requirement.cupp murphy,d.thus,with respect to the exigency exception,the court had recognized the exigency exception permits warrantless searches only to the extent that exigency exists.skinner,at.citing chimel california,d.
the exigent circumstances that justified the state bodily intrusion in schmerber are not present in the instant case.unlike the defendant in schmerber who refused a breathalyzer test,marshall submitted to two breathalyzer tests.the results of each were negative.the results from the breathalyzer tests and a blood test are of similar evidentiary value,and the officers do not argue otherwise.nelson city of irvine,cir.when a suspect has taken an alternative test of equal evidentiary value,the risk that evidence will be lost disappears and the exigent circumstance that excused the police from obtaining a warrant likewise disappears,rendering a warrantless nonconsensual blood test in such circumstances unconstitutional.id.the fact that marshall had already passed two breathalyzer tests makes the officers decision to perform a warrantless nonconsensual blood test all the more unreasonable.
in sum,we agree with the district court that the officers had fair warning of exigent circumstances requirement under federal law.aplts app.vol.i,at dist.order,filed may,i t should have been clear to these officers that their conduct was unlawful in this case.
new mexico implied consent law 
as marshall i concluded,it is appropriate to look to state law to determine the reasonableness of a search for fourth amendment purposes.at characterizing marshall argument as contending that state law does not authorize new mexico police to compel a blood test in a misdemeanor case involving no physical injury see garner,d in evaluating the reasonableness of police procedures under the fourth amendment,we have also looked to prevailing rules in individual jurisdictions.united states richardson,cir stating that federal courts are to conduct an independent inquiry apply ing federal law into the reasonableness of a search,and noting that federal courts are not prohibited from considering state law citation omitted.in state richerson,the new mexico court of appeals,citing schmerber,held that exigent circumstances must be present for a warrantless blood test to fall within the fourth amendment parameters 
the warrantless search of the defendant was justified because,a it was made incident to a lawful arrest,b plaintiff smelled of liquor,and c the police officer was confronted with an emergency due to the progressive diminution of the blood alcohol level during the time interval incident necessary to obtain a search warrant.
id.emphasis added.assuming the presence of factors a and b,lawful arrest and that marshall had alcohol on his breath,we hold the officers are unable to establish the presence of an emergency.
the officers argue that new mexico law was far from clear as to whether or not a search or seizure conducted in violation of state law would also infringe the fourth amendment.new mexico statutes are uniquely clear about the right at issue.pursuant to stat.ann.et.michie new mexico implied consent act,
if a person under arrest for violation of an offense enumerated in the motor vehicle code refuses upon request of a law enforcement officer to submit to chemical tests designated by the law enforcement agency as provided in section nmsa,none shall be administered except when a municipal judge,magistrate or district judge issues a search warrant authorizing chemical tests as provided in section nmsa upon his finding in a law enforcement officer written affidavit that there is probable cause to believe that the person has driven a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance,thereby causing the death or great bodily injury of another person,or there is probable cause to believe that the person has committed a felony while under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance and that chemical tests as provided in section nmsa will produce material evidence in a felony prosecution 
id.a emphasis added.as we pointed out in marshall i 
the statute describes two scenarios under which a magistrate can issue a warrant for chemical tests,including a blood test i upon probable cause to believe that a person has driven while under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance and has thereby caused the death or great bodily injury of another person and ii upon probable cause to believe that the person has committed a felony while under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance and that chemical tests will produce material evidence in a felony prosecution.under new mexico law,the driver license of a person arrested for driving under the influence may be revoked if he refuses to submit to a chemical test but if the subject refuses to submit to the test,the statute expressly forbids the police from administering it without a warrant.
at emphasis added.
the officers contend that,despite the new mexico implied consent act admonitions,new mexico law was unclear as to whether the warrantless seizure of blood could violate a defendant constitutional rights.they cite state steele for the proposition that compulsory blood tests do not violate constitutional rights.aplts br.at quoting state steele,citing schmerber,d.steele involved an arrestee suspected of committing vehicular homicide,a felony.importantly,steele involved the admission of the results of a blood test into evidence,implicating fifth amendment concerns.schmerber held that the compulsory administration of a blood test and admission into evidence the test results does not implicate the fifth amendment,at,it plainly involves the broadly conceived reach of a search and seizure under the fourth amendment.id.at.thus the new mexico court of appeals,despite there being no fifth amendment prohibition against the use of the chemical analysis,was constrained by the new mexico implied consent act,noting that consent of the offending driver must be obtained before blood test results may be introduced in a trial charging a criminal act resulting from driving while intoxicated.at emphasis added.the sole exception to this consent requirement is a warrant supported by probable cause.id.
no such warrant was issued in the instant case.moreover,pursuant to the new mexico implied consent act,no search warrant could lawfully have been obtained to compel a test of marshall blood because marshall was not suspected of having committed a felony.marshall i,at see new mexico implied consent act a requiring probable cause to believe that the person has committed a felony before issuance of a warrant.
the officers also cite to state wyrostek.wyrostek stated that b ecause the officer had probable cause to believe wyrostek was under the influence of intoxicating liquor,and because of the evanescent nature of levels,the trial court found that exigent circumstances justified the warrantless seizure of blood.thus,no constitutional issues are raised by this case.id.at.
wyrostek involved a very different set of facts.the wyrostek inquiry considered whether the new mexico implied consent act required an officer to arrest an unconscious driver before administering a blood test.because the defendant freedom of action was already restricted as he was unconscious,the court determin
