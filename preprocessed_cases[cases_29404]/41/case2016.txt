a court equitable power lies only over the merits of the case or controversy before it.when a plaintiff seeks injunctive relief based on claims not pled in the complaint,the court does not have the authority to issue an injunction.during discovery of its unfair trade practices case,appellant pacific radiation oncology,llc pro sought injunctive relief against appellee the queen medical center qmc arguing that qmc review and use of patient records violated the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa,and the hawaii constitution.the district court denied the injunction because pro complaint did not contain a claim alleging improper review and use of confidential patient information in violation of hipaa and the hawaii constitution.we affirm.
to understand the motion that is the subject of this appeal,it is necessary to describe the deterioration of a nearly professional relationship between pro and qmc and the extended litigation that occurred as a result.
pro consists of a group of physicians specializing in radiation oncology.pro provided service to its patients at qmc,and at one of qmc competitors,the cancer center of hawaii tcch,in which some pro members held a financial interest.but qmc is the only facility on oahu with an operating room licensed by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc for specialized radiation services to treat cancer.during the course of their nearly relationship,pro physicians were allowed to meet with and treat their patients at qmc in order to accommodate patient preferences in choosing the location of treatment.however,this relationship ended in when qmc decided to transition to a model.as a result,pro physicians could not practice at qmc at all unless they accepted exclusive employment with qmc and divested any interest they held in tcch.pro physicians,therefore,would no longer retain hospital privileges that allowed access to the operating room which they used to treat certain patients.
in january of pro brought suit against qmc alleging that adopting the model was merely a pretext to prevent pro physicians from competing with qmc.the complaint filed against qmc alleged ten claims for relief denial of procedural and substantive due process violation of qmc bylaws and governing regulations intentional tortious interference with plaintiffs contractual obligations with competing facilities intentional and tortious interference with prospective business advantage intentional and tortious interference with the professional and contractual relationship with plaintiffs patients unfair,deceptive,and illegal trade practices in violation of hawaii revised statutes chapter arising out of qmc termination of privileges unfair,deceptive,and illegal trade practices in violation of chapter arising out of qmc violation of the statute unfair,deceptive,and illegal trade practices in violation of chapter arising out of qmc attempt at economic credentialing unfair,deceptive,anticompetitive,and illegal trade practices in violation of chapter arising out of qmc breach of its obligations under its corporate integrity agreement between the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services and breach of fiduciary duty and bad faith owed to a partner.pro initially requested injunctive relief and damages related only to the termination of hospital privileges.
in march the district court granted a preliminary injunction to allow pro physicians to continue treating patients who needed access to the operating room at qmc.pac.radiation oncology,llc queen med,d.in february we affirmed that preliminary injunction.pac.radiation oncology,llc queen med,app x cir.thereafter,qmc brought a counterclaim against pro alleging that pro physicians were unlawfully transferring patients from qmc to tcch by encouraging them to seek treatment there.additionally,qmc alleged that pro physicians failed to inform patients of their financial interests in tcch when making these referrals.thus,qmc argues that it had a legitimate business interest to move to a model.
prior to the commencement of litigation in,qmc administrators identified relevant patients from the hospital own electronic system who had an initial consultation with a pro physician at qmc but did not return to qmc for radiation therapy.after bringing its counterclaim,qmc served a subpoena on tcch seeking documents and information regarding those patients.included in this subpoena was a list of of the identified patients names,patient numbers,and treating physicians.however,when qmc filed the return of service with the district court clerk on thursday,july,it filed the subpoena on the public docket with the complete unredacted list of patient names,numbers,and treating physicians.upon realizing its error,qmc counsel immediately notified the magistrate judge overseeing discovery,the clerk restricted access to the document the next business day,monday,july,and the court granted qmc ex parte motion to seal the document.so far as can be determined,only qmc attorneys accessed the document through pacer while it was publicly available.
pro then filed a motion for a temporary restraining order,or alternatively a preliminary injunction.pro challenged not only the public filing of the patient list,but also qmc right to review its own medical records that were the basis of the list,and pro sought to preclude qmc review of the records sought from tcch in the subpoena.pro alleges that qmc conduct violates hipaa and the hawaii constitution.
the district court denied pro motion for injunctive relief.it concluded that pro complaint does not contain a claim alleging improper review and use of confidential patient information in violation of hipaa and the hawaii constitution.pac.radiation oncology,llc queen med,d.the court rejected pro arguments that the claims for violation of patient privacy are part of its hawaii revised statutes chapter claims because the allegations in those claims did not refer to improper review and use of patient information.id.acknowledging the seriousness of the public disclosure,the court nonetheless held that the motion simply does not fit within the tro temporary restraining order analysis.id.
the district court then construed the motion as ultimately presenting a discovery issue.id.specifically,the court found that qmc had violated the terms of a previously entered protective order when it publicly disclosed identifiable patient information.id.at.for that violation,the district court sanctioned qmc with pro reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred in responding to the public filing id.at.to the extent that qmc argued that its use of patient information was relevant to its defenses and counterclaims against pro,the district court instructed the parties to confer on how to access this information in compliance with the protective order,hipaa,and the hawaii constitution through the normal discovery process overseen by the magistrate judge.id.at 
pro appealed the district court denial of injunctive relief.we have jurisdiction under a to review pro appeal of that order.
we review a district court grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.pimentel dreyfus,cir.we employ a two part test first,determining whether the trial court identified the correct legal rule to apply to the requested relief and second,determining whether the court application of that rule was illogical,implausible,or without support from inferences that may be drawn from facts in the record.id.a decision based on an erroneous legal standard or a clearly erroneous finding of fact amounts to an abuse of discretion.id.
the district court denial of pro motion was not an abuse of discretion because the motion for relief was unrelated to the underlying complaint.a preliminary injunction is appropriate when it grants relief of the same nature as that to be finally granted.de beers consol.mines united states.we have yet to adopt a formal test for comparing the relief sought in a preliminary injunction with the final relief sought in the original complaint.other circuits,however,have enunciated a rule requiring a plaintiff to establish a relationship be
