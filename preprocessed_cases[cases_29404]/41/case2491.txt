the principal of red mesa pharmacy pled guilty to conspiracy to dispense drugs in violation of the controlled substances act.meanwhile,two of his employees went to trial on similar charges and now appeal their resulting convictions.the trial record tells very different stories about the two men and their roles in the pharmacy operations.the first,jerry lovern,is a pharmacist with almost years experience.the record strongly suggests that he well knew details of the pharmacy illicit operation,and we affirm his convictions.by contrast,robert barron,a high school with no experience in the medical or pharmaceutical fields,served as the pharmacy computer technician.there is no evidence that he knew red mesa managers and pharmacists filled prescriptions issued without a legitimate medical purpose or in defiance of professional standards.accordingly,we are obliged to reverse his convictions.
nothing about wilbur and margaret hilst foray into the pharmacy business was conventional.they opened their pharmacy,red mesa,in wichita,kansas,in the fall of by submitting false information in their license applications to the kansas board of pharmacy and the federal drug enforcement administration dea.they then pursued a business plan that involved securing customers exclusively through websites run by two companies,safetrust processing and integrarx,based respectively in costa rica and seattle,washington.
through these businesses,customers across the nation received prescription drugs simply by filling out an online questionnaire.physicians in the united states and puerto rico contracted with safetrust and integrarx to log into their websites,review customer questionnaires,and either approve or disapprove the customers requested prescriptions.physicians did not examine their putative patients they did not verify any of the personal information provided in the questionnaires in fact,they did not have any dealings at all with the subjects of their prescriptions.yet,the doctors approved the vast majority of the requested prescriptions.safetrust and integrarx took these approved prescriptions and placed them online for access by participating pharmacies,including red mesa,to fill and ship.customers paid for all this by credit card through the two websites in turn,safetrust and integrarx shared with red mesa for each order filled,in addition to paying for the wholesale cost of the drugs.in all,red mesa received during its eight months of operation.
for a few months,red mesa carried a certificate from the dea permitting it to distribute substances subject to the controlled substances act csa.see et.during this period,red mesa filled more prescriptions for controlled substance a total of than noncontrolled in contrast to standard pharmacies,where the breakdown favors noncontrolled substances by a factor of nine to one.the controlled substances red mesa distributed consisted largely of diet and sleep aid pills,while the noncontrolled drugs it specialized in included lifestyle drugs viagra and the like,as well as some pain medications.
hilst ran red mesa operations.he opened the pharmacy in november and was responsible for managing the inventory and choosing which prescriptions the pharmacy filled.his wife served as the pharmacy operations manager while barron worked as a computer technician,printing out labels for prescriptions that lovern,the principal pharmacist,then filled.
red mesa was not open for long before authorities grew curious.their first clue came from maxine ihrig,red mesa original pharmacist,who became apprehensive when she saw that the pharmacy filled prescriptions issued by doctors who did reside in the same states as their patients.she expressed her discomfort to latonyua rice,a pharmacist and inspector with the state board of pharmacy,in november.in turn,rice reported all this to the board and to patricia,a dea investigator.the state did not immediately revoke red mesa license,but in february rice visited the pharmacy and issued a number of citations.among these,she cited the pharmacy for violating a kansas law limiting customers to a supply of diet pills at any one time.the dea conducted its own investigation and executed a search warrant in march.after the search,hilst surrendered the pharmacy dea federal controlled substance registration.while that left red mesa no longer able lawfully to fill prescriptions for controlled it did the pharmacy did continue to distribute noncontrolled prescription substances until june,when its state license was also revoked,forcing the pharmacy to shutter.
eventually,the federal government brought charges against the hilsts,as well as lovern and barron,alleging violations of the csa.enacted in with the main objectives of combating drug abuse and controlling the legitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled substances,the csa creates a comprehensive,closed regulatory regime criminalizing the unauthorized manufacture,distribution,dispensing,and possession of substances classified in any of the act five schedules.gonzales oregon,d.section a makes it unlawful,except under circumstances authorized by the statute,for any person knowingly or intentionally to manufacture,distribute,or dispense,or possess with intent to manufacture,distribute,or dispense,a controlled substance.
in one prominent and,for our purposes,pertinent exception,the csa allows registered practitioners to issue prescriptions for controlled substances classified in four of the five schedules.see.at the same time,however,implementing regulations require that these prescriptions must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice.a.while the responsibility for meeting this test rests in the first instance with the prescribing doctor,a corresponding responsibility rests with the pharmacist who fills the prescription.id.accordingly,a n order purporting to be a prescription issued not in the usual course of professional treatment is not a prescription within the meaning and intent of section of the act and the person knowingly filling such a purported prescription,as well as the person issuing it,shall be subject to the penalties provided for violations of the provisions of law relating to controlled substances.id.
hilst pled guilty to conspiracy under the csa,and the charges against hilst were dismissed.this appeal,meanwhile,arises from the joint trial of lovern and barron,each of whom was charged with and convicted of one count of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances in contravention of a,and three substantive counts of distribution of controlled substances in violation of a and aiding and abetting.we begin with lovern appeal before addressing barron.
lovern seeks reversal of his convictions for five primary reasons.he argues that they run afoul of the csa terms and supreme court teachings in gonzales oregon that insufficient evidence exists,as a matter of law,to support the jury verdict that the district court erred in refusing to accept his expert witness that a is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him and that the court erred by declining to give an instruction to the jury on an entrapment by estoppel defense.none of these arguments,however,warrants reversal.
lovern begins by asserting that t here was no evidence at trial and there is no law that a prescription received via the i nternet is illegal.aplt.br.at.but this is a red herring the government has disclaimed any interest in trying to prove that using the internet to transmit a lawful prescription is unlawful under the csa.rather,to show that lovern violated the csa,the government has argued before us that the issuance of a prescription based solely on an online questionnaire,without anything any existing relationship,without a physical exam,without any confirmation of the questionnaire contents,without any further contact of any outside the usual course of contemporary medical practice.and,the government contends,lovern knew this is exactly how integrarx and safetrust physicians operated,yet he still filled their prescriptions for controlled substances.it is this theory of csa liability that the government has pursued against lovern,and that lovern must address to avoid his conviction.
seeking to do so,lovern replies that,under gonzales oregon,the federal government has no business trying to define what practices are and are not within the usual course of professional medical practice.in gonzales,the attorney general issued an interpretive rule prohibiting the dispensation of controlled substances for use in suicide after adjudging assisting a suicide not to be a legitimate medical purpose.the attorney general judgment on this score,of course,conflicted with the view of at least one state oregon that permitted the practice at the time.the supreme court struck down the interpretive rule on the basis that it exceeded the attorney general delegated authority under the csa.at.
gonzales does not apply to our case.unlike gonzales,we have before us no interpretive rule seeking to define a practice as lacking any legitimate medical purpose,let alone a rule that conflicts with a state assessment of the legitimacy of that practice.instead,in this case the government sought to establish that the conduct of the safetrust and integrarx physicians was inconsistent with the usual course of professional practice the way through witnesses and documentary proof at trial focused on the contemporary norms of the medical profession.unlike gonzales as well,lovern was foreclosed by rule from disagreeing instead,he was free at all times to present contrary proof that his behavior and those of the safetrust and integrarx prescribing physicians were consistent with the usual course of professional practice.and,again unlike gonzales,the jury here remained free to sort out all the competing proof the question what constitutes usual medical practice remained,at all times,within its province,not the attorney general.see jury ins,instructing on elements of conspiracy and distribution,one being that controlled substance was distributed outside the usual course of professional medical practice or without a legitimate medical purpose.in this case,then,t he government made no attempt,as in gonzales,to unilaterally define which practices fall outside th e scope of professional practice rather,it intend ed to leave that question where it has been for over the jury.united states quinones,d.
even if the government case did not run afoul of gonzales,lovern maintains the government presented insufficient evidence at trial to support its claim that prescriptions based solely on a completed online questionnaire,without more,are inconsistent with the usual course of contemporary medical practice.we can not agree.whatever may be the case in five or ten or twenty years,the government adduced sufficient proof at trial that the practices of safetrust and integrarx physicians were not within the usual course of professional practice as of and.
the proof came in part from lovern himself.a pharmacist with almost years of experience,lovern took the stand and admitted that a prescription issued by a prescriber acting within the course of legitimate professional practice will be one for which the prescriber was prescribing for a patient which he might normally have seen in his office,whether he saw him in the office or not,or elsewhere.at.adding to lovern testimony were several other witnesses who testified about contemporary medical practices.they included deborah billingsley,the executive secretary of the kansas board of pharmacy rice,a pharmacist and inspector with the board ihrig,one of red mesa first pharmacists and,an investigator with the dea.these witnesses also pointed to directives from groups like the american medical association and the federation of medical boards,each of which expressed the view that a physician issuing a prescription based solely on an online questionnaire does not meet appropriate medical standards of care,as well as to a dea diversion control notice from summarizing the views of various state and professional societies and reaching the same conclusion 
from such varied well as from their common reasonable jury could determine that issuing prescriptions for controlled substances based solely on online questionnaires fell outside the usual course of medical conduct,at least at the time of trial.neither is the jury conclusion a novel one.see,united states nelson,cir upholding conviction of physician under csa where he approved of requests for prescriptions submitted over internet website,without conducting physical examination united states mciver,cir physician exceeded the legitimate practice of medicine when he prescribed controlled substances despite conducting little or no diagnostic tests on his patients united states fuchs,cir finding sufficient evidence showed prescriptions were outside usual course of medical practice where prescriptions were initiated by orders sent to pharmacy through its website customers were located throughout united states pharmacy forwarded prescription forms to physicians for approval physicians were paid per prescription pharmacy prices were higher than average and pharmacy did not accept insurance.
lovern complains that neither of the two pharmacists who testified,rice and ihrig,nor the dea investigator,is a physician.from this,we gather that lovern believes only doctors can testify about usual practices in the profession.but he provides no legal support for this notion,and in the case of pharmacists,the regulations implementing the csa tend to refute his hypothesis.those regulations expressly place a duty on pharmacists not to knowingly fill prescriptions issued outside the usual course of medical practice.see a.given this legal duty,it does not strain the imagination to think that some pharmacists might know and be qualified to speak about what it means for a prescription to be consistent or inconsistent with the usual course of medical practice.indeed,even lovern himself offered testimony on exactly these lines,and he certainly does suggest his own testimony was inadmissible.this is not to say that all pharmacists are necessarily qualified to testify about the usual course of medical practice.but it is to say,contrary to lovern view,that pharmacists are not categorically incapable of offering such testimony.see also united states perry,wl,at cir per curiam unpublished holding that pharmacist testimony as to unusual activities at pharmacy in csa prosecution are precisely within the realm of permissible expert testimony allowable under.
neither was it an abuse of discretion for the district court to admit the testimony of,a dea diversion investigator with over fifteen years of experience.in cases prosecuting the trafficking of common street drugs under the csa,courts have routinely upheld the admission of expert testimony from law enforcement officers seeking to identify for the jury typical indicia of drug trafficking activity.see,united states becker,cir united states sturmoski,cir.testimony sought to do much the same in this case to identify for the jury common red flags suggestive of an illicit pharmaceutical operation.we are given no reason to think such testimony is unhelpful or irrelevant or otherwise improper simply because this case arose in the context of pharmaceutical rather than street drugs,and we note that other circuits have permitted testimony like.see,united states seelig,cir,cert.denied,d perry,wl at.
lovern next objects to the district court exclusion of his expert witness,john mudri.according to lovern,mudri was prepared to testify on what factors a pharmacist acting under the standards of his profession could reasonably rely upon in determining the legitimacy of prescriptions.at.the district court granted the government motion to exclude mudri,holding that he was unqualified to offer expert testimony on this subject.before us,lovern seeks to contest the exclusion of mudri,but the government rightly notes that lovern waived any right to object to do so when he expressly took the position before the district court that,as an expert,mudri is not qualified but is able to testify as a fact witness as to certain points which may come up during testimony by another witness.id.at emphasis added.see united states olano,d w aiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.internal quotation marks omitted united states teague,cir,cert.denied,d a party that has waived a right is not entitled to appellate relief.even if we could overlook this problem,we would still face another the district court exclusion rested on mudri lack of sufficient qualifications,yet,in his opening brief on appeal,lovern argues merely that mudri testimony would have been relevant to the case.lovern does not address the basis of the district court exclusion order,let alone establish that its assessment of mudri qualifications represents an abuse of discretion 
next,lovern takes aim at the csa itself,arguing that a is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.elemental to our concept of due process is the assurance that criminal laws must give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute,and those that fail this test are treated as no laws at all they are void for vagueness.colautti franklin,d internal quotation marks omitted.ours is not a legal system like caligula,who reportedly wrote his laws in a very small character,and hung them up upon high pillars,the more effectually to ensnare the people.united states,d scalia,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment quoting blackstone,commentaries on the laws of england.
as applied to lovern,the csa can not be said to fall prey to such due process concerns.see vill.of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d v agueness challenges to statutes which do not involve first amendment freedoms must be examined in light of the facts of the case at hand.alternation in original.the evidence produced at trial demonstrate d that lovern had knowledge of the illegality of his activities,and thus this is not a situation where he could not reasonably understand that his contemplated conduct is proscribed.united states day,cir quoting parker levy,d see also united states,cir.lovern was a pharmacist with decades of experience.according to his own testimony,lovern understood that he had a legal duty to ensure he filled only those prescriptions issued in the usual course of medical practice.he understood as well that a relationship,including a physical examination,usually precedes a prescription in contemporary medical practice.and he knew that the prescriptions he filled at red mesa were issued after a customer filled in an online questionnaire with no physical examination or consultation with a physician.a reasonable jury could find that lovern knowingly filled prescriptions issued outside the usual course of medical practice,something lovern admitted he could not do lawfully.on this record,we can not say that lovern was the unwitting victim of a law he did understand 
finally,lovern contends that he was entrapped.among other things,lovern points to the pharmacy dea license and suggests this meant the government approved its conduct.lovern also points out that government agents visiting the pharmacy as part of their investigations never warned him that the pharmacy was running afoul of the law.given all this,lovern submits,the government should have been estopped from pursuing him for violating the csa,and the district court erred when it declined to provide him an entrapment by estoppel jury instruction.
no such error took place here.entrapment by estoppel claims against the government work only when the government affirmatively misleads a party as to the state of the law and that party proceeds to act on the misrepresentation so that criminal prosecution of the actor implicates due process concerns.united states apperson,cir see also wade pediatrics dep t of health human,cir.a government license does nothing of this sort.it may allow a pharmacy to conduct business,but it does not absolve a pharmacist from his responsibility to avoid knowingly filling unlawful prescriptions.likewise,government agents are allowed to investigate potential crimes without bearing an affirmative obligation to sit down and advise their targets about the lawfulness or unlawfulness of their activities.see wade pediatrics,at silence,of course,does not rise to the level of affirmative misconduct required to warrant estoppel against the government.
barron conviction tells a different story.the theories of liability under the csa the government pursued in its indictment and at trial required it to show that lovern and barron knew the prescriptions they helped fill at red mesa were issued by integrarx or safetrust physicians acting outside the usual course of professional medical practice or with a legitimate medical purpose.see jury ins.but the government proof,while it showed many things,failed to include direct or circumstantial evidence that barron possessed this particular mens rea.
to be sure,barron faces a high hurdle when seeking relief for lack of sufficient evidence to sustain his convictions we review the evidence,as well as all reasonable inferences that they sustain,in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,and we will only find the evidence insufficient if no reasonable jury could have found barron guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.united states rakes,cir.even mindful of this demanding standard,however,we can not help but reverse.
there is no direct evidence that barron knew that the prescriptions he helped distribute were issued outside the usual course of professional practice or without a legitimate medical purpose.in fact,there is no direct evidence that barron even knew the prescriptions at issue were based solely on online questionnaires,with a patient requesting and usually receiving a drug without any interaction with a doctor,let alone that doing so would be inconsistent with usual medical practices or purposes.
instead,trial evidence suggested that rogue pharmacies like red mesa often use persons with limited or no knowledge of medications and standard pharmacy practices and discretion to facilitate their work.at,and that barron met this description.unlike lovern,barron was no pharmacist,and there was no evidence he had any prior experience in pharmacies,or that he had any sort of a medical education.to the contrary,the evidence at trial showed that the only training barron received for his job was a phone call with safetrust and integrarx representatives about how to access and set up accounts for the websites.a government agent who interviewed barron in march testified that barron appeared to have little knowledge of pharmaceuticals.a probation report prepared for sentencing revealed that barron had completed only the grade,due in part to a learning disability,and had a grade point average of between d and f.
trial evidence also showed that barron performed only menial computer tasks at red mesa.barron job was merely to log into the safetrust and integrarx websites,access a page that listed what prescriptions were available,check a box next to those prescriptions the pharmacy would fill,and print labels for the chosen prescriptions he did not interact with customers he did not see patient profiles he did not communicate with safetrust or integrarx doctors he did not even pick which particular prescriptions the pharmacy.hilst sat by him and directed him on which boxes to check.neither did barron go about the business of filling the was left to lovern and other pharmacists.
without direct evidence that barron possessed the mens rea necessary to sustain a conviction under the csa,the government seeks to rely on inferential proof.this,of course,is entirely appropriate proof of mens rea,of what lies inside the recesses of the defendant mind,very often must depend on circumstantial,rather than direct,evidence.the problem is that the proof on which the government depends in this particular case fails to yield the mens rea inference required to convict barron under the csa theory the government pursued,even if it might suffice to yield a conviction under some other state or federal law.
the government first directs us to evidence that barron knew that the pharmacy prescriptions came exclusively from the internet that he told a government agent who interviewed him in march that the state board of pharmacy did like internet pharmacies that his wife,who had worked in a hospital as a surgery technician,told barron that she did think red mesa could fill internet orders and that hilst filled almost all prescriptions appearing on the websites.
such facts could well support the inference that barron thought red mesa was acting unlawfully in accepting prescriptions over the internet.but again the government has disclaimed any interest in pursuing such a theory u sing the internet to transmit a lawful prescription is not the issue it tells us.see appellee br.lovern at see also.at dea investigator testifying that crux of investigation was unlawful distribution of prescriptions,and that w hether that ended up being by internet,or some other form,was not the crux.missing is any apparent link between the facts the government relies upon and the theory it pursued at trial that barron knew the prescriptions red mesa filled were issued by integrarx and safetrust doctors,acting outside the usual course of professional medical practice or without a legitimate medical purpose.the government facts,for example,do even support the inference that barron knew that physicians at safetrust and integrarx relied exclusively on online questionnaires to issue they certainly do support the inference that barron knew that doing so exceeds the boundaries of legitimate practices and purposes in the medical profession.
the government falls into much the same trap when it points to the fact that barron never registered as a pharmacy technician with the state,despite being told by a receptionist at the state board that he needed to do so,as well as when it notes that one of red mesa early pharmacists told barron that there was a problem between the kansas state board of pharmacy and red mesa the record does show barron is told what that problem might be.such evidence may well suggest that barron knew something was amiss at red mesa,and perhaps more specifically that he was violating a state pharmacy technician registration law.but this evidence fails to suggest that barron knew that safetrust and integrarx physicians issued prescriptions outside the usual course of professional practice or without a legitimate medical purpose.without some evidence supporting that inference,barron conviction under the csa can not stand,even if a conviction for violating some other law might.
the government next points to a variety of instant message conversations between barron and heredia,who ran the safetrust website from costa rica.in one conversation,barron referred to a prescription for diet pills phentermine in excess of a supply as very illegal.at.but the trial evidence revealed that,by this time,barron had been told that prescriptions exceeding days violated state law,and that the pharmacy had been cited for filling overlong prescriptions and so had ceased issuing them.at most,then,this conversation shows that barron knew the length of a lawful diet pill prescription under state law,and complied with the law when he became aware of it.it does not suggest that barron knew anything about the medical practices or purposes of physicians who issued the prescriptions red mesa filled.
in another instant message the strongest piece of evidence supporting the government theory of the.barron told heredia that he did want the expiration to run on several drugs that had been sitting at red mesa for some time,and so solicited heredia for more business with this line hook a brother up on scripts.i need some fake customers please.mahahahaha.at.from this message,one could surely infer that barron knew that something was fishy at red mesa.
but,again,the difficulty is that this type of generalized knowledge is enough to sustain barron convictions under the csa.see,jury ins.at a general suspicion that an unlawful act may occur or that something criminal is happening is not enough to show aiding and abetting.at best,the instant message leaves a reasonable with a number of equally reasonable inferences about what barron might have thought was illicit at red mesa.the record,for example,supports the inference that barron thought the pharmacy customers were fake and the operation illicit because pharmacy customers never appeared at the pharmacy in person,but received their prescriptions by mail.the record also supports the inference that barron thought the pharmacy acted unlawfully by relying on the internet to receive and process orders.the trouble is that,to sustain his conviction,a must be able to infer not only that barron knew something was fishy at the pharmacy.a must also be able to infer,more specifically,that barron knew physicians working for safetrust and integrarx wrote prescriptions without first meeting with their patients,and that this failure to do so was inconsistent with legitimate medical practices or purposes.the instant message does not clearly suggest that barron knew anything of the suit.indeed,if anything,the word fake seems to suggest a belief that there were any customers on the other end of the prescriptions,not that there are real customers whose prescriptions were invalid for some other reason.even viewing the message in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,it gives us no way to distinguish among several plausible and competing inferences about its meaning.and where,as here,the evidence gives equal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of guilt and a theory of innocence,we must reverse the conviction,as under these circumstances a reasonably jury must necessarily entertain a reasonable doubt.united states caseer,cir emphasis in original see also ingram united states,d united states dunmire,cir while the jury may draw reasonable inferences from direct or circumstantial evidence,an inference must be more than speculation and conjecture to be reasonable.put differently,the jury simply had no reason to favor any one of these explanations over the others.
much the same can be said of the remaining instant messages to which the government points.by way of example,in one conversation heredia asked if red mesa could fill today,to which barron replied,apparently after checking with his boss,jerry lovern,nope,jerry said.and i need a centive to do that.i am getting paid any way and unless he send me orders.and jerry wants nothing over aver.gene is about a day.aplt.app at.gene likely refers to eugene patterson,a pharmacist at red mesa.this exchange may well suggest that red mesa pharmacists sought to avoid the authorities attention by keeping down the daily number of prescriptions they filled.though seemingly just passing a message from lovern,one might also infer from it that barron was aware that not all was right at red mesa.but a lot was right about red mesa,and this message,like its predecessors,does nothing to suggest that barron knew more specifically that what was right was that the prescriptions red mesa filled were issued without a legitimate purpose or in defiance of contemporary medical standards.
other evidence the government relies on is markedly less helpful to its case.the government points to the fact that a dea registration certificate hung on a wall in the pharmacy near barron desk and that he earned over for a few months work.appellee br.the certificate,however,speaks not at all to the question whether barron knew the prescriptions were issued outside the bounds of legitimate medical purposes or practices.neither does the government explain how his salary earned over eight months,not a few as the government suggests indicates such knowledge.while lovern asked for a pay raise after expressing concerns about the legality of the red mesa operations,there is nothing in the record suggesting barron did the same.neither is there any evidence in the record,such as barron prior earning history,to suggest his income at red mesa was in comparison.but even assuming that is a lot of money for a person with barron experience and background,that fact would only again raise the inference that he suspected something was amiss at red mesa.he could have believed internet pharmacies were categorically unlawful,
