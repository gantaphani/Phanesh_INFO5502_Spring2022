in this appeal,we are asked to decide when a position is vacant for the purposes of the americans with disabilities act ada,such that a disabled employee may request reassignment to that position as a reasonable accommodation.travis duvall,who suffers from cystic fybrosis,worked in the shipping department of a paper mill owned by georgia pacific gp.when gp decided to begin outsourcing the running of its shipping department,duvall transferred to another department but found that the paper dust in the air made it impossible for him to work there.as a reasonable accommodation,duvall requested that he be put back in his old shipping position,which was then occupied by a temporary contract worker pending the permanent outsourcing of the department,or in a position in the mill storeroom,which was also in flux at the time with a number of temporary employees filling some of the storeroom positions.gp refused these requests,and duvall sued under the ada.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of gp,holding that the shipping department and storeroom positions filled by temporary workers were not vacant within the meaning of the statute.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm that judgment.
background 
when travis duvall began working at gp muskogee paper mill,he informed the mill management that he suffered from cystic fibrosis.for the years before the events giving rise to this litigation,duvall worked in the shipping department of the mill,which received finished and packaged paper products from other departments and prepared them for shipping.by,duvall was earning around per hour in the shipping department.in december of,gp determined that it would outsource all shipping operations to a company called network logistics solutions nls,which would then operate shipping as a separate company within the mill.the changeover from gp to nls staffing of the shipping department was originally scheduled to be complete by the end of june.once the transition was complete,the only gp jobs remaining in the shipping department would be palletizer that required the use of gp equipment.
as part of the transition,gp employees in the shipping department were given the opportunity to bid for jobs in other parts of the plant,particularly in the converting department,which was a growth area in need of extra staff.as gp employees transferred out of shipping or left the company,they would be replaced by temporary workers provided by a temporary staffing company called encadria.the encadria employees would remain in the positions until the nls staff were ready to take over the department.gp elected to conduct the transition in this manner in order to minimize the impact on its employees and avoid having to reassign or lay off all the shipping personnel at once.
there is little information in the record characterizing the relationship between gp and encadria.there is an email from the senior client service supervisor at encadria to gp human resources department listing the positions at the mill for which encadria provided staff both the storeroom and the shipping department were included in that list of positions.see apl t app.at.in his deposition,gp mill manager,karl meyers,indicated that sometimes encadria temporary employees were hired by gp permanently to fill the positions they occupied,but that they would have to apply as any other person would have applied for the job,and would be hired only if they met the prerequisites of the position.id.at.finally,meyers characterized gp stance toward encadria temporary workers by observing,somewhat vaguely,encadria filled positions that were open that we had.id.at.unfortunately,meyers deposition is presented in the record in isolated snippets,and his testimony is difficult to place in any broader context.
as the outsourcing of the shipping department progressed,the palletizer positions that would remain open to gp employees in shipping became very popular duvall did not possess the seniority required to successfully bid into one of these positions.by february,the only positions open to duvall based on his seniority were in the converting department.in converting,raw rolls of paper were machined into finished product,such as napkins.as a result,the air in the converting department bore a significant amount of paper dust.duvall bid for and secured a position as a operator in this position he removed napkins from a machine by hand.after being certified on the machine,duvall rate of pay was increased to per hour,which was commensurate with the pay rates in converting.according to standard mill policy,an employee transferring between departments was paid at the rate of their new department,without regard to their prior wage.
but the dusty environment in converting took a toll on duvall health.by april,he was experiencing severe breathing difficulty.he could not wear the dust mask provided him by gp while it filtered out much of the dust,it also restricted the air he could inhale.on april,at the beginning of his shift,he went to the mill nurse to complain about his problems she sent him to muskogee immediate care,where he was advised to see his pulmonologist,and to avoid exposure to paper dust.the mill nurse then convened a company response team crt consisting of herself,the plant safety manager,and other mill personnel,with the goal of remedying duvall situation.the crt gave duvall an essential functions form for his operator position for his pulmonologist to fill out,and allowed him to work the remaining two days in his shift week back in shipping,since he had not been symptomatic there.during these two days,duvall observed that the shipping department was staffed with around encadria employees and gp employees.
in early may of,duvall returned to the crt with the essential functions form filled out by his pulmonologist.while the form itself is not in the record,a member of gp human resources staff made contemporaneous notes indicating that the form contained a permanent restriction can not work with paper dust in air.apl t app.at.the crt told duvall that,due to the nature of the work performed at the mill,no area would meet that restriction.duvall rejoined that he had worked for years in shipping without difficulty,but the crt responded that there were no open gp jobs in shipping,other than the palletizer positions that duvall did not have the seniority to obtain.duvall was given the paperwork for filing a disability claim this insurance eventually paid a portion of his salary while he was out of work.
but there was one area of the mill other than shipping where duvall could safely work the storeroom.air quality tests there eventually revealed dust levels far below those in converting,and on par with the levels in the shipping department.duvall was not offered a position in the storeroom in may of,however,because at that time gp plans for staffing the storeroom were in a state of flux.apl t app.at.during the spring and summer of,gp was considering plans to outsource the storeroom as well as the shipping department,but by july of,it had decided that the storeroom would be staffed entirely by gp employees the gp employees who were already working in the storeroom would maintain their current rate of pay,but new hires and transfers into the department would be paid between and per hour.
on july,the crt offered duvall two positions.first was a palletizer temporary position,in which he would fill in for the palletizers in shipping when they went on vacation or the department was otherwise.this position would not offer regular shifts or predictable hours.the second position was a storeroom clerk,at a pay rate of per top end of the new storeroom pay scale,but less than the duvall had been making in converting.notwithstanding the reduction in pay,duvall accepted the storeroom position and returned to work the first week of august.
on december,duvall filed suit against gp in the eastern district of oklahoma,alleging that gp violated the ada by failing to reasonably accommodate his disability.gp moved for summary judgment on august,and the district court granted that motion on september.duvall timely appealed to this court.

ii.the ada reassignment duty and the meaning of vacant 
the americans with disabilities act commands that no employer discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.a.a qualified individual is an individual who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.within its definition of discriminate,the ada includes not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability.b a.finally,the act states that such a reasonable accommodation may include reassignment to a vacant position.b.
the parties do not dispute that duvall cystic fibrosis renders him disabled within the meaning of the statute.see apl t app.at.therefore,resolution of this case turns on whether the ada required gp to reassign duvall either to his old position in the shipping department until it was ready to be permanently outsourced to nls,or to a position in the storeroom during the three months of the summer of in which he was unable to work in the converting department and was not offered a position in the storeroom.to answer that question,we first consider the scope of the duty of reassignment imposed by the ada in this circuit,then define the term vacant in the statute,and finally apply that definition to duvall circumstances.
ada reassignment in the tenth circuit 
this court most thorough exploration of the ada reassignment duty was in smith midland brake,cir en banc.in that case,we determined that the statutory duty upon employers to reassign disabled employees to vacant positions is mandatory.if a disabled employee can be accommodated by reassignment to a vacant position,the employer must do more than consider the disabled employee alongside other applicants the employer must offer the employee the vacant position.id.at.
midland brake sets out the elements of a claimed ada violation based on a failure to reassign a disabled employee 
the employee is a disabled person within the meaning of the ada and has made any resulting limitations from his or her disability known to the employer 
the preferred option of accommodation within the employee existing job can not reasonably be accomplishe d 
the employee requested the employer reasonably to accommodate his or her disability by reassignment to a vacant position,which the employee may identify at the outset or which the employee may request the employer identify through an interactive process,in which the employee in good faith was willing to,or did,cooperate 
the employee was qualified,with or without reasonable accommodation,to perform one or more appropriate vacant jobs within the company that the employee must,at the time of the summary judgment proceeding,specifically identify and show were available within the company at or about the time the request for reassignment was made and 
the employee suffered injury because the employer did not offer to reassign the employee to any appropriate vacant position.
the employer obligation to reassign a disabled employee is not,however,without limit.in midland brake,we recognized the overarching principle that all accommodations under the ada must be governed by the statutory modifier of reasonableness.id.at.in addition to that blanket principle,we noted a number of specific situations in which reassignment would be unreasonable.four of these situations are potentially relevant to this case.first,i t is not reasonable to require an employer to create a new job for the purpose of reassigning an employee to that job.id.at.next,the ada does not require the employer to reassign a disabled employee to a position that would constitute a promotion.id.at the ada is not a statute giving rise to a right to advancement.third,the ada does not require an employer to reassign a disabled employee in a manner that would contravene that employer important fundamental policies underlying legitimate business interests.id.at.finally,and most importantly for the purposes of this appeal,the job to which a disabled employee seeks reassignment must,as the statute text dictates,be vacant.id.i f a position is not vacant it is not reasonable to require an employer to bump another employee in order to reassign a disabled employee to that position.id.citing.ii,at,reprinted in,r eassignment need only be to a vacant position bumping another employee out of a position to create a vacancy is not required.
b.the meaning of vacant 
the operative question in this case,therefore,is did gp have any vacant positions to which duvall could have been reassigned during the relevant period between may and august of it is uncontested that some jobs in both the shipping department and the storeroom during that period were being filled by temporary workers provided by encadria.in the case of shipping,those temporary workers were filling in until nls employees could permanently take over the department in the storeroom,the encadria temps were working pending gp storeroom restructuring plans,which were completed in late july.according to gp,positions filled by encadria temporary workers were not vacant within the meaning of the statute duvall maintains,to the contrary,that if a gp position was filled by an encadria temp,then that position far as gp was.to decide which of these interpretations is correct,we must engage in statutory interpretation to determine the meaning of the term vacant.
we have not previously defined the term vacant for the purposes of the ada,and we have not found any cases from our sister circuits doing so nor has the supreme court defined the term,but in us airways,barnett,the court observed that n othing in the ada suggests that congress intended the word vacant to have a specialized meaning.we therefore begin our analysis by considering the ordinary meaning of vacant.see conrad phone directories,cir noting that we begin statutory analysis by considering the ordinary meaning of statutory terms,and we may consult dictionaries to determine that meaning.
webster dictionary offers two relevant definitions of vacant not filled or occupied by an incumbent or possessor and being without occupant.webster third new international dictionary ed.accord barnett,at,concurring quoting webster definition.these definitions,however,fail to provide for all the nuances of the employment relationship.to arrive at a proper meaning for the term vacant,we must consider it in the context of the statute as a this case,as a regulation of the employment relationship.see conrad,at we take into account the broader context of the statute as a whole when ascertaining the meaning of a particular provision.quotation omitted.in the employment context,we hold that a position is vacant with respect to a disabled employee for the purposes of the ada if it would be available for a employee to apply for and obtain 
this definition best serves the aims of the ada.congress purpose in passing the statute was to place disabled employees on an equal footing with their coworkers.see kornblau dade county,cir the purpose of the ada is to place those with disabilities on an equal footing,not to give them an unfair advantage.this is reflected at the very core of the statute,in the definition of a qualified individual.that category is limited to those disabled employees who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.emphasis added.to be covered under the statute,the disabled employee must be capable of performing the essential core of the job at issue.jarvis potter,cir o ne wh
