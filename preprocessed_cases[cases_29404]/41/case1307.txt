the appellee is now a student in the marshall joint school district.in kindergarten he was diagnosed with a rare genetic disease,and since then the school district has provided him with additional resources in his academic classes and special education in gym.when he was in second grade the school district reevaluated his eligibility for special education,and a team of educational professionals determined that he no longer met the criteria.his parents disagreed and sought administrative review the administrative law judge alj conducted a lengthy hearing,concluded that the school district had erred,and found that was still eligible for special education.the school district appealed to the district court,which affirmed,and now it appeals to this court.because the alj applied the wrong legal standard in the eligibility analysis and there is not substantial evidence to support her findings,we reverse.
in,was diagnosed with syndrome eds,hypermobile type,which is a genetic disease that causes joint hypermobility,commonly called.in case the symptoms are serious he has poor upper body strength and poor postural and trunk stability,and he suffers from chronic and intermittent pain in,he was also diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,inattentive type.
after the eds diagnosis,was evaluated and deemed eligible for special education services under the individuals with disability education act,et idea or act.as part of the process,the school district assembled a team of educational professionals to develop an individualized education program iep for him.under the iep,he received adaptive physical education six times a month,physical therapy,occupational therapy,assistive technology,supplemental aids and services,and program modifications in his academic classes.specifically,his first iep included providing with frequent bathroom breaks positioning aids extra time to complete academics motor and tasks and fine motor adaptations tape recorder,dictation and limited writing assignments.in the classroom,he used a floor rocker to conserve energy,a special chair at work tables,and a slant board.and when he moved around the school,he could ride in a wagon if walking made him too fatigued,d at.
in january,when was in first grade,a second iep was created that contained new goals and strictures for his participation in gym class.among other measures,the iep called for a periodic consultation between adaptive gym teacher,stefanie pingel,and his regular gym teacher before each class and at least fifteen minutes of consultation each month between pingel and his physical therapist and occupational therapist,d at.a year later,as prescribed by the act,the team began a periodic reevaluation of eligibility for special education.at the time,was engaging in regular gym class with certain limits placed on his participation to avoid injury he also met six times a month with pingel for adaptive physical education,which is simply another name for special education in use the terms interchangeably here.the adaptive physical education consisted of providing alternative activities for,so instead of regular,would do wall pushups instead of regular jumping jacks,he would do snow angels or do the jumping jacks on a mat.all of this reduced the impact on his joints.in addition,the rules for some of the games the students played were tweaked to allow him to safely participate these modifications were in place when was in second grade now he has finished fifth grade,and the school is operating under the same iep,and providing the same exact services,as mandated by law,until this suit is resolved.j.
under the act,schools must follow a process to determine whether a student is a child with a disability and thereby eligible for special education services.a.first,the student must have one of the ailments listed in the statute.although eds is not listed,there is a category titled other health impairment.id.a i.for a health condition to qualify as an other health impairment,it must manifest itself in one of a variety of ways,and it must a dversely affect the child educational performance.c ii.second,if the child condition does adversely affect his educational performance,then the team must determine whether as a result he needs special education.a ii.
during the reevaluation,the team found that was performing at grade level in his classes.he had met many of his specific iep goals for gym,and he no longer had many of the original problems that prompted his need for special education in gym.after considering all the evidence,the team concluded that the eds did not adversely affect his educational performance.
although this finding alone disqualified as a child with a disability,the team also addressed the second step in the analysis whether by reason thereof,he needs special education and related services.id.it found that did not need special education because his needs could be met in a regular education setting with some slight modifications for his medical and safety needs.these modifications included providing rest breaks and monitoring his progress through the day using an activity log.concerning his safety needs,the team recommended that a health plan be drafted by his physicians and the school nurse,setting out precise restrictions on his participation in gym class.this health plan would limit his repetitions in certain activities and provide alternative means for completing others.
parents disagreed with the team conclusions.they maintained that because he can not safely perform all of the activities in gym class,he is entitled to special education.they sought and obtained administrative review of the team decision.following eight days of hearings,the alj found that when the team evaluated his eligibility it committed several errors.ultimately,the alj credited the opinion of one of physicians,pamela trapane,that the eds causes him pain and fatigue and when he experiences that it can affect his educational performance.id.at.based on that,the alj found that ability to fully and safely perform and participate in certain physical activities at school,including regular pe class and recess,is adversely affected by his eds.id.
the alj also rejected the team alternative finding that did not need special education.she dismissed the testimony of stefanie pingel,adaptive gym teacher,as unreliable.id.at.and she specifically credited the opinion of trapane over the team,finding that he can not safely engage in unrestricted participation in various activities of the regular pe program and that he requires special education,particularly specially designed pe and related services to meet his unique needs.id.at.
the school district sought review by the district court.the district court did not receive any new evidence but instead relied on the record developed before the alj.it upheld the alj findings.specifically,on the issue of whether needed special education,the district court noted that a lthough the school district makes convincing arguments and another fact finder might have reached a different conclusion,i can not say that the administrative law judge clearly erred in deciding that needed special education.id.at.
under the act,the party challenging the outcome of the administrative hearing bears the burden of persuasion in the district court.alex forrestville valley county sch,cir.when that court reviews the administrative decision it gives no deference to the alj legal conclusions.id.on issues of law,the hearing officer is entitled to no deference.but on issues of fact,it must give the alj findings due weight.id.at.when the district court receives no new evidence and relies solely on the administrative record,it owes considerable deference to the alj factual findings.id.in such instances,as it did in this case,the district court is essentially sitting as a reviewing court.morton cmty.unit sch,cir.and when it sits in this manner,no matter how its rulings are characterized,they are necessarily rulings of law,which we indeed review de novo,just as we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.id.thus,we review the alj order directly,giving her findings the same degree of deference as the district court did due weight on the factual issues and plenary review on legal issues.sch.dist.of wi dells,cir dale bd.of educ.of high,cir.
this is a complicated case.the record spans thousands of pages with many exhibits,and the district court order reflects how involved the hearing was.a large part of the iep meeting,the hearing,and the alj report centers on and his performance in his academic classes.in his classes,the alj noted he was at grade level or only an average student.and this was after many modifications and accommodations were made for him.alj op.at.the discussion of his academic performance,however,obscures the issue at hand only received special education in gym,and the alj findings only concerned whether the eds adversely affects his educational performance in gym and his need for special education in gym.alj op.at.based on the record as a whole,i find that the student ability to fully and safely perform and participate in certain physical activities at school,including regular pe class and recess,is adversely affected by eds.id.at i find that the student needs special education,particularly specially designed pe,and related services to meet his unique needs.therefore,the precise question before us is whether the alj erred when she found that educational performance is adversely affected and because of that,he needs special education in gym.
special education under the act is limited to those students classified as a child with a disability.a.for to qualify,his health condition must adversely affect his educational performance and as a result he must need special education.id.a ii.based on a variety of data and factors,the team found that the eds did not adversely affect s educational performance,d at.the alj disagreed.she found that the eds adversely affects educational performance.the school district challenges this finding.this presents a mixed question of law and fact therefore,we review the legal standard applied by the alj de novo and her factual findings for clear error.alex,at.
in her report,the alj concluded that the eds adversely affects c.educational performance because it causes him to experience pain and fatigue and that when he does experience pain fatigue at school,it can affect his educational performance.alj op.at.this is an incorrect formulation of the test.it is not whether something,when considered in the abstract,can adversely affect a student educational performance,but whether in reality it does.c ii see also bd.of,d.
and it is clear from the record that this misstatement of the law affected the alj finding.the misstatement reflected the scant evidence on this point little of the testimony and few of the exhibits cited by the alj stated or even suggested that educational performance was adversely affected by the eds.rather,the evidence cited either mirrored the improper recitation of law,was inconsistent with prior findings and testimony,or was entirely discredited during.
concerning the last point,trapane was the main source of evidence cited for the proposition that the eds adversely affects educational performance.and the sole basis of her information was mother.trapane evaluated for minutes she did not do any testing or observation of and his educational performance.in fact,trapane admitted that she has no experience or training in special education and never observed in the classroom,d at.her only familiarity with school curricula was with her own children.such a cursory and conclusory pronouncement does not constitute substantial evidence to support the alj finding.
in short,the alj applied the wrong legal standard in determining whether the eds adversely affected educational performance,and while there is evidence that the eds can affect educational performance,there is no substantial evidence to support the alj finding that it has an adverse affect.rather,as the district court noted,the evidence is that the prior iep remedies have substantially improved his performance all of the school district members of the team,including the school therapists,agreed that average performance and overall improvement showed that his health condition did not have an adverse affect on his educational performance,d at.thus,we find that the alj erred in the legal standard she applied and committed clear error in her factual findings.
even if the alj had not erred in her finding that the eds had adversely affected educational performance,that would not have ended the inquiry.as explained above,if an iep team determines that a child medical condition adversely affects his educational performance,the team must also determine whether that student requires special education.a ii the second step in the analysis is whether the child needs special education and related services.in this case,the team concluded that such services were not needed all of safety needs could be met through a health plan implemented in his regular gym class.the school felt it could address his needs by simply limiting his repetitions and ameliorating the potentially harmful aspects of gym.
in rejecting that decision the alj found that the testimony of stefanie pingel,adaptive gym teacher,lacked reliability.alj op.at.the alj also overrode the team finding and instead credited the testimony of physician about his need for special education.relying primarily on the reports of nathan rudin and trapane and the testimony of trapane,the alj found that needed special education because of safety concerns in gym class.it was the team position throughout these proceedings that physicians can not simply prescribe special education for a student.rather,that designation lies within the team discretion,governed by the applicable rules and regulations.we agree.
the sole reason cited by the alj for rejecting the team position was that pingel testimony lacked reliability.alj op.at.we review credibility determinations for clear error.alex,at.and we rarely reverse a fact finder on a credibility determination.getch astrue,cir.but we will when the reason stated for rejecting the testimony is unreasonable or unsupported in other words,w e overturn it only if patently wrong.prochaska barnhart,cir quotation omitted.
because the reason for designating special education for was his need for special training and protection in gym class,pingel was the key individual in the process.she was among those responsible for formulating prior ieps,and she was the most important person in implementing them she was his adaptive gym teacher.as such,she was the one who could testify best concerning whether he needed special education to participate in the gym curriculum and meet the goals for children in his grade level.
despite pingel expertise and unique position in this whole process,the alj rejected her testimony as lacking reliability.the reason given was that although pingel testified that did not need special education,her behavior in conducting his activities in gym class contradicted that testimony.alj op.at.in support of this,the alj specifically noted that pingel testified in detail about many adaptations and modifications that she made for the student to enable him to participate in pe class,and that pingel frequently conferred with the physical therapist and the regular physical education teacher about how to modify activities for to meet his needs.id.at.
the problem with rejecting pingel testimony on this basis is that the behavior that supposedly contradicted her testimony was mandated under iep.as the district court noted,that iep prescribed consultation between the adaptive physical education teacher and the regular physical education teacher before each physical education class and consultation between the occupational therapist,physical therapist and special area teachers at least minutes a month,d at.pingel simply followed the directives set out in the iep,which is precisely what the law demanded of her,even though she may have thought it was unnecessary.
it is unclear what the alj would have had pingel do to assure that her opinion was reliable.pingel can only do as the law provides call or wait for another iep to reevaluate,and then express her bel
