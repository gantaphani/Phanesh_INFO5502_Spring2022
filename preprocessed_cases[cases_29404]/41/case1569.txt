michael brandon was employed as an anesthesiologist by anesthesia pain management associates apma.after discovering that certain apma doctors seemed to be falsifying the bills they submitted to medicare,he brought his concerns to the attention of the apma shareholders.this led in short order first to problems at work and later to his discharge.believing that the discharge was in retaliation for his airing of the medicare issue,brandon filed a lawsuit claiming that the defendants had committed the illinois tort of retaliatory discharge.a jury found in his favor,but not long afterward the district court granted apma motion for judgment as a matter of law and vacated the jury verdict.the court found as a matter of law that the illinois supreme court would not recognize a retaliatory discharge claim under the circumstances of brandon case.in our view,the district court was mistaken on this critical question of illinois law we therefore reverse the grant of the rule motion and order the jury verdict to be reinstated.furthermore,we conclude that the trial court should not have dismissed the punitive damage claims,which we remand for further proceedings.
brandon began working as an anesthesiologist for apma in september.apma provides anesthesia services to patients at elizabeth hospital in belleville,illinois approximately of its patients are medicare recipients.when brandon was hired,apma had four shareholder anesthesiologists kumar ravi,kathleen slocum,james boivin,and maurice boivin.maurice boivin was no longer a shareholder at the time brandon filed his complaint,which accounts for his absence in the list of defendants.after two years on the job,brandon was promoted to an associate position.along with the promotion came a pay raise and the ability to begin the process of becoming an apma shareholder.brandon also received a substantial bonus at the end of.
as an associate,brandon was now responsible along with the for filling out medicare billing reports.he soon began to suspect that several of the shareholders were making alterations to reports or otherwise falsifying reports in order to receive medicare reimbursement at rates higher than the rates to which apma was entitled by law.under the governing regulations,medicare allows for more generous reimbursements for procedures that an anesthesiologist medically directs because the bill includes both the doctor services and the services of various assistants,than for procedures that the doctor personally performs.there are limits,however,to the use of the medically directed rate most importantly for present purposes,an anesthesiologist may not oversee more than four surgeries at a time.if she does,then the provider may bill at a much lower rate only for the services of the assistants who are actually performing the work.
in may or june,brandon contacted medicare to obtain a copy of its regulations.after reviewing them,he became convinced that his colleagues practices were improper.some,he thought,were falsifying the number of operations they were supervising,so that they could bill at the highest medically directed rate others were altering the billing sheets to indicate that they were performing work,even though they had left the hospital for the day.accordingly,at the shareholders meeting held in early july,he brought these issues to their attention and showed them copies of the relevant medicare rules.the doctors seemed upset that he had contacted medicare and worried about what he had told the medicare authorities.brandon assured them that he had asked medicare only generic questions and had not divulged any information about apma billing procedures.he also suggested that the shareholders should hire another anesthesiologist,which would make it easier for them legitimately to meet the medicare requirements for billing at higher rates.the shareholders told brandon that they would look into the problem.at trial,the shareholders argued that brandon did not complain about medicare fraud until november.but since the jury found in brandon favor,we are taking his version of the facts as true.
a few weeks later,on july,the shareholders told brandon that his job performance was unsatisfactory,that they had received complaints about him,and that he should start looking for other work.brandon found this suspicious,as no formal complaint had ever been filed against him,he had recently been promoted,and he had recently received a substantial raise.he pressed the shareholders for details about the alleged complaints against him,but they did not furnish any particulars.around the same time,brandon began keeping a journal documenting all of the cases in which he thought that apma shareholders were improperly billing medicare.he periodically brought these occurrences to the shareholders attention,but he took no other action at that time.
on october,slocum told brandon that the shareholders had decided that he had to leave his job by the end of the year.brandon protested that the shareholders were firing him only because of his challenges to their medicare claims and that he planned to take them to court.slocum answered,we can do what we want with you.you do have a contract.
on october and,brandon again brought his complaints to the attention of the shareholders.his effort did nothing but bring about a letter from the shareholders dated october,formally notifying him that he was discharged effective at the end of the year,but also giving him the option to resign.on november,brandon met with the shareholders to discuss the termination he again accused the shareholders of retaliating against him for pointing out the billing fraud.with strong,vulgar language,slocum made it plain that brandon was finished,and bluntly added,you do have a signed contract.at this time,brandon,for the first time,threatened to report the alleged fraud to the government.
on november,the shareholders sent brandon another letter making his termination effective immediately,but still urging him to resign.they suggested that if he did not resign,they could make it very difficult for him to find another job.brandon refused to resign,and so he was terminated.ten months after his termination,he reported apma billing practices to the attorney office.the record does not reflect what use,if any,the attorney office made of his report.
brandon a citizen of missouri then filed this diversity suit against apma and its current shareholders all illinois citizens,alleging retaliatory discharge under illinois law.the trial began on october.two days later,at the close of brandon evidence,the defendants filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a they renewed their motion at the close of all the evidence.the court reserved its ruling on the motions it also refused brandon request for a punitive damages instruction.on november,the jury returned a verdict in favor of brandon,awarding him for lost earnings and for pain and suffering and emotional distress.
but brandon victory was.about six months after the jury verdict,the district court entered a final judgment granting the defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law,vacating the jury verdict,and dismissing the complaint.this appeal followed.
the jury concluded that brandon was fired for complaining about the shareholders fraudulent billing practices,and we are not asked to overturn this determination.rather,the question for us is whether this discharge was in retaliation for activities which are protected by the clearly mandated public policy of illinois,and as such was tortious under illinois law.
illinois is an employment state,which means that in general an employee can be discharged at any time for any reason or none at all.pratt caterpillar tractor,d.nevertheless,there are exceptions to that rule one obvious one is that a forbidden characteristic such as race can not be the reason for the actions of someone counting as an employer.comp.stat.ann.west.the tort of retaliatory discharge embodies another exception.a discharged employee may sue her employer for the common law tort of retaliatory discharge if her discharge was in retaliation for certain actions that are protected by the public policy of illinois,including retaliation for complaints about an employer unlawful conduct.pratt,at hinthorn roland of bloomington.unlike the federal false claims act fca,which we discuss below,the illinois tort does not require that the employee have reported the allegedly illegal conduct to the authorities,as long as she reported it to the employer,lanning morris mobile meals,d.the tort also does not require the employee to have been correct about the unlawfulness of the conduct,as long as she had a belief that it was unlawful.see stebbings of chicago,d.
as noted earlier,the district court did not overturn the jury determination of the reason for brandon termination that he was fired for complaining about the billing practices.instead,it found that brandon claim failed on two other grounds he failed to show any clear mandate of illinois public policy which his discharge contravenes,and even if such public policy exists,other means exist to vindicate it absent recognition of the tort of retaliatory discharge in this case.these are purely legal points that we review de novo.doe howe military school,cir.
public policy against medicare fraud 
while the illinois supreme court has acknowledged that t here is no precise definition of the term clearly mandated public policy,palmateer int l harvester,the court has explained that public policy concerns what is right and just and what affects the citizens of the state collectively a matter must strike at the heart of a citizen social rights,duties,and responsibilities before the tort will be allowed.id.at.
illinois courts have identified two situations in which the clear mandate of public policy standard is met when an employee is fired for asserting a workers compensation claim,kelsay motorola,and when an employee is fired for refusing to engage in illegal conduct or reporting the illegal conduct of others whistle blowing or citizen crime fighting.palmateer,at.brandon claim rests upon the latter of these two.
the defendants implicitly concede,as they must,that brandon believed that the conduct about which he had complained amounted to medicare fraud.medicare fraud is covered by several federal felony statutes,including the fca,which criminalizes the act of making false claims to the federal government including overcharging for medicare reimbursements,the false statements act,and the criminal medicare and medicaid and abuse provisions,west.
notwithstanding the fact that illinois has long had a public policy that encourages citizens to report crimes,see palmateer,at,the district court took the rather narrow view that these federal criminal statutes could not provide a basis for illinois public policy.it stated that brandon had failed to prove the existence of any clear mandate of illinois public policy in favor of preventing health care fraud against the federal government rather than the state of illinois,implying that state public policy would not be concerned with the defrauding of the federal government and the violation of federal statutes that make it a crime to commit medicare fraud.
in so holding,the court erred.to begin with,under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,the state is required to treat federal law on a parity with state law,and thus it is not entitled to relegate violations of federal law or policy to citizenship.see claflin houseman.but we need not escalate this case to the constitutional level,because it is plain that the courts of illinois have done no such thing.to the contrary,they have explicitly stated that it is a clearly established policy of illinois to prevent its citizens from violating federal law and that the state public policy encourages employees to report suspected violations of federal law if that law advances the general welfare of illinois citizens.russ pension consultants,d,the illinois supreme court has held that public policy may be found in federal law a n illinois citizen obedience to the law,including federal law,is a clearly mandated public policy of this state johnson world color press,d,public policy can be found not only in the laws and judicial decisions of illinois,but can also be found in federal law.our supreme court held that a cause of action for retaliatory discharge could be based upon a clearly mandated public policy which has been declared by congress and which is national in scope.citations omitted.
there are many examples of illinois cases in which reports about violations of federal law have given rise to valid claims of retaliatory discharge.see,wheeler caterpillar tractor,employee was fired after reporting violations of nuclear regulatory commission policy stebbings,at employee was fired for complaining about violations of federal radioactive materials regulations sherman kraft foods,d,employee was fired for reporting violations of osha howard zack,d,employee was fired for reporting violation of federal record keeping regulations johnson,d,employee was fired for reporting violations of federal securities laws.furthermore,the illinois legislature itself has explicitly articulated a state policy against all public benefits fraud 
because of the pervasive nature of public assistance fraud and its negative effect on the people of the state of illinois and those individuals who need public assistance,the general assembly declares it to be public policy that public assistance fraud be identified and dealt with swiftly and appropriately considering the onerous nature of the crime.
comp.stat.ann.west.although in a highly technical sense apma may not have committed state public benefits fraud,its discharge of brandon violated the statutory policy against public benefits fraud in general.see stebbings,at statute from which public policy can be inferred need not necessarily apply to the specific conduct at hand.finally,the illinois supreme court is particularly sensitive to the public policy underpinnings of statutes that affect the health and safety of citizens.united states ex rel.chandler hektoen inst.for med.research,d.
in short,the illinois courts are under no illusions about the status of federal law as a source of public policy for the state of illinois.the illinois legislature has stated that it is the public policy of the state to identify and end public benefits fraud illinois has an undeniable interest in ensuring that its citizens are obedient to federal law and that its public benefits recipients are not cheated out of proper medical care or benefits.taking all this into account,we conclude that the illinois supreme court would find that brandon discharge was in violation of the public policy of the state of illinois.
alternative means of enforcement 
even if brandon has established the elements of a retaliatory discharge claim,the illinois courts have hinted in dicta that the claim may still be rejected if an adequate alternative remedy exists to vindicate the retaliatory discharge or otherwise to deter the activity that is inconsistent with public policy.the tort of retaliatory discharge was not intended to serve as a substitute means for enforcement of particular laws.stebbings,at.see also hamros bethany homes methodist,no retaliatory discharge claim for plaintiff fired for exercising his rights under the family and medical leave act fmla since the fmla already prohibits retaliation and this discharge presented a private matter between the employer and the employee.
taking its lead from these cases,the district court also supported its decision on the ground that the fca,which forbids the submission of knowingly false claims for money to the federal government,adequately protected the state policy against public benefits fraud and provided brandon with a sufficient remedy for the retaliatory discharge.the fca permits the federal government to impose civil sanctions against fraudulent parties.a.it also allows a private individual to bring a qui tam action for fraud,on behalf of the federal government,and to recover an award of up to of the proceeds of the action.see b d.
but the existence of criminal and civil sanctions for unlawful conduct can not be the basis fo
