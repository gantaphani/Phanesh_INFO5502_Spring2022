the question in this case is whether steven nuzum,has an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity,thus entitling him to the protections of the americans with disabilities act,known as the ada.nuzum appeals from the district court entry of summary judgment against him on his ada claim against his former employer,ozark automobile distributors,which does business under the name auto parts.we hold that nuzum failed to show his of his left in a substantial limitation on any major life activity accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
nuzum worked for ozark as an,collecting auto parts from a warehouse to be distributed to retail stores and manually loading totes full of parts onto a conveyor belt.his job required him to lift as much as pounds at a time.he hurt his elbow while lifting a heavy auto starter at work on about may.the pain continued,and on june,he visited a doctor,who diagnosed him with tendinitis.the doctor sent him to physical therapy and told him to avoid lifting,pushing,or pulling more than fifteen pounds with his left hand,which is his dominant hand.over the next two years,he pursued medical treatment and remedies,and his condition fluctuated.as his injury waxed and waned,he asked for modification of his duties at work and received temporary assignments that did not require him to lift as much as usual.
on april,nuzum doctor pronounced him recovered to the maximum extent that could be expected.the doctor issued permanent medical restrictions nuzum was limited to lifting ten pounds constantly,twenty pounds frequently,and forty pounds occasionally.at nuzum deposition he described his impairment as follows 
right now,i still do mow the lawn.to push a lawn mower i can not do.some household chores can be too strenuous to be lifting certain items.even a basketful of laundry can hurt i do do it.
well,there some things i do do as much of,and that just the normal little things i always done,work on my car and my sons cars.
i been coaching baseball,football,and basketball for about or years,coaching,and i do think the past couple years i been as effective as a coach because i been unable to have any and demonstrate certain abilities of things that the kids need to know,because i ca throw a baseball like i used to,i ca throw a football,i ca shoot a basketball like i used to.
like i miss,hugging my wife is different,ca pull her as tight,and so there things that have changed,yeah.
the doctor who conducted an independent medical examination of nuzum recounted that nuzum sleep was disturbed by rolling onto his elbow while asleep nuzum reported sleeping about two and a half hours at a time,for a total of four to five hours sleep per night.
nuzum and ozark agree that the order picker job required nuzum to lift up to sixty pounds and was therefore not within his capabilities.because nuzum was not expected to improve,ozark was no longer willing to allow nuzum to do the modified jobs it had offered him while he was convalescing.ozark offered him a security guard position at a lower pay rate,which nuzum declined.ozark eventually offered nuzum three choices voluntary resignation,application for twelve weeks of family and medical leave act leave,or two weeks time to look for work within ozark compatible with his restrictions.nuzum chose the latter option,but he was not able to find another job at ozark within two weeks.at the end of the period,ozark terminated his employment.
nuzum brought this action under the ada and the iowa civil rights act,iowa code,alleging that he was disabled and that ozark had failed to accommodate his disability.the district court entered summary judgment against him.nuzum ozark auto,d.
summary judgment should be entered only if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,demonstrates that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.civ.c.we review de novo the district court entry of summary judgment.brunko mercy,cir.
title i of the ada prohibits discrimination by a covered employer against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability.a.an employer can discriminate by failing to make reasonable accommodation to the known limitations of an employee,b a,which is the kind of discrimination nuzum alleges.an individual does not prove that he or she has a disability simply by showing an impairment that makes it impossible to do his or her particular job without accommodation.see,toyota motor,williams,d.rather,establishing disability is a significant hurdle that can prevent a person who was denied a job because of an impairment from being covered by the ada,sutton united air lines,d employer refused to offer plaintiffs jobs because of myopia,yet plaintiffs were not disabled shipley city of.city,cir plaintiff not disabled although impairments prevented him from being able to perform former job as firefighter.
the principal meaning of disability consists of two parts the individual must have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of the individual.in this case,there is no doubt that nuzum suffers from a physical impairment.the disputed questions are whether the impairment has affected a major life activity and whether that effect is a substantial limitation.a.
major life activity has proven to be an elusive concept that has engendered a good deal of litigation.the eeoc definition includes a disparate range of activities from the elemental to the complex functions such as caring for oneself,performing manual tasks,walking,seeing,hearing,speaking,breathing,learning,and working.i.the eeoc definition includes some of the most elemental bodily,motor,and mental functions,such as breathing,seeing,and learning.at the middle level of complexity,the eeoc definition of major life activity includes some tasks that require the ability to perform a set of basic motor functions,such as caring for oneself,which might include walking to the bathtub,lifting oneself into the water,reaching to wash one hair.finally,at the high end of complexity,the eeoc definition includes major life activities that require the ability to do entire sets of tasks.for instance,working includes the ability to do the component tasks of a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.fjellestad pizza hut of america,cir j i.similarly,in williams,the supreme court interpreted the major life activity of performing manual tasks to include ability to do a particular set of tasks,to wit,the variety of tasks central to most people daily lives.at.
the supreme court has interpreted major as meaning of comparative importance,bragdon abbott,d see also williams,at,so that inability to do an activity of little importance can not establish disability.
nuzum lists a number of household chores and recreational activities that he can not do or can not do as well,as much,or as long as he used to.in light of williams,we regard the ability to perform manual tasks as encompassing the ability to perform a particular set of tasks the variety of tasks central to most people daily lives,at,rather than considering each individual task as a discrete major life activity.thus,we ask not whether nuzum can work on his car or mow his lawn,as he argues he can not,but whether his overall ability to do the manual tasks central to most people lives is substantially limited.see philip ford motor,cir the type of evidence most relevant to establishing a substantial limitation in the major life activity of performing manual tasks,includes,for example,an individual ability to do household chores,bathe,brush one teeth,prepare meals,do laundry.whether the individual can work on cars is one small part of a big inquiry that asks what manual tasks most people do and what manual tasks the ada plaintiff can do.even though throwing is recreational rather than a task,we have grouped limits on recreational activities together with limits on home or personal maintenance activities involving a similar degree of importance in daily life for purposes of the williams analysis.see philip,at taking into account whether plaintiff could mow grass,barbeque,and work out on treadmill,among other things.but weber strippit,cir holding that shoveling snow,gardening,mowing the lawn,playing tennis,fishing,and hiking are not major life activities.
nuzum argues that his injury affected the major life activity of working.although working is listed as a major life activity in the eeoc and rehabilitation act regulations,i j ii,the supreme court has reserved judgment on the question of whether working is properly considered a major life activity,williams,at.knutson ag processing,cir.however,our circuit has considered it so.webner,at fjellestad,at.
nuzum is subject to a permanent medical restriction on lifting,with a maximum.our circuit has recognized the basic motor function of lifting as a major life activity.see wood crown,cir webner titan,cir fjellestad pizza hut of america,cir.yet,in cases in which plaintiffs have established restrictions on lifting,we have said flatly that restrictions on lifting will not be enough to establish disability.for instance,in mellon fed.express,cir,we said 
it would thus appear that under prior rulings by this court both the district court and this panel must reject,as a matter of law,the disability claim of mellon that is based on the premise that she can not lift more than pounds and should avoid other such stresses with her right arm.
accord wenzel.water,cir a lifting restriction,without more,is not a disability.conant city of hibbing,cir per curiam this court has repeatedly held that the type of work restriction at issue in this case no lifting more than pounds and no repeated bending or squatting does not amount to a disability within the meaning of the ada.brunko mercy,cir although lifting itself is identified as a major life activity,this court has held that a general lifting restriction without more is insufficient to constitute a disability within the meaning of the ada.snow ridgeview med,cir while lifting is noted under the regulations as a major life activity,a general lifting restriction imposed by a physician,without more,is insufficient to constitute a disability within the meaning of the ada.see also dropinski douglas county,cir stating that if the plaintiff proved only lifting restriction,it might not be enough to establish disability.in those cases,we did not consider whether a restriction on lifting a certain weight limited the plaintiff in comparison with an average member of the population,which is the method of analysis specified by the regulations for determining substantial limitation.see j.thus,we did not simply say that a pound limit was too high to be a substantial limitation rather,we said lifting limitations alone were not enough to establish disability.if no amount of limitation on an activity suffices to establish disability,then the activity is not a major life activity in its own right.we have said,however,that a substantial limitation of a constellation of such basic motor functions could suffice to prove disability.dropinski,at webner,at.therefore,rather than viewing lifting as a major life activity in its own right,it is more accurate to say that it is part of a set of basic motor functions that together represent a major life activity.
not only have we required limitations on a set,rather than on individual basic motor functions,to satisfy the substantial limitation requirement,but we have recently applied the williams standard to such functions.williams itself held that to show a substantial limitation on the activity of performing manual tasks,a plaintiff must show an effect on the particular tasks that are central to most people daily lives.at.in our recent cases,we have held limitations on basic motor functions,such as sitting or standing,were not substantial because they did not meet the williams standard,even though the functions at issue were neither tasks,nor manual,at least not in the sense of involving the hands.see wood,at philip ford motor,cir see generally fenney dakota,cir williams test applies to all major life activities,not just manual tasks.for instance,in philip,at,we rejected a claim that plaintiff was unable to grip,reach,lift,stand,sit,or walk because plaintiff failed to show how these limitations impacted tasks central to most people daily lives.accord wood,at assessing substantiality of limit on standing,turning,lifting,and bending by asking which household tasks plaintiff could perform.as we explained in philip 
we recognize williams dealt only with the proof necessary to establish a substantial limitation in the major life activity of performing manual tasks.nevertheless,we find its premise equally applicable to philip claims involving the major life activities of gripping,reaching,lifting,standing,sitting and walking.
these cases interpreting williams are similar to another line in which we have assessed a lifting restriction by determining whether it posed a substantial limitation on the major life activity of working.see duty proppants,cir lifting restriction together with various symptoms and testimony of vocational expert supported limitation on working webner,at assessing limitation on lifting by determining whether it prevented plaintiff from doing certain classifications of jobs brunko,at holding that lifting restriction not a disability because it only precluded brunko from performing a narrow range of jobs see also fjellestad,at plaintiff argued she had limitations on basic function of sitting and on bathing,but court relied only on working.
thus,although the motor functions listed in the eeoc definition are designated as major life activities in their own right,our cases show a finding of disability depends not on whether the plaintiff can perform every one of those functions,but on whether the net effect of the impairment is to prevent or severely restrict the plaintiff from doing the set of activities that are of central importance to most people daily lives,williams,at,or from working,see webner,at.
sleeping is also recognized by some courts as a major life activity,colwell suffolk county police,cir sleep is undoubtedly a major life activity swanson of cincinnati,cir pack kmart,cir see also heisler metro.council,cir assuming sleep is major life activity,even though sleeping might be said to be the opposite of activity.bragdon abbott,d rehnquist,dissenting reproduction is not an activity at all,but a process.
nuzum reliance on hugging as a major life activity could be analyzed in several ways.it could be analyzed as the motor function of squeezing.it could,albeit with some linguistic strain,be characterized as part of the ability to perform manual tasks.it could be characterized as part of the ability to engage in sexual relations,which the ninth circuit has recognized as a major life activity.see mcalindin county of san diego,cir,amended on denial of rehearing,cir.we need not struggle with how to characterize this activity because it can not support nuzum ada claim for the reasons discussed below at page.
once a major life activity has been identified,the ada plaintiff must show that his ability to perform the activity is substantially limited by the impairment.substantially limited means limited considerabl y or to a large degree.williams,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the eeoc regulations define substantially limited as follows 
i unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform or 
ii significantly restricted as to the condition,manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition,manner,or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.
j.the eeoc regulations then instruct us to assess the substantiality of the limitation by examining the nature,severity,duration,and impact of the impairment,j,thus diverting attention to some extent from the functional limitations to the individual underlying physical or mental impairment.
as we have discussed,a limitation on lifting together with limitations on other basic motor functions may create a triable issue of disability if in the ag
