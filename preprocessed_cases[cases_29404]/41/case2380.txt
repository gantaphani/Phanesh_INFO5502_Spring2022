we navigate once again the murky waters between two statutory bodies medicaid and the americans with disabilities act ada.specifically,we examine whether a state violates the ada when it limits the number of people that can participate in a medicaid waiver program providing disabled persons with alternatives to institutionalization.
medicaid is a program under which the federal government provides financial assistance to participating states to help them furnish care to persons.if a state chooses to all fifty must submit a plan for approval by the federal regulators.see children hosp.health ctr.belshe,cir.
washington state department of social and health services the department devised a plan which provided for two types of services to certain developmentally disabled individuals.first,it funded intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded,which are generally large public institutions made available to any person who meets the eligibility requirements for admission.see a,d.in addition,the plan used some funds to support smaller,privately operated residences that serve between six and forty individuals each.second,in an effort to offer alternatives to institutionalization,the department sought and received a waiver of certain icf mr rules.see id.c.that waiver program is known as the home and services waiver hcbs hcbs provides a variety of noninstitutional care options for qualified persons,enabling them to remain more integrated in the community than if they were institutionalized.
central to the question presented to us is the limitation on hcbs services to a particular number of when this action was filed.such a cap is expressly contemplated by the medicaid waiver provisions,see c,f,and there is no indication that washington is failing to use all of its allocated slots.the arc of washington state,and three developmentally disabled individuals collectively the arc,complain that because the program is full,eligible individuals must await openings before they can be enrolled.the arc asserts that title ii of the ada,stat,codified at,prevents washington from maintaining any fixed hcbs cap.instead,it argues,the state must make the hcbs waiver program available to every developmentally disabled person who could qualify for an setting,but who prefers hcbs.the district court disagreed,and granted partial summary judgment against the arc 
discussion 
as an alternative to institutionalized care for the disabled,the medicaid statute and regulations allow states to apply for waiver programs for home and care.however,congress envisioned such programs as limited in scope,and therefore included the following language in c,the waiver portion of the statute 
in the case of any waiver under this subsection which contains a limit on the number of individuals who shall receive home or services,the state may substitute additional individuals to receive such services to replace any individuals who die or become ineligible for services under the state plan.
the secretary shall not limit to fewer than the number of individuals in the state who may receive home and services under a waiver under this subsection.
the regulations implementing the statute go farther,requiring states to place a limit on the number of waiver program participants,and requiring states to adhere to the limitation 
the state must indicate the number of unduplicated beneficiaries to which it intends to provide waiver services in each year of its program.this number will constitute a limit on the size of the waiver program unless the state requests and the secretary approves a greater number of waiver participants in a waiver amendment.
approaching the problem from the opposite direction,the ada provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.the regulations that flesh out that provision state a public entity shall administer services,programs,and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.d.
we have previously described the ada as containing an integration mandate.see townsend quasim,cir.under this mandate,states are required to provide care in integrated environments for as many disabled persons as is reasonably feasible,so long as such an environment is appropriate to their needs.see see also olmstead ex rel.zimring,d.this requirement serves one of the principal purposes of title ii of the ada ending the isolation and segregation of disabled persons.see d.in order to comply with the integration mandate,states are required to make reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedures that are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability.id.b.
the integration mandate has its own limitations.in administering services,programs and activities,a state is not required to make modifications that would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,program,or activity.id.the supreme court has instructed courts to be sympathetic to fundamental alteration defenses,and to give states leeway in administering services for the disabled.olmstead,at.see townsend,at.despite the integration mandate,therefore,we have held that we normally will not tinker with comprehensive,effective state programs for providing care to the disabled.see sanchez johnson,cir.
the arc claim is that washington hcbs program is too small to accommodate the state population of eligible participants.according to the arc,washington must request federal authorization for an increase in the size of its hcbs waiver program.whether the state may be required to seek such an increase depends on whether this would be a reasonable modification which is required or a fundamental alteration which is not.
the supreme court has addressed this distinction in the specific context of medicaid waiver programs for the disabled.in olmstead ex rel.zimring,the court recognized that t he state responsibility,once it provides treatment to qualified persons with disabilities,is not boundless.at.although the unjustified isolation of disabled persons in institutions would violate the ada,the court recognized certain state justifications that would defeat an challenge,for example the states need to maintain a range of facilities for the care and treatment of persons with diverse mental disabilities,and the states obligation to administer services with an even hand.id.at.further,a state could avoid having to modify its waiver program if it were to demonstrate that it had a comprehensive,effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with mental disabilities in less restrictive settings,and a waiting list that moved at a reasonable pace.id.at.
the supreme court in olmstead did not consider whether a forced change in the waiver program cap would constitute a fundamental alteration,because the state program in that case was far from full.see id.at.the modifications requested by the plaintiffs could therefore be implemented without requiring the state to request a higher program cap.thus,the case was remanded for consideration of the appropriate relief in light of the state reasons for refusing to implement the modifications.see id.at.
we have also twice explored the boundary between reasonable modifications and fundamental alterations in the context of medicaid waiver programs for the disabled.in townsend quasim,we held that a state could not maintain a waiver program that provided integrated care only for those disabled persons falling below a certain income level the categorically needy,while forcing disabled persons with a higher income level the medically needy to remain institutionalized.see at.the state program,we said,which explicitly provid ed only based long term care
