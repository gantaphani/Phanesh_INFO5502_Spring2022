in,the jefferson county road department fired lynn zwygart from his position as a truck driver after twelve years of problems.he was subsequently reinstated after signing a contract that expressly acknowledged the county right to fire him for taking unpaid leave.in,the county exercised its contractual right and fired zwygart because he failed to accrue sufficient paid leave,beyond the twelve weeks of leave provided by the family and medical leave act,to excuse his absence following an surgery.zwygart sued,alleging that the county actions violated his rights under the americans with disabilities act and the due process clause.the district court granted the county motion for summary judgment on both claims.we agree that zwygart has not demonstrated a triable issue of fact on either claim and therefore affirm the district court judgment.
the jefferson county road department hired zwygart as a truck driver in.after four years of apparently satisfactory performance,he began displaying attendance problems in,he used hours of leave without pay in,he received a written warning for taking hours of leave without pay and hours of sick leave under questionable circumstances and in,he received a second written warning after taking hours of leave without pay.app.
zwygart did not alter his behavior in response to the written warnings.in,he was put on probation and later suspended for not providing doctor notes to account for his time off.in june,the county told zwygart that he had failed to meet conditions imposed in for his continued employment,including accumulating five days of sick leave and not taking leave without pay.on october,zwygart secured his supervisor written acknowledgment that he had accumulated the required amount of sick leave within five weeks of doing so,however,he had used it all.
in september,zwygart had open heart surgery.he exhausted his annual statutory allotment of family and medical leave act leave while recuperating before returning to work full time in december.
zwygart first annual performance review occurred in july.it culminated in this july,termination letter from his supervisor 
i have reviewed your work performance evaluations and performance history with jefferson county road department and have found it to be below satisfactory.
as you know from our prior communications,the failure to improve your performance would result in termination from employment.your performance record this year falls far short of the improvement necessary for you to be retained.
consequently,this letter is to inform you that your employment with jefferson county has been terminated as of today.
zwygart contested this termination by filing a grievance as outlined in the county employee handbook.the grievance procedure requires department heads to respond to employee grievances within three working days and sincere ly attempt to resolve any grievance at this initial step.id.at.the mechanism worked eight days after he filed the grievance,zwygart was reinstated after represented by contract with the county that made his continued employment contingent on these conditions.all use of sick leave will require a doctor slip.for no reason will leave without pay be granted.any violation of these conditions will result in immediate termination.id.at.
the reinstatement contract,like the written warnings years earlier,did not have much effect on zwygart actions.in february,zwygart supervisor sent him another letter,which states in part 
six months ago the county commission and myself discussed the problem with your work attendance.
at that time your work attendance was unsatisfactory and as a condition of employment you were instructed to do a better job of managing your time off from work.as of today you are out of vacation and sick leave.you also used your discretionary day.the only paid time off you accrued is hours of.
it clear that you do not intend to accumulate leave to prevent time off due to unforeseen emergencies or medical needs.this would cause you to take leave without pay,which i will not grant.you have been warned that any use of leave without pay will result in termination.
this letter is to notify you that i am placing you on probation for the next six months.during this time you will be required to accumulate five days of paid leave 
in may,three months after receiving this letter,zwygart was diagnosed with a bacterial infection related to the prosthetic heart valve he had received in his surgery.on may,his doctor provided a certification for work stating that zwygart has been under my care from to present and should be off work until further notice.app.shortly thereafter zwygart began a intravenous antibiotics regimen that continued until september,when he underwent a second open heart surgery to repair a leak around his prosthetic valve.his primary care physician cleared him to return to work on november.
after receiving the may work release from zwygart doctor,the county granted zwygart twelve weeks of fmla leave.when that leave expired,zwygart used his accumulated sick leave and vacation leave,as well as sick leave other employees had donated to him.combined,these sources allowed zwygart to remain on approved leave through september,short of his november date.
beginning september,the county records list zwygart absences as leave without pay.app.the county classified his absences as such until zwygart was fired on october,by this letter from the county engineer 
i regret having to write this letter to you.however,in my capacity with the jefferson county road and bridge department,i must notify you that you are no longer employed with the county.
as you know,you have long exhausted all sick,vacation and other time,which you have used since the onset of your medical condition.additionally,the county has provided you more than the weeks of unpaid medical leave required by the county family and medical leave policy.everyone was hopeful that your condition would improve and that you could return to your position.unfortunately,that has not occurred and the county can no longer hold your position for you 
as he did two years earlier,zwygart filed a grievance contesting his termination.this time,however,he received no response from his supervisor,so he forwarded his complaint to the board of county commissioners as the grievance policy instructs.
the board appointed a committee to investigate zwygart grievance.it held a hearing on december,where zwygart testified while represented by counsel that his health was good and that he could return to work as a truck driver.the committee took other evidence,including the november letter from zwygart primary care physician.after the hearing,zwygart submitted a note from his cardiologist dated december,that affirmed zwygart capacity to return to work without restriction.
after reviewing the evidence,the committee issued a report on december recommending that the commission uphold zwygart termination for six different reasons.three days later,the commission adopted the committee recommendation and unanimously sustained zwygart termination.
zwygart then sued the county for wrongful discharge and failure to accommodate in violation of the ada,and for depriving him of a property interest in his continued employment without due process in violation of the fourteenth amendment.the county moved for summary judgment on all of zwygart claims.the district court granted the county motion,holding that zwygart was not disabled within the meaning of the ada and that he failed to establish he had a protected property interest in his employment.zwygart timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under.
