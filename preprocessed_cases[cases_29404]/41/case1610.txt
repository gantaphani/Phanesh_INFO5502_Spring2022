these are separate actions to compel arbitration of state law tort claims asserted by wayne rutherford and tresa robinson,representatives of the estates of isaac rutherford and donna faye snow.the claims arise out of incidents that occurred after isaac rutherford and snow were admitted to nursing home facilities in fayetteville and springdale,arkansas,operated by northport health services of arkansas,llc,and two of its affiliates collectively,northport.prior to being admitted to the nursing homes,isaac rutherford and snow signed admission agreements providing that all disputes broadly defined to include the pending tort claims shall be resolved by binding arbitration,and that the agreement to arbitrate shall be governed by the federal arbitration act,et the faa.

the district court granted the motions to vacate,concluding that,while vaden addressed only federal question jurisdiction,its look through analysis implicitly overruled prior federal cases compelling arbitration based upon diversity of citizenship.northport appealed both rulings we later consolidated the appeals for submission.though some of the reasoning in vaden supports the district court rulings,we are not persuaded that vaden implicitly overruled the otherwise decisions in moses cone memorial hospital mercury construction,and advance america servicing of arkansas mcginnis,cir.accordingly,we reverse.

diversity cases.diversity jurisdiction turns on two issues,is there complete diversity of citizenship between the parties,and does the amount in controversy exceed.see,advance america,at.prior to vaden,all courts of appeals adopted the same approach in resolving diversity jurisdiction disputes.they determined the first issue,whether there is diversity of citizenship,by looking only to the parties in the federal action to compel arbitration,whether or not the claim s to be arbitrated were part of a parallel state court action that included other,parties,unless a party would be necessary and indispensable to the federal action under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure as the leading case addressing this issue explained,as with any federal action,diversity of citizenship is determined by reference to the parties named in the proceeding before the district court,as well as any indispensable parties who must be joined pursuant to rule.distajo,at.
to resolve the second issue,amount in controversy,courts uniformly applied a limited look through approach,determining whether the value at stake in the arbitration being sought in the federal action could exceed,regardless whether the claim s to be arbitrated were part of a broader parallel state court action in which the total amount in controversy might be greater.advance america,at accord geographic expeditions,lhotka,cir,a case we care hair,at hamilton,at.
federal question cases.unlike the uniform approach to diversity jurisdiction issues prior to vaden,a circuit split developed in deciding whether petitions to compel arbitration were supported by an independent basis of federal question jurisdiction.the majority of circuits to address the issue held that should not be interpreted to mean that a federal court has subject matter jurisdiction over an action to compel or stay arbitration merely because the underlying claim raises a federal question.westmoreland capital findlay,cir.thus,in these circuits,unless the federal action to compel arbitration included an additional claim arising under federal law,petitioners could not establish an independent basis of federal question jurisdiction.two circuits disagreed,concluding that directs a district court to look through the arbitration petition at the underlying dispute in order to determine whether there was a federal question.cmty.state bank strong,cir accord discover bank vaden,cir.the supreme court granted certiorari from the fourth circuit second decision in vaden to resolve this circuit conflict.

vaden arose when a discover bank affiliate sued in state court to recover charges,the credit card holder asserted state law counterclaims,and discover bank filed a petition in federal court to compel arbitration of the counterclaims.the district court entered an order compelling arbitration,and a divided fourth circuit panel affirmed,adopting the look through approach to federal question jurisdiction and concluding that at least some of the state law counterclaims were completely preempted by federal law and therefore established a federal question basis for jurisdiction.discover bank vaden,cir.
the supreme court granted certiorari in view of the conflict among lower federal courts on whether district courts may look through the petition and examine the parties underlying dispute to determine whether federal question jurisdiction exists over the petition.at.the court addressed that issue and an additional question presented by the procedural posture of the case if look through is the proper approach to federal question jurisdiction,may a district court exercise jurisdiction over a petition when the petitioner complaint in the underlying state court action rests on state law but an actual or potential counterclaim rests on federal law id.at.
