the plaintiffs are hospitals that provide services to patients under both medicare and medicaid.medicare beneficiaries are billed and deductibles for the services provided to them,and in some cases the medicare beneficiaries can not or will not pay.the beneficiaries in this case also have medicaid as a secondary insurer,and medicaid may cover these costs,but in some circumstances medicaid only partially covers them.the all do business in states that cap the amount of such medicaid payments.in these states,medicaid prevents the hospital from recovering the remaining portion of the fees from the beneficiary.the hospitals are left,therefore,with unrecoverable bad debt.
the medicare act states that the secretary of health and human services will promulgate regulations to ensure that the costs of medicare will not be borne,or,by individuals not covered by medicare.because of this provision,the medicare program historically covered all bad debts attributable to medicare patients.in,congress in the balanced budget act amended the medicare act to provide a percentage reduction of the amount of bad debt that would be reimbursed by medicare.the provider can make up for the remaining loss by continuing collection efforts against medicare beneficiaries,except when the beneficiaries are also covered by medicaid,as the medicaid act disallows such efforts.the plaintiffs allege that the provider is effectively forced to recoup the remaining loss attributable to patients from funds paid by patients.
the plaintiffs brought suit against the secretary,arguing that this scheme violates the medicare act ban.the plaintiffs argued that the secretary regulation,promulgated under the bad debt reimbursement reduction statute,is invalid and that there should be an exception to the bad debt reimbursement reduction for debt arising from services provided to beneficiaries.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the secretary.it is questionable to characterize medicare effective incorporation of medicaid cost limits as rather than simply as rate setting.in any event,the statutory scheme is clear on its face and does not allow for the exception that plaintiffs seek to the statutory reduction in medicare reimbursement for bad debt.the district court thus properly entered judgment for the secretary.
under the medicare program,et,the federal government pays the cost of eligible health care expenses for the aged and disabled.medicare part a authorizes the secretary to pay for inpatient institutional care,primarily at hospitals.medicare part b provides optional supplemental insurance for physician services,outpatient hospital care,and medical equipment.as under a private insurance plan,part b enrollees are responsible for and deductibles.
under both part a and part b,medicare pays for services that are medically reasonable and necessary for the beneficiary.a.before,the medicare statute provided that hospitals be paid for the services rendered based on a retrospective determination of the reasonable cost for the service.x v.since,hospitals are paid based on a system,where the provider is paid a standard rate per treatment at the time of discharge.d.some costs,including those at issue in this case,are still reimbursed on a retrospective basis.in creating regulations regarding the payment of reasonable costs,the secretary must ensure that the medicare program is regulations promulgated by the secretary 
shall i take into account both direct and indirect costs of providers of services in order that the necessary costs of efficiently delivering covered services to individuals covered by the insurance programs established by this subchapter will not be borne by individuals not so covered,and the costs with respect to individuals not so covered will not be borne by such insurance programs 
v a emphasis added see also d.this ban was in the original statute and is part of the definition of reasonable cost.social security amendments of,v,stat.
bad debts of medicare enrollees are treated as reasonable costs,and are reimbursed to hospitals on a retrospective basis.bad debts arise when the hospital can not recover and deductibles from medicare enrollees despite reasonable collection efforts.e.historically,the secretary reimbursed bad debt in full.however,in congress decreased the amount of bad debt reimbursement in order to combat rising medicare costs,balanced budget act of,stat,and provide the hospitals an impetus to make collection efforts,at.
t he amount of bad debts otherwise treated as allowable costs which are attributable to the deductibles and coinsurance amounts under this subchapter shall be reduced 
i for cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year,by percent of such amount otherwise allowable,
ii for cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year,by percent of such amount otherwise allowable,
iii for cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year,by percent of such amount otherwise allowable,and 
iv for cost reporting periods beginning during a subsequent fiscal year,by percent of such amount otherwise allowable.
v t.the secretary promulgated a regulation that mirrors the statute at h.for the remaining bad debt,the hospitals must either accept the loss or continue to pursue debt collection from the medicare beneficiary.
some medicare beneficiaries are also enrolled in medicaid,and medicaid pays their copayments and deductibles,which generally prevents bad debt with respect to medicaid beneficiaries.medicaid is a program that pays the cost of necessary medical expenses for individuals.individuals covered by both medicare and medicaid,or qualified medicare beneficiaries qmbs,include those who are enrolled in both programs,by virtue of their age or disability and their,and also those who are enrolled in medicare and have an income level not low enough to qualify for medicaid but low enough to make them unable to pay medicare and deductibles.p,a e i.medicare pays a qmb medical expenses,but state medicaid agencies are responsible for medicare,including paying a qmb and deductibles.p.
however,as permitted under federal law,michigan and missouri have placed caps on the medicare under their medicaid programs.the caps can result in reduced payments to hospitals for the services provided to qmbs.in the balanced budget act of,a,congress provided that 
a state is not required to provide any payment for any expenses incurred relating to payment for deductibles,coinsurance,or copayments for medicare to the extent that payment under medicare for the service would exceed the payment amount that otherwise would be made under the state medicaid plan for such service if provided to an eligible recipient other than a medicare beneficiary.
n.under this provision,if the medicare payment rate for the qmb treatment is above the rate that the state medicaid program pays for the same treatment,the state medicaid program pays no additional amount for or deductibles.if the medicare payment rate is below the medicaid rate,the state medicaid program pays only the additional amount necessary to provide the hospital with the medicaid rate amount.for example,if the provider charges for a service to the qmb and medicare pays,a remains.if the state medicaid rate for that service is,medicaid pays nothing and the provider is shortchanged if the qmb does not pay his.if the state medicaid rate for the service is,medicaid pays the difference between the medicaid and medicare rates,and the provider is shortchanged if the qmb does not pay his.the example is drawn from community hospital of monterey peninsula thompson,cir.in states with this payment cap,qmbs are not responsible for payments and the medicaid act prohibits hospitals from engaging in debt collection efforts against qmbs.n.
plaintiffs are all hospitals in michigan and missouri,alleging that the limits on bad debt reimbursement,when coupled with the medicaid cap,result in a loss for the hospitals that can only be covered through from funds.from through,each hospital filed a medicare cost report at the end of the fiscal year with a medicare fiscal intermediary,which pays providers for covered services on the secretary beh
