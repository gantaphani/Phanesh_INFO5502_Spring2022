background 
factual background 
marlar sued bwxt for allegedly defrauding the united states government and discharging her in retaliation for whistleblowing.her complaint alleges that bwxt operates the nuclear power facility in oak ridge,tennessee pursuant to a contract with the united states department of energy doe.the contract at issue in this case began november,and covered a operational period.the compensation paid to bwxt by doe had fixed elements as well as elements.each month,bwxt would report its performance to date to doe.bwxt would then receive partial,quarterly payments based upon its reports.at the end of the fiscal year,bwxt would submit a certified completion form regarding its performance as well as a,and doe would reconcile this with previous payments to determine whether any further compensation was due.if the contractual performance objectives were not met or only partially met,then doe had discretion to adjust bwxt compensation downward.
one contractual,element was bwxt reports from its environment,safety,and health division.the environment,safety,and health division was responsible for evaluating and reporting accidents,injuries,and illnesses.reportable instances included all new injuries that result ed in death days away from work restrictions on work transfer to another job medical treatment beyond first aid or loss of consciousness.at compl.medical treatment beyond first aid include d the administration of any prescription drug except those used for diagnostic purposes or of drugs at above normal dosages or strengths.at compl.bwxt received greater compensation for fewer reports of accidents,injuries,and illnesses.
these contractual,performance measurements regarding injuries and illnesses were consistent with bwxt other reporting duties.for instance,bwxt was required to complete standard osha forms to record covered injuries and illnesses.
marlar is a certified nurse practitioner who worked in bwxt occupational health services division ohs.ohs was a subdivision of bwxt environment,safety,and health division.marlar was employed by bwxt from april,until she was terminated on january.
marlar alleges that during her tenure at bwxt,the company engaged in systematic and significant underreporting of injuries and illnesses and time missed from work.bwxt allegedly underreported such incidents so as to inflate its compensation under the doe contract.bwxt,therefore,purportedly submitted false and fraudulent monthly reports,yearly completion forms and annual s.at compl.being given prescription drugs as a result of injuries,but the medical records of the employees did not include those prescriptions.marlar also alleges that in may of,an unidentified employee had received an injection of a prescription drug due to a head injury,and yet the injection was not noted in that employee medical records.marlar additionally provides other examples of purportedly improper reporting in and that generally fall into the category of failure to include receipt of a prescription drug in the unidentified medical records.marlar other allegations generally concern unidentified,employees improperly making medical judgments regarding an employee working condition so as to avoid reporting injures and illnesses.
after marlar informed her management of her concerns regarding these allegedly improper reporting practices,bwxt terminated marlar.marlar alleges that,throughout her time at bwxt,she continually objected to her superiors about the sorts of incidents related previously.when an open forum for employee grievances was held,marlar took the opportunity to again raise her objections to the allegedly improper reporting.marlar asserts that because she persisted in questioning bwxt reporting,she was placed on administrative leave on september.bwxt charged marlar with insubordination,a charge which marlar believes to be false.
on october,while on administrative leave,marlar wrote to dennis ruddy,bwxt president and general manager,regarding her placement on administrative leave.she told ruddy that she had learned that her computer had been cleaned out because she refused to participate in illegal activities at ohs.she stated that the illegal activities included the underreporting of occupational injuries and illnesses resulting in large incentive payments to bwxt under the contract.at compl.
marlar was eventually fired after writing to ruddy.first,an employee relations representative contacted marlar to gather additional information regarding the circumstances of marlar being put on administrative leave and her allegations of underreporting.at compl.marlar responded by writing a memo to the representative reiterating that there was of injuries and illnesses and detailing the events of the day marlar was placed on administrative leave,when the alleged insubordination occurred.at compl.marlar then received a letter,dated january,informing her that bwxt determined that her allegations of inappropriate activity within her department that would lead to a retaliatory discharge we re unfounded.at compl.the letter also informed marlar that she was terminated for insubordination.marlar,however,maintains that she was terminated because she br ought the underreporting of injuries and illnesses to the attention of her superiors including the senior management of bwxt.at compl.
ii.procedural background 
marlar filed this qui tam suit against bwxt on september.she alleged that bwxt had violated a by submitting false reports and certifications regarding injuries and illnesses,thereby increasing its,contractual compensation and defrauding doe.marlar also alleged that bwxt violated h when it terminated her in retaliation for activities she took regarding bwxt purported defrauding of the united states government.
bwxt filed a rule b motion to dismiss marlar complaint for failure to state a claim.it asserted that marlar failed to plead her allegations of fraud against doe with sufficient particularity,as required by rule b.it further contended that marlar failed to allege facts to sustain an action for retaliation under h.
the district court agreed with bwxt,and therefore dismissed marlar suit.the district court found that marlar claims of fraud were not pleaded with sufficient particularity.specifically,it found her complaint insufficiently particular because marlar did not identify any specific claims that were submitted to the united states,nor did she indicate the dates o n which those claims were presented.at dist.op.at.the district court also found that the complaint was too general and upon allegations made on information and belief.at dist.op.at.
the district court also found that marlar failed to adequately plead her retaliation claim,and therefore similarly dismissed that claim.the district court held that the complaint fail ed to properly allege the plaintiff employer knew that she was engaged in any protected activity.at dist.op.at.more specifically,the complaint contained no allegation s from which it could be inferred that bwxt knew that plaintiff was considering bringing a qui tam action herself or assisting the government in bringing an fca action.at dist.op.at.the district court therefore dismissed marlar complaint.
marlar argues on appeal that the district court incorrectly dismissed her complaint.she asserts that her allegations of fraud against bwxt met rule b because they were supported by sufficiently particular pleadings.marlar additionally asserts that she has pleaded sufficient facts so as to sustain her claim of retaliation.
we review dismissals pursuant to rule b de novo.yuhasz brush wellman,cir.a complaint is properly dismissed when it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.id.because we find that marlar failed to adequately plead fraud in violation of rule b,we hold that her cause of action for violation of a was properly dismissed.because we find,however,that marlar adequately pleaded the elements of a retaliation claim under,we reverse the district court judgment dismissing this claim and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
compliance of claims under with rule b 
federal rule of civil procedure b requires that parties alleging fraud must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.to satisfy rule b,a complaint of fraud,at a minimum,must allege the time,place,and content of the alleged misrepresentation on which the plaintiff relied the fraudulent scheme the fraudulent intent of the defendants and the injury resulting from the fraud.united states ex rel.bledsoe cmty.health,bledsoe i,cir quoting coffey foamex,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.courts must proceed to ensure compliance with rule b if the paragraphs of a relator complaint allege separate and unrelated fraudulent conduct.united states ex rel.bledsoe cmty.health bledsoe ii,cir.where a complaint alleges a complex and fraudulent scheme,then that scheme must be pleaded with particularity and the complaint must also provide examples of specific fraudulent conduct that are representative samples of the scheme.id.at emphasis removed.
there are multiple purposes for this heightened pleading requirement.claims of fraud raise a high risk of abusive litigation.see bell atlantic twombly,d see also bledsoe ii,at noting that rule b is meant to protect defendants from fishing expeditions and strike suits united states ex rel.atkins mcinteer,cir rule b ensures that the relator strong financial incentive to bring an fca possibility of recovering between fifteen and thirty percent of a treble damages not precipitate the filing of frivolous suits.rule b is also meant to protect defendants from spurious charges of immoral and fraudulent behavior.bledsoe ii,at quoting sanderson healthcare,cir accord united states ex rel.fowler caremark rx,cir greater precomplaint investigation is warranted in fraud cases because public charges of fraud can do great harm to the reputation of a business firm or other enterprise or individual.quoting ackerman nw.mut.life ins,cir citations omitted.lastly,rule b is intended to provide defendants with notice of the specific conduct with which they were charged,so that the defendants can prepare responsive pleadings.bledsoe ii,at.
the elements of an fca action must be pleaded with the particularity required by rule b.yuhasz,at.marlar alleged fca claims under a,a,and a.these subsections make liable 
a any person who knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government or a member of the armed forces of the united states a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval 
a any person who knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government and 
a any person who conspires to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid.
the claim all of the subsections refer to is any request or demand,whether under a contract or otherwise,for money or property which is made to a contractor,grantee,or other recipient if the united states government provides any portion of the money or property which is requested or demanded,or if the government will reimburse such request or demand.c.
claims under subsection a 
marlar has failed to comply with rule b for her claims under subsection a.we have previously held that an action under subsection a requires proof that the alleged false or fraudulent claim was presented to the government.see,united states ex rel.thacker allison engine,cir sanderson,at.marlar has not pleaded any facts regarding whether the alleged false claims were in fact submitted to the government.instead,marlar relies on the general allegation,o n information and belief,that bwxt submitted purported false claims to the government,and that doe paid bwxt a fee that was based in part of the purported false claims.we have held,however,that alleging that the defendants must have submitted fraudulent claims to the government does not satisfy a plaintiff duty to plead with particularity under rule b.see sanderson,at quoting united states ex rel.joshi luke,cir.instead,a plaintiff must identify the specific claims that were submitted to the united states,which marlar has failed to do.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.a plaintiff may not describe a n alleged fraudulent billing scheme in detail but then allege simply and without any stated reason for his belief that claims requesting illegal payments must have been submitted,were likely submitted or should have been submitted to the government.a plaintiff must provide some support for the allegation.united states ex rel.heater holy cross,d,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
marlar asserts that she has provided sufficient detail regarding the facts on which she has based her belief that the false claims were actually submitted to the government.she admits that she does not know what happened to the purportedly false reports after they left her division.she alleges,however,o n information and belief that the purportedly false reports were provided by the environment,safety,and health division to senior management.she then alleges o n information and belief that the certification forms provided by bwxt to doe were based on the purportedly false reports.
these allegations do not suffice.marlar does not allege personal knowledge of the procedures through which bwxt compiled its completion forms,or monthly reports that bwxt submitted to doe.marlar also fails to allege concrete facts,rather than inferences based o n information and belief,to establish that fraudulent claims were in fact,once compiled,submitted to the government.she has not provided dates on which the purportedly false certifications were submitted,nor has she alleged who submitted the purportedly false certifications,nor has she alleged any other specific information about the certifications allegedly submitted.see bledsoe ii,at.indeed,worse yet,she has even failed to plead with specificity the allegations of which she allegedly has personal knowledge she has not identified any of the patients whose medical records were allegedly incomplete,nor has she identified any of the,safety employees who were allegedly pressuring the medical employees to falsify medical records.
while we have before suggested that we may relax the pleading requirement when a relator demonstrates that he can not allege the specifics of actual false claims that in all likelihood exist,bledsoe ii,at,this case does not call upon us to establish such an exception.marlar does not allege a factual basis for her assertions that purportedly false records from ohs were used by environment,safety,and health division management to complete reports,that those false reports were then provided to bwxt senior management,that bwxt senior management then used those reports to complete its certification requirements necessary for compensation under bwxt contract with doe,and that bwxt then allegedly submitted those certifications to the government.
the weakness of these allegations,and their consequent unfitness for an exception t
