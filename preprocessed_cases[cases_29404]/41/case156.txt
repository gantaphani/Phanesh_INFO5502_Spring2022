the office of the chief medical examiner of massachusetts has had a troubled history.this lawsuit is brought by a disgruntled former contract medical examiner,abraham philip,against the administrator of that office,john cronin.
in november of the national association of medical examiners name conducted an audit and filed a report critical of the office of the chief medical examiner for massachusetts ocme.ocme had requested the audit.the report called ocme facilities woefully inadequate and detailed insufficient staffing,unacceptable delays,and other difficulties in the office.
in march of,john cronin was brought on as the chief administrator of ocme and charged with improving the office,including mending ocme public reputation.during cronin tenure,plaintiff abraham philip was employed as a medical examiner under a contract starting on september.that contract required philip to adhere to the highest ethical standards and serve as a role model for all other ocme employees.he had worked for the agency in the past.
cronin terminated philip contract on march.philip sued cronin in his personal capacity,claiming the termination was in retaliation for two letters criticizing ocme that philip had sent to the governor and therefore violated his first amendment rights.cronin denied that accusation and pointed to several troubling incidents during philip employment as the cause for the contract termination.
the case went to trial.after the close of plaintiff evidence,and on defendant motion,the trial judge entered a directed verdict for cronin.see.a.the judge did so essentially for the reasons and rationale set forth in defendant memorandum of law in support of his rule a motion.cronin,in his memorandum to the district court,had primarily argued that no reasonable fact finder could conclude that philip critical speech regarding ocme was the motivating factor in the termination of his employment,that philip employment would have been terminated regardless of his speech on a matter of public concern,and that cronin was entitled to qualified immunity of these rationales,we find the to sustain the trial court rule a judgment.
philip was,depending on one point of view,either a constant complainer or a constant seeker of improvement in the ocme.he freely used emails and memos to communicate his ideas to cronin.cronin did meet with philip at least twice in january,for a couple of hours each time,to discuss these suggestions.many of philip concerns had been highlighted in the name report from two years earlier.as to philip new ideas,cronin did follow up on some.
starting in february,there was a series of incidents which had later consequences.the first incident involved the contamination of a death certificate.on february,a funeral home brought a death certificate back to ocme because it had not been properly signed because the autopsy had been conducted by philip,cronin sent an administrative assistant,leslie ward,to obtain philip signature on the certificate.
philip,in the midst of another autopsy,did not want to be interrupted and essentially told leslie ward to tell the funeral home to wait an hour until he took a break.she relayed that message to cronin at cronin request,leslie ward supervisor,deirdre ward,went down to see philip,bearing the unsigned certificate and a request that he sign it.this time philip did sign it,but in doing so got blood on the certificate.philip testified that he placed the bloody certificate on a table to deal with later,but that the technician took it away while philip was finishing his autopsy.deirdre ward told cronin that philip had handed the bloodied certificate directly to her.deirdre ward brought the certificate to cronin and told him it had been dripping with blood when she received it.cronin told deirdre ward to place it into a sleeve,recognizing the bloody certificate to be a biohazard.cronin then explained what happened to richard evans,the chief medical examiner.according to cronin,evans was shocked and disgusted by philip unprofessional behavior.
cronin investigated and took statements from four employees involved in the incident,who confirmed the events outlined.philip autopsy assistant was not questioned about the incident.cronin then consulted his superiors at the executive office of public safety eops,eops undersecretary robert hass and eops chief of staff jane tewksbury.they discussed the written statements and the range of possible disciplinary actions.evans also provided his views.
in cronin view,the lack of signature on the original certificate was not directly philip fault,but philip response was inappropriate.philip had larger administrative and safety responsibilities,and the group decided some discipline was appropriate.the decision was made to suspend philip for one day to get his attention and make him realize that he need ed to be part of this recovery of this system that ocme was looking to build from a professional ground up.the suspension was brief in light of the staffing shortage at ocme.cronin superiors instructed cronin to convey that disciplinary decision to philip.
that same day,february,cronin met with philip to hear his version of events.this effort was unsuccessful.philip became agitated and left cronin office in anger,yelling at him.as philip left,cronin handed him a disciplinary action letter,dated february,that read 
please let this correspondence serve to notify you that as a result of your actions on friday february,at approximately pm,you are suspended without pay for one day.your suspension is to be served on thursday march.
the events,as described by four witnesses,reveal that you abruptly accepted a death certificate for your signature while you were performing an autopsy on a homicide victim.you then,without comment,handed the document back to deirdre ward with blood dripping from it.a copy of the soiled document is attached.
your actions exposed a to a potentially hazardous situation without any explanation.the document was also rendered destroyed thereby causing embarrassment and inconvenience to this office,the funeral home that transported the document,the burial agent that signed the original for burial of the decedent back in january,and the natick town hall clerk office.
please understand that your actions are very disturbing and are determined to be completely unacceptable.
any future occurrence of unprofessional or unacceptable behavior will result in immediate termination of your contracted services pursuant to the terms and conditions of the contract you have endorsed with this office.
at trial,philip acknowledged he knew he was on shaky ground in terms of his continued employment once he got this letter.philip view of the incident was that he should not have been asked to sign a certificate while he was in the midst of an autopsy,that he believed he was given no choice but to sign the certificate immediately,that the funeral home could have waited an hour for him to take a preplanned break,or that some other medical examiner could have been found to sign in his place.
cronin,on the other hand,testified that he had not viewed philip as a discipline problem before the bloody autopsy report,although philip had made a number of negative comments to cronin,derisively calling him a control freak and administrator.cronin explained that no one other than philip and evans could have signed the certificate that cronin was attempting to provide polite and quick service to the funeral home to help repair ocme negative bureaucratic reputation that deirdre ward was instructed to ask,not command,philip to sign the certificate and that neither deirdre ward nor leslie ward,to the best of cronin knowledge,violated standard operating procedures by entering the autopsy suite.
the next incident concerns emails about evidence from a child homicide prosecution,including the email.on february,jackie faherty,general counsel for ocme,informed philip that a court had issued an order requiring his notes relating to the death and autopsy of a child homicide victim be preserved.philip was working on a report for the case,but the charts were in faherty possession.on february,philip replied to f
