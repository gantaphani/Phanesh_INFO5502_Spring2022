misty atkinson and her minor daughter,angel dixon collectively,the plaintiffs,sued the city of crete,nebraska crete medical clinic crete municipal hospital crete area medical center and russell ebke collectively,the defendants under nebraska law alleging that the defendants were negligent in providing the prenatal,labor and delivery,and treatment associated with the birth of angel dixon on may.pursuant to and with the consent of the parties,the matter was tried before a magistrate judge who granted judgment in favor of the defendants.the plaintiffs appeal,and we affirm.
on december,misty atkinson learned that she was pregnant with angel.on december,ebke,a physician with training and experience in obstetrics and gynecology,examined atkinson and noted that she was fifteen years old,stood five feet tall,weighed pounds,and was roughly four months pregnant.after a physical examination,ebke concluded that atkinson pelvis was of adequate size and shape for a vaginal delivery.during this visit,atkinson admitted to ebke that she had smoked cigarettes,consumed alcohol,and used illegal drugs prior to her pregnancy,but she denied having engaged in any of this behavior after learning that she was pregnant.
over the course of her pregnancy,atkinson gained a significant amount of weight,which led ebke on april,to recommend bed rest for atkinson for the remainder of her pregnancy.tests conducted on april for hypertension were negative,and ebke scheduled atkinson for induction of labor to begin on may.
when she arrived at crete municipal hospital for the delivery,atkinson was briefed on the process.upon her admission,atkinson asked a member of the nursing staff about a cesarean delivery,remarking that she just want ed to get it over with because she was really nervous about the pain associated with a vaginal delivery.tr.at.after a consultation with ebke,during which he described his plan to conduct a trial induction of labor and to perform a cesarean only if the trial labor failed,atkinson agreed to the induction,which ebke commenced at on may.at,ebke checked atkinson progress noted that it was normal and ordered the administration of pitocin,a drug used to induce labor or enhance a labor pattern.atkinson testified that after the pitocin was administered,she again requested a cesarean delivery because of painful contractions.at,ebke heard a report from hospital staff regarding atkinson progress and ordered that the pitocin be discontinued overnight so atkinson could rest before the induction of labor was resumed the following day.
the next morning at,ebke conducted another vaginal exam of atkinson,noting that dilation had progressed to three centimeters and that effacement was at ninety percent.because atkinson labor was progressing normally,ebke proceeded to rupture atkinson uterine membranes,he broke her water,and he attached an electrode to angel scalp in order to monitor her heart rate throughout the remainder of the labor and delivery process.ebke the pitocin at on may,and he increased the pitocin dosage at atkinson testified that after her water was broken,her contractions worsened and she again requested that a cesarean delivery be performed.atkinson also testified that she requested an epidural,which was provided.
at,ebke was updated on atkinson progress,including that the fetal heart rate fhr was elevated ebke was not alarmed by the fhr,however,because other factors,including acceptable variability,indicated to him that the baby was not experiencing hypoxia.in addition,ebke was aware that atkinson continued to be fairly agitated and upset,which may have caused an increase in the fhr.at,the pitocin was temporarily discontinued to allow atkinson a brief respite from her contractions.a vaginal examination conducted by ebke at showed progress in dilation thereafter,pain medication was administered and the pitocin was restarted.at,atkinson was upset and crying,and she stated to one of the nurses,i ca do this anymore.tr.at.this comment was noted in atkinson chart,but there was no indication in the chart that atkinson had demanded a cesarean delivery in conjunction with the complaint.at,the fhr was still periodically reaching the.at noon,the pitocin was halted.
at,a member of the nursing staff reported to ebke that atkinson was exhibiting a dysfunctional labor pattern because the pitocin had been stopped and restarted a number of times.at,ebke reviewed the fhr himself and assessed the overall clinical situation,concluding that atkinson was experiencing a great deal of anxiety but that the fhr was reassuring and variability was acceptable.from until,the nursing staff noted seven out of eight periods with good variability,but they also noted questionable late decelerations in the fhr at and at because a brief,late deceleration may be caused by,among other factors,epidural placement,maternal movement or repositioning,or fluid shifts,neither ebke nor the nursing staff was concerned by these episodes.see tr.at.atkinson vaginal examinations during this period showed that dilation had progressed from five to six centimeters and that effacement had reached one hundred percent.at,ebke was notified that atkinson was resting more comfortably and that her contractions were approximately five minutes apart.ebke ordered that the pitocin be resumed at a low level.
from until delivery,atkinson chart showed positive variability and average to increased variability.the fhr increased from to between and during one period,but the elevation resolved.because variability remained positive,the nursing staff did not believe that the brief episode of fhr elevation warranted a call to ebke.from onward,atkinson had very good progression of labor.tr.at.
once the pushing phase of her labor began,atkinson protested,g et it out i ca handle it anymore.tr.at see also tr.at.the nursing staff,however,did not believe that atkinson complaint amounted to a request for a cesarean delivery.rather,the staff believed that atkinson was expressing the fear,anxiety,and pain frequently expressed during a typical vaginal delivery.
at about,ebke arrived in the delivery room after having been informed that atkinson was completely dilated.based on his opinion that atkinson labor pattern was acceptable and on his earlier physical examinations,ebke was not concerned about a condition called cephalopelvic disproportion cpd,where a baby head is too large to descend safely through the mother pelvis.by,atkinson had stopped pushing effectively so ebke determined that a vacuum extractor should be utilized to aid in completing the delivery.after angel head began crowning,ebke positioned the vacuum extractor on angel head.ebke then waited for a contraction and,with a single pull,delivered angel head.tr.at.meconium was observed on angel nose and mouth,which ebke removed by suction before continuing with the delivery.
at this point,ebke experienced some difficulty in delivering angel body,and he instructed the nurses to atkinson,thus allowing additional space in the birth canal to deliver angel shoulders.ebke delivered angel at on may,and she weighed six pounds,six ounces.immediately after her birth,angel had trouble breathing.because ebke had already removed visible meconium from angel mouth and nose,he used an instrument to examine angel airway below her vocal chords and remove any additional meconium she may have aspirated.the first insertion of the instrument yielded some meconium,but the second insertion was clean.as a precaution,ebke applied a device to push additional oxygen into angel lungs,but angel was stable and was breathing on her own.angel apgar score was three,while her apgar score was seven.angel was provided enriched oxygen and was transported to the nursery.because meconium was present below angel vocal chords and because she continued to experience periods of rapid breathing,ebke directed that angel be transferred to elizabeth hospital,which was equipped to provide more specialized care.
in the meantime,the nursing staff had prepared atkinson placenta for delivery to the laboratory.the staff noted that the placenta appeared abnormal,with an umbilical cord that was small in diameter.the medical records also noted that angel experienced trauma during the delivery.tr.at.this comment was based on angel large caput the overlapping of the baby skull bones caused by the forces of labor during a vaginal delivery.tr.at.while some swelling of the scalp and overlapping of the skull bones are normal for a baby of a mother,tr.at,a large caput is also consistent with cpd,tr.at.
on november,the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit,claiming that ebke was negligent by failing to consider or act on atkinson requests for a cesarean delivery,failing to recognize that fetal distress and maternal labor patterns indicated that a cesarean delivery was medically required,and performing a vacuum delivery rather than a cesarean delivery.in addition,the plaintiffs claimed that the other defendants,through their employees,breached the applicable standard of care by failing to identify the fetal distress and failing to notify ebke or the chain of command that a cesarean was medically necessary.
in support of their claims,the plaintiffs presented testimony from,among others,abraham scheer and michael cardwell.scheer,a pediatric and adult neurologist,analyzed angel medical records,reviewed a neurosurgical consultation report,and conducted a neonatal neurological examination of angel two days after her birth.testifying as angel treating physician and as an expert witness,scheer stated that angel face was bruised and swollen upon her admission to elizabeth and that her head circumference was normal.scheer recommended that angel remain in the neonatal unit nicu at elizabeth for continued observation.scheer testified that upon her admission to elizabeth,angel appeared to have aspirated meconium,suffered seizures,probably lost oxygen to her brain a condition called hypoxic encephalopathy,and sustained a head fracture that may have been the cause of her seizures.tr.at.scheer also noted that angel was not fixing and following and was very,very floppy.tr.at.he suggested these symptoms could be attributable to the head fracture,the medication,the hypoxic encephalopathy,or the meconium aspiration.tr.at.his review of the fhr monitoring strips led scheer to opine that over the course of labor and delivery,angel had suffered some oxygen deprivation as reflected by the periods of tachycardia in the monitoring strips.
scheer examined angel again on july.an mri revealed atrophy,or shrinkage,in the right hemisphere of angel brain,a condition scheer testified was consistent with hypoxia.another mri on april,indicated to scheer that the left hemisphere of angel brain was growing normally,while the right hemisphere continued to appear atrophied and exhibited hygromas,or areas.scheer concluded that angel had cerebral palsy.tr.at.
on june,scheer noted that angel was severely head circumference was abnormally small,typically signifying developmental difficulties and mental retardation.tr.at.scheer testified that microcephaly may be caused by,among other factors,genetic,anatomical,or metabolic problems hypoxia and maternal drug use.tr.at.scheer did not rule out a stroke or event as the cause of angel microcephaly.tr.at.on november,scheer confirmed that angel remained microcephalic and that the circumference of her head was significantly below normal.tr.at.
scheer testified that in his opinion,the suction from the vacuum extractor used to remove angel from the birth canal as well as the trauma and hypoxia angel experienced during the labor and delivery process caused her neurological condition.tr.at.he attributed angel neurological condition to the defendants negligence.scheer opined that had angel been delivered by cesarean,her head size would be normal as would her growth and development.tr.at.
cardwell,an and perinatology specialist,reviewed the medical records and the various depositions related to the labor and delivery treatment provided by the defendants.cardwell testified that atkinson had a protracted active phase of labor because she was slow to dilate,a factor that may signal cpd.tr.at.according to cardwell,the fhr monitoring strips recorded during atkinson labor began to show a pattern.specifically,cardwell interpreted the fhr monitoring strips as showing tachycardia and decreased variability at approximately on may,indicating that at that point ebke should have known a cesarean delivery was required.tr.at.cardwell testified that ebke violated the standard of care by failing to consider or act on atkinson request for a cesarean delivery failing to recognize that atkinson protracted active phase of labor,the slow descent of the baby through the birth canal,and the fhr all suggested that a cesarean delivery was medically indicated attempting a vacuum delivery instead of the medically indicated cesarean delivery and failing to call a pediatrician to attend to angel based on the fhr and the presence of meconium at delivery.tr.at.likewise,cardwell testified that the nursing staff and the hospital through its nursing staff had a duty to notify ebke about atkinson requests for a cesarean delivery and should have recognized that the protracted active labor and fhr were reasons to either insist that ebke perform a cesarean delivery or notify the chain of command that ebke refused to perform a cesarean delivery.tr.at.
to rebut the plaintiffs claims,the defendants presented the testimony of nurse martha graf,james elston,michael levine,john macdonald,and gerald bradley schaefer.nurse graf,a registered nurse certified in obstetric nursing,nursing,and fetal monitoring,reviewed the plaintiffs medical records and the deposition testimony of several witnesses.she opined that the nursing staff providing atkinson labor and delivery care satisfied the applicable standard of care.nurse graf testified that members of the nursing staff are responsible for monitoring a baby variability during the labor and delivery process.moderate variability indicates to the staff that the baby brain is,while minimal variability should alert nursing staff to a potential problem with oxygenation.tr.at.the nursing staff also monitors the fhr.according to nurse graf,acceleration occurs if the fhr exceeds for less than ten minutes,and it may be caused by maternal temperature,maternal or fetal activity,or stress to the mother or fetus.tr.at.tachycardia occurs if the fhr exceeds for longer than ten minutes,and it also may be caused by maternal factors.if the fhr reaches to,the nursing staff should be concerned about the baby condition.after reviewing the medical charts and the fhr monitoring strips,nurse graf testified that although there were periods when angel fhr was above,there was no reason for concern because the episodes were brief and could be explained by the total clinical,that atkinson was feverish or anxious during those periods.tr.at.likewise,the periods of deceleration were not alarming in atkinson case given the total clinical picture.tr.at.nurse graf testified that the assistance given to ebke by the nursing staff in placing and operating the vacuum extractor was within the applicable standard of care.tr.at.nurse graf s review of atkinson chart revealed that atkinson labor was shorter than average for a mother and would not have caused her any concern.tr.at.nurse graf also testified that in her clinical experience,mothers typically complain about their inability to continue with the labor process on account of pain,exhaustion,anxiety,and when the labor process has advanced almost to delivery.tr.at.the nursing staff is trained to offer the mother pain control,reassurance,and encouragement during this period of labor.tr.at.based on her review of the medical records,nurse graf found no evidence that the nursing staff should have suggested to ebke that a cesarean delivery was necessary or that the nursing staff should have invoked the chain of command.tr.at.
elston,an emeritus with training and experience in performing vaginal and cesarean deliveries,diagnosing cpd,and using vacuum extractors,testified that the fhr monitoring strips revealed variability and fhr over the course of the labor and delivery within normal limits that did not indicate any fetal jeopardy or problem.tr.at.elston explained that the fhr is affected by,for example,medications,maternal contractions,and maternal activity or inactivity.during some periods when angel fhr was elevated,atkinson heart rate was also elevated.tr.at.elston also concluded that angel did not suffer from hypoxia because the umbilical cord ph was normal,angel apgar score was normal,and angel did not experience the impairment typically associated with hypoxia.tr.at.in elston opinion,atkinson labor was not protracted because it was shorter than would be expected for a mother with an epidural.moreover,elston opined that ebke use of the vacuum extractor was appropriate given that atkinson was complaining of pain and exhaustion and angel was along the birth canal.tr.at.based on his review of the medical evidence and on his training and experience,elston ultimately concluded that ebke and the nursing staff met the applicable standards of care in treating the plaintiffs and that the defendants had no duty to perform a cesarean delivery in the circumstances.tr.at.
levine,a medicine specialist with training and experience in treating problem pregnancies and in interpreting fhr monitoring strips,also reviewed the medical records and depositions.levine analyzed the fhr monitoring strips and concluded that although periods of minimal,moderate,and marked variability were present,the majority of the monitoring strips showed moderate variability,which is preferred.tr.at.levine did not identify any portion of the monitoring strips that would indicate to him a cesarean delivery was necessary.tr.at.according to levine,the fhr monitoring strips,although exhibiting some periods of mild tachycardia and some problematic patterns,would not have caused him concern.levine testified that atkinson dilation proceeded normally given that the pitocin was started and stopped more than once.based on his assessment of the fhr,variability,and labor progression as measured by dilation and angel movement through the birth canal,levine opined that ebke and the nursing staff met applicable standards of care and at no time was a cesarean delivery necessary.tr.at.levine testified that ebke properly used the vacuum extractor based on atkinson complaints of exhaustion and the ineffectiveness of her pushing.tr.at.
macdonald,a pediatric neurologist,diagnoses,treats,and searches for the cause of neurological problems in his patients.macdonald reviewed the medical records including the prenatal and ongoing treatment records for angel,as well as reports and depositions of experts,treating physicians,and other witnesses.in macdonald opinion,angel neurological problems could not be attributed to the labor and delivery care provided by the defendants.tr.at.rather,macdonald testified that angel problems may have been caused by atkinson drug use during the first trimester of her pregnancy or by a viral infection contracted by atkinson and passed to angel just prior to angel birth.tr.at.macdonald testified that a number of viruses can cause damage to a fetus or exacerbate a disorder.tr.at.after reviewing a may,analysis of angel spinal fluid,macdonald testified that angel white blood cell count was.tr.at.according to macdonald,a normal white blood cell count for a newborn would have been to and a count above would have been a cause for concern.tr.at.a second analysis on may,showed a normal white blood cell count.tr.at.macdonald concluded from this evidence that angel had an infection of the nervous system.tr.at.macdonald also testified that seizures like those suffered by angel may be a sign of meningitis or encephalitis.tr.at.in addition,macdonald testified that angel may have inherited a blood coagulation disorder,which may have caused one event just prior to her birth and another such event in.tr.at.according to macdonald,a event could cause neurological symptoms that are limited to one side of the brain,as in angel case.tr.at.macdonald testified that the mri taken of angel brain when she was two months old is consistent with his conclusion.tr.at.in contrast,an injury due to hypoxia would affect blood flow to both sides of the brain.tr.at.in short,macdonald opined that the evidence of atkinson illness before labor and the analyses of angel spinal fluid suggested that a viral infection was either a major or contributing cause of angel neurological condition and that a disorder may also have contributed to a event causing angel injuries.tr.at.
schaefer,a professor of pediatrics who is certified in clinical genetics,pediatrics,and pediatric endocrinology,reviewed the medical records and testimony,conducted a medical examination of angel,and had blood samples from angel and atkinson analyzed.according to schaefer,angel neurological condition was not due to the labor and delivery treatment provided by the defendants,but to a combination of genetic and environmental factors including prenatal exposure to multiple teratogens,such as drugs,chemicals,or infections that can cause birth defects two specific genetic mutations and a family history of certain physiological problems,including a possible disorder.tr.at.schaefer considered particularly important atkinson earlier miscarriages,her disorder,the abnormality of the placenta,and studies showing that angel suffered a event around the time of her birth.tr.at.
following the bench trial,the magistrate judge ruled in favor of the defendants,finding that the plaintiffs failed to establish that they sustained any injuries due to a breach of the standard of care by the defendants.mem.order of,at mem.order.in reaching this conclusion,the magistrate judge credited the testimony of the defendants witnesses and expert witnesses about the nature and causes of angel injuries.id.
on appeal,the plaintiffs first argue that the magistrate judge erred when he entered judgment in favor of the defendants.br.of appellants at.although it is not altogether clear from their brief,the thrust of the plaintiffs first argument appears to be that the magistrate judge made a number of errors in his factual findings.findings of fact,whether based on testimony,documentary evidence,or inferences from other facts,will not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous.a anderson city of bessemer city,d.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states united states gypsum.if the factfinder account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,we will not reverse even if we would have viewed the evidence differently had we been sitting as the trier of fact.anderson,at.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.id.if a factual finding is supported by substantial evidence on the record,it is not clearly erroneous.robinson geico ins,cir.

the plaintiffs argue that the defendants breached the applicable standard of care by refusing to grant atkinson repeated requests for a cesarean delivery.the magistrate judge found,however,that after a consultation with ebke and the nursing staff,atkinson consented to the induction of labor and a vaginal delivery.her complaints to the nursing staff to just take it out because she c ould do this were uttered during particularly painful,periods of the labor and delivery process,and these comments could not reasonably be construed as requests for a cesarean delivery.nurses yank and graf testified that it is very common for women in labor to make remarks or demands like atkinson and that such statements do not compel a cesarean delivery in response.tr.at.moreover,the magistrate
