background 
exelon and local are parties to a cba.they have engaged in collective bargaining for over fifty years and have bargained over mandatory bargaining subjects such as working conditions and wages as well as permissive bargaining subjects such as retiree medical benefits that become effective upon a bargaining unit employee retirement.the terms of the retiree medical benefits have been memorialized in memoranda of agreement reached in collective bargaining moas which supplemented and became part of the cba.
in january,exelon made various unilateral changes to the retiree medical benefits.these changes immediately affected certain retirees and may also affect current employees when they retire.this led to a dispute between exelon and the union over the interpretation and application of the retiree medical benefit provisions.the union believes that the dispute is within the scope of the cba grievance procedure which states in part should any dispute or difference arise between the company and the union or its members as to the interpretation or application of any of the provisions of this agreement the dispute or difference shall be settled through the grievance procedure.if a dispute is not resolved at steps one through three,then at step four,at the request of a party to the grievance,the dispute shall be referred to arbitration.the grievance procedure states all decisions rendered by the impartial arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties.
on october,the union filed a grievance under step of the grievance procedure,alleging that exelon violated the cba and moas with respect to retiree medical plans,premiums,and prescription drug costs for active and retired employees.in the section entitled name of employee s,the union wrote,for the good of the union.the grievance proceeded through steps,and of the grievance procedure without resolution.on february,the grievance proceeded to step,when the union referred the grievance to arbitration.exelon participated in the selection of an arbitrator and hearing dates.however,exelon later argued that retirees are not part of the bargaining unit and exelon does not have an obligation to bargain with local with respect to current retirees.
exelon provides medical benefits to approximately retirees and their dependents.the union does not have the consent of all retirees affected by exelon changes to retiree medical benefits to represent them in arbitration of the dispute.seven retirees have consented to representation by the union in the grievance procedure,though not in writing.no affected retiree has filed an individual action against exelon over the changes to the retiree medical benefits.
on february,exelon filed a complaint for declaratory judgment,seeking a declaration that disputes over its decisions to modify retiree medical and prescription drug benefits are not subject to arbitration under the cba.the parties filed for summary judgment,raising two issues of arbitrability and an issue of the union standing.the district court granted the union motion for summary judgment and denied exelon motion.the court first decided that the dispute between the union and exelon over retiree medical benefits falls within the scope of the grievance procedure in the cba.second,it concluded that exelon had consented to arbitrate the underlying retiree medical benefit dispute.and,finally,the court concluded that the union could represent the retirees who consented to its representation consent of all affected retirees was not necessary for the union to pursue arbitration.
ii.analysis 
we review de novo the district court decisions on the for summary judgment.rickher home depot,cir.in this case we address whether exelon consented to arbitration of a dispute over retiree medical benefits brought by the union on behalf of retirees,and whether the union may arbitrate a dispute under the cba on behalf of affected retirees when it has the consent of a few but not all of the affected retirees before getting to the substantive issues presented on appeal,we must first assure ourselves that we have appellate jurisdiction.
appellate jurisdiction 
a question arose at oral argument of whether a final judgment had been entered by the district court,and we ordered the parties to file supplemental memoranda addressing the issue.the parties complied with the order,and we are satisfied that we may properly exercise appellate jurisdiction.

exelon filed a complaint for declaratory judgment,seeking a declaration that disputes over its decisions to modify retiree medical and prescription drug benefits are not subject to arbitration under the cba.the union filed an answer,and the parties filed for summary judgment.on december,the district court entered three documents on its docket.it entered its memorandum opinion and order in which it determined that plaintiffs were not entitled to the declaratory relief sought in their complaint and directed the clerk to enter judgment in favor of the defendant.the court also entered a minute order which said 
for the reasons set forth in the memorandum opinion and order,the court grants defendant motion for summary judgment and denies plaintiffs motion for summary judgment.defendant motion to compel discovery is terminated as moot.the clerk is directed to enter judgment in favor of the defendant.
and,finally,the clerk entered a document entitled judgment in a civil case,which read 
decision by court.this action came to trial or hearing before the court.the issues have been tried or heard and a decision has been rendered.
it is hereby ordered and adjudged that the court grants defendant motion for summary judgment and denies plaintiffs motion for summary judgment.judgment is entered in favor of the defendant.
although it would have been clearer had the judgment indicated that the plaintiffs would take nothing and that the case was dismissed,the failure to include this language does not render the judgment and unappealable.see mccaskill sci mgmt,cir.unlike american interinsurance occidental fire casualty,cir,in which both sides sought declaratory relief and thus the final judgment had to include a declaration of rights,here,only exelon sought a declaratory judgment.the union neither filed a counterclaim nor sought any declaration of the parties rights.and although the union filed its own motion for summary judgment,it merely sought a judgment against exelon on the complaint for declaratory relief.furthermore,the district court minute order,memorandum opinion and order,and judgment in a civil case together indicate that there is nothing left to be decided and that court is done with the case.the judgment itself is clear that the plaintiff exelon loses judgment is for the defendant local.therefore,the judgment is final and we have appellate jurisdiction.we thus move on to the merits of the appeal.
exelon consent to arbitrate disputes over retiree medical benefits 
exelon contends that it did not agree to arbitrate a grievance brought by the union on behalf of retirees.the district court concluded otherwise.the court reasoned that because the cba includes provisions that apply specifically to retirees,
when the cba says that disputes over its interpretation or application are subject to arbitration,that necessarily includes disputes over retiree rights that the cba confers.in short,by entering into a cba that included terms according rights to retirees as well as a broad obligation to engage in arbitration over disputes about the cba,exelon consented to arbitration of grievances brought on behalf of retirees.
the court also relied on the presumption of arbitrability,requiring an express provision or forceful evidence to exclude the retiree grievance from arbitration.we have said 
w here the contract contains an arbitration clause,there is a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that a n order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.

exelon argues that rossetto pabst brewing,cir,compels a different conclusion than that reached by the district court.the cba in rossetto provided for health benefits for retired employees and their dependents,id.at,and the cba arbitration provision provided for appeal to arbitration of all grievances between the company and its employees that that can not be satisfactorily settled by the grievance process.id.at emphasis added.pabst unilaterally eliminated retiree health benefits and the union filed a grievance on behalf of the affected retirees,alleging a breach of the cba.the union also filed a civil action on behalf of all the retirees,seeking reinstatement of the terminated benefits.the union eventually appealed the grievance to arbitration,and pabst refused to arbitrate.the district court certified a class consisting of all the retirees,their spouses,and dependents,who were represented by the union.the plaintiffs sought to compel arbitration of the union grievance,their motion was granted,and pabst appealed.id.we held that the union lacked standing to represent the retirees in arbitration unless the retirees consented to the union representation and pabst consented to bargain with the union as the agent of the affected retirees.id.at.
exelon is correct that the mere fact that a cba creates the retirees rights to medical benefits may be insufficient to establish that the company agreed to arbitrate disputes over retiree medical benefits.we know as much from rossetto.after all,the cba there provided for retiree health benefits,but this was insufficient by itself to support the conclusion that pabst agreed to arbitrate retiree claims.but there is a critical distinction between the cba in rossetto and the one in this case the cba in rossetto expressly defined an arbitrable grievance as one between pabst and an employee.and retirees are not employees.id.at.the cba here,however,does not define an arbitrable grievance as one between the company and an employee.nor does the cba in this case expressly restrict arbitration to grievances by employees.the arbitration agreement is broader than that.the grievance procedure applies to any dispute or difference between the company and the union or its members as to the interpretation or application of any of the provisions of this agreement exelon has agreed that a dispute exists between it and the union regarding the interpretation and application of the retiree medical benefit provisions of the moas,which are part of the cba.
exelon contends that the cba contains specific language plainly limiting the grievance procedure to disputes brought by the union on behalf of current employees.for example,exelon points to the following it is the intent of the company,local union,and the employees that timely filed grievances shall be settled promptly emphasis added the deadline for filing a grievance runs from the date that the employee became aware or reasonably should have become aware of the incident which is the basis for the grievance emphasis added and t he dispute or difference shall be presented and first discussed by the employee concerned and the immediate supervisor.emphasis added.none of these provisions,however,or any other provision in the cba we might add,expressly excludes from arbitration a grievance brought by the union on behalf of retirees.the parties could have written the cba to exclude retiree grievances from the arbitration agreement if they had intended to,but they did not.
exelon also points to the cba representation and recognition clause,which it claims demonstrates the parties intent that the grievance provisions apply only to current employees and not retirees.that clause recognizes the union as the exclusive bargaining representative for all employees in the bargaining unit.however,it does not follow from the fact that exelon recognizes the union as the exclusive bargaining representative for bargaining unit employees that exelon could never recognize the union as the representative of retirees in arbitration.the clause does not clearly limit exelon agreement to arbitrate to disputes involving only current employees.
any doubt about whether exelon agreed to arbitrate disputes brought on behalf of retirees is resolved by application of the presumption of arbitrability.a rbitration is favored and should be ordered unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.niro fearn int l,cir quoting united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf navigation,d.doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.warrior gulf navigation,at.the presumption of arbitrability is particularly applicable where the arbitration provision is broad.united steelworkers cooper tire rubber,cir.where the arbitration provision is broad,as it is here,only an express provision excluding a particular grievance from arbitration or the most forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitration can keep the claim from arbitration.at t,at.quoting warrior gulf,at.several of our sister circuits have applied the presumption of arbitrability to disputes involving retirees.united steelworkers of am.retirement income plan for employees of asarco,cir applying presumption of arbitrability where union sought arbitration and filed a complaint to compel arbitration cleveland illuminating util.workers union,cir t he presumption of arbitrability applies to disputes over retirees benefits if the parties have contracted for such benefits in their cba united steelworkers of,canron,cir applying presumption.but see anderson alpha portland,cir.
we will apply the presumption of arbitrability here as well.first of all,as noted,the arbitration provision is quite broad.the grievance and arbitration procedure covers any dispute as to the interpretation or application of any of the provisions of this agreement and the retiree medical benefits are created by provisions of the moas,which have supplemented and become part of the cba.and it was the union rather than the retirees that filed the grievance asserting a violation of the cba and moas with respect to retiree medical benefits.furthermore as exelon concedes,the dispute is between the union and exelon.and the union may resort to its economic also represents the bargaining unit interests in maintaining retiree medical benefits.these considerations counsel in favor of applying the presumption of arbitrability.see asarco,at cleveland illuminating,at.
