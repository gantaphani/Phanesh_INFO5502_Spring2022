nuvasive,owns patent,which describes and claims implants for spinal fusion surgery.medtronic,which settled with nuvasive and has withdrawn from the present appeals filed two petitions for inter partes review with the patent and trademark office,which the patent trial and appeal board instituted as and.the board ultimately cancelled all but one of the challenged claims under,finding in one reference,michelson patent,a spinal fusion implant that meets two of the claim requirements of the patent having a length both greater than mm and at least times its width.medtronic,nuvasive,wl ptab,board decision medtronic,nuvasive,wl ptab,board decision.
on appeal,nuvasive contends that it did not receive adequate notice of or opportunity to address that reading of michelson and its consequences for the overall obviousness analysis.we agree in part.in,medtronic petition put nuvasive on notice that medtronic was relying on particular portions of michelson to teach the patent claimed implants.in that proceeding,we see neither procedural nor other error in the board decision,and we therefore affirm.in,however,medtronic petition did not notify nuvasive of the assertions about the pertinent portions of michelson that later became critical.in that proceeding,we conclude,the board ultimate reliance on that material,together with its refusal to allow nuvasive to respond fully once that material was called out,violated nuvasive rights under the administrative procedure act.our affirmance in resolves the unpatentability of the patent claims,and,but claims and are at issue only in.we vacate the board decision and remand for further proceedings on claims and.
the spinal fusion implant of the patent is designed to be inserted between two vertebrae to replace a damaged or diseased intervertebral disc.patent,lines.the implant shares many features with implants,such as teeth to hold the implant in place,lines,vertical holes fusion apertures to allow bone to grow through the implant,lines,and horizontal holes visualization apertures so that a doctor can see such bone growth,lines.although the patent itself does not limit the methods of inserting the implant,its design is particularly suited to an approach from the side,through the psoas muscle,rather than from the front or back of the patient,lines.the focus of the obviousness issue now on appeal is certain dimensions of the claimed implant,specifically,a length that is both greater than mm and at least times the maximum width.the relevant part of claim,the only independent claim,reads 
a spinal fusion implant of construction positionable within an interbody space between a first vertebra and a second vertebra 
wherein said implant has a longitudinal length greater than mm extending from a proximal end of said proximal wall to a distal end of said distal wall 
wherein a central region of said implant includes portions of the first and second sidewalls positioned generally centrally between the proximal wall and the distal wall,at least a portion of the central region defining a maximum lateral width of said implant extending from said first sidewall to said second sidewall,wherein said longitudinal length is at least two and half sic times greater than said maximum lateral width

nuvasive asserted the patent against medtronic in warsaw orthopedic,nuvasive,cal.medtronic thereafter filed two separate petitions for inter partes review of the patent under 
medtronic petition in what became relied primarily on patent application publication published,frey,which teaches an implant whose length is at least times the width.as relevant here,medtronic argued that it would have been obvious to modify frey to have a length greater than mm,as taught by michelson.but in one brief passage,medtronic petition went further.in pointing out that michelson also teaches many of the limitations,medtronic stated that l ike frey,michelson discloses example lateral fusion implants having an elongated shape and dimensions that are longer than wide,citing michelson,line,through,line.that cited range includes a discussion of michelson figure,which shows an alternative embodiment similar to the spinal fusion implant,but which has a narrower width such that more than one spinal fusion implant may be combined in a modular fashion for insertion within the disc space d between the adjacent vertebrae.michelson,lines.
medtronic petition in what became relied primarily on the synthes vertebral brochure,synthes spine,and the telamon vertestack peek vertebral body spacer brochure and the accompanying telamon posterior impacted fusion devices guide jointly,telamon,which teach implants whose lengths are at least times their widths.medtronic argued that it would have been obvious to modify either or telamon to have lengths greater than mm,as taught by michelson.but in the petition,unlike the frey petition,medtronic did not include an assertion about or citation to material encompassing michelson figure.
in response to medtronic petitions,the board,exercising institution authority delegated by the pto director,determined that there was a reasonable likelihood that medtronic would establish,by a preponderance of the evidence,that claims,and would have been obvious over frey,in view of michelson.on that basis,the board instituted.the board made comparable determinations as to claims,and based on either or telamon,in view of michelson and patent application publication published,baccelli.on that basis,the board instituted.the two proceedings involve all the same claims apart from claims and,which are the subject of,but not.
when nuvasive filed its patent owner responses,it argued that no single reference taught an implant that was both longer than mm and had a length at least times its width.nuvasive pointed to michelson figures showing rectangular implant,showing a plurality of narrower implants lined up in the disc space,and showing another rectangular implant,as evidence that a person of ordinary skill reading michelson would size an implant to be both long and wide not long and narrow in order to maximize the surface area of contact with the vertebrae,as taught by michelson.nuvasive further argued that there was no reason for a person of skill in the art to combine the length of michelson with the ratio of the primary references,because doing so would make the resulting implant an unsuitable size for the intended insertion path of the primary references,which nuvasive contends were inserted from the front or back,not the side.
in its replies,medtronic pointed to michelson figure specifically and argued that it disclosed an implant whose length was greater than mm and at least times its width.
nuvasive objected to medtronic argument regarding michelson figure,which it contended was a new ground of invalidity asserted for the first time on reply.it requested leave to file motions to strike or,alternatively,surreplies,which the board denied.nuvasive also attempted to address the matter at oral argument,but the board refused to allow nuvasive to make substantive arguments in response.when medtronic made arguments relating to michelson figure in its rebuttal time,nuvasive objected again,but the board assured nuvasive that it understood nuvasive position and would consider the propriety of medtronic arguments when making a final decision.
the board ultimately held,in,that claims,and would have been obvious over frey and michelson,but it upheld claim.in,the board held that claims,and would have been obvious over either or telamon in view of baccelli and michelson,but it upheld claim.
the board decisions relied heavily on its findings that michelson,by itself,discloses both disputed dimensional limitations in a single implant one whose length is both greater than mm and at least times its width so that no combining of references was needed to arrive at an implant that meets both requirements.thus,in,the board never found that frey teaches an implant with a length at least times the width.rather,it found that if one combined michelson teaching that the preferred overall width of the implant was mm with michelson teaching that
