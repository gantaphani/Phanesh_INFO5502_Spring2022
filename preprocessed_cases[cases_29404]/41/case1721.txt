jeff blakeman applied for social security disability benefits in july,claiming a disability onset date of october.he suffers from a genetic heart condition that allegedly causes disabling fatigue,dizziness,shortness of breath,and arrhythmia.the administrative law judge alj held a hearing on december,and found blakeman not disabled.the appeals council denied review.blakeman filed this action for judicial review.the district court upheld the final agency decision.blakeman appeals raising a single substantial evidence on the administrative record as a whole supports the alj finding that blakeman subjective complaints of disabling fatigue due to his heart condition are not entirely credible.
fatigue is one of the subjective symptoms that must be considered when,as in this case,it is cited by a claimant as a cause of his disability and a medically determinable impairment could reasonably be expected to produce that symptom.b,b.our decision in polaski heckler,cir,established the factors an alj should consider when evaluating the credibility of subjective complaints.because questions of fact,including the credibility of a claimant subjective testimony,are primarily for the commissioner to decide,our review is limited to determining whether the alj considered all the evidence relevant to blakeman complaints of disabling fatigue and whether that evidence contradicted his account sufficiently that the alj could discount his testimony as not entirely credible.benskin bowen,cir.after careful review of the record,we affirm.
blakeman and members of his family suffer from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy,a hereditary heart condition also known as idiopathic hypertrophic stenosis or ihss.the administrative record includes a medical website description of the condition submitted by his treating cardiologist,kelly.the major abnormality is an excessive thickening of the heart muscles,which tends to restrict the amount of blood the heart can hold and eject with each contraction.the condition is usually apparent by the late teens and stable thereafter,although some persons experience worsening symptoms in later life.symptoms include shortness of breath,chest pain,palpitations,lightheadedness,and blackouts,symptoms which often have other causes.blakeman,for example,is obese and was a heavy smoker until he reduced his smoking to a few cigarettes per day in recent years.the effects of ihss vary greatly.those with severe symptoms face the risk of heart block and even sudden death.ihss is commonly treated with medications,a pacemaker implant,and in severe cases heart surgery.
after blakeman received a pacemaker implant in early,his doctor advised that he could return to normal activities.he returned to his sporadic work as a truck driver,maintenance worker,and carpenter,working as much as ten hours per day at these jobs after the alleged disability onset date,october.he did not report for recommended periodic checks of his pacemaker until september,when his brother died,possibly from a pacemaker malfunction.at that time,he told the doctor he did not have any particular problems.from july to october,he performed strenuous mobile home warranty repair work for his brother business.the alj noted that he stopped this work for reasons not related to his allegedly disabling impairments.
at a july disability examination,blakeman noted activity intolerance and complained of frequent episodes of feeling tired and having dizzy spells.the examining physician,paul johnson,opined that blakeman could sit or stand for up to hours a day for work,but he is not capable of any lifting or carrying activities because of the great risk of sudden death from his heart condition.johnson saw blakeman again in october when he complained of low back pain after working on his vehicle.johnson prescribed rest and medications,observing that blakeman was a h ealthy male in no acute distress.
in september,blakeman returned to complaining of extreme fatigue that increased with activity and episodes of dizziness,blurred vision,heart palpitations,and near.he reported that he is unable to maintain a job because of fatigue and other symptoms.the clinic prescribed medications and reprogrammed his pacemaker in november.in may,blakeman reported that his dizziness and palpitations improved after the pacemaker was reprogrammed and that he exercised a each morning.his pacemaker was at the end of its useful life.it was replaced with an aicd device because of his heart condition.the physician report described him as a w,obese,male currently in no apparent distress.when checked the aicd device in july,blakeman had no particular complaints.in november,when he reported episodes of dizziness at the end of the day,adjusted the aicd.in august,blakeman reported fatigue,dizzy spells with temporary loss of vision,shortness of breath,and trouble sleeping.prescribed medications and again adjusted the aicd.
in november,in response to a request from blakeman attorney,opined that blakeman heart condition limited him to episodes of less than fifteen minutes walking,fifteen minutes standing,and thirty minutes sitting.the letter did not state how many such episodes blakeman could tolerate in an day.that same month,larry vander woude performed a residual functional capacity assessment in connection with blakeman disability claim.vander woude opined that blakeman could occasionally lift twenty pounds,frequently lift ten pounds,stand or walk six hours in an workday with frequent breaks,and sit six hours in an workday.vander woude noted opinion that blakeman capacity for walking,standing,and sitting was more limited because of his heart condition.a third physician performed another residual functional capacity assessment in february,agreeing with vander woude as to blakeman capacity to walk,stand,and sit and opining there was no basis for more limited opinion.
in august,blakeman arrived a day early for an appointment with.he refused to reschedule the appointment,declaring that it was unnecessary because he had no problems and that he would come back in six months or a year.however,he visited in october complaining of dizziness,shortness of breath with orthopnea and dyspnea from walking feet to walmart.suspected his heart condition was the cause of these symptoms and reprogrammed his aicd pacemaker.
at the december hearing,blakeman testified that fatigue from his heart condition is the primary reason he feels he is disabled.he helps with household chores and grocery shopping,drives a car infrequently for short distances,reads and plays cards for hobbies,and attends church but not regularly.he naps one or two hours each afternoon,has dizzy spells most days,and is short of breath after walking twenty or thirty feet.
the other witness at the hearing was vocational expert william tysdal.the alj recognized that blakeman heart condition is a severe impairment and therefore a vocational expert was needed to help complete steps four and five of the evaluation process,the determination of whether blakeman has the residual functional capacity rfc to perform his past relevant work,and if not,whether the social security administration met its burden to show that blakeman has the rfc and the skills needed to perform other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy.see.
the alj asked tysdal whether jobs exist in significant numbers in the national or regional economies for a worker of blakeman age,education,and prior work experience who has the following rfc stand or walk for four hours and sit for at least four hours in an day if allowed to alternate between these positions lift and carry up to fifteen pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently never climb ladders or scaffolds occasionally climb stairs,balance,kneel,crouch,and crawl no concentrated exposure to extreme cold and no work in places that could damage a pacemaker.tysdal responded that this hypothetical worker could perform certain unskilled sedentary jobs such as food and beverage order clerk or operator.the alj then asked 
q.if we assume that this hypothetical worker needs to lie down during the day as you heard from blakeman testimony,would any of these jobs exist 
would any other jobs exist 
blakeman attorney then asked tysdal whether someone with the limitations set forth in november letter could perform jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy.tysdal responded by noting a significant ambiguity in that letter 
i f i can just kind of summarize what my feelings are about the limitations,minutes walking,minutes standing,which would be a total of minutes walking and standing,and then minutes sitting.if the individual could perform that throughout an workday,then the occupations i identified would be within these limits.
okay.and it unclear from the letter,to you,whether that what she saying or not 
well,if you add it up,it looks to me like and minutes walking and standing,minutes sitting it per episode.there no limitation per day.
on december,two days after the hearing,wrote another letter to blakeman attorney that is part of the administrative record.she opined that blakeman has multiple medical problems and his fatigue could very well be related to any one of these conditions.she then addressed the question of blakeman functional capabilities 
again,as stated in a letter dated november,blakeman is limited as to his ability to perform certain activities.especially of concern is his ability to perform any job in which he has to be available on a consistent basis for long periods of time.
he is able to walk for less than minutes per episode.in fact,at his last visit in october,he informed me he was unable to walk feet without having shortness of breath.
standing is limited to minutes per episode.sitting is limited to minutes per episode.
in his february,opinion,the alj credited opinions as the treating cardiologist but found that blakeman statements concerning his impairments and their impact on his ability to work are not entirely credible.the alj then found that blakeman has the residual functional capacity described in the hypothetical to vocational expert tysdal standing or walking four hours and sitting at least four hours in an work day consistent with johnson disability evaluation and a somewhat greater limitation than vander woude november rfc assessment,provided he is able to alternate between standing,walking,and sitting consistent with opinion.based on this functional capacity and the testimony of vocational expert tysdal,the alj found that blakeman could not perform his past relevant work but retains the capacity to perform other unskilled sedentary jobs such as order clerk or operator and is therefore not disabled.
on appeal,blakeman sole argument is that the alj wrongly found his subjective complaint of disabling fatigue not entirely credible.this attacks a subsidiary finding.the alj critical finding,based on medical opinions in the record,was that blakeman had the rfc to stand or walk for four hours and sit for at least four hours in an day,if allowed to alternate between these positions.vocational expert tysdal testified that,if blakeman has that rfc,jobs exist in significant numbers that he can perform.many workers suffer from fatigue but are able to work,just as many people suffer from chronic pain that is not disabling.the issue is not whether blakeman heart condition is fatiguing,it is whether his fatigue is disabling.as in moad massanari,cir,the alj found blakeman complaints of fatigue credible only to the extent consistent with the alj rfc findings.that must be our focus.
blakeman testified that he naps one or two hours each afternoon.the alj used this testimony to focus the fatigue inquiry in questioning the vocational expert.tysdal responded that there are no jobs available for someone whose rfc is limited by a need to lie down during the work day.the issue is not whether blakeman was credible in testifying that he naps each weekday afternoon he is not working.the issue is whether his heart condition compels him to nap each afternoon.
blakeman conceded at oral argument that it is very difficult to overcome the alj credibility finding for the period beginning with the october onset date and extending into given the strenuous work blakeman sporadically performed until october,johnson disability evaluation in july,and the medical reports showing that blakeman ihss condition was stable and being effectively controlled by medications and a pacemaker.however,blakeman argues,even if his complaints of disabling fatigue were not credible in those early years of the alleged disability period,the medical evidence of disabling fatigue beginning in august is extremely powerful and compels the conclusion that the alj credibility finding for this later period is not supported by substantial evidence.
as blakeman attorney recognized at the hearing,the medical evidence of disabling fatigue is based upon november letter,which opined that blakeman is only capable of walking less than minutes,standing minutes,and sitting minutes per episode.when asked whether someone with those limitations could perform jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy,tysdal responded yes,if the ambiguous reference to episode meant a cycle of alternating positions that could be repeated over the course of a work day.after the hearing,blakeman submitted a letter from that simply reiterated the limitations set forth in her november letter.in other words,after identifying at the hearing an ambiguity perceived by the vocational expert to be critical to the claim of disabling fatigue,blakeman submitted a letter from the physician that either did not clarify the ambiguity or confirmed the vocational expert interpretation that the limitation as to walking,standing,and sitting during a episode was consistent with blakeman being able to stand or walk a total of four hours and sit a total of at least four hours during an work day,provided he can alternate positions.
in his opinion,the alj made the rfc finding and then based his disability determination on tysdal testimony logically interpreting opinion as consistent with that rfc.there is other evidence in the record supporting the implicit finding that his ihss condition has not worsened in recent years to the point that it caused disabling fatigue in late and,such as advice in april that blakeman needed to become more physically active,blakeman refusal to reschedule an appointment with in june because it was unnecessary,and his continuing to smoke while complaining of shortness of breath.after careful review of the administrative record,we conclude that the alj finding discounting blakeman complaints of fatigue to the extent inconsistent with the finding of his rfc is supported by good reasons and substantial evidence.gonzales barnhart,cir.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
because the alj decision denying jeff blakeman benefits is not supported by the record,i would reverse the judgment of the district court and return with instructions to remand to the commissioner of the ssa for an award of benefits from august.
the majority asserts this court focus for review must be on the alj conclusion blakeman complaints of fatigue were credible only to the extent consistent with the alj rfc findings.ante at.however,this simply begs the question at issue in this appeal whether the alj credibility assessment,which formed the basis for his rfc finding is supported by substantial evidence.the alj first assessed the credibility of blakeman complaints of fatigue and dizziness.then,based on such determination,the alj made the rfc determination.of course,given this order of analysis,the complaints the alj found to be credible will be consistent with the rfc complaints are the sole basis for the rfc finding.the majority analysis does nothing but confirm what we already the alj discounted blakeman complaints of fatigue and,therefore,found he has the rfc to lift pounds occasionally and pounds frequently,stand walk for hours in an workday,and sit for hours in an workday what we have been asked to review,however,is whether the alj decision to discount blakeman complaints of fatigue and dizziness is substantially supported by evidence in the record my analysis leads to the conclusion the alj credibility assessment,and,therefore,it rfc finding,is not supported by substantial evidence in the record with respect to blakeman disability from august,going forward.
it is a principle that if there are any inconsistencies in the evidence as a whole,an alj is permitted to disbelieve a plaintiff subjective complaints.see,cruse bowen,cir conley bowen,cir polaski heckler,cir.in making this determination,the alj must list specific reasons for the finding on credibility,supported by the evidence in the case record.see.reg,wl at.in this case,each of the alj stated reasons for discounting blakeman testimony regarding his fatigue and dizziness is not supported by the record.
blakeman failure to take medication for fatigue 
the alj noted,despite his complaints of fatigue and dizziness,blakeman takes no medication for fatigue such as a shot.at.there is no evidence in the record that physicians use shots to treat fatigue resulting from ihss,nor is there evidence any physician treating blakeman had recommended he use shots to treat his symptoms of fatigue and dizziness.in addition,the record establishes blakeman had been receiving treatment to control and alleviate his fatigue and dizziness,along with his other symptoms.as explained in the record,ihss is a heart condition in which there is an excessive thickening of the heart muscle.the condition reduces the area where blood flows out of the heart and through the aortic valve the outflow tract,causing turbulent flow and sometimes obstruction to flow which results in the excessive speed and force of heart contractions.various drugs are used to treat the disease,such as beta blockers,which ease symptoms by slowing the heart pumping action,and calcium channel blockers,which ease symptoms by relaxing the heart and reducing the blood pressure in it.these drugs ease and control fatigue,dizziness,and other similar symptoms by treating the underlying cause of the excessive speed and force of his heart contractions.
the record shows,since august of,blakeman has been receiving treatment and taking medication for his fatigue by treating the underlying cause of the excessive speed and force of his heart contractions.in august of,in an effort to alleviate his symptoms of fatigue and dizziness,blakeman began taking cardizem to suppress episodes of abnormally fast hearth rhythms and accelerated blood flow across the outflow tract and aortic valve area of his heart.at.blakeman did not respond to the cardizem and,therefore,in january of,started blakeman on verapamil,a calcium antagonist which,like,reduces symptoms such as chest pain,breathlessness and palpitations and can cause excessive slowing of the heart rate and lower blood pressure.at.at the time of the hearing,blakeman was still taking verapamil.thus,the alj conclusion blakeman is not taking medication for his fatigue is not only unsupported by the record,it is contradicted by it.
blakeman ability to walk feet 
the alj discredited blakeman testimony about his limited ability to walk,finding,although blakeman testified he could not walk more than twenty to thirty feet and now has to use a cane,he made no such complaints or allegations to his physician but rather reported he was unable to walk feet without having shortness of breath,to which responded,lose weight and try to get more physically active.the alj incorrectly concluded blakeman testimony was contradicted by the record.
contrary to the alj conclusion,the record shows blakeman did complain to his doctors he could not walk more than twenty to thirty feet without a cane or something to lean against.blakeman complained to about an increase in fatigue with activity.id.at.he told her activities,such as walking,had been exacerbating his fatigue and dizziness.id.he noted,as an example,that walk ing from the parking lot into walmart would exacerbate his symptoms.id.blakeman also explained the severity of his symptoms varied from day to day.he indicated on some days he might be able to walk one block.id.in,blakeman indicated he was able to walk behind a cart at walmart,but could not ambulate very far if no cart was available for support.id.at.
moreover,blakeman testimony does not contradict his physician report he was unable to walk feet without having shortness of breath.id.at.blakeman testified at the hearing before the alj in feet,i would say i can walk or feet,but i started using a cane,and it seems like if i pace myself and go a lot slower,i can walk a little farther.id.at.if one is short of breath at twenty feet,they will assuredly be short of breath at feet.if anything,blakeman concession that he can walk farther than twenty feet if he moves slower and uses a cane shows he was being forthright and supports the veracity of both statements.
finally,the alj reliance on statement to blakeman to lose weight and try to get more physically active is wholly misplaced.statement was made in response to blakeman complaints about his back pain and there is nothing in the record showing ever responded in this manner when blakeman complained of fatigue or dizziness.
blakeman testimony about his extremely uneventful lifestyle 
with respect to blakeman testimony on what the alj characterized as his extremely uneventful lifestyle,the alj noted it was 
interesting that blakeman is able to lose some weight over the last few months given his testimony of such an extremely uneventful lifestyle,a description contrary to his treating physician recommendation to increase his physical activity,as well as in conflict with the claimant other reports including but not limited to such activities as working on his vehicle and dyspnea especially while shopping or trying to keep up with his children.
at.the medical records show blakeman recorded weight varied as follows in the months leading up to the hearing before the alj 
at most,the alj is referring to pound drop from april,to october,a weight loss over seven months.this is hardly remarkable.further,because one can lose weight by reducing caloric intake or limiting fat consumption without increased physical activity,blakeman weight loss does not contradict his testimony about his extreme fatigue and dizziness.in addition,i fail to see how statement blakeman needs to get more physically active contradicts blakeman testimony about his fatigue and dizziness and his limited ability to do physical activity.if anything,statement supports blakeman testimony.
the alj next found blakeman testimony about his extremely uneventful lifestyle was contradicted by evidence in the record showing blakeman had been working on his vehicle.specifically,on october,blakeman sought medical treatment for low back pain and the doctor noted,he was working on his vehicle and noted shortly afterwards he had tightness and back pain.at.this vague statement about one instance of activity in does not contradict blakeman testimony.as the alj noted,the record does not indicate what type of work was involved.according to the alj,activities of stooping or kneeling could be a possible assumption.id.at.even if this could be a possible assumption,other types of activities could just as likely be assumed.there is simply no way to know,with any degree of confidence,what type of activities were involved.further,i do not believe one isolated event of stooping or kneeling is inconsistent with blakeman claims of extreme fatigue and dizziness or inconsistent with his extremely uneventful lifestyle.blakeman has never claimed to be totally incapacitated.to the contrary,he claims his ability to engage in physical activity is limited by his fatigue and dizziness and that on some days he is able to engage in more strenuous activity than on others,depending on the severity of his fatigue and dizziness.stooping or kneeling for a limited period of time on one given day is hardly inconsistent with blakeman claims.
the alj also pointed to blakeman statements that he went shopping and tried to keep up with his children as evidence blakeman was lying about his fatigue and dizziness.see id.at.the record,however,does not support this conclusion.in may of,summarized blakeman symptoms as follows he does have some shortness of breath on exertion,some days worse than ot
