background 
stadium seating 
in the,stadium seating in movie theaters revolutionized the way americans viewed movies.rather than cramming seats together on a sloped floor,causing moviegoers to be at the mercy of a taller patron choosing the seat in front of them,the staggered elevation of stadium seating virtually suspend ed the moviegoer in front of the screen.along with the other major theater companies,amc constructed scores of theaters nationwide employing the new layout.promoting its theaters,amc invited the public to experience the difference.the department of justice claimed that one group could not the disabled.
the first iteration of theaters,initially constructed by amc in,posed a particular problem for patrons.these complexes offered a hybrid of traditional sloped floor seating closest to the screen and stadium seating accessible by stairs.moviegoers would enter the theater in the front,right under the screen.once entering,patrons would first have the option rarely,if ever,taken of sitting in the few rows of traditional seating closest to the screen.or if they preferred and were able,they could bypass these first rows and climb stairs to choose a seat within the section of the theater.the impossibility of the latter option relegated disabled patrons to the least desirable seats in the rows closest to the screen.
complaints from customers began immediately.the mother of a disabled viewer complained to amc that their seats in the second row made it impossible to see this movie at such a close range.a disabled missourian explained in more detail his experience while sitting in the limited wheelchair seating offered by amc 
my eagerness quickly turned to anger and then despair as i found myself in a brand new theater where,from a viewing and comfort standpoint,i was worse off than ever before.while your theater seats appear very comfortable and positioned to maximize the theater goer sic view of the screen,my wheelchair has a rigid frame and straight back.from my vantage point on the far right side of the second row from the screen i was forced to endure two hours of neck wrenching discomfort as i struggled to find a comfortable way to view the entire screen if not the least desirable location in the theater,the wheelchair area must be a close second.
amc apparently responded to customer complaints and began to modify its design for future theaters.later iterations of the multiplex permitted entry in the of the auditorium,allowing for wheelchair seating in the center of the cinema.by,amc offered full stadium seating for all patrons in its newly constructed theaters.nevertheless,the initial spurt of theater construction specked communities with theaters restricting wheelchair seating to the very front of the auditorium.
b.the ada and 
in response,the doj,along with numerous private plaintiffs,brought a series of nationwide suits against various theater companies alleging that the theaters violated title iii of the ada,by placing wheelchair seating in the front rows of their new stadium complexes.
title iii of the ada generally provides that n o individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations of any place of public accommodation a.to flesh out the details of this general rule,congress charged the attorney general with the task of promulgating regulations clarifying how public accommodations must meet these statutory obligations.b.these regulations were to be consistent with the minimum guidelines issued by the access board.c.individuals comprise the access board,thirteen appointed by the president,and twelve representing government departments or agencies.a.in january,the access board proposed accessibility guidelines and provided a notice and comment period to evaluate them.later that year,the access board issued its final ada accessibility guidelines.july.the attorney general adopted these guidelines as the standards for accessible design.pt,app.
section of the standards addresses wheelchair seating in assembly areas.it reads 
wheelchair areas shall be an integral part of any fixed seating plan and shall be provided so as to provide people with physical disabilities a choice of admission prices and lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public.they shall adjoin an accessible route that also serves as a means of egress in case of emergency.at least one companion fixed seat shall be provided next to each wheelchair seating area.when the seating capacity exceeds,wheelchair spaces shall be provided in more than one location.readily removable seats may be installed in wheelchair spaces when the spaces are not required to accommodate wheelchair users.
exception accessible viewing positions may be clustered for bleachers,balconies,and other areas having sight lines that require slopes of greater than percent.equivalent accessible viewing positions may be located on levels having accessible egress.
pt,app.a,some emphasis removed.because this regulation stadium seating in movie theaters by nearly four years,it did not expressly address whether lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public meant that wheelchair seating must provide a similar viewing angle for disabled patrons.it was not until that the access board publicly noted that the doj interpreted this provision to mandate placing wheelchair seating areas in the section that provide viewing angles that are equivalent to or better than the viewing angles provided by percent of the seats in the auditorium.in,the access board concluded that it is considering whether to include specific requirements in the final rule that are consistent with doj interpretation of to theaters.the board is also considering whether to provide additional guidance on determining whether lines of sight are comparable in assembly areas id.as of this date,the access board has failed to do so.
c.the litigation history of 
while lines of sight was a phrase long familiar to parties involved in the movie theater industry,its precise meaning shifted depending upon the particular context and who was using it.internal correspondence within the industry featured recognition that,at times,lines of sight meant viewing angle to the screen.at other times,the movie industry understood comparable lines of sight to require only unobstructed views of the screen.indeed,before the circuit,the government insisted that there was no uniformly understood construction of the language prior to the time it was picked up by the board and the department of justice.paralyzed veterans of am.arena.
because lines of sight comparable lacked a concrete meaning,and the access board and the doj failed to provide clear direction as to the precise meaning of,litigants turned to courts throughout the country to determine the regulation breadth.plagued by an opaque regulation and minimal legislative history,however,the various circuits did not reach a uniform understanding as to what exactly required of theater companies building complexes.
i.the unobstructed view interpretation 
the first circuits to parse did not contemplate the comparable viewing angles interpretation currently adopted by the government.rather,plaintiffs in the initial round of cases urged the courts to understand the provision as requiring that public accommodations provide disabled spectators only with an unobstructed view to a stage or screen.unlike the later advocated comparable viewing angles interpretation,the access board had anticipated the issue of unobstructed views.the access board had requested comment on whether full lines of sight over standing spectators should be required.after the comment period,however,the access board did not expressly address the issue of unobstructed views in the language of.
from the opening salvos of litigation,courts admitted their confusion as to what exactly lines of sight meant.in caruso music entm t,rev in part,cir,plaintiffs brought suit against a concert hall for failure to provide wheelchair bound patrons an unobstructed view to the stage.the district court,when asked to assess whether required this unobstructed view,expressed its frustration that the regulation,even when read in conjunction with secondary materials,suffers from a vagueness not cured by interpretive manuals or an enforcement history which would put meat on the bones of the concept of enhanced sight lines.id.at.absent further legislative direction,the district court could not read the language of to impose a requirement that disabled viewers enjoy an enhanced line of sight.
writing for the third circuit,alito agreed with the district court estimation that the lines of sight language is ambiguous.caruso music entertainment centre at waterfront,cir.the regulation ambiguity,in judge alito view,allowed for two conflicting understandings neither of which the government presently advocates of what mandates dispersal of seating for disabled viewers throughout the auditorium or vertically enhanced lines of sight allowing patrons to view the stage over standing audience members.after reviewing the notice and comment period for discussion on the unobstructed view theory,the third circuit affirmed the district court,concluding that does not reach the issue of sightlines over standing spectators.id.at.
this placed the third circuit slightly out of line with the circuit opinion in paralyzed veterans of america arena,which had affirmed the district court reading of to require that some wheelchair seating provide an unobstructed view over standing spectators at washington wizards and capitals games.at.while the circuits reached different conclusions as to exact requirements,the circuit and the third circuit did agree that the regulation was hardly a model of clarity.see id.at noting that when applied to the issue of standing spectators,the regulation is ambiguous.
ii.the viewing angle interpretation 
in,the government filed an amicus brief in the district court for the western district of texas that,for the first time,publicly advocated the litigation position it has taken in this case and others throughout the nation that requires movie theaters to provide wheelchair bound patrons with comparable viewing angles to the screen as nondisabled persons.lara cinemark usa,no,wl,at.august,rev,cir see also united states cinemark usa,cir accepting government representation that its lara amicus brief represented the first widely published document expressly announcing that required comparable viewing angles.the government explained that the regulatory language,as well as the overarching purpose of the ada,compelled an understanding of that included a comparable viewing angle requirement.this new theory,however,failed to produce a uniform interpretation among the circuit courts of appeal.ambiguity in still hamstrung the various courts in creating a coherent nationwide interpretation of the regulation.
the fifth circuit,the first appellate court to consider the viewing angle interpretation,rejected the theory as contrary to the use of similar language in other regulatory contexts.lara,at.rather,the court concluded that the regulation merely requires that the theater provide an unobstructed view of the screen.the fifth circuit did not reach this result without joining the third and circuits in criticizing the lack of transparency in the regulation the text of section provides little guidance as to whether theaters must provide moviegoers with comparable viewing angles.id.at.
in,our circuit accepted the viewing angle interpretation the fifth circuit had rejected,concluding that does require comparable viewing angles for disabled patrons.oregon paralyzed veterans,at.we did not reach this result,however,by analyzing the plain meaning of the regulation.rather,we carefully phrased the issue as one of proper deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulation 
the question here,then,is whether it is unreasonable for doj to interpret comparable lines of sight to encompass factors in addition to physical obstructions,such as viewing angle.the answer,in light of the plain meaning of the regulation both in general and as understood in the movie theater industry,is no.
id.at emphasis added.deferring to the doj interpretation,we held that required theaters to provide a viewing angle for wheelchair seating within the range of angles offered to the general public in the seats.id.at.
the sixth circuit joined our conclusion that required comparable viewing angles in united states cinemark usa,at.reviewing the regulation,the court concluded that the criteria for evaluating similarity,moreover,while not explicit in the regulation,doubtless include viewing angle.id.at.reading the regulation in any other manner would,in the sixth circuit estimation,eviscerate the ultimate goal of the statutory scheme to provide the disabled with equal enjoyment of public accommodations.id.moreover,as did we,the sixth circuit deferred to the doj interpretation of its own regulation.id.at.
while technically dicta,the sixth circuit did hint at its views regarding an eventual remedy.cinemark had presented evidence that it had relied upon state building codes previously certified by the federal government when constructing its multiplexes id.at.while the court rejected an estoppel argument on the basis of the permits,it reasoned 
cinemark reliance on tas and the government statements with respect to the state building code certification process weigh strongly in favor of making any relief that the district court grants the government on remand apply only on a prospective basis.we do not go so far as to hold that any relief must be prospective to comport with due process,but note that,given the following facts,prospective relief will often be most appropriate.
id.with these less than subtle instructions,the sixth circuit remanded the case to the district court.
the first circuit,after noting that s imilar cases have divided the circuits,joined us and the sixth circuit in concluding that mandates comparable viewing angles.united states hoyts cinemas,cir.nevertheless,the court also acknowledged that t here is no doubt that standard is vague as to whether it embraces angles,that the justice department has been slow in providing more precise guidance by regulation,and that the belated amicus brief in lara and the differing conclusions of the courts have impaired predictability.id.at.these factors seemed to militate,in the court view,against retroactive application of this requirement.id.at.
after the first circuit opinion,the tally of the different circuits opinions as to was as follows in the third circuit did not even require an unobstructed view in the circuit mandated that some seats had an unobstructed view in the fifth circuit the provision required an unobstructed view but not comparable viewing angles and in the first,sixth and ninth circuits mandated some sort of comparable viewing angle.three of the circuits considering the issue credited the doj interpretation,but two of those three expressed skepticism as to the possibility of retroactive relief.all circuits considering found common ground on the proposition that the regulation was vague or ambiguous.see also miller cal.speedway,cir agreeing that lines of sight in is subject to several interpretations,detailing the various interpretations,and ultimately concluding that the doj interpretation of its own regulation is reasonable and therefore entitled to substantial deference.
d.the proceedings against amc in the district court 
as the courts grappled with the ambiguous provision,and before we issued our opinion in oregon paralyzed veterans,the doj brought this action against amc for violating by failing to provide disabled patrons with comparable viewing angles 
granting the doj motion for summary judgment,the district court refused to interpret to be static and inflexible,rejected the fifth circuit interpretation in lara,and concluded that the provision imposed a comparable viewing angle requirement.the court review of industry literature and amc correspondence made it clear to the court that amc should have the meaning of lines of sight in the context of motion picture theaters referred not only to possible obstructions but also to viewing angles.
to address the infraction,the district court accepted a proposed remedial order crafted by the doj detailing how amc theaters,containing a total of auditoria,must be retrofitted to comply with.over amc objection,the district court did not exempt those theaters built before the date when amc claims it could have reasonably known of the comparable viewing angles requirement.in fact,those theaters built in require the most significant retrofitting,including installing ramps,removing and constructing new seats,whereas newer theaters,having been altered to respond to customer complaints,require less retrofitting.amc also argued that any theater located in the fifth circuit should be exempted from the remedial order because the fifth circuit had held that did not require comparable viewing angles.rejecting this argument,the district court held that its jurisdiction over all amc theaters allowed it to fashion relief regardless of circuit boundaries.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court injunction in this matter for an abuse of discretion or an erroneous application of legal principles.easyriders freedom hannigan,cir.a district court has considerable discretion in granting injunctive relief and in tailoring its injunctive relief.however,a trial court abuses its discretion by fashioning an injunction which is overly broad,mccain foods,cir.
b.the district court abused its discretion and violated amc due process rights by requiring retrofitting of all theaters regardless of their date of construction 
due process requires that the government provide citizens and other actors with sufficient notice as to what behavior complies with the law.liberty depends on no less b ecause we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct,we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited,so that he may act accordingly.grayned city of rockford,d.put more colloquially,t hose regulated by an administrative agency are entitled to know the rules by which the game will be played.prof l hunters ass faa,internal quotation marks omitted.amc claims it was not told the rules of building theaters until,at the earliest,the government published its view of in its lara amicus brief.we agree.
examining the conflicting decisions reached by various courts,see supra part,it is clear that the text of did not even provide our colleagues,armed with exceptional legal training in parsing statutory language,a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited let alone those of ordinary intelligence.grayned,at.the circuits are split as to whether mandates comparable viewing angles,an unobstructed view,or merely dispersed seating options.indeed,the government itself did not publicly endorse the viewing angle interpretation among these views until it filed a relatively obscure amicus brief in in the district court for the western district of texas.amid this morass of litigation,we decline to hold that a person of ordinary intelligence should have known,when initiating a construction project years prior to any public announcement from the relevant agency,that was susceptible only to the interpretation the government now champions.retroactive application of the viewing angle interpretation is appropriate only as of the date on which amc received constructive notice that the government viewed as incorporating a comparable viewing angles requirement and intended to enforce that requirement.see forbes napolitano,cir although only constructive rather than actual notice is required,individuals must be given a reasonable opportunity to discern whether their conduct is proscribed so they can choose whether or not to comply with the law.
we share the first circuit frustration that the government could have solved this problem,without time and litigation,by merely clarifying through amendment or some other form of public pronouncement the regulations were intended to provide guidance and it would have been child play for the drafters to make clear that the lines of sight requirement encompassed not only unobstructed views but also angles of sight.hoyts cinemas,at.the government has had ample opportunity throughout the era to update the regulation to respond to the overhaul of the nation.as late as,the access board indicated that it was still considering whether to include specific requirements in the final rule that are consistent with doj interpretation of to movie theaters.no new rule was forthcoming.again,in april of,the access board published a new proposed draft regulation that included a viewing angle requirement.see united states hoyts cinemas,d,vacated,cir.this proposal was never formally accepted.when regal cinemas sought certiorari from the supreme court to resolve the circuit split between the ninth and fifth circuits,the solicitor general of the united states represented to the supreme court that review was not necessary because the doj planned to issue new regulations to resolve the split there is no need for this court to exercise its certiorari jurisdiction to address an issue of regulatory interpretation that is presently being addressed directly by the relevant regulatory bodies themselves.brief for the united states as amicus curiae supporting respondents,regal cinemas,stewmon,d,wl,at.despite this representation to the court,made now over four years ago,has not been replaced with something more specific we decline to require amc to have determined the precise meaning of the regulation when the government did not do so.
the government counters that,regardless of any ambiguity in,full retroactive application is appropriate presently because it can point to internal correspondence within amc and throughout the movie industry at large suggesting that theater companies understood lines of sight to incorporate a viewing angle requirement we are skeptical that the meaning of a federal regulation can rest on the subjective interpretations of discrete,affected persons and their legal advisors.florida long,d.when presented with the same argument from the government,the first circuit reasoned persuasively nor is it a conclusive answer to argue,as the government does from public sources,that the theater industry has long regarded viewing angles as important in designing theaters and that this was certainly true in when standard was framed.whether or not viewing angles mattered to patrons,the defendants were entitled to provide the minimum that the law required of them.hoyts cinemas,at.in other words,the capacity of counsel or others to read correctly legislative does not alleviate the government from its obligation to fashion coherent regulations that put citizens of ordinary intelligence on notice as to what the law requires of them.
the due process clause guarantees individuals the right to fair notice of whether their conduct is prohibited by law.forbes napolitano,at.at no point before the filing of the lara amicus brief was amc on notice that the regulators understood to incorporate a comparable viewing angles requirement.the requirement of fair notice precludes the district court from requiring retrofitting of theaters built before the government announced its interpretation of.therefore,we remand this case to the district court to determine the specific can be no earlier than the date on which the government filed the lara amicus which amc could have fairly discerned the settled meaning of the,and to refashion the remedial order accordingly.
c.the district court abused its discretion in issuing a nationwide injunction that included the fifth circuit.
once a court has obtained personal jurisdiction over a defendant,the court has the power to enforce the terms of the injunction outside the territorial jurisdiction of the court,including issuing a nationwide injunction.see steele bulova watch.noting that the district court in exercising its equity powers may command persons properly before it to cease or perform acts outside its territorial jurisdiction united states oregon,cir when a district court has jurisdiction over all parties involved,it may enjoin commission of acts outside of its district.however,when exercising its equitable powers to issue an injunction,a court must be mindful of any effect its decision might have outside its jurisdiction.courts ordinarily should not award injunctive relief that would cause substantial interference with another court sovereignty.steele,at.
the parties do not dispute that amc owns and operates nearly stadium movie theaters scattered throughout eighteen different states,including theaters in the geographical area of the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit.here,the united states district court for the central district court of california imposed a nationwide injunction affecting movie theaters in the fifth circuit texas,despite amc objection.in lara,the fifth circuit reviewed the same authority that the district court reviewed here and the same authority that we reviewed in regal cinemas and most recently in miller california speedway,cir.after such review,the fifth circuit interpreted to require theaters to provide an unobstructed view for disabled spectators but not to require comparable viewing angles for wheelchair bound patrons.
in regal cinemas,we specifically rejected the fifth circuit holding in lara,and held that the fifth circuit reading of the regulation was too narrow.we then held that theaters in the ninth circuit must provide comparable viewing angles for disabled patrons.the district court applied our regal cinemas precedent issuing the injunction.the injunction essentially requires these texas theaters to be consistent with the central district of california understanding of the requirement imposed by,rather than the fifth circuit reading of the same provision.
based on this conflict,amc contends that principles of comity should constrain the district court from enjoining theaters within the fifth circuit to provide comparable viewing angles we agree.we also find that amc did not waive this argument when it complied with a district court order which it opposed and submitted proposed remedial orders for these theaters to assist in formulating the injunction.
this circuit has yet to address this specific comity issue.however,it goes without saying that we expect our pronouncements will be the final word within the ninth circuit geographical area,subject only to en banc or supreme court review.see parfums givenchy,drug emporium,cir.our federal judicial system requires that when the supreme court issues an opinion,its pronouncements become law of the land.see hart massanari,cir.similarly,when the ninth circuit or any of its coequal circuit courts issue an opinion,the pronouncements become the law of that geographical area.see zuniga united can,cir noting that district courts are bound by the law of their own circuit,and are not to resolve splits between circuits citations omitted.in instances where the circuits do not agree on the interpretation of a statute or a regulation,those disagreements should be resolved by the supreme court.
based upon this judicial hierarchy,we must be mindful of the decisions of our sister circuits,when we make decisions in cases affecting litigants legal rights and remedies in the geographic boundaries of their circuits.for example,in railway labor executives ass,cir,we held that a party was not collaterally estopped from relitigating the scope of a federal regulation due to the tenth circuit decision on the issue.we stated that t he courts do not require an agency of the united states to accept an adverse determination of the agency statutory construction by any of the circuit courts of appeals as binding on the agency for all similar cases throughout the united states.id.at.we did note,however,that the review would have limited geographic impact i t is standard practice for an agency to litigate the same issue in more than one circuit and to seek to enforce the agency interpretation selectively on persons subject to the agency jurisdiction in those circuits where its interpretation has not been judicially repudiated.id.emphasis added.
we similarly considered the effect of an injunction that would impugn foreign law or be an interference with the sovereignty of another nation in ramirez feraud chili las palmas food,adopted and summarily aff,cir.there,we adopted as our own a district court decision enjoining american citizens from appropriating the trade name of an american corporation for use in mexico.see id.at.in las palmas,the plaintiff asserted a claim under the lanham act for infringement and unfair competition in use of plaintiff and trade name.id.at.in reviewing the issue of comity,the district court,determined that there w ould be no affront to mexican sovereignty or mexican law,plaintiff does not seek a determination that any act of a foreign sovereign is invalid,and plaintiff does not ask this court to negate something that has already been determined in adversary proceedings between parties at bar in a foreign forum.id.at.only after making these findings did the court conclude that comity would not prevent the exercise of the court jurisdictional power.id.
our sister circuits have similarly respected another circuit ability to disagree.for instance,in virginia society for human life,federal election commission,cir,the fourth circuit refused to issue a nationwide injunction of a federal election commission fec regulation that would prevent the fec from enforcing the regulation against any party anywhere in the united states.id.at.the fourth circuit reasoned the injunction also encroaches on the ability of other circuits to consider the constitutionality of the regulation.id.such a result conflicts with the principle that a federal court of appeal decision is only binding within its circuit.id.
likewise,in carson here johnny portable toilets,cir,johnny carson brought suit against a michigan corporation engaged in renting and selling portable toilets under the name here johnny.id.at.the sixth circuit held that carson state law right of publicity had been violated,and affirmed the nationwide injunction.id.the court held that where there are indications that other jurisdictions may hold as our court would hold and where there are no facts in the record to suggest that the party would encounter the contrary precedent,it would allow a nationwide injunction.id.the sixth circuit,in herman miller,palazzetti imports and exports,cir,applied the factors set forth in carson and held that the district court abused its discretion by extending the right of publicity to states that do not recognize that right.id.at.the court noted t he issuance of an injunction under state law prohibiting otherwise lawful conduct in another state raises serious concerns.thus,although a court may have jurisdiction to grant broad relief,an injunction protecting the right of publicity should ordinarily be limited to conduct in jurisdictions that provide protection comparable to the former state.id.quoting restatement third of unfair competition cmt.c emphasis omitted.
here,the district court injunction is not a reasonable extension of fifth circuit precedent.instead,the district court specifically requires conduct by amc in the fifth circuit geographic area that the fifth circuit rejected until the access board and the doj promulgated specific regulatory guidelines.therefore,not only does the fifth circuit not require such conduct,it specifically judicially repudiated these board requirements of the citizens of its circuit when considering the same arguments the district court now enforces in its injunction.see railway labor,at.a district court in the ninth circuit should not negate something that has already been determined in adversary proceedings before the united states court of appeals of the fifth circuit.see las palmas.at.the fifth circuit specifically rejected the lines of sight argument stating 
in light of the lack of any evidence that the access board intended section to impose a viewing angle requirement,the board recent statement that it had not yet decided whether to adopt the doj litigating position with respect to theaters,and the common meaning of lines of sight,we can not conclude that the phrase lines of sight comparable requires anything more than that theaters provide patrons with unobstructed views of the screen.to impose a viewing angle requirement at this juncture would require district courts to interpret the ada based upon the subjective and undoubtedly diverse preferences of disabled moviegoers.congress granted the doj,in conjunction with the access board,the authority to promulgate regulations under the ada in order to provide the owners and operators of places of public accommodation with clear guidelines for accommodating disabled patrons accordingly,in the absence of specific regulatory guidance,we must hold that section does not require movie theaters to provide disabled patrons with the same viewing angles available to the majority of patrons.
lara,at internal citations omitted.to this date and lara was decided in april,the access board and the department of justice have proposed no additional regulatory guidance.thus,the district court injunction is in direct conflict with the fifth circuit precedent,not a reasonable extension of it.
we find the reasoning set forth in railway labor,virginia,carson,herman miller,and las palmas instructive,and apply it here.principles of comity require that,once a sister circuit has spoken to an issue,that pronouncement is the law of that geographical area.courts in the ninth circuit should not grant relief that would cause substantial interference with the established judicial pronouncements of such sister circuits.to hold otherwise would create tension between circuits and would encourage forum shopping.thus,we hold the district court abused its discretion in issuing the nationwide injunction affecting the geographical area of the fifth circuit and,therefore,the actions of amc within that circuit 
iii.conclusion 
because the government failed to give amc fair notice as to the requirements of,until,at the earliest,the doj publication of its amicus brief in lara,due process requires that amc may not be held accountable for actions undertaken prior to the date on which it received fair notice.further,a majority of this panel holds that because the fifth circuit has endorsed a different interpretation of,principles of comity prevent the district court from fashioning a nationwide injunction that dictates amc conduct within the fifth circuit.we therefore vacate the district court remedial order and remand for a determination of the precise date on which amc received fair notice and modification of the remedial order consistent with due process and comity requirements.
reversed and remanded.
i respectfully dissent from part of the majority opinion in crafting a remedy that was no broader than necessary to address amc violations of,the district court did not abuse its discretion on the contrary,the district court properly followed the supreme court instruction that no conflict exists,for the purposes of comity analysis,where a person subject to regulation by two states can comply with the laws of both.hartford fire ins.california,d internal quotation marks omitted.disregarding the absence of a true conflict that implicates comity concerns,see id.at,the majority concludes that a nationwide injunction against amc would cause substantial interference with the sovereignty of the fifth circuit,and that consequently the district court abused its discretion in granting such relief.i can not agree.
i.the appropriate scope of injunctive relief 
it is that once a court has obtained personal jurisdiction over a defendant,that court has the power to command the defendant to perform acts outside the territorial jurisdiction of the court.see new jersey city of new york.the situs of the acts creating the nuisance,whether within or without the united states,is of no importance.plaintiff seeks a decree in personam to prevent them in the future.the court has jurisdiction.accord steele bulova watch.holding that an injunction may reach activities taking place in mexico leman hinge last.holding that a district court decree is binding throughout the united states.
we have often reiterated this principle.see,bresgal brock,cir t here is no bar against nationwide relief in federal district or circuit court when it is appropriate.united states oregon,cir holding that a district court may enjoin the commission of acts outside its district.just last year,we upheld a nationwide injunction setting aside certain forest service regulations that were manifestly contrary to the forest service decisionmaking and appeals reform act.earth island inst.ruthenbeck,cir.
likewise,district courts within our circuit commonly issue nationwide injunctions where the injunction is tailored to the violation of law that the court already injunction that is no broader but also no narrower than necessary to remedy the violations.california ex rel.lockyer dep t of,d,see also golden door,odisho,aff,cir,abrogated on other grounds by japan telecom,japan telecom am,cir plaintiff market area,and hence the sphere of its reputation,are nationwide.accordingly,it is entitled to nationwide protection against confusion and dilution.the scope of the injunction must therefore be nationwide.
ultimately,the appropriate scope of injunctive relief is guided by the rule that injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.califano yamasaki,d revisiting equitable principles in light of class action lawsuits.thus,principles of equity limit the scope of injunctions to the extent of the violation established,not by the geographical extent of the plaintiff class.id.our circuit assesses the appropriateness of the relief fashioned by referencing the test set by califano the primary concern must be that the relief granted is not more burdensome than necessary to redress the complaining parties.bresgal,at quoting califano,at.
consistent with these principles,we have held that a district court abuses its discretion when it enjoins activities beyond what is necessary to address the actual case before the court.see meinhold dep t of defense,cir.addressing the complaint of a lone navy serviceman who was discharged for stating he was gay,the district court had issued an injunction preventing the department of defense dod from discharging anyone based on sexual orientation and from maintaining files on the sexual orientation of servicemen in the absence of conduct affecting the military mission.id.at.applying califano,we found the injunction overbroad,reasoning this is not a class action,and meinhold sought only to have his discharge voided and to be reinstated beyond reinstatement,and not separating meinhold on that basis,dod should not be constrained from applying its regulations to meinhold and all other military personnel.id.at.accordingly,we vacated all aspects of the injunction addressing issues beyond meinhold reinstatement.id.
these principles are beyond any real dispute.moreover,it is clear that,following these principles,the district court appropriately tailored its injunction so that it was no more burdensome to amc than necessary to provide complete relief to the doj.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the majority apparently does not disagree.
ii.relevant comity concerns 
my disagreement with my colleagues arises from their view that because our circuit and the fifth circuit embrace distinct interpretations of,the nationwide injunction implicates principles of comity.the error in their analysis is that they focus on the wrong conflict.the critical issue is not that the ninth and fifth circuits have announced different interpretations of ninth requiring comparable viewing angles and the fifth merely an unobstructed view of the screen.rather,the issue is whether amc compliance with the nationwide injunction would require it to act in conflict with any law,obligation,or requirement in the fifth circuit or texas.it would not.
the fifth circuit certainly has every right to interpret law governing those states within its territory inconsistently with our view of the same law.however,i do not the majority does not the district court remedial order impairs the fifth circuit power to do so.specifically,nothing in a nationwide injunction against amc could possibly threaten the independence or sovereignty of the fifth circuit,and it is simply incorrect to assert,as the majority does,that the injunction requires conduct by amc in the fifth circuit geographic area that the fifth circuit rejected.under the injunction,as the district court noted in its summary judgment order,amc would not be faced with a choice between complying with this court orders and the fifth circuit orders.were the nationwide injunction to issue,the law in the fifth circuit would remain unchanged,and all persons in the fifth circuit would remain bound by its statement of the law.nor would amc remedial actions violate or undermine the fifth circuit interpretation of.in lara cinemark usa,cir,the fifth circuit held that,at a minimum,requires theaters to provide an unobstructed view for disabled spectators.see id.at.requiring amc to provide an even better viewing just unobstructed,but also not create a conflict,and it is clear that amc could remodel its theaters on its own initiative without violating the fifth circuit interpretation of 
in the international context,the supreme court has spoken clearly to what constitutes a cognizable comity conflict.hartford fire presented the question of whether comity permitted a district court to consider certain sherman act antitrust claims against a group of london reinsurers.at.regarding comity,the court framed the only substantial question as whether there is in fact a true conflict between domestic and foreign law.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the london reinsurers,joined by the british government as amicus curiae,argued that comity counseled against the district court exercise of jurisdiction,because the british parliament had established a comprehensive regulatory regime and the conduct alleged here was perfectly consistent with british law and policy.id.at.the court rejected this argument,stating that the fact that conduct is lawful in the state in which it took place will not,of itself,bar application of the united states antitrust laws,even where the foreign state has a strong policy to permit or encourage such conduct.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the court explained no conflict exists,for these purposes,where a person subject to regulation by two states can comply with the laws of both.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
hartford fire provides clear support for the district court issuance of a nationwide injunction against amc.since the amc defendants can not show that fifth circuit law requires them to act in some fashion prohibited by the law of the ninth circuit or that their compliance with the laws of both circuits is otherwise impossible,the district court remedial order does not create a conflict that implicates comity concerns.see also in re simon,cir confirming that general principles of international comity are limited to cases in which there is in fact a true conflict between domestic and foreign law internal quotation marks omitted.
iii.the majority can not cite a single case supporting its position 
though courts in our circuit and elsewhere frequently issue and approve nationwide injunctions,the majority fails to identify a single,relevant case that suggests the injunction against amc was an abuse of discretion.in fact,most of the cases the majority relies on actually support the conclusion that nationwide relief was appropriate here,while the others are strikingly inapposite.
bulova was a lanham act case in which the supreme court concluded a federal district court had jurisdiction to enjoin trademark infringement consummated in mexico by a resident.at.the supreme court first stated that it did not doubt the district court jurisdiction to award appropriate injunctive relief if warranted by the facts after trial,although the infringing conduct was permitted under mexican law.id.at.the court also noted that a mexican court had nullified a potentially conflicting registration of the counterfeit bulova trademark in mexico.id.concluding that there could be no interference with the sovereignty of another nation,the supreme court held that the district court in exercising its equity powers may command persons properly before it to cease or perform acts outside its territorial jurisdiction.id.

under bulova and las palmas,the district court was well within its discretion in issuing a nationwide injunction against amc.in fact,each of the specific factors the las palmas court considered supports the propriety of nationwide relief.first,just as the law of mexico did not require the las palmas defendants to exercise their counterfeit license,the law of the fifth circuit does not prevent amc from providing comparable viewing angles in its theaters,such that the nationwide injunction causes no affront to fifth circuit law.see see also bulova,at.finding no conflict which might impugn foreign law.moreover,surely no public policy of the fifth circuit requires that theater owners refrain from providing comparable viewing angles to disabled patrons,such that requiring amc to do so would affront the fifth circuit sovereignty.las palmas.at.second,the las palmas court emphasized that plaintiff does not see
