sisay mengistu and his wife,almaz abebe together petitioners,are natives and citizens of ethiopia who petition for review of a final order of the board of immigration appeals bia denying their application for asylum and withholding of removal.the bia adopted the decision of the immigration judge ij,who concluded that petitioners had not demonstrated a fear of persecution.petitioners argued that if the family were returned to ethiopia,their daughter would be subjected to female genital mutilation fgm and mengistu would be persecuted because of his political activities.we conclude that the ij determination concerning petitioners fgm argument is not supported by substantial evidence.fgm constitutes persecution sufficient to support an asylum claim.the record does not support the conclusion reached by the ij and adopted by the bia that the risk that petitioners daughter will be subjected to fgm is too small to establish a fear of persecution.substantial evidence does support the rejection of petitioners political persecution argument,however.based upon the fgm ground,we grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
on january,mengistu came to the united states on a student visa that required him to return to ethiopia upon expiration of the visa.abebe joined him on february.on july,petitioners filed an application for asylum while awaiting resolution of their application,petitioners had two children,a son,mikaeh,born in,and a daughter,amen,born in.both children are citizens.
nearly two and a half years after petitioners filed their request,the asylum office denied their application.the office concluded that petitioners were aliens who had overstayed their visas and referred them to an ij for further proceedings.before the ij,petitioners renewed their asylum application,arguing that if their family was required to return to ethiopia,their daughter,amen,would be subjected to fgm and that mengistu would be persecuted because of his actual and imputed political activities.the ij denied petitioners application on november.
in a per curiam opinion,the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision on july.petitioners petitioned for review of the bia decision,and on august,a panel of this court concluded,with one judge dissenting,that petitioners did not establish a fear of persecution based upon either their concern that their daughter would be subjected to fgm or mengistu political activities.on march,we granted petitioners request for rehearing en banc,vacating the prior decision of the panel.
ii.standard of review 
keeping in mind that when the bia adopts the decision of the ij,we review the ij decision as if it were that of the bia.hoque ashcroft,cir see also tchoukhrova gonzales,cir.we review the ij findings of fact for substantial evidence and will uphold these findings if they are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,cir quoting a.we review questions of law de novo.baballah ashcroft,cir.
iii.discussion 
female genital mutilation.exhaustion 
as a preliminary matter,the government argues that we do not have jurisdiction to consider petitioners fgm argument because petitioners did not exhaust this argument before the bia.in particular,the government contends that petitioners did not put the bia on notice that they were appealing the ij decision on the fgm ground.as the government points out,petitioners did not mention the fgm ground in their notice of appeal to the bia.furthermore,only one sentence in the brief that petitioners filed with the bia referred to this ground.this sentence,which was included in the document statement of facts,stated further,petitioners submitted written and testimonial evidence regarding their fear that their daughter,amen mengistu,born in the united states on may,would be subjected to female genital mutilation if petitioners are forced to return to ethiopia.no reference was made to petitioners concern that their daughter would be subjected to fgm within the argument section of the brief.instead,the argument focused solely on the political activities ground.
making clear that it had reviewed the entire record,however,the bia did not limit its decision to address only petitioners political activities argument for asylum.instead,the bia effectively addressed petitioners fgm argument and rejected it on substantive grounds.see ghassan ins,cir noting that the bia may consider an issue that has not been appealed by either party.in its opinion,the bia specifically stated that it adopt ed and affirm ed the thorough and decision of the immigration judge in this case,which correctly found that the petitioners had not adequately demonstrated their eligibility for either asylum or withholding of removal.while the bia did not provide a more extensive discussion to support its conclusions,the bia cited its decision in matter of burbano,bia,to signify that it had conducted an independent review of the record and had exercised its own discretion in determining that its conclusions were the same as those articulated by the ij.
our caselaw establishes that where the bia cites its decision in burbano and does not express disagreement with any part of the ij decision,the bia adopts the ij decision in its entirety see tchoukhrova,at.if the bia intends to constrict the scope of its opinion to apply to only one ground upon which the ij decision rested,the bia can and should specifically state that it is so limiting its opinion compare krotova gonzales,cir noting that the bia affirmed on one ground upon which the ij decision was based without considering the other issue raised by the petitioner see also singh ashcroft,cir same falaja gonzales,cir same.
on this occasion,the bia adopted the ij decision in full without saying that it limited the scope of its decision to petitioners political persecution argument.the ij decision discussed both the political persecution ground and the fgm ground and denied both on the merits.we interpret the bia express adoption and affirmance of what it described as the thorough and decision of the immigration judge to mean that it did the same.we take the bia at its word and do not assume that the board meant something other than what it said.
recognizing that the bia elected to consider both of petitioners grounds for asylum in this instance,we further note that the bia could have expressly declined to consider petitioners fgm argument based on a finding that the argument was procedurally defective.it did not the bia is presumably aware of its ability to decline to review an argument when a petitioner has not properly raised the argument on appeal to the bia.see ins,cir noting that the bia declined to consider an argument because the petitioner did not raise it on appeal.when the bia has ignored a procedural defect and elected to consider an issue on its substantive merits,we can not then decline to consider the issue based upon this procedural defect.fed.power comm texaco,d noting that a court can only uphold an agency decision on the same basis articulated in the order by the agency itself quoting burlington truck lines,united states,d.the bia express adoption of the ij decision which explicitly discussed the fgm ground is enough to convince us that the relevant policy concerns underlying the exhaustion an administrative agency should have a full opportunity to resolve a controversy or correct its own errors before judicial been satisfied here.sagermark ins,cir see also ins,cir.thus,we conclude that petitioners fgm argument is not barred due to failure to exhaust it before the administrative agency.
substantive merits of the fgm argument 
eligibility for asylum is established when an alien demonstrates that he is unable or unwilling to return to the country of origin because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.melkonian ashcroft,cir quoting a a.an alien does not have to prove that it is more likely than not that he will actually be persecuted even a ten percent chance of persecution may be sufficient to establish eligibility for asylum based upon a fear of persecution.see ins,d.
it is that fgm constitutes persecution sufficient to warrant a grant of asylum.see in re kasinga,bia mohammed gonzales,cir toure ashcroft,cir balogun ashcroft,cir abay ashcroft,cir abankwah ins,cir.the government has not argued otherwise.
it is uncertain whether the ij used the correct standard in evaluating petitioners fgm argument.in explaining the standard used to determine whether a fear of persecution exists,the ij stated in his oral decision that a reasonable person may well fear persecution even where the likelihood is significantly less than clearly probable,however,there must be a reasonable possibility of actually suffering such persecution.the ij then concluded that fgm is not likely to be a threat to amen if her family is returned to ethiopia.the proper standard,however,is not whether the persecution feared is likely to be a threat.instead,as noted above,the supreme court held in that even an alien who can demonstrate only a ten percent chance of future persecution may prevail in a claim for asylum.whether that is what the ij meant by a reasonable possibility was not made clear.
substantial evidence in the record does not,in any event,support a finding that there was less than a ten percent chance that amen would be subjected to fgm in ethiopia.in his ruling,the ij mischaracterized petitioners testimony on this subject.the ij noted that 
mengistu testified that he has no family other than his elderly parents and his siblings and the state department material does indicate and the court does not believe that fgm would be forced upon his daughter without his and his wife consent.mengistu testimony that his wife would not be able to prevent such actions by her relatives was contradicted by abebe testimony.she testified that she would be able to prevent it but that her family would probably reject her if she did prevent it.
contrary to the ij findings,however,neither mengistu nor abebe actually testified that they would be able to prevent amen from being subjected to fgm.
mengistu testified that fgm is a ritual that almost practically all females have to undergo in ethiopia.he explained that while he and his wife both oppose the practice,i t not as easy as that.i mean there will be pressure from the society,from the grandparents.i mean it everybody is sic forced to go through that he further clarified that while he would try to prevent amen from being subjected to the ritual,if he were imprisoned or otherwise separated from his family after their return to ethiopia,abebe would be unable to prevent amen from being subjected to fgm.
abebe testified that fgm was performed on her when she was a child.she explained that she does not believe in fgm and does not want her daughter to be subjected to the procedure.she stated,however,that she would be rejected by her family,her husband family,and her society if she opposed the ritual.
documentary evidence in the record supported petitioners contention that they had an objectively reasonable fear that amen would be subjected to fgm if the family were returned to ethiopia.one report indicated that as of,of women in ethiopia were subjected to fgm another report substantiated petitioners argument that the ethnic group to which their families belong,the amharas,regularly practiced fgm.the state department ethiopia country report on human rights practices for,at,stated that a lmost all girls in ethiopia undergo some form of female genital mutilation clitorectomies are typically performed days after birth,and the excision of the labia and infibulation,the most extreme and dangerous form of fgm,can occur any time between the age of and the onset of puberty.
the state department report for,at,indicated that m ost ethiopian females have undergone some form of genital mutilation.this report also advised that the practice varies widely and in degree depending on ethnicity and urban rural status most urban women under the age of are unlikely to be mutilated.reportedly,women are able to prevent their daughters from being subjected to circumsion sic by relatives.these statements alone,however,should not have been sufficient to persuade a reasonable factfinder that there was less than a ten percent chance that amen would be forcibly subjected to fgm if the family were returned to ethiopia.
instead,the evidence indicated that the probability that amen would have to undergo this ritual greatly exceeded the threshold required to establish eligibility for asylum.thus,since the ij conclusion regarding petitioners fgm argument was not based on substantial evidence,we vacate this portion of the ij decision.see knezevic ashcroft,cir remanding to the bia because the denial of asylum was not based on substantial evidence.
we do not reach the issue of whether petitioners,parents of a citizen child likely to face persecution in her parents native country,may derivatively qualify for asylum.that was not a ground relied upon or even discussed by the ij or the bia in this case.we remand to give the bia the opportunity to address the matter in the first instance,as the supreme court has instructed.ins ventura,d 
political persecution argument 
petitioners also argued before the ij that they had a fear that mengistu would be persecuted based upon his actual and imputed political activities if the family were returned to ethiopia.after considering petitioners testimony and the documentary evidence in the record,the ij determined that petitioners had not demonstrated eligibility for asylum on this basis.the ij conclusion regarding petitioners political persecution argument was supported by substantial evidence.
to put petitioners political persecution argument into context,some background regarding ethiopia recent political history is necessary.from to,ethiopia was ruled by a dictatorial marxist regime,known as the derg,which was dominated by members of the amhara ethnic group,to which petitioners belong.in,the derg regime was by the ethiopian people revolutionary democratic front eprdf,a coalition of political parties predominately controlled by the tigrean ethnic group.since the overthrow of the derg,amharas have experienced open hostility and harassment from other ethnic groups.
in claiming that mengistu would be persecuted by the eprdf,petitioners essentially offered three arguments.first,petitioners asserted that it was likely that the eprdf would assume that mengistu was a supporter of the former derg regime because he is amhara and his parents were derg supporters.petitioners point out that after the derg regime was overthrown,mengistu parents were imprisoned for two weeks and were denied their civil rights,including the right to vote.
there is no evidence,however,concerning the location or conditions of his parents detention.nor is there any evidence that the eprdf would treat mengistu,who was not himself a derg supporter,more harshly than it treated his parents,who were active derg supporters.the ij concluded that the fact that his parents were only detained for two weeks suggested that mengistu,whose only connection to the derg organization was through his parents,would not be treated any more harshly and would therefore not be persecuted.the bia adopted that reasoning,and we can not say that the record compels a contrary finding.furthermore,mengistu has four siblings and seven,and with the exception of one sister,who was an active derg supporter,his siblings have remained in ethiopia largely without incident.
second,petitioners argued that it was possible that the government would assume that mengistu was a derg supporter because he received a scholarship to study abroad while the derg regime was in power.the record indicates,however,that after the eprdf came to power,mengistu passport was renewed so that he could remain abroad and continue to take advantage of the scholarship.there was no evidence that the new government wanted to prevent him from returning home,or that it was persecuting persons simply because they were returning from education paid for by scholarships awarded under the derg regime.
finally,petitioners argued that the eprdf would persecute mengistu because in mengistu joined medhin,a political organization that opposes the eprdf.some of medhin members viewed violence as an acceptable means to overthrow the eprdf,but mengistu testified that he did not believe in using violence to achieve the organization goals.as a medhin member,mengistu has attended meetings,helped recruit members,and attended a medhin conference in washington,
the fact that petitioner is a member of medhin,however,does not in and of itself demonstrate that he has a fear of persecution.evidence in the record indicates that the eprdf has not ordinarily targeted individuals who renounce violence.also,as the ij recognized,mengistu association with medhin was limited,and mengistu did not receive any threats arising from his membership in medhin.see singh ins,cir explaining that when there is no evidence of significant physical violence or specific threats of serious harm,we are unlikely to find persecution.thus,we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ij determination that petitioners failed to demonstrate that they have a fear that mengistu would be persecuted because of his actual or imputed political activities.
iv.conclusion 
while substantial evidence supports the ij determination concerning petitioners political persecution argument,the ij erred in concluding that petitioners failed to demonstrate a fear that their daughter will be subjected to fgm if the family is returned to ethiopia.consequently,we grant the petition,vacate the order of removal,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
petition for review granted remanded with instructions.
i respectfully dissent.the petitioners failed to adequately raise the female genital mutilation fgm issue in their appeal to the board of immigration appeals bia.it remains administratively unexhausted and i would dismiss the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see d zara ashcroft,cir holding that the f ailure to raise an issue in an appeal to the bia constitutes a failure to exhaust remedies with respect to that question and deprives this court of jurisdiction to hear the matter alteration in original quoting vargas united states dep t of imm,cir.by neglecting to raise the fgm issue in their counseled notice of appeal,or to challenge the decision of the immigration judge ij within their counseled brief to the bia,the petitioners did not put the bia on notice of their claim or give the agency a full opportunity to resolve the controversy or correct its own errors before judicial intervention.ladha ins,cir alteration in original quoting sagermark ins,cir.
the petitioners referred only to the ij decision denying asylum on grounds of political persecution in their notice of appeal to the bia.specifically,the petitioners argued that the ij decision was in error because t hrough their testimony and written evidence,petitioners met their burden of proving that mengistu had a fear of persecution due to his actual and imputed political opinion.they made no mention of fgm,their daughter fear of fgm,or the likelihood that their daughter would be ostracized for not undergoing fgm.nor did the petitioners alert the bia to the fact that they sought derivative asylum through their daughter,who allegedly fears persecution if forced to travel to her parents homeland.the petitioners have no direct claim to asylum based on fgm.since n otices of appeal are filed directly with the bia,and the regulations specifically contemplate that supporting briefs are not required to be filed by a party,the notice of appeal is of great importance in raising claims before the bia.ladha,at internal citations omitted.
a party who fails to raise an issue in the notice of appeal may still exhaust his administrative remedies by adequately addressing the issue within his brief to the bia.zhang ashcroft,cir per curiam holding that petitioner had exhausted his claim by explicitly mention ing in his brief to the bia that he was requesting reversal of the ij denial of relief under the convention against torture see also ladha,at finding exhaustion when the ij considered and rejected a claim and the party challenged this very aspect of the ij opinion within its brief before the bia.the petitioners failed to meet this standard as well.the notice of appeal says nothing about fgm.the only reference to fgm in the brief to the bia is a general,proclamation buried within the fact section this summary statement served only as a side note it did not provide notice to the bia that the petitioners sought to challenge the ij decision with regard to the possibility of fgm being forced by ethiopian culture upon the petitioners daughter.see zara,at dismissing the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because a general challenge to the ij decision is insufficient to satisfy the exhaustion requirement.
the absence of notice is further evidenced by the concluding remarks in their bia brief where,again with the assistance of their lawyer,they addressed only the ij decision on political asylum 
mengistu actual political beliefs and activities,as well as those that will be imputed to him because of his education abroad and his parents political activities on behalf of the derg,give rise to a well founded fear of persecution if he returns to ethiopia.by the same token,these factors establish a clear probability of persecution if he returns to ethiopia.
therefore,the immigration judge decision denying respondents applications for asylum and withholding was erroneous and should be reversed.
clearly,petitioners sought review only of the ij asylum decision as it pertained to the father on political persecution grounds.they raised no substantive argument as to the possibility of persecution of their daughter because of fgm,or their entitlement to derivative asylum as a result of this possibility,and,consequently,the bia did not have an opportunity to resolve the controversy or correct its own alleged errors.we can not intervene in the administrative process if the bia was not first given such an opportunity therefore,we do not have jurisdiction over the fgm claim.
the bia issuance of a burbano affirmance does not change this analysis or the necessary result.a burbano affirmance signals only that the bia has adopted the ij decision as it pertains to those issues adequately raised on appeal it does not equate to a blanket acceptance of the ij entire decision when only parts of that decision are appealed.see mabugat ins,cir reviewing the ij decision because the bia appear ed to have adopted or at least relied upon the immigration judge findings and conclusions to make its decision but dismissing the arguments that the petitioner failed to raise before the bia.in contrast,the majority opinion unjustifiably expands the scope of a burbano affirmance beyond the issues actually raised on appeal to all issues decided by the ij.the result can only be to encourage shifting theories on appeal when previously and properly presented issues are rejected.we have an entire body of immigration jurisprudence that requires issues to be fully and squarely presented below.see zara,at barron ashcroft,cir ins,cir per curiam mabugat,at vargas,at.
in matter of burbano,the bia emphasized that when reviewing the discretionary determination by an immigration judge,it rel ies upon its own independent judgment in deciding the ultimate disposition of the case,bia.however,this independent review does not preclude the bia from adopting or affirming a decision of the immigration judge,in whole or in part,when it is in agreement with the reasoning and result of that decision.id.at emphasis added.therefore,depending upon the issues raised on appeal,the bia may agree with the ij decision in its entirety,or it may agree with the ij decision only as to the issues relevant to deciding the appeal.
the flaw in the majority decision can be illustrated by the very case on which it relies,tchoukhrova gonzales,cir.in tchoukhrova,the ij determined that the petitioners had failed to establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution and,therefore,denied both the application for as
