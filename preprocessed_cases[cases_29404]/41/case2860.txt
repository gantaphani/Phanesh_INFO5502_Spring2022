brockton hospital petitions for review of a decision and order of the national labor relations board holding that the hospital violated a of the national labor relations act,a,by preventing the massachusetts nurses association the union from distributing literature to its members at entrances to the hospital,maintaining overbroad solicitation,distribution and confidentiality policies,and removing from the door of a nurse locker a notice announcing a union meeting.the board has for enforcement of its order and the union has intervened in support of the board.we deny the petition and grant the for enforcement except with respect to the alleged but uncharged unfair labor practice stemming from the removal of the meeting notice.
background 
the union has represented the registered nurses at brockton hospital,an acute care facility,for over years.in anticipation of the october,expiration of the union collective bargaining agreement with the hospital,the union began early in that year what it called a safe care campaign,part of which involved the distribution of literature to nurses in the bargaining unit.the literature,as described by the board,consisted largely of articles addressing the adverse effect on patients caused by downsizing and restructuring of nursing staff and the use of nonprofessional employees giving the care and treatment that used to be the sole province of nurses.brockton hosp.and.nurses ass n,at,wl.the hospital reasonably characterizes the literature as containing shocking and sensational headlines and focusing upon horror stories of patient death and injury due to allegedly unsafe care at hospitals other than brockton.
for ten consecutive thursdays beginning march,nurses distributed this literature to other nurses in the vestibule at the front entrance to the hospital,at the rear entrance,and at the entrance.the hospital stopped distribution in the vestibule on the first two occasions but thereafter allowed it while making clear its view that it could lawfully prohibit the practice.in august,a hospital supervisor removed from a nurse locker a notice of a union meeting,which notice had been posted without prior permission.
the union timely filed unfair labor practice charges concerning the hospital interference with the distribution of literature,as well as its policies limiting solicitation and distribution and delineating the nurses obligations with regard to confidentiality.the general counsel thereafter issued a complaint alleging that the hospital ban on distribution in the vestibule solicitation and distribution policies confidentiality policy and removal of the union notice each violated a of the act.the alj so held,brockton,at,and the board agreed,adopting as its own much of the alj reasoning,id.at.
ii.analysis 
the court reviews the board decision deferentially.we uphold its findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence,see united states testing nlrb,and abide its interpretation of the act if it is reasonable and consistent with controlling precedent,see local,int l of workers nlrb.
the hospital challenges all the board determinations that it violated a.that provision makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights,among others,to assist labor organizations and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.section necessarily encompasses the right effectively to communicate with one another regarding at the jobsite.beth israel hosp.nlrb,d.
a.the prohibition of distribution 
a hospital is presumptively allowed to prohibit the distribution of literature in any work area and to ban solicitation more narrowly in immediate areas.nlrb baptist,d.outside work areas a hospital may ban solicitation and distribution only as necessary to avoid disruption of operations or disturbance of patients.id.at.at.in this case the board determined that the hospital unlawfully prohibited employees from distributing union literature in the vestibule and at the other entrances because those areas are not work or immediate patient care areas and the hospital had not demonstrated that the prohibition was necessary to avoid disruption or disturbance.see brockton,at.the hospital attacks these conclusions on several grounds,none of which we find persuasive.
the hospital primary contention is that prohibiting distribution in the vestibule was necessary to avoid disturbing patients.the hospital first argues that the alj,whose opinion the board adopted on this point,failed altogether to address this issue.not quite.the alj decision could have been more precise,but we agree with the board that it is clear enough the alj was of the opinion the hospital had not shown a likelihood of patients being disturbed the alj acknowledged that the hospital expert witnesses had credibly testified that if patients or their families saw these articles they could become upset and anxious,but went on to find there was not a shred of evidence that any patient or family member saw any of this literature,the hospital received no complaints about the literature,and t here was no evidence that any patient was ever disturbed or inconvenienced by the distribution of this literature.id.at.
turning to the merits,the hospital argues that it presented evidence the prohibition was necessary,to wit,the disturbing nature of the literature the testimony of three doctors that if patients saw the literature they could experience stress and become distrustful the number of patients that use the vestibule to enter and exit the hospital and the testimony that literature which may have been distributed in the vestibule was left in various parts of the hospital.the hospital position is that it was not required to show actual disruption or disturbance,but only that the distribution may adversely affect patients,quoting baptist,at.at.finally,the hospital asserts the board failed to consider the availability of alternative means of communication,as required by baylor.med.ctr.nlrb.the board and the union argue that the board reasonably concluded the hospital failed to show a likelihood of disturbance.
the board and the union concede,and we agree,that the hospital had to show only a likelihood of,not actual,disruption or disturbance,see baptist,at.at but substantial evidence supports the board decision that the hospital did not meet even this standard.the hospital experts testified that if patients saw or heard about the content of the literature they would be upset,brockton,at the hospital presented no reason,however,to believe patients were likely to learn of the content of the literature.as the board points out,when the hospital stopped the nurses from distributing the literature in the vestibule,the nurses made clear that they intended to distribute it only to members of the union a practice approved by the supreme court in beth israel,at.at and so they did.as the board further notes,the hospital produced no evidence that any patient or patient family ever saw the literature,and there is no evidence of any complaint by a patient or a patient relative.in beth israel the court found the same lack of evidence regarding patients being disturbed e specially telling.id.at.at.furthermore,the board reasonably discounted the significance of the hospital evidence that some literature was found in the lobby and near the cafeteria because the lobby was frequently policed by the cleaning staff and there was no evidence any patient or family or visitors ever picked up and read or even saw the literature.brockton,at.
we also agree with the board that the hospital reliance upon baptist,at.at upholding solicitation ban in corridors and sitting rooms and baylor,at indicating that prohibition of solicitation in cafeteria during specified times may be lawful,is misplaced.in both cases,as the board points out,the hospital presented evidence that the prohibited activity was likely to disturb patients or to disrupt operations.baptist,at.at baylor,at.finally,although the availability of alternative means of communicating with employees is an impo
