by and through her mother,appeals the dismissal of various federal claims against willmar public schools,independent school district the district,several officials affiliated with the district and her former special education teacher lisa van der heiden.we affirm.
background 
when this action commenced,a special education student,attended fourth grade in the atwater public school district in atwater,minnesota.this action,however,concerns events that allegedly occurred while was enrolled at lincoln elementary school within the district in willmar,minnesota,where attended school from midway through kindergarten to midway through her third grade year.
was born in march and was tested for autism spectrum disorder asd in.although the testing ruled out asd,further testing revealed had a communications disorder and attentional and hyperactivity problems.ultimately,was designated as developmentally delayed with speech and language impairment.thus,during kindergarten at jefferson elementary,a school within the district,had an individualized education program iep geared toward addressing her special needs.the iep was created through the collaborative efforts of the local education agency,teachers,parents and behavioral service providers the iep team.iep included a behavior intervention plan bip,which authorized the use of restraint holds and seclusion when exhibited various target behaviors.after continued behavioral problems,the district and agreed should be assessed by tim ardoff,an outside evaluator from southern minnesota community support services.after the evaluation,the district transferred to lincoln elementary,another district school,in january.iep and bip were also revised to incorporate some of ardhoff suggestions.ardhoff did not specifically recommend the use of restraint holds or seclusion.over alleged objections,however,bip continued to authorize such procedures to address certain target behaviors.during later evaluations,ardhoff recommended against seclusion,and allegedly continued to object to the use of restraints and seclusion.throughout time at lincoln,however,the iep team continually adjusted her iep,and at all relevant times,the iep authorized controlled procedures.
while attending lincoln,worked with defendant lisa van der heiden,a special education teacher.van der heiden sometimes used the controlled procedures authorized in bip,and recorded the incidents in behavioral and communication logs she kept for her students.the complaint alleges that during time under her care,van der heiden used those techniques improperly and excessively and also mistreated for example,van der heiden allegedly made sit at a thinking desk and hold a physical posture for a specified time,or else face restraint or seclusion.van der heiden also allegedly yelled and shouted at,demeaned and belittled,once pulled hair when she would not hold a posture at the thinking desk and once denied use of the restroom,causing an accident.also reported to that van der heiden choke d her and that the restraints hurt her very much.
during third grade year the school year,a paraprofessional reported van der heiden to the minnesota department of education mde maltreatment of minors division for maltreatment of.this was the third such report made against van der heiden.learned of those allegations in august,and filed a complaint with the mde accountability and compliance division in september.ultimately,according to the complaint,the mde investigations concluded van der heiden violated a number of rights as a child with a disability and also maltreated by denying her access to the restroom.during the mde investigations,the district placed van der heiden on leave and conducted its own investigation into allegations that she mistreated two students,one of whom was on two previous occasions in and,the district had conducted similar investigations but found no misconduct by van der heiden.this time,the district found evidence that van der heiden denied access to the restroom but attributed the incident to a lapse in judgment.thus,van der heiden was never disciplined by the district for any maltreatment allegations without notice to,van der heiden returned to lincoln on october.she remained at lincoln until october,but was not at school the following week and had no further contact with 
thereafter repeatedly contacted defendant kathryn leedom,district superintendent,and asked to be notified if and when van der heiden returned to lincoln.on november,leedom wrote and informed her that leedom had no obligation to provide that information to subsequently withdrew her daughter from lincoln and enrolled her at john,a private school in atwater,minnesota,for the remainder of her third grade year.enrolled in the atwater public school district for the school year.
on october,by and through,requested an administrative hearing and filed a complaint with the mde,challenging the adequacy of the educational services provided by the district.relying on a line of cases beginning with thompson board of special school district,cir,the administrative law judge alj granted the district motion to dismiss the hearing request for lack of jurisdiction because was no longer enrolled in the district and had transferred to atwater without requesting a hearing against the district.
appealed that ruling to the district court and asserted various federal and state claims against the district,district board chairman michael carlson in his official capacity,and van der heiden,leedom,lincoln principal rebecca simenson and supervisor of special education programming susan smith,in both their individual and official capacities.as relevant to this appeal,asserted federal claims under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,section of the rehabilitation act and for violations of the fourth and fourteenth amendments.the district court concluded idea claim failed as a matter of law because she did not request a hearing on her claims against the district until after leaving the district.the court also dismissed remaining federal claims for failure to state a claim and declined to exercise jurisdiction over her state law claims this appeal follows 
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo the grant of a motion to dismiss,taking all facts alleged in the complaint as true.owen motors,cir quotation omitted.we bear in mind,however,that although a complaint need not include detailed factual allegations,a plaintiff obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions,and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.bell atl.twombly,internal quotations and alteration omitted.instead,the complaint must set forth enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.id.at.
idea claim 
we first address challenge to the dismissal of her idea claim against the district.as noted above,after transferring to the atwater public school system,requested an administrative hearing against the district,challenging the adequacy of the educational services provided by the district.like the alj,the district court concluded idea claim failed under thompson,because she did not request a hearing to challenge the education provided by the district until after leaving the district.contends that ruling was in error because recent changes to minnesota law have rendered thompson invalid.we disagree.
the idea seeks to ensure that all disabled children receive a free appropriate public education fape designed to meet their needs.d a.to that end,the idea provides federal money to state and local education agencies in order to assist them in educating handicapped children on the condition that the states and local agencies implement the substantive and procedural requirements of the act.indep.sch.dist,cir.substantively,for example,school districts must develop an iep for each disabled student.id.the idea also provides certain procedural safeguards to permit parental involvement in all matters concerning the child educational program and to allow parents to obtain administrative and judicial review of decisions they deem unsatisfactory or inappropriate.id.thus,a parent who is dissatisfied with certain aspects of a child special education may request an administrative due process hearing to resolve the matter,and the party aggrieved by the outcome of the hearing process may file suit in state or federal court.id.at.see also b,f i a.
when thompson was decided,the minnesota statute implementing the idea provided that such hearings shall be initiated and conducted by and in the school district responsible for assuring that an appropriate program is provided.at emphasis added quoting former,subd.e.and in thompson,we concluded that i f a student changes school districts and does not request a due process hearing,his or her right to challenge prior educational services is not preserved.id.at.rather,s ubsequent challenges to the student previous education become moot because the new school district is responsible for providing a due process hearing.id.accord,at smith special sch,cir.under the version of the statute applicable to this case,due process hearings are conducted by the state and must be held in the district responsible for ensuring that a fape is provided,subd.a emphasis added see also special sch.dist,cir,cert.denied.relying on thompson and the applicable statute,the district court concluded idea claim failed as a matter of law because the district was no longer responsible for providing with a fape when she requested the hearing.
on appeal,suggests thompson is no longer good law after the statutory amendment.specifically,because the state now conducts all hearings,suggests it is immaterial whether a student requests a due process hearing against a particular district before or after leaving that district.we disagree.as the thompson court recognized,the hearing process is in place to ensure that a disabled child educational needs are being met by the student school district.at.after all,t he purpose of requesting a due process hearing is to challenge an aspect of a child education and to put the school district on notice of a perceived problem.once the school district receives notice,it has the opportunity to address the alleged problem,at quoting thompson,at.and like the statute in effect at the time of thompson,the applicable statute reflects these too requires that any hearing be held in the district currently responsible for the student education.see former,subd.e requiring the hearing be held in the district responsible for assuring that an appropriate program is provided,subd.a requiring the hearing be held in the district responsible for ensuring that a fape is provided emphases added,however,did not request a due process hearing while the district was responsible for her education.rather,by the time requested a hearing against the district,atwater had already assumed responsibility for providing with an appropriate education geared toward addressing her specific needs including any arising from deficiencies in prior education.under these circumstances,we agree with the district court that idea claim fails but she may request a hearing against atwater if she believes her educational needs are not currently being met thompson,at.we note,however,that indicated in her brief that she has no complaints regarding her current educational situation.
also contends she should be allowed to proceed with her idea claim,notwithstanding her failure to request a hearing before leaving the district,because an immediate transfer was necessary for her physical and psychological safety.our case law suggests otherwise in,a student was verbally harassed and physically assaulted by his classmates after a district employee disclosed his mental health condition to school authorities.at.although his parents engaged in repeated discussions with school authorities and otherwise tried to remedy the intolerable situation he endured through informal means,they did not request a due process hearing until after removing their son from the delinquent district and we affirmed dismissal of idea claim under thompson.id.at.applying our prior precedents in this case,we are likewise bound to affirm dismissal of idea claim 
constitutional claims 
also challenges the dismissal of her claims for fourth and fourteenth amendment violations.as relevant to this appeal,asserted violations of her fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures and her fourteenth amendment right to substantive due process.the district court dismissed those claims as to the district after concluding the complaint failed to identify an unconstitutional district policy or custom that caused the alleged injuries.the court further concluded the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because failed to allege either a fourth amendment or a substantive due process violation.finding no error,we affirm.
individual appellees 
we first consider the allegations against the individual appellees van der heiden,leedom,smith and simenson qualified immunity protects individual state actors from liability under unless they violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.brockinton city of sherwood,cir.because we agree with the district court that failed to allege a violation of her constitutional rights,we conclude the individual appellees are entitled to dismissal on qualified immunity grounds.
fourth amendment 
turning first to fourth amendment claim,the complaint alleges,in essence,that van der heiden violated right to be free from unreasonable seizures by seizing,restraining,secluding and confining,and the other appellees failed to stop that conduct.the district court concluded failed to allege a fourth amendment violation because iep authorized the use of restraints and seclusion to manage her behavior and thus,even if such actions amounted to seizures,they were not constitutionally unreasonable.on appeal,contends that ruling was in error,because van der heiden used those methods excessively and punitively,over alleged objections and despite the fact ardhoff did not recommend the methods and also verbally and physically abused 
a litigant may state a fourth amendment violation by alleging facts which indicate a seizure occurred and that it was unreasonable.see mccoy city of monticello,cir.moreover,the fourth amendment protections extend to actions by public school officials.see,couture bd.of,cir shade city of farmington,cir.reasonableness is judged in light of the totality of the circumstances,however,mccoy,at,and c ontext is therefore critical to reasonableness analysis.couture,at.and in a school setting,t he fourth amendment reasonableness inquiry must account for the schools custodial and tutelary responsibility over the students entrusted to their care.shade,at quoting vernonia sch.dist.acton.
applying those principles here,we conclude the district court properly dismissed fourth amendment claim.we first consider allegations relating to the use of restraints and seclusion.assuming was seized within the meaning of the fourth amendment when van der heiden employed those methods,we agree with the district court that any such seizures were not unreasonable.we have held that an authorized professional treatment of a disabled person within the state care is reasonable if his or her actions are not a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment,practice,or standards.heidemann rother,cir.here,iep authorized the use of restraints and seclusion and we agree with the district court that the iep set the standard for accepted practice.and although contends she objected to the use of those methods,she did not request a hearing to challenge those methods while attended school in the district.because iep authorized such methods,van der heiden use of those and similar methods like the thinking desk,even if overzealous at times and not recommended by ardhoff,was not a substantial departure from accepted judgment,practice or standards and was not unreasonable in the constitutional sense indeed,as the tenth circuit recently observed,we would place educators in a very difficult position if we did not allow them to rely on a plan specifically approved by the student parents and which they are statutorily required to follow.couture,at.for these reasons,the district court correctly concluded van der heiden use of those procedures did not violate fourth amendment rights.
also contends the district court ignored her abuse allegations in concluding she failed to allege a fourth amendment violation,and suggests those allegations state a claim for excessive force.this circuit has generally analyzed claims alleging excessive force by public school officials under the rubric of substantive due process,however,and not the fourth amendment.see,doe gooden,cir noting that physical abuse by a teacher might amount to a constitutional violation if it was literally shocking to the conscience see also golden anders,cir wise pea ridge sch,cir accord gottlieb laurel highlands sch,cir concluding the momentary use of force by a teacher against a student does not effect a seizure of the student under the fourth amendment and collecting cases applying the fourteenth amendment shocks the conscience standard to claims alleging excessive force by public school officials quotation omitted.accordingly,we agree with the district court that failed to allege a fourth amendment violation,and the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.see brockinton,at.
fourteenth amendment 
we now turn to whether has adequately pleaded a substantive due process claim.to do so,must allege actions by a government official which violated one or more fundamental constitutional rights and were shocking to the contemporary conscience.flowers city of minneapolis,cir internal quotation omitted.this is a high standard,as 
s ubstantive due process is concerned with violations of personal rights so severe so disproportionate to the need presented,and so inspired by malice or sadism rather than a merely careless or unwise excess of zeal that it amounted to brutal and inhumane abuse of official power literally shocking to the conscience.
golden,at first alteration added quotation omitted.contends she has done so,pointing again to her allegations that van der heiden physically and verbally abused the disabled children in her care,and the other individual defendants failed to stop that conduct.
as the supreme court has recently reiterated,however,a pleading that offers merely labels and conclusions or naked assertion s devoid of further factual enhancement does not plausibly establish entitlement to relief under any theory.ashcroft iqbal,third alteration in original quoting twombly,at.judged against these standards,complaint does not state a viable substantive due process claim.some of the abuse allegations do not even identify as the victim of the alleged,the complaint simply asserts that on unspecified dates and under circumstances not described,van der heiden allegedly mistreated unidentified disabled children in a variety of ways.such vague allegations neither provide the appellees with fair notice of the nature of claims and the grounds upon which those claims rest nor plausibly establish entitlement to any relief.twombly,at,see also id.at disapproving of factual allegations which fail to mention times,places,or persons involved in the specified events,and noting that a defendant seeking to respond to such conclusory allegations would have little idea where to begin.and even those allegations that are specific to are little more than general assertions of harm,lacking elaboration as to the context of the alleged incidents or resulting injuries.t he scope of substantive due process is carefully circumscribed,flowers,at,and the pleading standard established by federal rule of civil procedure a demands more than an unadorned,accusation.iqbal.at.the vague allegations set forth in complaint do not plausibly state a claim for a violation of her substantive due process rights,and the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on this claim as well.brockinton,at 
the district 
also challenges the dismissal of her claims against the district.t he touchstone of the action against a government body is an allegation that official policy is responsible for a deprivation of rights protected by the constitution mcvay sisters of mercy health,cir alterations in original quoting monell dep t of soc.because has not alleged a violation of her constitutional rights,it follows that the district can not be liable under.see see also mccoy city of monticello,cir.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the dismissal of federal claims.may,of course,proceed with her state claims,which were dismissed without prejudice by the district court.
was a special education student at the lincoln elementary school in the willmar public schools from kindergarten through the third grade.she alleges that a special education teacher at the lincoln school abused her physically and emotionally during that time,and that the school district deprived her of the free appropriate public education to which she is entitled under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,b,f,i a.asserts that she left the lincoln school in november to avoid further abuse,and completed the third grade at a catholic school in atwater,minnesota.she enrolled in the atwater public school district for the fourth grade in the fall of.in october,filed a complaint with the minnesota department of education alleging that the willmar school district denied her a free appropriate public education under the idea while she attended lincoln.she sought compensatory education services to make up for the educational deprivations that she allegedly suffered.see miener ex rel.miener missouri,cir.
this court held in thompson ex rel.buckhanon board of the special school district,cir,that a minnesota student did not state a cause of action against a school district under the idea for failing to provide a free appropriate public education,because the student did not request a due process hearing under f until after he left the district and enrolled in another school.in this case,an administrative law judge for the state of minnesota dismissed claim under the idea based on thompson,because did not file her complaint until after she left willmar and enrolled in school at atwater.the district court dismissed claim under the idea on the same ground.
minnesota law has changed since thompson,and it now provides that a due process hearing must be conducted by the state rather than by the school district in which the student is enrolled,subd.under the present system,the state presumably has authority to order compensatory relief from a school district in which the student previously was enrolled.see,subp.a.to the extent that thompson rested on the lack of authority for a new school district to order relief from a former school district,that rationale likely has been superseded by statute and rule.
the court opinion correctly observes,however,that the rationale of thompson for denying the student claim against his former district was not so limited.rather,thompson also reasoned that t he purpose of requesting a due process hearing is to challenge an aspect of a child education and to put the school district on notice of a perceived problem.at.the court explained that o nce the school district receives notice,it has the opportunity to address the alleged problem.id.even though a hearing officer acting on behalf of the state of minnesota now may have authority to order a former school district to provide equitable relief,see,subp.a,the notice rationale of thompson still prevails.see ex rel.special sch.dist,cir.
argues that the notice requirement of thompson is created out of whole cloth,and that we should abandon it.it is true that the statute does not include an express requirement that a student provide notice to a school district,or request a due process hearing,as a precondition to obtaining equitable relief,except in the case of reimbursement for private school placement.see a c iii.other courts have recognized,however,that because equitable considerations are relevant to fashioning relief under the idea,see sch.comm.of burlington dep t of educ.of,the court
