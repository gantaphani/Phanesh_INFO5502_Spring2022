amax coal amax appeals from a grant of benefits by an administrative law judge alj under the black lung benefits act,et.blba,in favor of jack chubb.the benefits review board brb or board affirmed the alj decision on initial review and again on reconsideration.amax asserts the alj and brb erred on multiple grounds.it asserts that it was denied due process of law because of the delay in the litigation,that the alj decision is without substantial evidence,that the statutory presumption for date of onset violates the administrative procedure act apa and is thus invalid,and that the attorneys fees requested by chubb counsel are unreasonable.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
jack chubb worked as a coal miner for years.on august,he filed for black lung benefits under the blba.a district director awarded benefits and identified amax as the company liable to pay the benefits.amax sought a hearing.by the time of the hearing,chubb indicated through counsel that he had returned to coal mining on september,and wished to withdraw his claim.in april,the alj issued an order approving chubb request to withdraw and dismissing amax as a party.however,on a motion by the department of labor dol for reconsideration,amax was reinstated as a party.chubb requested a hearing on his entitlement to benefits between august,and august,if it was determined that he was not entitled to benefits from to,he would be required to reimburse the benefits he had received during that time period.
after experiencing episodes of shortness of breath and some chest pain,chubb retired from coal mining on september.amax contends that chubb left because of heart problems.
after multiple proceedings,the brb,in stated that the case was a morass of procedural errors.petitioner app.at.the brb determined that,because 
the procedural errors in this case go as far back as claimant motion to withdraw his claim,justice requires that we vacate this case in its entirety,and remand it to the administrative law judge with instructions to convene a new hearing.at the hearing,the administrative law judge should determine whether claimant wishes to pursue his previous request to withdraw his claim.
id.at.amax sought reconsideration,which was denied in.
on remand,in november,chubb decided to pursue his claim.in,the alj concluded that the,pulmonary function studies,and physicians opinions invoked the interim presumption of entitlement under three of the alternative methods.see a,the alj found that amax had not rebutted the presumption under the applicable rebuttal provisions.see b the alj found onset on april,and awarded benefits beginning april.
the brb affirmed as uncontested the alj finding of invocation,that is,that the claimant had invoked the interim presumption of entitlement,under a by establishing a totally disabling respiratory impairment as shown by pulmonary function tests see petitioner app.at.the brb nevertheless reviewed the alj other findings that claimant had invoked the interim presumption under a and a because they affected the alj findings on rebuttal.the board determined that the alj other invocation findings based on his weighing of the interpretations and medical opinions could not stand and,consequently,vacated the rebuttal findings on disability causation and the existence of pneumoconiosis.based on contentions of amax that the april onset date was arbitrary and contentions by chubb that the record did not establish a date of onset,the brb vacated the alj determination of an onset date.id.at.the brb advised the alj that where claimant was employed in coal mine employment subsequent to the filing of his claim,if the evidence of record does not establish a particular date of onset,the date of claimant last coal mine employment is the date for the commencement of benefits.id.at.
on remand,the alj again awarded benefits.as to the evidence,the alj explained 
i observe that a majority of the most highly qualified physicians,those who are both and board certified radiologists,found the presence of pneumoconiosis.pneumoconiosis is a progressive disease and since the film was taken,the positive readings among dually qualified physicians constitute a sizeable majority of the readings by physicians possessing the most impressive credentials.it is proper to credit the opinions of dually qualified physicians over and i do so here.i do not lend added weight to the november,negative readings based on recency,because of the majority findings.
id.at citations omitted.the alj also found the medical opinions established the presence of a totally disabling respiratory impairment under a.the alj accepted the medical opinions that diagnosed chubb as totally disabled by a respiratory impairment because lenyo is board certified in internal medicine and repeatedly examined and diagnosed chubb with respiratory disability due to pneumoconiosis the opinions of lenyo,combs and rader were all reasoned and documented and the opinions of deppe and jacobson were otherwise consistent with the opinions finding disability present.id.at.the alj afforded additional credence to these opinions because the pulmonary function studies supported the physicians conclusions.the alj discredited the opinions of tuteur,because tuteur did not believe that chubb had pneumoconiosis,and myers,because of the equivocal and vague expression of her conclusions.
the alj also determined that amax had not rebutted this evidence.although tuteur and myers had offered opinions in favor of rebuttal,the alj did not find their opinions to be sufficient to establish rebuttal in the face of five physicians who believe the contrary,one of whom is also board certified.id.at.additionally,the alj gave tuteur and myers less weight for the same reasons that he had stated earlier.id.the alj also dismissed reconsideration of the rebuttal evidence under b as unnecessary because the finding under a that the disease had been established by evidence precluded a finding of rebuttal premised on the absence of the disease.id.
the alj awarded benefits beginning september,the month in which chubb had retired from coal mining.the alj noted that the testimony of various physicians and other medical evidence had provided differing dates ranging from to.the alj did not find that any of these established a specific date of onset of when chubb first became totally disabled.while under the date of filing is the default date of onset when a specific date of onset is not established by the evidence,the alj explained that because chubb returned to work after the date of filing,
pursuant to a c and order of the board,i must find that the date of the claimant last coal mine employment is the date for the commencement of benefits,unless credited medical evidence establishes that claimant was not totally disabled at some point post retirement.i do not find credited medical evidence which establishes that the claimant was not totally disabled after his retirement.indeed,lenyo opined that the claimant was totally disabled prior to leaving coal mine employment.i must therefore use chubb last date of coal mine employment as the onset date.
petitioner app.at.the alj ordered benefits commencing on september,the month that chubb retired.
amax appealed and the brb affirmed.the brb noted that the alj had not merely relied on a head count of the testifying physicians,but had adequately explained his crediting and discrediting of the various physicians opinions.the brb also rejected amax arguments concerning any due process violation,noting that amax had been timely notified of the claim and had been an active participant in all of the proceedings.on reconsideration,the brb again affirmed.chubb died in.his wife,madge chubb,is pursuing his claim.
discussiona.standard of review 
although we review questions of law de novo,we accord the alj factual findings considerable deference.freeman united coal mining summers,cir.in fact,w e ask only whether the alj decision is rational,supported by substantial evidence,and in accordance with the law.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a rational mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.moreover,w e do not reweigh the evidence,resolve inconsistencies in the record,make credibility determinations,or substitute our inferences for those drawn below.id.
due process 
amax claims that the delay in this proceeding from the time of the filing to the order to start afresh was sufficient to deny it due process of law.it relies on the decisions of the fourth circuit in consolidation coal borda,cir,and lane hollow coal director,office of workers compensation programs,cir.
as the second circuit has noted,the borda and lane hollow decisions dealt with delay in the defendant receipt of notification that proceedings would be instigated,not delay in actually litigating the matter once both parties were on notice of the proceedings.new york state org.for women pataki,cir.in lane hollow,the dol failed to inform the coal company of the proceedings against it for seventeen years after it could have notified it and eleven years after it was required to notify it.lane hollow,at.similarly,in borda,the dol failed to process a miner claim when it was filed in.ten years later upon a resubmission by the miner,the dol informed the coal company of the resubmission,but did not mention any potential validity of a claim.the day before the hearing before the alj,the coal company was informed that the claim was still viable.indeed,the fourth circuit itself stated in betty b coal director,office of workers compensation programs,cir,that borda and lane hollow dealt with denial of due process rights when the defendants had not received timely notice of the proceeding.in contrast,amax received notice of,and participated in,all of the proceedings dealing with chubb claim since.
in our view,the decision of the third circuit in c k coal taylor,cir,provides more appropriate guidance in evaluating the present case.there,the dol delayed years in making its determination.yet the third circuit refused to transfer the responsibility from the coal company to the black lung trust fund because of the lack of significant prejudice to either party.it noted that the delay was inexcusable,but that the claimant had been receiving benefits from the trust fund and the coal company had been able to procure medical evidence before the death of the miner.id.at.the third circuit concluded,we see no prejudice other than that attendant on the failure to confirm the liability that had been asserted years earlier.id.at.additionally,the third circuit saw no reason to shift payment onto the trust fund,an innocent party that did not cause the delay,when there is an operator legally responsible and financially capable of assuming payments.see also old ben coal luker,cir noting that congress intended to ensure that individual coal operators rather than the trust fund bear the liability for claims arising out of such operators mines to the maximum extent feasible internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
interim and rebuttal findings 
in awarding benefits in,the alj relied on the interim presumption,a,which was repealed in,but which applies to claims that were filed before that date this interim presumption provides a rebuttable presumption of entitlement that is,total disability due to pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment.the claimant may invoke this rebuttable presumption by establishing any of the following pneumoconiosis as shown by,biopsy,or autopsy evidence under a a totally disabling respiratory impairment,as shown by pulmonary function tests under a a specified impairment in transfer of oxygen to the blood as demonstrated by blood gas tests under a or a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment as shown by physicians opinions under a.upon invocation of the presumption through any of these bases,the burden shifts to the coal company to rebut the entitlement.this rebuttal can be accomplished by showing by a preponderance of the evidence any of the following facts the miner is,in fact,doing his usual coal mine work or comparable work the miner is able to do his usual coal mine work or comparable work the evidence establishes that the miner disability is unrelated to his mine employment or the evidence establishes that the miner does not have pneumoconiosis.see b.
the alj found invocation of the presumption of benefits under a a totally disabling respiratory impairment,as shown by pulmonary function tests.amax did not dispute this invocation.consequently,amax assertions of error concerning the alj findings of invocation under other subsections of a are mostly not relevant because the presumption is invoked through a.however,as amax correctly points out,the alj finding that invocation was established under a by evidence is still relevant because a finding of invocation under a precludes a coal company from being able to rebut the interim presumption under b using a theory that chubb did not have pneumoconiosis.see mullins coal,office of workers comp.programs,d.amax also contends that the alj erred in finding that amax did not rebut the presumption under b using a theory that the miner disability is unrelated to his coal mine employment.
the alj finding that the evidence supported invocation of the presumption see a is supported by substantial evidence.the alj stated that a majority of the most highly qualified physicians,those who are both and board certified radiologists,found the presence of pneumoconiosis.petitioner app.at.as stated by amax itself,of the thirteen films,there are nine readings by doctors dually qualified as radiologists and.six of the nine readings were positive.petitioner br.at.amax argues that these six positive readings are insufficient because they take into account only four of the thirteen films but six positive readings out of nine by the most qualified physicians is substantial evidence.
amax submits that,in evaluating the evidence and the accompanying medical opinions,the alj impermissibly ruled by a head count.we can not accept this contention.our review of the record makes it clear that the alj adequately explained his credibility determinations.the alj did not rely on a mere head count.rather,he gave weight to the readings taken by the physicians possessing the most impressive credentials.petitioner app.at.amax submits that zeigler coal office of workers compensation programs,cir,overruled on other grounds by,office of workers comp.programs greenwich collieries,d,is virtually identical to this case.petitioner br.at.however,in zeigler coal,the only medical evidence that the claimant brought forward consisted of seven readings,five of which were negative,and two of which were positive.the claimant had no other evidence.none of the pulmonary studies or other tests resulted in a qualifying or positive diagnosis of pneumoconiosis.nor did the claimant even have an examining physician opinion stating that the physician believed claimant had pneumoconiosis.see id.the court held that the two positive readings standing alone and contradicted by five negative readings did not constitute substantial evidence.id.at.in stark contrast,chubb has six positive readings out of nine readings by dually qualified and radiologists the alj finding that the interim presumption was invoked under a by evidence was supported by substantial evidence,and,consequently,amax can not rebut the existence of pneumoconiosis under b.see mullins coal,at.
amax also submits that it rebutted the presumption of entitlement pursuant to b that is,the evidence establishes that the miner disability is unrelated to his coal mine employment because chubb disability was caused by a heart problem and not pneumoconiosis.the standard for b rebuttal is that the coal company must demonstrate that the claimant total disability was caused entirely by an impairment other than pneumoconiosis.zeigler coal kelley,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.although the record shows that chubb had heart problems,it also is replete with evidence,including the opinions of five physicians,pulmonary studies,and,that chubb disability was at least in part due to pneumoconiosis.amax only evidence to the contrary is the testimony of tuteur and myers.
amax argues that the alj impermissibly discredited the opinions of tuteur and myers and credited the opinions of five other physicians,one of whom was board certified in internal medicine and repeatedly examined and diagnosed chubb with pneumoconiosis.again,the alj did not merely rely on a head count,but explained his reasons for discrediting the testimonies of tuteur and myers.he discredited tuteur argument that pneumoconiosis was not a contributing cause because tuteur did not believe the patient even had pneumoconiosis and the alj had found under multiple presumptions that chubb did have it.see peabody coal shonk,cir since peabody physicians rejected the possibility that shonk had anthracosis at all,the alj distrusted their opinions as to whether the miner lungs were impaired by any pulmonary or respiratory disease.the alj discredited myers because her testimony was equivocal and vague.petitioner app.at.for example,while admitting that chubb has a significant limitation,she stated that it appeared more cardiac than pulmonary.employer ex.in conclusion,the alj noted that 
a lthough the opinions of meyer sic and tuteur are entitled to added weight based on their board certifications,i find that they are not sufficient to overcome the overwhelming weight of the opinion evidence and objective medical evidence to the contrary.
petitioner app.at it is not our province to weigh expert opinions that is the province of the alj.see livermore amax coal,cir.the alj findings of no rebuttal under b are supported by substantial evidence.
accordingly,we affirm the alj findings of invocation of the interim presumption under a with no rebuttal by amax under b.
date of onset 
the correct default date 
the alj,at the direction of the brb determined that the date of onset was the date of chubb retirement,september,and thus chubb was entitled to benefits beginning september.the alj erred in selecting the date of retirement,rather than the date of filing,as the default date.see green,office of workers comp.programs,cir finding that where evidence did not establish a default date and where miner worked after filing his claim,the alj selection of the retirement date as a default date of onset was neither supported by the substantial evidence nor in accordance with the law.
when the evidence does not establish a date of onset,applies.that section provides that w here the evidence does not establish the month of onset,benefits shall be payable to such miner beginning with the month during which the claim was filed.b.the coal company can refute that date by bringing forth credible medical evidence that the miner was not disabled on the date of filing.see rochester pittsburgh coal krecota,cir.because the alj correctly found that the evidence did not establish a month of onset,the onset date is the date of chubb filing,namely,august.
the matter,however,is complicated by chubb return to work in september for a year.the alj correctly cited a now codified at as covering this issue.that section provides that the payments to the miner shall be suspended and no benefits shall be payable for the period during which the miner continues to work.the alj misapplied the section by determining that the date of onset was the date of chubb retirement.when correctly applied,the section dictates that the onset date is the date of filing with benefits suspended during the period of chubb employment.
the decision of the fourth circuit in green is illustrative.in green,the miner was engaged in mine employment for many years after his date of filing.green,at.the alj and brb determined that the date of the miner retirement from his mining jobs should be the default date of onset.the fourth circuit reversed,stating that selection of the date of retirement as the default date of onset was not in accordance with applicable law and that the onset date is determined pursuant to b,and thus is december,the day green filed his claim.id.at.the fourth circuit explained that,even though benefits are suspended for periods during which a coal miner is employed in coal mine employment or comparable and gainful employment under a,the alj selection of the wrong default onset date could not be excused because the alj had failed to examine the claimant employment from december,to june,to determine whether it was comparable and gainful.id.at.the court held that the date of onset was the date of filing,and the benefits were to be suspended only during periods where the miner was engaged in coal mine employment or in other comparable and gainful employment.id.
thus the correct default onset date under is the filing date,august,benefits will be suspended during the year that chubb worked according to a now and will commence again beginning august,the month chubb retired.
the validity of a default date 
amax argues that is invalid,as is any u se of a default date for onset because it conflicts with c of the apa.petitioner br.at.section c states that e xcept as otherwise provided by statute,the proponent of a rule or order has the burden of proof.d.amax argues that having a default date,even if it can be rebutted by medical evidence,impermissibly shifts the burden of proof from the claimant to the is contrary to c.amax states that the claimant must be able to prove by a preponderance of evidence the date of onset or fail on his claim.
as noted by the supreme court in director,office of workers compensation programs greenwich collieries,d,the blba incorporates the apa,but it does so except as otherwise provided by regulations of the secretary.a.section is a regulation by the secretary.therefore,under the express language of the blba,the apa does not trump the regulation 
in any event,greenwich collieries makes plain that the designation burden of proof in c refers only to the burden of persuasion and not to the burden of production or the burden of going forward with the evidence.id.at.section shift s the burden of production,rather than the burden of proof,as it is merely a rebuttable evidentiary presumption enacted to ease the burden on claimants in black lung claims adjudications.mining ass chao,d,rev in part on other grounds and aff in part by mining ass dep t of labor,failing to address the district court ruling on,but noting that another dol evidentiary presumption for the blba was not invalid under c of the apa or greenwich collieries because the regulation shifted the burden of production,not the burden of proof it requires nothing more than that operators must submit evidence rebutting an assertion of liability.
the fourth circuit has noted that other similar rebuttable presumptions concern the burden of production and not the burden of proof and thus are permitted by greenwich collieries.for example,concerning the rebuttable doris coal presumption the fourth circuit explained that 
t hough the miner burden of proving his claim is not onerous,it does not follow that it is or that it has somehow been shifted to the employer if the party opposing the claim produces credible evidence that the treatment rendered is not related to the pneumoconiosis the mere existence of a medical bill without more,shall not carry the day 
we hold that the doris coal presumption merely reallocates the burden of production,and does not affect the burden of proof.
gulf indus.ling,cir quoting glen coal seals,cir.the fourth circuit further explained,the only thing that changes is that the claimant initial burden of coming forward with evidence supporting his stage two claim is eased by virtue of the determination in the first stage that he has pneumoconiosis.id.at quoting glen coal,at.similarly,once the miner has proven total disability by pneumoconiosis,if the evidence is unclear as to the actual date of onset,then establishes a presumption that the miner was disabled when he filed for benefits,unless the coal company brings forth contrary credible medical evidence.as with the doris coal presumption,shifts the burden of production and not the burden of proof,and so it is permitted by greenwich collieries and c of the apa.
attorneys fees 
amax argues that chubb counsel,sandra fogel
