plaintiffs vivid entertainment,llc califa productions,kayden kross and logan pierce are organizations and individuals who make adult films in los angeles county.the los angeles county department of public health,whose director is a defendant here,sent plaintiffs a letter stating its intention to enforce the county of los angeles safer sex in the adult film industry act commonly known as measure b codified at los angeles county,code tit,div,ch,and amending tit,div,ch.measure b imposes a permitting system and additional production obligations on the makers of adult films,including a requirement that performers wear condoms in certain contexts.plaintiffs sued for declaratory and injunctive relief,arguing that measure b burdens their freedom of expression in violation of the first amendment.defendant los angeles county answered that,although it would enforce the ordinance unless ordered by a court not to,it did not intend to defend measure b because it took a position of neutrality with respect to the ordinance constitutionality.the official proponents of measure b intervened to defend it.
the district court issued a preliminary injunction forbidding defendants from enforcing measure b provision,which gave defendants discretion to set fees for permits a provision that allowed warrantless searches by county health officers of any location suspected of producing adult films and the broad permit modification,suspension,and revocation process.the court denied preliminary injunctive relief,though,for much of the ordinance,including its condom and permitting requirements.plaintiffs appeal the district court decision not to enjoin measure b in full we affirm.
factual and procedural history 
the citizens of los angeles county enacted measure b in november by means of the initiative process it became law on december.the text of the ordinance declared that it was passed in response to documentation by the los angeles county department of public health of the widespread transmission of sexually transmitted infections among workers in the adult film industry.under measure b,producers of adult must obtain a newly designated public health permit before shooting an adult film in los angeles county.
under measure b as enacted,to obtain such a permit,producers of adult films must pay a fee,provide the department with proof that certain employees have completed a training program concerning pathogens,display the permit while filming,post a notice at the film site that the use of condoms is required,report to the department any changes in the permitted business,and comply with all applicable laws,including title,section of the california code of regulations.measure b.section mandates barrier protection for all employees who are exposed to pathogens,which measure b interprets to require condoms for performers who engage in vaginal or anal intercourse.id.measure b also provides that a public health permit may be suspended or revoked,and fines or criminal penalties imposed,for failure to comply with all permitting requirements.id.a producer who faces modification,suspension,or revocation of a permit may apply for an undefined form of administrative review.id.c.
in addition to providing for monetary and criminal penalties,measure b allows enforcement of the permitting requirements through a surprise inspection by a los angeles county health officer at any location suspected of conducting any activity regulated by this chapter.id.f or purposes of enforcing this chapter,the health officer may issue notices and impose fines therein and take possession of any sample,photograph,record or other evidence,including any documents bearing upon adult film producer compliance with the provision of the chapter.id.measure b authorizes the district attorney to bring a civil enforcement action for injunctive relief against any producer who fails to cooperate with the health officer.id.
on the day that measure b took effect,defendant department of public health mailed plaintiffs a letter notifying them of the new ordinance and stating that it had established provisional permitting fees of to per year.plaintiffs then filed this action challenging measure b as facially unconstitutional under the first amendment plaintiffs allege that measure b permitting scheme and its condom requirement operate as prior restraints on plaintiffs ability to create expression,in the form of adult films,which is protected by the first amendment.
over plaintiffs objection,the district court allowed supporters of measure b to intervene.following the supreme court decision in hollingsworth perry,d,plaintiffs asked the court to reconsider because,they argued,intervenors lacked article iii standing.the district court denied the motion to reconsider.
the district court granted in part and denied in part intervenors motion to dismiss,and granted in part and denied in part plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction.in granting preliminary injunctive relief,the district court severed one chapter of measure b in its entirety and severed portions of three other chapters.appendix a contains measure b and shows the parts that the district court enjoined and severed.
plaintiffs timely appeal the denial of complete preliminary injunctive relief they argue that the enjoined provisions are not properly severable,so the likely invalidity of some parts of the ordinance requires enjoining the entire ordinance.in the alternative,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in denying preliminary injunctive relief with respect to measure b requirements that producers acquire a permit before beginning production on an adult film demonstrate that employees have completed a training program concerning pathogens as a condition precedent to issuance of the permit and require performers to use condoms during any acts of vaginal or anal sexual intercourse.

discussion 
jurisdiction 
citing perry,plaintiffs argue that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal,because intervenors lack article iii standing.we disagree with their reading of perry and with their contention that intervenors must have standing for this appeal to proceed.
the supreme court has held that a party must have article iii standing both to initiate an action and to seek review on appeal.arizonans for official english arizona,d.but an intervenor who performs neither of those functions and no other function that invokes the power of the federal courts need not meet article iii standing requirements.yniguez arizona,cir,vacated by arizonans for official english,at,as recognized in league of united latin am.citizens wilson,cir see also perry.at citing art.iii,holding that any person invoking the power of a federal court must demonstrate standing to do so emphasis added.nothing in perry,which concerned the question whether an intervenor who sought to appeal had article iii standing,affects that conclusion.plaintiffs have standing,and it is they alone who have invoked the federal courts jurisdiction.for that reason,we need not and do not decide whether intervenors satisfy the requirements of article iii standing.
to the extent that plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in granting intervention,we can not consider their challenge.an order allowing intervention under federal rule of civil procedure a is not a final order and is not an interlocutory order appealable by statute,so an appeal on that issue is premature until entry of final judgment.alsea valley alliance dep t of commerce,cir.
severability 
plaintiffs next urge that,having held that they are likely to succeed on the merits with respect to some provisions of measure b,the district court had to enjoin operation of the entire ordinance whether or not the remainder independently satisfies the standards for injunctive relief.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
federal courts should avoid judicial legislation that is,amending,rather than construing,statutory text out of respect for the principle that only legislatures ought to make positive law.united states treasury emps.union,d.but,because of countervailing principles,courts must respect the laws made by legislatures and,therefore,should avoid nullifying an entire statute when only a portion is invalid.brockett spokane arcades,d.these concerns have led to the judicial doctrine of severability,that is,the elementary principle that the same statute may be in part constitutional and in part unconstitutional,and that if the parts are wholly independent of each other,that which is constitutional may stand while that which is unconstitutional will be rejected.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the need for deference and restraint in severing a state or local enactment is all the more acute because of our respect for federalism and local control.see city of lakewood plain dealer publ g,d.
because a court may not use severability as a fig leaf for judicial legislation,courts have fashioned limits on when a statute may be severed.see yu cong eng trinidad.i t is very clear that amendment may not be substituted for construction,and that a court may not exercise legislative functions to save the law from conflict with constitutional limitation.in keeping with federalism principles,the s everability of a local ordinance is a question of state law.city of lakewood,at.
california law directs courts to consider first the inclusion of a severability clause in the legislation.cal.redev.ass matosantos,cal th,d,cal.the presence of such a clause establishes a presumption in favor of severance.id.although not conclusive,a severability clause normally calls for sustaining the valid part of the enactment santa barbara sch.dist.superior court,cal d,cal internal quotation marks omitted.
measure b contains this severability clause 
if any provision of this act,or part thereof,is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional,the remaining provisions shall not be affected,but shall remain in full force and effect,and to this end the provisions of the act are severable.
measure b.section states clearly that the people,acting in their legislative capacity,intended any provision and any part of a provision,if invalid or unconstitutional,to be severed from the ordinance.the district court thus properly held that measure b severability clause establishes a presumption of severability.
next,california law directs courts to consider three additional criteria the invalid provision must be grammatically,functionally,and volitionally separable.cal.redev.ass n,d,at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.we will consider each criterion in turn.
grammatical separability,also known as mechanical separability,depends on whether the invalid parts can be removed as a whole without affecting the wording or coherence of what remains.id.internal quotation marks omitted.t he grammatical component of the test for severance is met by the severability clause considered in conjunction with the separate and discrete provisions of the statute.barlow davis,th,d.to be grammatically separable,the valid and invalid parts of the statute can be separated by paragraph,sentence,clause,phrase,or even single words.people nguyen,th,d,internal quotation marks omitted.where the defect can not be cured by excising any word or group of words,the problem is quite different and more difficult of solution.ex parte blaney,cal d,cal santa barbara sch,at.
here,plaintiffs contend that the district court abused its from the definition of an adult film.specifically,the district court struck part of of measure b as follows 
an adult film is defined as any film,video,multimedia or other representation of sexual intercourse in which performers actually engage in oral,vaginal,or anal penetration,including,but not limited to,penetration a penis,finger,or inanimate object oral contact with the anus or genitals of another performer any other sexual activity that may result in the transmission of blood any other potentially infectious materials.
in large part,as can be seen,the district court severed distinct clauses.the district court also severed some individual words but,grammatically,they are understood by the reader to include complete clauses.for example,the compound clause engage in oral,vaginal,or anal penetration means and easily could have been drafted to say engage in oral penetration,engage in vaginal penetration,or engage in anal penetration.for that reason,the district court did,in fact,sever only distinct provisions from measure b,and that severance did not alter the meaning of the remaining text in any way.california courts have long held that parts of a compound clause are grammatically severable from a statute if their omission would not affect the meaning of the remaining text.ex parte blaney,at santa barbara sch,at see also legislature eu,cal d,cal holding as grammatically severable or serving in from elected to or serving in the legislature on or after november,borikas alameda unified sch,th,d,holding as grammatically severable residential from o n each taxable,residential parcel at the rate of per year city of dublin county of alameda,th,d,holding as grammatically severable incorporated and from the geographic entity,including both the incorporated and unincorporated areas.in short,the district court permissibly held that the disputed portions of measure b are grammatically severable 
our next consideration,functional severability,depends on whether the remainder of the statute is complete in itself.santa barbara sch,at internal quotation marks omitted.to be functionally severable,t he remaining provisions must stand on their own,unaided by the invalid provisions nor rendered vague by their absence nor inextricably connected to them by policy considerations.they must be capable of separate enforcement.people advocate,superior court,d.here,the district court enjoined the provisions of measure b that allowed for modification,suspension,and revocation of permits that authorized administrative searches and that allowed discretion in setting fees.the rest of the ordinance remains intact the permitting scheme,with its condom and educational requirements and enforcement through fines and criminal charges.in addition,as the district court noted,even in the absence of the administrative search provision,defendants can obtain a warrant to enforce measure because the remaining parts of measure b operate independently,are not rendered vague in the absence of the invalid provisions,and are capable of separate enforcement,the district court permissibly ruled that the provisions are functionally severable.
our final consideration,volitional severability,depends on whether the remainder of the statute is complete in itself and would have been adopted by the legislative body had it foreseen the partial invalidation of the statute.santa barbara sch,at internal quotation marks omitted.with respect to ballot initiatives,the test for volitional severability is whether it can be said with confidence that the electorate attention was sufficiently focused upon the parts to be severed so that it would have separately considered and adopted them in the absence of the invalid portions.gerken fair political practices comm n,cal th,d,cal internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.
the district court preserved the requirements that producers of adult films in los angeles county obtain permits,train employees about the sexual transmission of disease,and require performers to wear condoms when engaged in vaginal or anal intercourse.the district court also preserved the enforcement mechanisms of fines and criminal penalties.as the court correctly noted,the findings and declaration section of the initiative emphasizes a growing public concern over the spread of and other sexually transmitted infections in the adult film industry the importance of safe sex practices,and the use of condoms in particular,in limiting the spread of and other sexually transmitted infections and a failure to enforce current state laws mandating the use of condoms by performers in adult films.measure b.thus,the declaration demonstrates that the public attention was focused primarily on heightening enforcement of the condom requirement.that is,even in the absence of the severed segments,the remaining provisions centrally address the voters stated concerns.the district court permissibly concluded that the condom and permitting requirements are volitionally severable from the,inspections,and administrative procedures.
plaintiffs counter that the fee provisions are not volitionally severable,because the voters would not have passed measure b as an unfunded mandate.but the declaration contained in measure b says nothing about money or revenue neutrality.rather,the text demonstrates that the core purpose of the initiative was presented to the electorate as a distinct aim,separate and apart from the measure funding mandate.mcmahan city of san francisco,th,d,holding that a funding provision was volitionally severable from the primary regulatory scheme.
in sum,the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting preliminary injunctive relief with respect to only certain parts of measure b,while allowing enforcement of other provisions as severable.we now turn to plaintiffs assertion that,even if severance is permissible,the district court erred in denying preliminary injunctive relief with respect to additional parts of the ordinance the condom mandate and the permitting requirement.
denial of preliminary injunctive relief 
in deciding whether a preliminary injunction should issue,a district court must consider four factors whether the plaintiff has shown a likelihood of success on the merits whether the plaintiff has shown a likelihood of irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief whether the balance of equities tips in the plaintiff favor and whether preliminary relief is in the public interest.winter natural res.def.council,d.
courts asked to issue preliminary injunctions based on first amendment grounds face an inherent tension the moving party bears the burden of showing likely success on the merits and yet within that merits determination the government bears the burden of justifying its law 
therefore,in the first amendment context,the moving party bears the initial burden of making a colorable claim that its first amendment rights have been infringed,at which point the burden shifts to the government to justify the restriction.

condom mandate 
the district court held that plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their first amendment challenge to the condom requirement.the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to enjoin the enforcement of the condom mandate.the condom mandate survives intermediate scrutiny because it has only a de minimis effect on expression,is narrowly tailored to achieve the substantial governmental interest of reducing the rate of sexually transmitted infections,and leaves open adequate alternative means of expression.
as a threshold matter,plaintiffs argue that the district court applied the wrong standard intermediate scrutiny and that the condom mandate should be subject to strict scrutiny.we disagree.
the supreme court has recognized that nearly all regulation of the adult entertainment industry is content based.see city of los angeles alameda books,d kennedy,concurring in the judgment.regulation of speech generally receives strict scrutiny,but we have fashioned an exception,grounded in alameda books,that applies intermediate scrutiny if two conditions are met.ctr.for fair pub.policy maricopa county,cir citing alameda books,at recognizing justice kennedy concurrence as controlling.first,the ordinance must regulate speech that is sexual or pornographic in nature.gammoh city of la habra,amended on denial of reh g,cir.second,the primary motivation behind the regulation must be to prevent secondary effects.id.but even if those two conditions are met,strict scrutiny may still apply if the regulation amounts to a complete ban on expression.dream palace county of maricopa,cir.
we assume,but need not and do not decide,that measure b condom mandate is a regulation of speech.nonetheless,measure b regulates sexual speech in order to prevent the secondary effects of sexually transmitted infections,thus falling within the alameda books exception.plaintiffs argue that,despite that exception,the district court should have applied strict scrutiny because the condom mandate amounts to a complete ban on their protected expression.
as an initial matter,plaintiffs argument presupposes that their relevant expression for first amendment purposes is the depiction of condomless sex.but simply to define what is being banned as the message is to assume the conclusion.city of erie pap,d.in pap,a plurality of the supreme court concluded that a general ban on public nudity,which required erotic dancers to wear at least pasties and a while dancing,did not violate the first amendment.id.at.in reaching that conclusion,the opinion rejected the argument that the requirement functioned as a complete ban on the dancers expression of nude dancing.id.at.instead,the opinion defined the relevant expression more broadly as the dancer erotic message.id.at.we undertook a similar analysis,albeit without reference to pap,in gammoh,in which we upheld an ordinance that required dancers to stay at least two feet away from patrons during their performances.at.the plaintiffs there argued that the ordinance completely banned their expression,which they defined as proximate dancing.id.in response,we stressed that the expression at issue could always be defined to include the contested restriction,but virtually no ordinance would survive this analysis.id.we instead defined the relevant expression as the dancer erotic message and upheld the ordinance.id.at.
in light of those cases,we must examine more carefully whether plaintiffs relevant expression is the depiction of condomless sex.plaintiffs submitted declarations stating that condomless sex differs from sex generally because condoms remind the audience about concerns such as pregnancy and disease.under this view,films depicting condomless sex convey a particular message about sex in a world without those risks.the supreme court has cautioned,however,that i t is possible to find some kernel of expression in almost every activity a person example,walking down the street or meeting one friends at a shopping such a kernel is not sufficient to bring the activity within the protection of the first amendment.barnes glen theatre,d quoting city of dallas stanglin,d.
to determine whether conduct is protected by the first amendment,we ask not only whether someone intended to convey a particular message through that conduct,but also whether there is a great likelihood that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.spence washington,d per curiam.here,we agree with the district court that,whatever unique message plaintiffs might intend to convey by depicting condomless sex,it is unlikely that viewers of adult films will understand that message.so c
