we have twice before heard appeals in this case.it has now been tried before a jury,which rendered a verdict against the defendant appellees collectively the police board or the board.jeffrey gorman now appeals the district court ruling that punitive damages are not available under the rehabilitation act and the americans with disability act.the board,for its part,asserts eleventh amendment immunity,and appeals various trial court rulings.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
a january auto accident left jeffrey gorman a paraplegic.he lacks voluntary control over his lower torso and legs,including his bladder.his inability to steady himself with his abdominal muscles and legs confines him to a wheelchair specially designed to keep him upright.he must also wear a catheter attached to a urine bag around his waist,which must be emptied in order to prevent urine from backing up into his body and causing an infection or a kidney disorder.
one saturday night in may,gorman and a friend were in the westport area of kansas city,missouri,where they entered a dance club called guitars and cadillacs.while in the club,the two became involved in an altercation with a bouncer,which ultimately resulted in gorman forceful ejection from the premises.outside,gorman approached several police officers,hoping they would intercede on his behalf.in fact,the officers were and working as private security for westport.the officers told gorman that he had to leave.when he refused,they placed him under arrest for trespass.
while waiting for the police van,gorman told the officers that he had to go to the restroom to empty his full urine bag,but was told to wait until he got to the station.when the van arrived it lacked wheelchair locks,which would have permitted gorman transportation in his chair.rather,it contained only a narrow bench.gorman told the officers that he could not possibly ride in it.given his inability to stay upright without his wheelchair,gorman thought he would fall from the bench.gorman testified that he told the officers this,that he told them how to lift him from his chair,and that he needed his molded cushion.regardless,the officers placed gorman on the bench and used a seatbelt to strap him in.the seatbelt did not properly hold gorman upright,and it lay across his already full urine bag.gorman testified that after he complained about the seatbelt,the officers loosened it,and used gorman own belt to strap him to the mesh behind the bench in order to hold him upright.the officers were unable to fold the wheelchair,and placed it,unfolded,in the back of the van 
officer becker,the van driver and only officer involved,then drove the van away from the scene.gorman testified that his body swayed with every turn and acceleration.gorman admitted that he released his seatbelt out of concern over the pressure it was placing on his urine bag.eventually,the other belt also came undone and gorman fell to the van floor.the impact from the fall exploded gorman urine bag,soaking him with his own urine.noticing that gorman had fallen,officer becker stopped the van.unable to lift gorman by himself,officer becker tied him to a support in the back of the van for the duration of the trip.the trip also damaged the wheelchair.after arriving at the station,gorman was booked,processed and released.he was subsequently convicted of misdemeanor trespass.
after these events,gorman began having medical difficulties.he suffered a bladder infection from urine backing up into his system and began suffering serious lower back pain.whereas prior to that night he had been active and,his injuries left him unable to work a full day,suffering frequent pain,uncontrollable spasms in his paralyzed areas,and shoulder problems.expert testimony suggested that these injuries and the resulting pain are permanent.
gorman sued the police board under title v,section of the rehabilitation act,section,and title ii,section of the americans with disabilities act ada,section.section prohibits discrimination in any public program receiving federal funds.section more generally prohibits discrimination in any public program or services regardless of the receipt of federal funds.in gorman bartch,cir,we held that despite gorman involuntary participation in the public services provided to detainees,he could pursue his claim under sections and.after a trial,a jury found the defendants liable and awarded gorman actual damages of and punitive damages of this appeal followed.
we begin with the police board claim of sovereign immunity.the board interposes as dispositive our holding in alsbrook city of maumelle,cir,cert.denied sub,alsbrook arkansas,d,that the eleventh amendment bars suits against the states in federal court under section.gorman argues the police board failure to similarly address his section claim renders that argument moot.however,the eleventh amendment implicates our jurisdiction,which we are obliged to explore even where the parties fail to do so.long bureau of reclamation,cir.we are therefore bound to consider whether sovereign immunity prevents gorman from bringing a claim against the police board under either statute.alsbrook alone does not dispose of that issue,for it leaves us with two questions whether sovereign immunity similarly bars suits against a state in federal court under section and whether the police board constitutes an arm of the state entitled to sovereign immunity.because we resolve the latter question in the negative,we do not reach the former.
sovereign immunity extends to states and arms of the state,but not to local governments.alden maine,d merrill lynch,pierce,fenner and smith,nixon,cir,cert.denied,d.whether an entity constitutes such an arm turns on its relationship to the state under state law regents of the of cal.doe,d healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.
in our own arm of the state jurisprudence,we have looked generally to three factors an agency powers and characteristics under state law an agency relationship to the autonomy from the state and degree of control over its own affairs,and whether any award would flow from the state treasury.treleven university of,cir accord hadley north.cmty.tech,cir finding community college to be an arm of the state based upon the state ultimate financial liability and the institution status under state law greenwood ross,cir directing inquiry to degree of local autonomy and control and whether suit will draw payment from the state treasury.because a state may only waive its immunity upon an unequivocally expressed clear declaration of an intent to do so,we give particular heed to a state treatment of its subdivisions under its own laws.college savs.bank florida prepaid postsecondary educ.expense,d citations omitted.likewise,we give substantial weight to whether litigation against a particular entity would draw on the public fisc.hess port auth,d regents,at.
our resolution of this issue in this case is guided by two holdings.the first is the supreme court ruling in auer robbins,d,that the louis board of police is not an arm of the state.there,the court noted that w hile the governor appoints four of the board five members,the city of louis is responsible for the board financial liabilities,and the board is not subject to the state direction or control in any other respect.it is therefore not an arm of the state for eleventh amendment purposes.id.citations omitted.
the elements relied upon by the supreme court in auer were recently reaffirmed in smith missouri,no,wl,at.may,where the missouri court of appeals addressed the question whether members of the louis police board and police officers with the city of louis were entitled to coverage under the missouri state legal expense fund.that fund makes money available for payment of damages levied against any state agency or officer or employee thereof.id.at.the court undertook a rigorous analysis of the louis board of police in order to determine whether it was the sort of state agency the creators of the legal expense fund had intended to include under its coverage.the court noted that the board is a creature of state,and not local law.id.at.moreover,it noted that the board was intentionally set up to be above local political influence,and to that end,as the supreme court noted,four of the board five members are appointed by the missouri governor.id.at.however,the court went on to note that the state funding mechanism ensures that the louis board is funded by the people of louis.id.at.finally,the court examined the louis board functions and purpose,which relate primarily to the city in particular,the court noted that the state has no control over the louis board.id.at.in sum,the missouri court of appeals concluded that at best,the louis board is a hybrid agency.id.at.as regards the legal expense fund,the court concluded that the legislature intent in creating and maintaining the fund is to provide coverage to those agencies and employees whose duties and actions directly impact the whole state and over which the state retains more direct control.id.at.the louis board not being such an entity,the court concluded the state has no obligation to pay judgments against its members or officers.id.at.
the kansas city board,at issue in this case,is similarly a creature of missouri state law,and is managed in a substantially similar manner.ann.stat.its functions are primarily local.its structure mirrors that which the supreme court found in auer to not be an arm of the state.moreover,as the missouri court of appeals confirmed in smith,and as the supreme court stated in auer,board members are not subject to reimbursement from the state treasury for any money judgments rendered against them.because for the purposes at issue in this case relevant state law treats entities such as the board as not being a state agency,and because the state is not responsible for judgments against it,we conclude that the kansas city board does not constitute an arm of the state for purposes of eleventh amendment immunity.
gorman appeals the district court ruling that neither section nor section permits punitive damages.we have twice permitted monetary remedies under section,rodgers magnet cove pub,cir miener missouri,cir,but the availability of punitive damages remains an open question,gorman bartch,cir.this raises a question that only one other circuit has addressed.see moreno consolidated rail,cir holding that punitive damages are not available under section.while we are sympathetic to the sixth circuit conclusion,we find it foreclosed by controlling precedent.
sections and both borrow their remedies from title vi of the civil rights act.a.the pertinent question,therefore,is what remedies title vi permits.unfortunately,title vi expressly provides neither a private cause of action nor remedies for such an action.see et.in cannon university of chicago,d,however,the supreme court held that title ix of the education amendments of created an implied cause of action in its protected class.in doing so,the supreme court relied heavily on the fact that title ix had been modeled on title vi.the court assumed congress knew that title vi had been interpreted by some lower courts to contain an implied cause of action.id.at.therefore,the court concluded,congress must have intended title ix to similarly include an implied cause of action.this reading has since been turned around to conclude that title vi must also contain an implied cause of action.lane pena,d guardians ass civil serv.comm n,d seven members of the court recognizing implied action in title vi in fragmented opinions.for our part,we have twice permitted damages under section,thereby corroborating,albeit without discussion,the notion that title vi contains an implied cause of action.rodgers,miener.
we turn next to franklin gwinnett county public schools,d,which considered the remedies available under the cause of action implied in title ix.there,the court affirmed the rule,articulated earlier in bell hood,that absent clear direction to the contrary by congress,the federal courts have the power to award any appropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action brought pursuant to a federal statute.franklin,at.the supreme court has long made clear that punitive damages are an integral part of the common law tradition and the judicial arsenal.see pacific mut.life ins.haslip,d reviewing history of punitive damages from blackstone through the english and american courts day woodworth,how.noting well established common law principle that juries may exact exemplary,punitive or vindictive damages.punitive damages,therefore,fall within the panoply of remedies usually available to american courts.given an implied cause of action in title vi,franklin compels the conclusion that absent express congressional statement to the contrary,title vi also affords all appropriate remedies,including punitive damages 
the court in franklin next took up whether congress intended to limit application of this general principle in the enforcement of title ix.at.because the cause of action in question was implied rather than expressed,the court put aside what it considered a pointless discussion of legislative history id.rather,it looked to the judicial backdrop against which congress had legislated.the court observed that i n the years before and after congress enacted this statute,the court followed a tradition and regarded the denial of a remedy as the exception rather than the rule.id.quotation and brackets omitted.once again indulging the assumption that congress legislates in light of prevailing precedent,the court found congress to have intended the availability of all remedies.the court then reviewed congress subsequent treatment of title ix.in both and,congress amended title ix without disturbing either the court holding in cannon,that title ix afforded a private remedy,or limiting the availability of remedies thereunder.in fact,the language of the amendment impliedly recognized the existence of a private cause of action.id.at.the court concluded,o ur reading of the two amendments to title ix enacted after cannon leads us to conclude that congress did not intend to limit the remedies available in a suit brought under title ix.id.at.
application of franklin methodology to this case must begin with the enactment of title vi in.cannon and our own holdings in rodgers and miener compel the conclusion that in congress created an implied cause of action in title vi at that time,the rule in bell,relied on in franklin,that a cause of action affords all appropriate remedies unless expressly limited,was alive and well.as in franklin,we must therefore conclude that congress assumed the availability of all remedies,including punitive damages,under title vi.congress has not since amended title vi to limit any cause of action implied thereunder,nor the remedies that might accompany such a cause of action.congress extended the remedies available under title vi to section in,and then to section in.congress has never expressly limited the remedies available under those sections either.therefore,logic dictates,the full panoply of remedies available under title vi,including punitive damages,must be available under sections and.
the sixth circuit reached the contrary conclusion in moreno.it relied largely on two concerns.first,it noted that since the enactment of these various sections,lower federal courts have been in near unanimity that they do not support punitive awards.id.at.second,given this fact,it pointed to the civil rights act of as proof that congress itself did not intend the availability of punitive damages.id.at.it additionally pointed to this same evidence to support the proposition that punitive damages would not be appropriate in that case.id.at.
we are sympathetic to the sixth circuit concerns,but find its methodology and conclusions foreclosed by cannon and franklin.the sixth circuit first pointed to the,and amendments to the rehabilitation act and the ada,wherein congress amended these acts but did not disturb decisions ruling punitive damages unavailable under sections and.noting the assumption,made in franklin and cannon,that congress legislates in light of judicial interpretations,the sixth circuit concluded t he only inference of congressional intent that can be drawn from the amendments is that
