the issue in this case is standing to challenge a regulatory safe harbor where the direct cause of injury is the independent action of a third party.the same issue was before this court in national wrestling coaches ass department of education,national wrestling,though the factual context there was very different.here,relying on national wrestling,the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of standing.we affirm.
congress first enacted the stark law as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of.see,stat.the law,which added section to the social security act,limited the ability of a physician to refer medicare patients to clinical laboratories with which the physician had a financial relationship.a.in,congress extended the law to several other health services,id.h,and also included medicaid patient referrals within the scope of the law,id.s.see,stat.among other things,the law prohibits payment for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral,a b,s,imposing civil penalties in the case of a prohibited referral,id.g.the stark law includes several exceptions,id.b e,and authorizes the secretary of health and human services to make additional exceptions by regulation,where the financial relationship does not pose a risk of program or patient abuse,id.b.
one of the exceptions to the referral prohibition is for p ersonal service arrangements.id.e.essentially,this exception covers,arrangements.in other words,if the physician only financial interest in the clinic is receipt of compensation at or below fair market value for reasonable and necessary services,then the physician may make referrals to the clinic without violating the law.id.e a.the stark law,however,limits the extent to which the physician compensation may be based on the volume or value of patient referrals.id.at e b.the law defines fair market value as the value in arm s length transactions,consistent with the general market value.id.h emphasis added.obviously,this definition of fair market value is critical to determining the scope of the stark law exception,and the definition hinges on the term general market value.
the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms formerly called the health care financing administration hcfa is the division within the united states department of health and human services that oversees regulatory implementation of the stark law.in,in a notice of proposed rulemaking,hcfa proposed a set of regulations to clarify and implement the various provisions of the law,including defining general market value as the compensation that would be included in a service agreement,as the result of bona fide bargaining between parties to the agreement at the time of the service agreement.several comments on this proposed rule focused on how,with what sort of evidence a party could establish it had met this standard.hcfa responded in by stating its intent to accept any method of proof that is commercially reasonable and provides us with evidence that the compensation is comparable to what is ordinarily paid for an item or service in the location at issue,by parties in arm length transactions who are not in a position to refer to one another.id.at the same time,the hcfa issued a final rule defining general market value in accord with its proposed rule.see.at.
the rulemaking did not address several subsections of the stark law,and hcfa stated it would address those subsections shortly in a phase ii rulemaking.at.in addition,this phase ii rulemaking would address comments received in response to the rulemaking,phase i.id.phase ii was completed in,when hcfa by this time renamed cms issued an interim final rule,which it planned to finalize within three years.to a large extent,the new rulemaking duplicated portions of the proposed rulemaking,addressing stark law subsections phase i had not covered.id.at.however,because a new law effective december,required the agency to finalize its proposed rules within three years,see a b,a question arose about the continuing viability of the proposal.although the agency was unsure the new law prohibited the secretary from finalizing rules proposed more than three years before december,it took the cautious approach of publishing the new rule as an interim final rule with a comment period.see.at.
in short,cms restarted the rulemaking process from scratch but waived publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking,finding the customary notice and comment period impracticable,unnecessary,or contrary to the public interest because the public had been afforded two prior opportunities to comment and could also comment on the interim final rule.see id.at quoting b.
as part of this interim final rule,cms created a safe harbor provision within the existing regulatory definition of fair market value.id.at.the agency emphasized the safe harbor was entirely voluntary health service providers may continue to establish fair market value through other methods.id.at.thus,cms added the safe harbor to give providers an easy way of proving fair market value,but providers remain free to ignore the safe harbor,and so long as they can show their personal service arrangements are nevertheless at rates,they are in full compliance with the law.the safe harbor offers two methods for showing that a physician hourly rate is at fair market value by reference to the hourly rate paid to emergency room physicians in the same market,and by averaging the hourly compensation level for physicians in the same specialty,as determined in several national surveys.specifically,the safe harbor provides as follows 
an hourly payment for a physician personal services shall be considered to be fair market value if the hourly payment is established using either of the following two methodologies 
the hourly rate is less than or equal to the average hourly rate for emergency room physician services in the relevant physician market,provided there are at least three hospitals providing emergency room services in the market.
the hourly rate is determined by averaging the percentile national compensation level for physicians with the same physician specialty or,if the specialty is not identified in the survey,for general practice in at least four of the following surveys and dividing by hours.the regulation then lists six salary surveys.
plaintiff renal physicians association rpa brought this action in the district court,challenging the provision as violating the requirements of the administrative procedure act apa and as arbitrary and capricious agency action.rpa is a national,nonprofit specialty society whose membership consists of nephrologists,advance practice nurses,and physician assistants specializing in the treatment of patients with kidney disease.rpa complaint adds that m any rpa members are medical directors of outpatient dialysis facilities.the rpa alleges that a majority of nephrologists serve as medical directors of dialysis providers that own clinical laboratories.if these physicians refer patients to these laboratories for services covered by medicare or medicaid,they violate the stark law,unless an exception applies.see a a,h a.similarly,where a nephrologist has a financial relationship with a dialysis facility,the physician may not refer patients to the hospital for hospital services covered by medicare or medicaid,unless an exception applies.id.a a,h k.as noted,health service providers that receive referrals in violation of the stark law face civil penalties,in addition to nonpayment for services furnished pursuant to the referral.id.a b,g,s.
the merits of rpa challenge to the safe harbor provision are not before us,because the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of standing.the complaint includes several paragraphs of allegations related to standing,though not the redressability aspect of standing.specifically,rpa alleges 
o nly by complying with the safe harbor can a dialysis provider ensure that it will avoid investigation or prosecution relating to compensation paid to medical directors.thus,in an effort to obtain the protection of the safe harbor,dialysis providers are likely to limit compensation for medical director services to the amount allowed under the safe harbor.
if this occurs,a significant number of nephrologists,including rpa members,will experience a substantial reduction in medical director compensation.
on the other hand,if nephrologists demand and are paid reasonable compensation,both parties run the risk that hhs will later allege,based upon the safe harbor,that the compensation paid is excessive and that the medical director arrangement violates the stark law.
in fact,dialysis providers have already begun to insist upon strict compliance with the fair market value safe harbor.rpa members have advised rpa that in negotiating the renewal of a medical director agreement,certain dialysis providers have required reduction of medical director compensation to levels.in at least one instance,that position has resulted in an executed agreement which provides for significantly reduced compensation to an rpa member.
if interested parties had been accorded their statutory right to comment on the fair market value safe harbor,the rpa would have demonstrated that based upon the use of the safe harbor,the compensation paid to nephrologists for the provision of medical director services will significantly and unfairly decrease,causing rpa members direct economic injury and negatively affecting patient care.
the stark law did not empower the secretary to set fair market value compensation rates the stark law did not authorize the secretary to reduce arbitrarily the compensation currently paid to physicians,in the free market,for personal services.the fair market value safe harbor in effect does both,and does so without benefit of any meaningful record.
the fair market value safe harbor,now fully effective,poses the threat of imminent economic harm to rpa members and other medical directors of dialysis facilities who will not be compensated at fair market value.although the compensation rates are well below the current market rate for medical director services furnished to dialysis providers,dialysis providers are insisting upon compensating medical directors in accordance with the safe harbor so as to avoid a governmental investigation or enforcement action.

despite these allegations regarding direct injury,the district court found rpa failed to meet the test for standing set forth in lujan defenders of wildlife,d,requiring injury in fact,causation,and redressability.the district court focused on the third prong,concluding rpa could not show its alleged injury would be in any way ameliorated by the relief it was seeking.renal physicians ass dep t of health human,d.because the safe harbor was merely an available option for proving fair market value,the direct cause of the alleged injury was not the safe harbor but rather the actions the clinics decided to take independently.id.
moreover,concluded the court,invalidating the safe harbor would not relieve the rpa alleged injury.at the time of the phase i rulemaking,the agency clearly announced its intent to accept any method of proof that is commercially reasonable and provides us with evidence that the compensation is comparable to what is ordinarily paid for an item or service in the location at issue,by parties in arm length transactions who are not in a position to refer to one another.at.the safe harbor merely identified two presumptively reasonable methods of proof,without restricting parties from relying on other methods of proof.renal physicians ass n,d at.and,in any event,once the agency had expressed its approval of those two methods,it could not unring the bell.id.at quoting maness meyers,d.therefore,even if the safe harbor was invalidated,the two methods of proof would still be available to providers and they would still enjoy the implicit approval of the agency,absent a rulemaking expressly disapproving these methods.id.at.the relief sought in rpa complaint thus would not redress its alleged injury.id.in reaching these conclusions,the district court relied on this court decision in national wrestling,a standing decision that likewise involved the independent action of a third party in response to a safe harbor and turned on the question of redressability.at.
the district court granted the government motion to dismiss,d at,and rpa filed this appeal.
we review a dismissal for lack of standing de novo.wrestling coaches ass n,at.as the supreme court explained in lujan,the burden of production a plaintiff must bear in order to show it has standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the district court varies with the procedural context of the case.at the pleading stage,general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct may suffice,and the court presum es that general allegations embrace the specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.sierra club epa,quoting lujan,at.
the government emphasizes that the safe harbor is voluntary and that,even if the safe harbor were rescinded,the fair market value requirement would still remain.therefore,the clinics might take the same action even without the safe harbor.standing,however,surely can not be so easily defeated solely on the basis that the challenged regulation creates a voluntary safe harbor.voluntary or not,a safe harbor must achieve some useful purpose or an agency would not bother to create it,which suggests that every safe harbor has at least some substantive impact.the extent of this substantive impact turns on the scope of the risk associated with not using the safe harbor the higher the risk,the more likely the safe harbor will attract regulated entities into its calm litigation free waters.if an agency uses a safe harbor to coerce parties toward a substantive result the agency prefers,and the safe harbor is voluntary in name only,then the agency is making substantive law.
here,however,the alleged impact of the safe harbor on rpa members is indirect,the result of the actions of third parties.in lujan,the supreme court emphasized the heightened showing required of a plaintiff alleging injury from the government regulation of a third party 
when a plaintiff asserted injury arises from the government allegedly unlawful regulation or lack of regulation of someone else,much more is needed.in that circumstance,causation and redressability ordinarily hinge on the response of the regulated or regulable third party to the government action or perhaps on the response of others as well i t becomes the burden of the plaintiff to adduce facts showing that choices of the independent actors have been or will be made in such manner as to produce causation and permit redressability of injury.thus,when the plaintiff is not himself the object of the government action or inaction he challenges,standing is not precluded,but it is ordinarily substantially more difficult to establish.

we grappled with these competing considerations in national wrestling,a case involving a challenge to a policy interpretation of the department of education doe addressing how colleges could comply with title ix ban on sex discrimination in intercollegiate athletics.wrestling coaches ass n,at.the policy interpretation established what became known as the test,under which title ix compliance can be demonstrated in any one of three ways strictly by the numbers,athletic opportunities for men and women in proportion to male and female enrollment at the college by showing that the college has been and is expanding programs that serve the underrepresented sex or by showing that the interest and abilities of the underrepresented sex are fully served by the existing program.id.at.the first of the three was the easiest to objectively in essence a safe harbor.
