the employee retirement income security act of erisa,u,provides,in pertinent part,that a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries a.in this putative class action appeal,plaintiff anthony deluca and defendant blue cross blue shield of michigan bcbsm agree that,at least for certain purposes,bcbsm served in a fiduciary capacity for a welfare benefit plan by flagstar bank for its employees and their families.deluca contends that bcbsm fiduciary status should have prevented it from engaging in contract negotiations with various hospitals that would ultimately raise the costs that flagstar plan participants were required to pay for hospitalization.the district court disagreed with the plaintiff assessment of bcb sm dealings,holding that bcbsm was not acting as a fiduciary when negotiating systemwide payment schedules for the various levels of its health insurance coverage,and granted summary judgment for the defendant.
on appeal,deluca insists that the district court erred both in failing to hold that bcbsm functioned as a fiduciary under a and in failing to interpret the broad language of b to impose fiduciary status on bcbsm in virtually all its business dealings.deluca also faults the district court for making erroneous factual findings in bcbsm favor to support the court grant of summary judgment.we conclude that the district court determined correctly that bcbsm was not acting in a fiduciary capacity in negotiating hospital reimbursement rates and that there was no genuine dispute of material fact that would prevent entry of summary judgment.
factual and procedural background 
bcbsm is a health care corporation that provides a number of health care services to employers and individuals.it offers three forms of coverage a traditional plan,a preferred provider ppo plan,and a health maintenance organization hmo that bcbsm operates through a subsidiary,blue care network.in many cases,bcbsm offers insured coverage,for which an employer or individual pays a fixed premium and bcbsm bears the risk that actual expenses will exceed that premium.bcbsm also administers plans,providing services for a fee,and the plan then reimburses bcbsm for actual medical expenses.in that case,the plan bears the risk that medical expenses will exceed expectations.for each of its coverage options,bcbsm negotiates rates with michigan providers such as doctors and hospitals.there are separate rates for each of its three coverage traditional plan,the ppo plan,and the rates are standard within each category.bcbsm status as a large purchaser of services allows it to negotiate favorable rates,and those favorable rates enable bcbsm to offer competitive pricing for their insured plans and to attract customers for their plans.
flagstar bank has long maintained a health benefit plan for its employees.in january,flagstar bank entered into a contract with bcbsm,under which bcbsm agreed to provide and other administrative services for the flagstar plan in return for a fee.the agreement stated 
bcbsm shall administer enrollees health care coverage s in accordance with bcbsm standard operating procedures for comparable coverage s offered under a bcb sm underwritten program,any operating manual provided to flagstar bank,and this contract the responsibilities of bcbsm pursuant to this contract are limited to providing administrative services for the processing and payment of claims.
the contract also specified that bcbsm will process and pay,and flagstar bank will reimburse bcbsm for,all amounts billed related to enrollees claims incurred during the term s of this contract.flagstar bank and bcbsm renewed the contract each year preceding the filing date of the present action.in,bcbsm and flagstar bank entered into a business associate addendum to the administrative services contract,one goal of which was to comply with applicable requirements of the health insurance portability and accountability act of and its implementing regulations.the addendum provided that bcbsm was responsible for e stablishing,arranging,and maintaining provider networks,including managed care,preferred provider,and traditional networks through contractual arrangements with preferred participating hospitals,physicians,and other health care providers and with other health plans within designated service areas.
prior to,the rates paid by bcbsm traditional and ppo plans were lower than the hmo rates for many providers.beginning around,in an effort to increase the hmo competitiveness and to simplify pricing structures,bcbsm negotiated a series of letters of understanding with various hospitals that altered these preexisting rate agreements.typically,these agreements were structured to equalize the rates paid by the hmo with those paid by the ppo plan.bcbsm agreed to make the rate adjustments for the providers by increasing the ppo and traditional plan rates to make up for the decrease in the hmo rates.some of these rate adjustments were retroactive to the beginning of the year in which they were negotiated.
deluca,a practicing attorney in grosse point park,michigan,was a beneficiary of the flagstar bank group health plan through his wife participation as a flagstar bank employee.in,he filed the present action against bcbsm alleging that bcbsm violated its duties as a fiduciary under two provisions of erisa,and b,by agreeing to increase its traditional and ppo plan rates in exchange for decreases in the hmo rates.after the completion of discovery,the district court granted bcbsm motion for summary judgment,concluding that bcbsm was not acting as a fiduciary for the flagstar plan when it negotiated the rate adjustments.deluca now appeals,arguing that bcbsm was indeed acting as an erisa fiduciary under when it negotiated the rate changes and,alternatively,that acting in a fiduciary capacity is not a required element of a liability claim under the other capacity provision in b,as long as bcbsm simply had the status of a fiduciary.
discussion 
as the supreme court has noted in pegram herdrich,
in general terms,fiduciary responsibility under erisa is simply stated.the statute provides that fiduciaries shall discharge their duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries,a,that is,for the exclusive purpose of i providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and ii defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan,a a.
id.at.the district court ruled that bcbsm did not violate because it was not acting as a fiduciary when negotiating the rate changes at issue in this case.we agree.although erisa has strict provisions,those standards apply only when an individual or entity is acting as a fiduciary,defined by a as follows 
a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent i he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets or iii he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.
bcbsm acted in two capacities during the course of its business relationship with the flagstar plan.first,bcbsm acted as the administrator and agent for the plan.the parties do not dispute that bcbsm acted as a fiduciary in this capacity by,for instance,making discretionary eligibility determinations.but a party is subject to fiduciary liability under erisa only when the party was acting as a fiduciary that is,was performing a fiduciary function when taking the action subject to complaint.pegram,at.for purposes of this case,therefore,bcbsm liability under thus depends on whether bcbsm was a fiduciary in its second capacity as a distributor of services,negotiating discounted rates for such services and passing the savings along to flagstar bank.
we conclude,as did the district court,that bcb sm was not acting as a fiduciary when it negotiated the challenged rate changes,principally because those business dealings were not directly associated with the benefits plan at issue here but were generally applicable to a broad range of consumers.the supreme court has recognized that erisa defines fiduciary not in terms of formal trusteeship,but in functional terms of control and authority over a plan.mertens hewitt,u,see also smith provident bank,cir the definition of a fiduciary under erisa is a functional one,is intended to be broader than the common law definition,and does not turn on formal designations such as who is the trustee.as a result,in determining liability for an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in an erisa case,the courts must examine the conduct at issue to determine whether it constitutes management or administration of the plan,giving rise to fiduciary concerns,or merely a business decision that has an effect on an erisa plan not subject to fiduciary standards.hunter caliber,cir emphasis added internal quotation marks and alterations omitted citing sengpiel goodrich,cir.in this case,the conduct at issue clearly falls into the latter category,a business decision that has an effect on an erisa plan not subject to fiduciary standards.
furthermore,a contrary saddling bcbsm with the fiduciary obligation to negotiate be.the financial advantage underlying bcb sm rate negotiations arises from the market power that bcbsm has as a large purchaser of services.bcbsm is continuously in the process of prices for its three coverage options and,thus,must continuously determine how much of that market power to allocate to achieving discounted prices for each of these options.if,however,bcbsm would be required to negotiate solely on a basis,as a practical matter its economic advantage in the market would be destroyed,damaging its ability to do business on a basis,ultimately to the flagstar plan beneficiaries disadvantage.
deluca suggests two additional bases on which we might determine that bcbsm acted as a fiduciary when negotiating the rate changes,neither of which we find persuasive.first,deluca suggests that it is not proper in this case to consider bcbsm and roles separately.but we are required to do so under pegram.see at.second,deluca argues that bcbsm was acting as a fiduciary when it negotiated the rate changes because it exercise d any authority or control respecting management or disposition of plan assets.a.even if bcb sm did have authority or control respecting plan assets,this argument is also refuted by pegram.as previously noted,that opinion holds that liability for a breach of fiduciary duty can occur only when a party was acting as a fiduciary that is,was performing a fiduciary function when taking the action subject to complaint.pegram,at.deluca argument is not that bcbsm unwisely invested,wrongly appropriated,or otherwise squandered plan assets under its authority or control.instead,the action subject to complaint in this case is bcbsm negotiation of rates.regardless of whether bcbsm exercised discretionary authority or control over plan assets in some other contexts,the challenged rate negotiations were not an exercise of such authority or control.bcbsm thus did not act as a fiduciary when negotiating the rate changes.
bcbsm also did not engage in prohibited transactions in violation of b.that section provides,a fiduciary with respect to a plan shall not in his individual or in any other capacity act in any transaction involving the plan on behalf of a party or represent a party whose interests are adverse to the interests of the plan or the interests of its participants or beneficiaries.deluca argument,as we understand it,is that the terminology in any other capacity imposes liability on a fiduciary even when not acting in a fiduciary capacity,at least with regard to those activities prohibited by section.such an interpretation,however,flies in the face of our holding that,by its own terms,applies only to those who act in a fiduciary capacity.hunter,at.because bcbsm was not acting in a fiduciary capacity when it negotiated the rate changes at issue in this case,bcbsm did not violate b.
deluca also contends that in ruling favorably on bcbsm motion for summary judgment,the district court erroneously found facts adverse to deluca.because we do not rely on any of the allegedly erroneous facts in reviewing the district court legal conclusions,we need not address deluca arguments on this point.in addition,we note that most of the allegedly disputed facts were based on conclusory statements by deluca,rather than on evidence in the record.
conclusion 
for the reasons set out above,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the facts of this case are regrettable.flagstar bank contracted with blue cross blue shield of michigan blue cross to administer flagstar plan.among the s ervices the contract between flagstar and blue cross describes them as blue cross agreed to provide were e stablishing,arranging,and maintaining provider networks through contractual arrangements with preferred participating hospitals,physicians,and other health care providers.one of the years in which blue cross agreed to provide these s ervices was.in the latter half of that year,however,blue cross apparently concluded that its own wholly owned subsidiary,the blue care network bcn hmo,was not sufficiently profitable.
so,in approximately september of that year,blue cross circled back to many of its participating hospitals and renegotiated the rates that those hospitals would charge not only bcn,but also plans like the flagstar plan.indeed that was the idea the decrease in bcn rates would be budget neutral for each hospital,blue cross explained,because blue cross would agree to a commensurate increase in the rates paid by the plans that blue cross represented.many hospitals agreed to the deal.the rate increases were also made retroactive to january of that nine months before the deals were means the flagstar plan and others was billed anew for services it had already paid for.thus,in a nutshell,blue cross lowered rates for its own subsidiary by effectively raising them for flagstar and other plans.the letter agreements between blue cross and the hospitals spell out these facts in black and white.
but that does not mean that flagstar knew about the deals.to the contrary,blue cross has admitted in interrogatory responses in this case that it never told flagstar it had raised the plan rates in order to lower them for its own subsidiary.and it appears that flagstar was otherwise clueless about the change,because blue cross did not provide backup data for the charges it sent flagstar each month.
no one disputes that these facts would amount to a breach of fiduciary duty,in the erisa sense of the term,if blue cross duties to flagstar with respect to e stablishing,arranging,and maintaining provider networks were indeed fiduciary.whether they were,therefore,is the principal question presented here.the statute provides 
a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent i he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets or iii he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.
a.we employ a functional test to determine fiduciary status,rather than focus on titles,trustee or on limiting language in the parties agreement.briscoe fine,cir.
whether blue cross functioned as a fiduciary when it established and maintained provider networks for flagstar depends on how one characterizes their agreement.deluca i think no one the function of negotiating rates with provider hospitals surely would have been fiduciary in nature had the plan trustees kept that function and in deluca view,the contract merely delegated that function from the trustees to blue cross.he therefore contends that blue cross was acting as a fiduciary when,as part of the services it provided under the contract,it negotiated rates for the plan.in contrast,blue cross argues that it actually provided a access to its provider network at whatever rates blue cross cared to negotiate with than services.
the difference matters because,while selling a product tends not to create fiduciary duties under erisa,providing services
