plaintiff anna maday appeals from a jury verdict in favor of defendant public libraries of saginaw,pointing to three trial errors allegedly committed by the district court.for the reasons outlined below,we affirm.
maday had been employed since by the saginaw public library hereinafter the library,where she managed the genealogy and history departments.in,the library hired a new director,marcy warner,and a new assistant director,jim curtis.curtis was maday immediate supervisor.in december,maday requested and was granted family medical leave through february to care for her husband,who was having hip surgery.during her leave,maday developed heart problems and was forced to undergo surgery.her leave was accordingly extended until april,at which point she returned to work until november,when she again requested and was granted family medical leave to care for her husband,who was having a hip procedure.
when maday returned from this second leave in december,she received a poor evaluation from curtis.the evaluation noted that maday performance and attitude had flagged since warner and curtis had taken over.maday appealed her negative evaluation to warner and,ultimately,the library board,but both supported curtis position.in february,maday received another poor evaluation from curtis,and was suspended for one week when she reacted belligerently to this news.the day she returned to work,she was told to report to a new supervisor,jill coe.coe had difficulty working with maday as well,and on march maday was suspended again.she was subsequently terminated on april.maday was years old at the time of her discharge.
on august,maday filed a complaint in federal district court,alleging age discrimination in violation of federal and state law,as well as violations of the family and medical leave act,et.the case was tried to a jury,resulting in a verdict in favor of the library.
defense counsel remarks and expressions during trial 
maday first argues that the attorney for the library,suzanne bartos,made several inappropriate remarks in the presence of the jury throughout the course of the trial.most of these remarks were directly or indirectly disparaging of victor mastromarco,maday trial counsel.mastromarco routinely objected to the remarks,but to no avail.for example,at the beginning of her opening statement,bartos remarked to the jury 
i see it in your eyes,it not going to be an hour and ten minute sic on opening statement,i promise you.i was having to sit back there,another problem with going second in these trials is i have to sit back and just bite my knuckles.
at the beginning of her closing statement,bartos said 
before i get started on my planned discussion here,i wanted to just say one thing because i had to sit back there and every time i hearing from mastromarco it like nails on a chalkboard.it driving me crazy.curtis never said at any point in time that maday was disciplined,fired,or job changed he never testified to that.i not asking to you sic take my word,i asking you to think back on your memory as to what was asked to him by mastromarco 
and at the end of her closing statement,bartos quipped 
oh,one last thing,because mastromarco gets a final say,so to speak,i going to have to sit there and i going to do my best to be cordial and respectful and bite my tongue.but if you hear something that you just,like,gosh that just does sound right,please,take it upon yourselves to say hey,bartos would have said this or bartos said this not that.do my job for me because i ca any longer 
in addition to these statements,maday alleges that bartos repeatedly made inappropriate facial gestures as a means to communicate with the jury and cast doubt on maday case and mastromarco abilities as a lawyer.in an attempt to articulate the basis for his objection at trial,mastromarco argued that bartos was attempting to make some type of contact with the jury via her facial gestures,to show a window to what her mind is thinking about all these things.
finally,maday points to a statement made by bartos accusing mastromarco of lying during a sidebar conference when the judge was asking mastromarco and his,manda aganost,whether or not they had received a particular document.bartos said,apparently within earshot of the jury,she aganost not going to lie for you,as if to indicate that both mastromarco and aganost knew they had received the document,and thus they should not lie about not having received it.maday views this as part of an campaign to unfairly and improperly paint plaintiff counsel as a liar to the jury throughout the course of trial.
mastromarco asked that the district judge poll the jury to see if they had heard or seen any of bartos allegedly inappropriate statements or gestures,but the district judge refused,ruling as follows 
well,instead of polling the jury the court opted for a different route,and that is to give the jury a special instruction,which i did,that concerned comments of counsel and the reaction of lawyers sometimes in the heat of battle and that they should disregard those comments and decide the case only on the evidence.
the district judge also indicated that any motion for a mistrial on these grounds would be denied even if the jury had heard the remark 
hypothetically,if the one of the jurors would have stated that they heard the comment that bartos made and you would have made a motion for a mistrial,my view is that the instruction would have cured the problem and i would have denied the motion for mistrial.in fact,if you would like to make a record and preserve that,i entertain your motion for mistrial now.
maday accepted the district court invitation,and made a motion for a mistrial,which the district court accordingly denied.we review the district court denial of a motion for a mistrial for abuse of discretion.wilson morgan,cir citing grossheim freightliner,cir.
maday cites to only one case,city of cleveland peter kiewit sons,cir,in support of her position that bartos comments and gestures somehow unfairly prejudiced the outcome of her lawsuit.in kiewit,the city of cleveland sought to recover from a corporation for damages to a dock that the corporation had been leasing from the city and using to load and unload goods.id.at.throughout the trial,the attorney for the city made persistent references,over the objection of the trial court,to the size of the,a million corporation in the marine engineering field and to the size and scope of its insurance policy.id.at.the jury ultimately returned a verdict of against the corporation.id.at.in ruling that the district court should have granted a mistrial,this court noted that evidence as to the poverty or wealth of a party to an action is inadmissible in a negligence action.id.at quoting eisenhauer burger,ohio misc,cir see also draper airco,cir appealing to the sympathy of jurors through references to financial disparity is improper.
this case,in contrast,appears to involve nothing more than verbal and perhaps also nonverbal sparring between trial attorneys,an occurrence not uncommon in the heat of battle,as the trial judge correctly pointed out.bartos actions may have flirted with impropriety,but it is likely that her demeanor and tactics negatively influenced her own client case as much as they might have maday.bartos certainly made no express references,as did the attorney in kiewit,that directly violated any rules of evidence.and the statement maday appears to consider particularly,she not going to lie for you was said between attorneys and the district judge at sidebar,not in front of the jury.to be sure,the jurors may nevertheless have heard what transpired,but the district court provided a curative instruction to the jury namely,that it must decide the case only on the evidence and should disregard extraneous comments by either of the parties attorneys.
misconduct by an attorney that results in prejudice may serve as a basis for a new trial.the burden of showing prejudice rests with the party seeking the new trial,and district courts have broad discretion in deciding whether to grant a motion for a new trial.fuhr school dist.of hazel park,cir quoting in re air crash disaster,cir.a rev
