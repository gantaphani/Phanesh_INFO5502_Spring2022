gale edgar sued her former employer,jac products,based upon an alleged violation of the family medical leave act fmla after she was fired in october of.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of jac,concluding that edgar was not entitled to relief under the fmla because she was unable to return to work after the period of statutory leave had ended.on appeal,edgar argues that her ability to resume her duties is a disputed question of fact that the district court improperly resolved in jac favor.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
gale edgar began working for jac,a manufacturer of specialized automotive products,as an assembler in october of.she later worked as a administrator,a job that she held until the position was eliminated in.at that point,edgar accepted a transfer to jac finance department,where she worked as an clerk.
edgar began to suffer from stress after her transfer,but refused another transfer to the newly created position of coordinator.on september,her family doctor,linda speegle,diagnosed edgar as suffering from high blood pressure and anxiety.she recommended that edgar be excused from work through september.edgar did not heed speegle advice,instead deciding to continue working because she knew that there was nobody who could do the check run set for that week.speegle met with edgar again on september,diagnosed her with anxiety and an adjustment reaction related to increased stress at work,and recommended that her leave be extended through october.
the following morning,edgar called her supervisor,cindy irish,and informed irish that she would be missing work due to high blood pressure and anxiety disorder.irish asked edgar to come into the office early the following week to answer some questions and to deliver the doctor note justifying her absence.when edgar entered the building on september,she was escorted by jodee szozda,the corporate compensation and benefits manager,to a meeting with szozda and dennis kaye,jac corporate director of human resources.
what actually transpired at the meeting is the subject of dispute between the parties.jac maintains that kaye and szozda explained to edgar her rights and responsibilities under the fmla,handed her two forms,and instructed her to fill out the forms and return them to jac.the forms in question were the jac products request for family or medical leave form and a certification of health care provider form issued by the department of labor.jac form included a note informing employees that leave requests must be accompanied by a verifying medical certification from a physician and that failure to provide the requested certification within days of the request may result in termination of employment.edgar acknowledges receiving the forms,but insists that she did understand what was going on,that she was confused because the fmla procedure differed from the company previous practice,and that the situation was very stressful because her young daughter was with her.
speegle examined edgar again on october,concluding that edgar continued to suffer from anxiety,dizziness,and insomnia.she extended edgar leave until october,by which date edgar was to have been evaluated by a psychiatrist.edgar immediately provided speegle updated note to jac along with the company request for family or medical leave form.jac approved edgar requested leave on october.edgar had not,however,turned in the required medical certification form.on october,jac mailed her a correct version of the form because the one given to her at the september,meeting was no longer the one recommended by the department of labor and instructed her to return the form by october,two days after the deadline would have passed.
edgar did not receive the updated form until friday,october.she immediately called szozda and left a voicemail message explaining that she had just received the form and that she would need an extension.szozda returned her call the following monday and,after consulting with kaye,agreed to give her an extension.the parties dispute the length of the promised extension,with edgar insisting that szozda provided a deadline of october,while jac maintains that szozda set the deadline for october,as reflected in a memorandum that he placed in edgar personnel file.these conflicting versions of the final medical certification deadline led the district court to conclude that a genuine issue of material fact existed that precluded the entry of summary judgment in favor of jac.
in an effort to comply with the new deadline,edgar asked speegle to fill out the updated medical certification form.speegle told edgar that her office would call when the form was ready.edgar called speegle three times over the next two days and finally arranged for her husband to pick up the completed form on october,day that edgar believed marked the deadline for submitting the form.the form,according to edgar husband,was picked up from the doctor and delivered by hand to jac on october,but the company insists that its records reveal that the form was not received until the following day.kaye mailed a letter on october,terminating edgar employment due to her failure to provide the requested medical certification by the october,deadline allegedly set by jac.
meanwhile,edgar was unable to meet with the psychiatrist,barbara day,as scheduled on october.day finally evaluated edgar on october,diagnosed her with major depression,and determined that she would not be able to return to work until january.after a subsequent examination in december of,day extended edgar medical leave of absence until february.a second psychiatrist,jeri kedzierski,began treating edgar in february of.kedzierski treated edgar for approximately a year and finally released her to work at full capacity as of march,which was months after the expiration of the period.
procedural background 
in the meantime,edgar had filed her complaint in the michigan system in july of.she alleged that jac had violated the fmla in four ways by failing to provide her with written notice of her fmla rights,by failing to provide her with sufficient time to submit the required medical certification form,by interfering with the exercise of her rights under the statute,and by terminating her employment in violation of the statute.the following month,jac removed the case to federal court and filed its answer.jac later filed a motion for summary judgment,asserting that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because edgar had failed to provide the required medical certification in accordance with the established deadline,and even if the certification was timely,edgar suffered no harm from jac termination decision because she would not have been able to return to her position at the end of the period of statutory leave in any event,and thus would have been terminated at that time.
the district court granted jac motion for summary judgment in an opinion and order filed in december of.because of conflicting testimony as to whether szozda had extended the deadline for filing the requested medical certification form until as late as october,the district court ruled that material facts were in dispute as to edgar compliance with the certification requirement.see generally frazier honda of am,cir holding that the employer had given the employee more time than was required under the fmla regulations by making a written request for a medical certification after the employer oral request initially triggered the deadline.
the district court concluded,however,that jac was entitled to summary judgment on the alternative ground that edgar was not released to return to work at the time her leave would have ended and therefore ha d no claim under the fmla.in so ruling,the district court relied on this court opinion in cehrs northeast ohio alzheimer research center,cir,and two district court opinions.edgar timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.int l union cummins,cir.summary judgment is proper where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
statutory and legal framework 
the fmla entitles qualifying employees to up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave each year if,among other things,an employee has a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.walton ford motor,cir quoting a d.a serious health condition,in turn,is defined as an illness,injury,impairment,or physical or mental condition that involves a inpatient care in a hospital,hospice,or residential medical care facility or b continuing treatment by a health care provider.employees claiming that they suffer from such a condition may be required by their employer to support their contention with a written certification from a healthcare provider.a.that certification form,according to the department of labor dol regulations,must be submitted within the time frame requested by the employer which must allow at least calendar days after the employer request,unless it is not practicable under the particular circumstances to do so despite the employee diligent,good faith efforts.b see also frazier,at explaining the rule.
the other relevant time frame under the fmla is the period of statutory leave.qualifying employees who return to work within that period are entitled to be reinstated to their previous position,or to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits,pay,and other terms and conditions of employment.a.once the period ends,however,employees who remain unable to perform an essential function of the position because of a physical or mental condition have no right to restoration to another position under the fmla.b.
this court has consequently held that an employer does not violate the fmla when it fires an employee who is indisputably unable to return to work at the conclusion of the period of statutory leave.cehrs northeast ohio alzheimer research center,cir finding no fmla violation because the evidence was undisputed that the employee would not have been able to return to work by the statutory deadline williams toyota motor,cir concluding that the employee had suffered no harm when she was terminated because she was unable to resume her duties by the end of the fmla leave period,rev on other grounds,d.
section of the fmla,codified at,prohibits covered employers from interfering with,restraining,or denying the exercise of their employees rights under the statute,and also makes it unlawful for any employer to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by this subchapter.a,a,b.these provisions are enforceable under of the fmla,which imposes liability on a ny employer who violates section,and provides an individual right of action to sue in state or federal court.a,a.two distinct theories of recovery arise under these statutes.see arban west pub,cir explaining the entitlement and retaliation theories of recovery under the fmla see also throneberry mcgehee desha county,cir same.
under the entitlement theory which some courts refer to as the interference theory,t he issue is simply whether the employer provided its employee the entitlements set forth in the example,a leave or reinstatement after taking a medical leave.arban,at.the right to reinstatement guaranteed by a is the linchpin of the entitlement theory because the fmla does not provide leave for leave sake,but instead provides leave with an expectation that an employee will return to work after the leave ends.throneberry,at see also a explaining that employers are permitted to deny restoration to employment if they can show that an employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time reinstatement is requested.
to prevail on an entitlement claim,an employee must prove that she was an eligible employee,the defendant was an employer as defined under the fmla,she was entitled to leave under the fmla,she gave the employer notice of her intention to take leave,and the employer denied the employee fmla benefits to which she was entitled.see walton,at citing cavin honda of am,cir.only the last of those five issues is currently in,whether jac termination of edgar employment denied her the fmla benefits to which she was entitled.see walton,at.
the employer intent is not a relevant part of the entitlement inquiry under.see arban,at because the issue is the right to an entitlement,the employee is due the benefit if the statutory requirements are satisfied,regardless of the intent of the employer.citing hodgens dynamics,cir.by the same token,the fmla is not a statute.see throneberry,at rejecting the argument that employers are strictly liable for all fmla violations smith diffee,cir holding that employees may be dismissed so long as the dismissal would have occurred regardless of the employee request for or taking of fmla leave.employees seeking relief under the entitlement theory must therefore establish that the employer violation caused them harm.see ragsdale wolverine world wide,d section provides no relief unless the employee has been prejudiced by the violation.
both the statute and the dol regulation likewise establish that interference with an employee fmla rights does not constitute a violation if the employer has a legitimate reason unrelated to the exercise of fmla rights for engaging in the challenged conduct.see arban,at an employee lawfully may be dismissed,preventing him from exercising his statutory rights to fmla leave or reinstatement,but only if the dismissal would have occurred regardless of the employee request for or taking of fmla leave.accord throneberry,at as long as an employer can show a lawful reason,a reason unrelated to an employee exercise of fmla rights,for not restoring an employee on fmla leave to her position,the employer will be justified to interfere with an employee fmla leave rights.
under the retaliation theory also known as the discrimination theory,in contrast,the employer motive is an integral part of the analysis.see hodgens,at explaining that in retaliation cases,the employer motive is relevant,and the issue is whether the employer took the adverse action because of a prohibited reason or for a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason.the employer motive is relevant because retaliation claims impose liability on employers that act against employees specifically because those employees invoked their fmla rights.see kauffman fed.express,cir observing that the retaliation theory applies where a company seeks to punish an employee for exercising rights or opposing an unlawful procedure.
this court applies the familiar test articulated in mcdonnell douglas green,d,to retaliation claims under the fmla.see skrjanc great lakes power serv,cir applying the analysis to an suit.edgar can make out a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that she availed herself of a protected right under the fmla by notifying jac of her intent to take leave,she suffered an adverse employment action,and that there was a causal connection between the exercise of her rights under the fmla and the adverse employment action.see id.at setting forth this framework rodriguez ford motor,d,applying this test to a claim under the fmla.if the employee satisfies these three requirements,the burden shifts to the employer to proffer a legitimate,nondiscriminatory rationale for discharging the employee.skrjanc,at.
c.the district court did not err in concluding that no genuine issues of material fact were in dispute regarding edgar ability to return to work 
the district court did not evaluate edgar claim under either the entitlement or the retaliation mode of analysis.instead,the district court relied on this court decision in cehrs for the proposition that an employer can lawfully fire an employee who is unable to return to work at the end of the fmla leave period,even if the termination occurs before the end of the period,and rejected edgar theory that her case was distinguishable because the condition that prevented her from returning to work was exacerbated by the firing.we will follow the same order in evaluating the district court grant of summary judgment.
is edgar claim foreclosed by cehrs and its progeny 
in cehrs northeast ohio alzheimer research center,cir,this court held that a company does not violate the fmla when it terminates an employee who is incapable of returning to work at the end of the leave period allowed by the act.the plaintiff in cehrs was a nurse at an alzheimer research facility who suffered from a chronic ailment that prevented her from working when it flared up.id.at.although the parties disputed the precise date on which cehrs employment was terminated,the evidence indisputably showed that she was not released to resume her duties until march,two weeks after her fmla leave period ended.id.at.this court held that,because cehrs was clearly unable to return to work within the period provided by the fmla,the defendant was entitled to summary judgment on the fmla claim.id.at.
two unpublished decisions of this court have applied cehrs to analogous factual scenarios.see hicks leroy jewelers,wl cir per curiam green alcan aluminum,wl cir.in hicks,the pregnant plaintiff requested fmla leave in advance of the anticipated birth of her child.her employer,however,placed her on fmla leave when a kidney infection required her to be hospitalized almost one month before she gave birth.wl,at.this court held that,although the district court had erred in granting summary judgment on the ground that the employee hospital stay allowed the employer to move up the start date of the leave period,the employer was nevertheless entitled to summary judgment because the employee could not have returned to work until at least days after the leave period ended even if the employer had used the correct date.id.at.
in so holding,the court in hicks relied on both cehrs and b.the latter is a dol regulation establishing that employees who remain unable to perform an essential function of their position have no statutory right to restoration under the fmla.id.at see also green,wl,at relying on cehrs and the dol regulation to reject a claim by an employee who was not cleared to resume her duties until three weeks after the leave period expired reynolds phillips temro,cir relying on the dol regulation to reject a claim by an employee who could not perform an essential function of his previous position for several months after the expiration of the period.
another panel of this court reached the same conclusion announced in cehrs without citing that decision.see williams toyota motor,cir,rev on other grounds,d.the plaintiff in williams worked at a toyota assembly plant.id.at.she suffered from syndrome and tendinitis in her hands and arms,ailments that led her doctors to recommend that she cease all work as of december.id.at.even though the defendant fired williams with time still remaining in the period,this court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in the employer favor.id.the court emphasized that the evidence demonstrated that williams was restricted at the time of her termination and up until at least nine months later from doing any work of any kind,not even office jobs.id.because williams suffered no damages,the employer was entitled to summary judgment even if it had improperly denied williams fmla leave.id.at.
edgar attempts to distinguish the cehrs line of cases by limiting those precedents to situations in which no dispute exists as to whether the employee could resume her duties by the end of the period.she relies instead on district court cases holding,unsurprisingly,that factual disputes regarding the employee ability to return to work preclude summary judgment in favor of the employer.see,mendoza micro electric,c,wl,unpublished shepherd honda of am,d viereck city of gloucester city.as jac persuasively demonstrates in its brief,however,both mendoza and viereck are factually distinguishable from the present case.in those two cases,the plaintiffs testified unequivocally that they would have returned to work by the end of the leave period if they had known that their jobs were at stake,and the employers could not demonstrate that the employees were medically unable to resume their positions.see mendoza,wl,at viereck.at.
the plaintiff in the present case,in contrast,has not pointed to any competent proof that contradicts the testimony of day and kedzierski.both of those doctors were of the opinion that edgar could not return to work until well after the period had expired in december of.edgar instead relies on a statement in her own deposition testimony where she claimed that she would have been able to timely resume her duties.she acknowledged,however,that she was unaware of what her doctors would have wrote down there to that respect.she also relies on an ambiguous answer given by day,who said that she had no reason to doubt edgar statement that she was prepared or preparing to return to work when jac terminated her.day did not state,however,that edgar could actually have returned to work.this testimony is therefore insufficient to establish that any mental health professional had released edgar for work during the leave period,and does not contradict the consistent diagnoses of day and kedzierski.
contrary to the distinguishable nature of mendoza and viereck,the district court decision in shepherd does lend a degree of support to edgar position.the plaintiff in shepherd,like edgar,suffered from clinical depression.d at.shepherd took intermittent periods of leave until may of,after which she could not return to work.these leave periods accounted for of the business days to which shepherd was entitled under the fmla.id.at.honda considered shepherd to be on an unauthorized leave of absence because she did not submit the required medical documentation.an extension was granted until june,to allow shepherd doctor time to regulate her medication,id.at,but shepherd still did not return to work.shepherd was fired at the end of the extension period.id.
seeking judgment as a matter of law after the jury had returned a verdict in shepherd favor,honda argued that shepherd was unable to perform the functions of her position both at the time of her firing and for two years after that event.id.the district court denied honda motion and upheld the jury verdict.in so ruling,the court rejected honda invocation of the cehrs defense,emphasizing that the defense was based upon evidence revealed after plaintiff was terminated.id.at.at the time of the firing,shepherd treating physician indicated that a medical leave of days would suffice,although he opined months later that she would need at least months of leave before returning and years before resuming her duties on a basis.shepherd,d at.the court concluded that,because shepherd ability to return to work was disputed at the time of her firing,the jury could have found that the termination violated the fmla.it therefore ruled that the cehrs defense did not apply.id.at.
there is,however,an important procedural difference between the present case and shepherd.the district court in shepherd was deciding whether the employer was entitled to judgment as a matter of law after the jury returned a verdict in favor of the employee on the fmla claim.this court has recognized that a jury verdict in an fmla after consideration of the evidence and the credibility of the on firmer ground than do a plaintiff allegations and accompanying materials at the stage.see chandler specialty tires of am,cir affirming the denial of the employer motion for judgment as a matter of law on an fmla claim in part because the employer had ample opportunity to support is position that the employee was fired for taking a drug overdose,and not for taking fmla leave.despite this procedural distinction,shepherd operative facts are similar to the ones in the present case,and the legal analysis applied by the district court in shepherd differs significantly from the one undertaken by the court below.whether or not shepherd accurately applied the law of this circuit is therefore an issue that we must deal with directly.
specifically,edgar reliance on shepherd raises an important question not addressed in cehrs and still unresolved in this,does the point in time when the company learns that its employee can not return to work by the end of the period of statutory leave affect the lawfulness of its termination decision stated another way,can evidence of an employee medical condition acquired by the employer after the adverse employment action has been taken be used to justify that action we believe that the answer to this question depends upon the theory of recovery invoked by the employee.
employees invoking the entitlement theory must prove that their employer interfered with or denied them an fmla benefit to which they were entitled.see arban,at kauffman,at.this inquiry is an objective one divorced from the employer motives,with the central question being simply whether the employee was entitled to the fmla benefits at issue.these benefits are usually the weeks of leave with continued insurance coverage and restoration to the employee previous position or an equivalent one.see a,a.both the dol regulation in question and this court decision in cehrs establish that this central question must be answered in the negative when the employee is incapable of returning to work,or of performing an essential function of her position,at the end of the period.see b cehrs,at see also throneberry,at explaining that the fmla does not prohibit an employer from discharging an employee for legitimate reasons just because that employee happens to be on fmla leave at the time of the discharge.
in examining the employee ability to return to work,courts faced with a motion for summary judgment in an entitlement case should consider all of the medical evidence bearing on the employee ability to timely return,not just the evidence available at the time of the adverse employment action.bauer varity,cir holding that a court deciding whether an fmla plaintiff suffered from a serious health condition could consider evidence of the plaintiff medical condition that arose after his employer fired him.this principle makes sense because,rather than inquiring into the employer motive at the time of the decision,the court is charged with resolving the objective question of whether the employee was capable of resuming his or her duties within the period.employers in entitlement cases should thus be able to invoke cehrs and b the dol regulation even if the medical evidence on which they rely did not emerge until after the employment decision occurred.
the same can not be said of claims brought under the retaliation theory.what makes the employment decision unlawful under the latter theory is the motive of the,that the action was taken because the employee exercised,or complained about the denial of,rights.because the mcdonnell douglas framework applies to retaliation claims,see skrjanc,at,employers will point to evidence of the employee medical condition as a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the employment decision.the time at which the evidence arises thus becomes a crucial factor in discerning the employer motive.
in mckennon nashville banner publishing,d,the supreme court reversed a decision of this court that had rejected the evidence rule.id.at.that rule bars employers accused of discriminatory conduct from using evidence of an employee wrongdoing acquired after the adverse employment action as a defense to liability under the statutes.see id.at.before mckennon,employers would use evidence of employee misconduct acquired after discharge as a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the employment decision,thus placing on the employee the burden of proving that the proffered reason was a pretext.see id.at.the employer could not have been motivated by knowledge it did not have and it can not now claim that the employee was fired for the nondiscriminatory reason.the supreme court in mckennon refused to permit evidence to bar all recovery in a case brought under the age discrimination and employment act,instead holding that such evidence did not alter the fact of the employer liability,but rather must be taken into account in deciding the appropriate remedy.id.at.
another key district court case from this circuit cited by edgar applied a modified version of mckennon in deciding the appropriate remedy for a prevailing fmla plaintiff.see rogers ac humko,d.in rogers,the was fired just days after he requested disability leave due to a serious health condition affecting his legs.id.at.after the jury returned a verdict for the employee in his retaliation suit against the company,the employer argued that damages should be limited because evidence of the employee medical condition acquired after the discharge revealed that the employee would not have been able to resume his duties at the end of the period.id.at.the district court determined that the key questions to ask in an fmla case are as follows whether the employee was so incapacitated by a continuing serious health condition at the end of the leave period that she could not perform the essential functions of her position,and whether the employer would in fact have terminated the employee for taking more leave than is permitted under the fmla.id.at.
under that test,the court in rogers concluded that the employer had carried its burden of proving that the employee was not capable of returning to work after weeks and consequently would have been terminated even absent the improper motive.id.the court also emphasized,however,that the purposes of the fmla would be frustrated if an employer could escape from all liability for a retaliatory discharge under a simply because it has shown that the employee could not have returned to work after having taken fmla leave.id.at holding the employer liable,but limiting the employee backpay award to the fmla period because the employee would not have been able to return to work after that period.rogers is thus consistent with the view that,in a retaliation case,evidence of an employee inability to return to work can not be used to shield a defendant from liability,but should be considered in determining the appropriate remedy for the fmla violation.
this analysis does not preclude cehrs and the dol regulation from being potentially applicable in a retaliation case.to the contrary,the rule,as its name indicates,covers only evidence discovered after the adverse employment action takes place.see bauer,at explaining that,in cases where the employer motive for the employment action is the primary issue,courts should not consider evidence acquired by the employer after the decision to discharge an employee.employers,in other words,are still permitted to cite the medical evidence available prior to the employment decision as a legitimate,nondiscriminatory basis for taking an adverse action against an employee otherwise eligible for the leave period.under the retaliation theory,therefore,cehrs and the dol regulation come into play at the stage where the employer must articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.
in light of the above analysis,we believe that the following summary properly reflects the relationship among the two theories of recovery available under the fmla,the dol regulation,and this court decision in cehrs in entitlement cases,cehrs and the dol regulation provide a defense to liability,regardless of whether the medical evidence revealing the employee inability to return to work is available before or after the termination decision in retaliation cases where the medical information known to the employer prior to the termination decision shows that the employee could not return within weeks,cehrs and the dol regulation can be invoked by employers as a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for discharging the employee,to rebut the employee prima facie case of discrimination and in retaliation cases where the employer learns of the employee inability to r
