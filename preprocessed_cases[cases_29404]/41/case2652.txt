introduction 
on wednesday,september,martin shane phillips,accompanied by his friend and mike lulka,walked into the emergency room of hillcrest medical center hmc.phillips complained of severe chest pain and symptoms.prior to examining phillips,hmc staff took background information from phillips,including whether he was covered under any health insurance plan.phillips claimed he was covered but could not locate his insurance card.lulka,who was covered under the same plan from their mutual employer,offered his card to provide hmc administrative staff with the generic information that was equally applicable to the.hmc staff allegedly indicated on his file that phillips was not insured.
after initial processing,phillips was triaged by lugenia cue a registered nurse,and then examined by carolyn cobb in the minor care side of the emergency room.after the examination,phillips was given two prescriptions,discharged from the emergency room,and referred to an oklahoma medical clinic for treatment.though his symptoms failed to subside,phillips was seen at work on the two days thursday and friday following his discharge from hmc.based upon all accounts,his condition was rapidly deteriorating through saturday and sunday.
late sunday night or early monday morning,fred phillips,decedent father,decided to take phillips to the emergency room at tulsa regional medical center trmc.they arrived at trmc,claiming phillips had been suffering from nausea and vomiting for four to five days.phillips again gave demographic information and denied,as he had on september,the use of illegal drugs.phillips was initially examined by an emergency room doctor,phillip murta.murta believed phillips was suffering from pneumonia.stan stacy later relieved murta and became concerned plaintiff condition was the result of something more serious than pneumonia.after performing additional tests,stacy confirmed phillips was suffering from bacterial endocarditis.phillips condition worsened and he was pronounced dead on september.all parties agree the cause of death was acute bacterial endocarditis.
procedural history 
plaintiffs sued hillcrest medical center,carolyn cobb,and emergency physicians,incorporated later amended to tulsa emergency physicians,incorporated tep.the suit related only to the evaluation,diagnosis,and treatment provided phillips on september.plaintiffs alleged defendants violated the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala and also brought a claim for wrongful death under oklahoma medical malpractice law for failing to properly treat phillips.
prior to trial,the district court dismissed the emtala claim against cobb and tep.the remaining claims were presented to a jury.at the close of evidence,the district court sustained hmc rule motion,holding no emtala claim existed as a matter of law,and sustained appellants rule motion that cobb was the agent of hmc the district court submitted the issue of medical death to the jury and a verdict in favor of hmc was returned.plaintiffs filed this appeal.
summary of issues on appeal 
on appeal,appellants raise four issues.appellants allege the district court erred in granting hmc rule motion as to the emtala claim,admitting allegations of phillips drug use,excluding plaintiffs expert testimony regarding the cause of bacterial endocarditis,and refusing to allow of hmc nurse regarding exhibit and exhibit.
ii.analysis 
appellants argued at trial that hmc treated phillips differently than similarly situated patients because he was alleged to be uninsured and that hmc established procedures were not followed.the district court ruled no evidence of differential treatment was presented and,at most,the complained of conduct amounted to negligence.see vol.ii.at the invitation of the district court appellants are now pressing similar argument before this court.
standard of review 
this court reviews the grant of judgment as a matter of law de novo,sitting in the same position as the trial court.see tyler mountain states,cir.pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,a trial judge may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law if,after a party has been fully heard on an issue,there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the party on that issue.see tyler,at finley united states,cir.this court has read frcp a to mean judgments as a matter of law may be granted only if the evidence points but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable inferences which may support the opposing party position.finley,at see also tyler,at relying upon reeves sanderson plumbing,d.as such,the facts and all reasonable inferences from them are viewed in the light most favorable to the appellant.see finley,at.
legal framework 
congress enacted emtala in to address the problem of dumping patients in need of medical care but without health insurance.see abercrombie osteopathic hosp.founders ass n,cir stevison enid health sys,cir.though originally intended to cure the evil of dumping patients who could not pay for services,the rights guaranteed under emtala apply equally to all individuals whether or not they are insured.see collins depaul,cir stating emtala also applies to those who are covered by health insurance see also summers baptist med.ctr.arkadelphia,cir en banc stating the statute literally applies to any individual so a lack of indigency or uninsured status does not defeat an emtala claim.thus,whether phillips was or was not actually covered by his employer insurance plan is of no consequence to the resolution of this issue on appeal.
under emtala,a participating hospital has two primary obligations.see ingram muskogee reg l med,cir.first,the hospital must conduct an initial medical examination to determine whether the patient is suffering from an emergency medical condition.see abercrombie,at.the second obligation requires the hospital,if an emergency medical condition exists,to stabilize the patient before transporting him or her elsewhere.see urban king,cir.to ensure compliance with these obligations,congress created a private cause of action.see d repp anadarko mun,cir.appellants only claim under emtala is for an alleged failure to provide an appropriate screening as required by section a.
pursuant to section a,hmc was required to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition exists.a this court has stated that whether a given hospital has performed an appropriate medical screening examination,as defined by emtala,varies with the unique capabilities of the specific hospital.see repp,at.further,we give appropriate deference to the existing screening procedures utilized by the hospital,because it,not a reviewing court,is in a superior position to determine its own capabilities and limitations.see id.at a court should ask only whether the hospital adhered to its own procedures,not whether the procedures were adequate if followed.based upon those procedures adopted and employed by a hospital,the repp court held emtala screening requirement is violated when it does not follow its own standard procedures.see id.at.
the underlying principle behind section a is to ensure all patients,regardless of their perceived ability or inability to pay for medical care,are given consistent attention.emtala requirement of an appropriate screening examination undeniably requires hmc to apply uniform screening procedures to all individuals coming to the emergency room.vickers nash hosp,cir stating uniform treatment for all patients,regardless of ability to pay,is considered the linchpin of an emtala claim.while this court has never expressly described the obligation under emtala in terms of uniform or disparate treatment,several of our sister circuits,as well as numerous district courts within this circuit,have.see marshall east carroll parish hosp.serv,cir summers,at holcomb monahan,cir scott hutchinson,a hospital satisfies the requirements of a if its standard screening procedure is applied uniformly to all patients in similar medical circumstances.tank chronister,quoting vickers,at emtala is implicated only when individuals who are perceived to have the same medical condition receive disparate treatment.to the extent it was unclear before,this court holds,as it implicitly did in repp,a hospital obligation under emtala is measured by whether it treats every patient perceived to have the same medical condition in the same manner.disparate treatment is simply another term for describing or measuring a hospital duty to abide by its established procedures.unless each patient,regardless of perceived ability or inability to pay,is treated in a uniform manner in accordance with the existing procedures,emtala liability attaches.see repp,at.
appellants claims 
appellants argued to the district court,as they have here,that evidence of a bias towards those who are uninsured is sufficient to state an emtala claim.they point to the testimony of mike lulka regarding the initial intake procedures hmc undertook and attempt to extrapolate an intolerance towards those perceived to be uninsured they also look for support in christina daczewitz testimony that she saw,some time after phillips death,a notation of no insurance on phillips medical records at hmc.appellants repeated attempts to introduce evidence regarding hmc motives are irrelevant to whether phillips was treated in a manner consistent with hmc existing procedures.this circuit,like many others,does not require any particular motive for emtala liability to attach.see repp,at stating emtala imposes strict liability.emtala looks only at the participating hospital actions,not motives.see stevison,at we construe section a as imposing a strict liability standard subject to those defenses available in the act.see also roberts galen of virginia,d stating the sixth circuit requirement of an improper motive is in conflict with several circuits,including the first,fourth,eighth,and circuit.while testimony regarding a hospital knowledge of a patient lack of insurance coverage may be relevant to explain a failure to abide by established procedures,it alone does not establish a violation of emtala requirement of uniform treatment.
moving to the crux of their emtala claim,appellants attempted to identify certain hmc policies they claim were not followed.during the rule colloquy,the district court asked appellants to point to the evidence adduced in support of the emtala claim.see vol.ii.as they have before this court,appellants pointed to exhibit and an unidentified discharge policy,claiming various aspects of these policies were not followed.the district court repeatedly implored appellants counsel to describe the evidence showing that hmc failed to screen and evaluate phillips condition.in the interest of brevity,it is sufficient to say appellants counsel reluctantly conceded hmc,either through nurse cue cobb,did in fact make a determination as to phillips condition with respect to each and every allegation of failure to abide by existing policy requirements.see vol.ii,p,ln.id.at,ln,ln.id.at,ln,ln.id.at,ln,ln.based upon these admissions and in reliance upon repp and tank chronister,the district court stated that so long as hmc performed a medical screening examination,consistent with its policies and in an effort to discern whether phillips was suffering from an emergency medical condition,emtala was satisfied.
appellants argument brings into focus the uneasy intersection between emtala and state law medical negligence claims.they argue hmc staff failed to appropriately identify appreciate the gravity of phillips condition.in other words,while they concede hmc technically complied with their standards,the practical effect was an inadequate examination.emtala was not,however,designed for such a claim.though it created a new cause of action,we have consistently recognized emtala provisions have only a limited reach and purpose.see ingram,at citing several cases for the proposition that emtala limited purpose was to eliminate.
emtala does not set a federal standard of care or replace state medical negligence laws.see,repp anadarko mun,cir power arlington hosp.ass n,cir emtala is not a substitute for state law malpractice actions,and was not intended to guarantee proper diagnosis or to provide a federal remedy for misdiagnosis or medical negligence.while providing a guaranty for an appropriate medical screening,emtala,unlike traditional state negligence or malpractice law,does not provide a remedy for an inadequate or inaccurate diagnosis.see vickers,at.for example,in collins depaul hospital,we stated the purpose of section a screening examination is to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists.nothing more,nothing less.collins,cir footnote omitted.thus,while appellants were allowed to go to the jury with their medical malpractice claim for the alleged conduct of hmc staff the district court was,as a matter of law,correct in stating no evidence of an emtala claim was presented.
in addition to the emtala claim,appellants alleged cobb and hmc violated the standard of care in the treatment of phillips.as an affirmative defense,cobb and hmc responded phillips was at fault,invoking oklahoma comparative negligence defense,for failing to notify them of his prior drug use.hmc claimed this failure to provide relevant medical information contributed to any negligent care it may have provided.
prior to trial,appellants moved to exclude any and all evidence of phillips alleged drug use.the district court denied this request and allowed testimony that phillips had used street drugs and failed to inform cobb of this information when he sought treatment at hmc.the court ruled the evidence was admissible to support hmc defense of comparative negligence.on appeal,appellants argue that the evidence was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial.
standard of review 
though appellants moved,in limine,to exclude evidence of drug testimony,they failed to renew their objection at trial.hmc admits this has sufficiently preserved the issue for appellate review.see united states,cir stating a motion in limine may preserve the ruling for review when the issue has been fairly presented to the trial court,is the type of issue that can be finally decided in a pretrial hearing,and is ruled upon without equivocation.by presenting the issue to the district court and receiving a definitive ruling,appellants were entitled to rely upon the ruling as the law of the case and to have this court review the decision under an abuse of discretion standard.see id.under this standard,we will not reverse unless there has been a distinct showing it was based on a clearly erroneous finding of fact or an erroneous conclusion of law or manifests a clear error of judgment.united states mitchell,cir internal quotations omitted.
in oklahoma,evidence of a patient failure to provide an accurate medical history is relevant to the defense of contributory negligence in a medical malpractice claim.see.tit,graham keuchel,stating patient failure to inform the medical staff about her rare blood type may be considered by the jury as an indication of her contributory negligence.in united states,for example,the plaintiff claimed p hysicians at the defendant facilities did not perform the appropriate diagnostic tests to determine the source of plaintiff medical condition,despite the defendants failure to adequately test or perform diagnostic tests,the court reduced plaintiff damages because she failed to give her accurate medical history to the treating physicians.see id.at applying oklahoma law.based upon oklahoma law,there can be little doubt phillips failure to inform hmc cobb of his medical history was relevant and necessary to the defense of contributory negligence 
unfair prejudice 
even assuming phillips failure to inform hmc of his prior drug use was relevant,appellants claim the district court erred
