amended opinion 
sherman petty sustained serious injury to his jaw during a fight with other inmates in the franklin county correctional institute.he sued numerous county defendants under,alleging primarily that they violated his eighth amendment rights by failing to protect him and by failing to provide him with adequate medical care.in particular,petty claimed that the county delay in allowing him to undergo surgery,and its failure to provide him exclusively with a soft diet prior to the surgery,was the direct cause of his suffering further injury.the district court dismissed petty claims against some defendants for failure to state a claim,and against others upon their successful motion for summary judgment.petty now appeals the dismissal of his claims.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
on april,petty was placed in the franklin county correctional institute after being sentenced to serve days in jail.he was put in a cell with about twenty other inmates.according to petty,as he was reading a book and sitting on a bunk bed,two inmates picked a fight with him,punching and kicking him several times.they also struck petty with his own shoe and with an unidentified object.the entire altercation lasted about five minutes,at which point petty was finally able to get a guard attention.the guard realized petty was seriously injured,because he was bleeding badly from the mouth,and thus let him out of the cell and gave him a towel to soak up the blood.
petty initially told the guard that he fell off a bunk,but upon the guard prodding admitted that they beat me up.the guard then brought pictures of the inmates to petty so that he could identify who had beaten him.he positively identified two inmates.petty was then taken to a doctor at the jail,who recommended that he be transported to the ohio state medical center emergency room for treatment.
petty was initially examined by sorabh khandelwal and chadwick miller,who determined that his jaw was broken in two places.one of the fractures did not require surgery.the second fracture did require surgery,but not immediately,and thus petty was discharged with instructions to take percocet for pain,amoxicillin to prevent infection,and to be kept on a soft diet.the attending surgeon who ultimately operated on petty,gayle gordillo,stated that he was not operated on immediately because the injury occurred late on a friday night,and she does not perform surgeries on the weekends except in emergencies.
in the early morning hours of saturday,april,petty was returned to jail and placed in a cell designated for medical care.petty admits that every day he was given his prescribed medications,but the parties dispute what kind of food he was actually served.petty claims that he only got fed a liquid diet three times when he was in jail,whereas the other times he was fed the regular,menu.the sheriff office counters that he was fed according to a special dietary order which specifically prescribed a liquid diet.despite receiving medication,petty claims he was in considerable pain,and continually requested to see the doctor,only to be rebuffed by jail deputies.gordillo contacted the sheriff office medical department on april,requesting that petty be brought in for surgery on thursday,april,or friday,april.she was informed that,due to personnel issues,he could not be transported on the thursday,and friday would not work either,because the jail never transports patients on friday.
petty was released from incarceration on saturday,april well before his sentence was up,evidently,and gordillo performed the surgery to realign his jaw on the following tuesday,april.he was discharged on the same day.however,he returned to the emergency room on april with symptoms of an infection.gordillo treated him for a wound infection with a course of intravenous antibiotics and rest.he was released from ohio state medical center on april.
gordillo examined petty on a visit on april and again on may.he was experiencing some weakness in his right lower lip,which gordillo stated could be attributable to his surgery,but is not attributable to the delay in surgery or treatment,and is not attributable to the infection that petty incurred subsequent to his injury and surgery.as to the infection,gordillo posited as follows the timeframe between petty injury and surgery was longer than normal.it may or may not have contributed to the infection certainly,the longer an injury or wound remains open,the greater the risk for infection becomes.petty was scheduled for another visit on may,but he did not appear,and he subsequently discontinued treatment with gordillo.
petty brought suit in federal district court under.the gravamen of his complaint concerned violations of his rights under the eighth amendment.named as defendants were franklin county,ohio,the franklin county sheriff office,sheriff james karnes,and john does.john does and were sheriff department employees john doe was allegedly on duty and assigned to the area of the jail where petty was attacked john doe allegedly served petty his meals,and brought only solid foods,not the prescribed soft diet.compl.at.john does and are the two inmates identified visually by petty after the incident,and later by name through jail records.the specifics of petty allegations were as follows first,that the county defendants failed to protect him from other inmates and second,that the county defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs when he was returned from the hospital,by a denying him access to medical care for his bleeding mouth,b failing to provide him on all occasions with the soft diet prescribed by gordillo,and c failing to accommodate the request of gordillo that he return for surgery on april or.petty also sought to hold the county,the sheriff department,and sheriff karnes liable under on a theory of municipal liability.finally,petty asserted claims of negligence against the county defendants,and claims of assault and battery against john does and.
defendants franklin county,the sheriff office,and john does and moved for dismissal of petty claims pursuant to.b.the district court granted this motion as to all of these defendants.first,citing barrett wallace,d,the district court held that the franklin county sheriff office is not a legal entity capable of being sued under.op.at.second,as to defendant john does and,the court found that they had never been properly identified or served pursuant to.m.the district court held plaintiff had ample time to identify john does and.the court finds no cause sufficient to justify setting aside the requirement of dismissal under rule m.op.at.finally,as to defendant franklin county,the district court noted that under monell department of social services,d,a county may be found liable only if the alleged constitutional violation arose from an official policy or custom of the county.accordingly,the court held as follows 
plaintiff identifies no official custom or policy of franklin county with regard to his constitutional claim.in addition,plaintiff fails to come forward with any facts to demonstrate how,even if there were a custom or policy of the county,his injuries are causally linked to the county alleged failure to train supervise.consequently,plaintiff municipal liability claim fails as a matter of law.
the only one of petty claims to survive beyond the b stage was an eighth amendment claim against sheriff karnes for his deliberate indifference to petty serious medical needs.sheriff karnes moved for summary judgment on this claim and the district court granted the motion,finding that petty had met neither the objective nor the subjective component of a claim as to medical care.see blackmore kalamazoo county,cir.the district court noted that under the objective component,petty must place verifying medical evidence in the record to establish the detrimental effect of the delay.op.at citing napier madison county,cir.the court found that petty failed to meet this burden petty surgeon avers that it was not necessary to operate on petty on the day of the injury.further,the evidence shows that the infection petty later suffered and the difficulty he experienced moving his mouth after surgery were of the surgery itself,not attributable to petty receiving surgery approximately ten days after the incident at the jail.id.at citation omitted.as to the subjective component,the district court noted that petty burden was to show that the county actors had a sufficiently culpable state of mind.napier,at.this burden petty again failed to meet the undisputed evidence of record shows that plaintiff was designated to a medical cell when he was returned from the ohio state university medical center on april.in addition,plaintiff received his medicine and a liquid diet as prescribed.op.at.in other words,petty had pointed to no actions by county actors that could reasonably be construed as constituting behavior deliberately indifferent to his medical needs.
having dismissed petty federal claims,the district court declined to reach the merits of any of his claims.petty now appeals,raising three issues for review.
we review de novo both the b and summary judgment rulings below.the district court dismissal of a civil rights complaint on a b motion is scrutinized with special care.gazette city of pontiac,cir.in reviewing the dismissal,we must therefore construe the complaint liberally in the plaintiff favor and accept as true all factual allegations and permissible inferences therein.id.although a complaint need not set down in detail all the particularities of a plaintiff claim,westlake lucas,cir,the complaint must nevertheless give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,conley gibson,d.thus,a b motion tests whether the plaintiff has stated a claim for which the law provides relief.gazette,at.
in our review of a district court grant of summary judgment,the facts and any inferences that can be drawn from those facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party.bennett city of eastpointe,cir citing matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting.c.
dismissal of defendant john does and 
m provides in pertinent part as follows 
if service is not made upon a defendant within days after the filing of the complaint,the court shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to that defendant or direct that service be effected within a specified time provided that if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure,the court shall extend the time for service for an appropriate period.
petty filed his complaint on april.he has yet to identify john does and,and thus has yet to serve them,clearly in violation of the window provided by rule m.furthermore,the district court ruled on this particular b motion only after the close of is,petty was given ample time to figure out who john does and might be.the thrust of petty argument,however,seems to be that john does and should not have been dismissed because even if not personally actually served,they were on constructive notice of the lawsuit.in other words,because sheriff karnes and franklin county were properly served,the two john doe served at the direction of the sheriff and the county and whose behavior allegedly gave rise to some of petty have been on notice that they were being sued as well.
what petty fails to grasp,however,is that his argument makes sense only if,at some point,he actually substitutes the names of real persons for his john doe defendants to be sure,the john does and in this case could reasonably have been expected to know of petty suit,assuming of course both remain in franklin county employ.but that is not enough to make them parties to the lawsuit without their being specifically named.see,doe sullivan county,cir although as jailers the three defendants reasonably could be expected to have known of the instant suit,this alone is insufficient to impute to them knowledge of their future status as defendants.many jailers and employees who were not named as defendants were aware of and even deposed in this case.
it should not have been difficult to obtain the name of john doe,the individual petty alleges was on duty and assigned to the area of the jail where he was attacked and failed to intervene or otherwise protect him during the attack compl.at.nor should it have been difficult to identify john doe,who petty alleges gave him only solid foods upon his return from the hospital,despite his request and the doctor orders for a soft diet.compl.at.nor is there a scintilla of evidence in the record that franklin county in any way impeded petty efforts to discover the identities of john does and.in fact,nowhere in his appellate brief does petty offer a rational any explanation at all,for that why the identities of john does and still elude him even after discovery.
the district court was therefore correct in dismissing john does and from the lawsuit,and this the two county officials most directly implicated in petty civil rights undermines the remainder of petty claims 
dismissal of defendants franklin county and franklin county sheriff office 
the district court dismissed the franklin county sheriff office as a party because under ohio law,a county sheriff office is not a legal entity capable of being sued for purposes of.see barrett,d at.in his appellate brief,petty cites only one case to refute this authority,united food commercial workers local city of sidney,cir.but united food is totally inapposite,because it did not involve an ohio county sheriff office as a named defendant.rather,it involved a county sheriff as named defendant.unlike a county sheriff office,the sheriff himself may be considered a proper legal entity for purposes of suit under.in fact,that is exactly what the district court did in allowing petty suit against sheriff karnes to proceed at least to the summary judgment stage.there is no merit,therefore,to petty argument that the franklin county sheriff office be implicated as a separate legal entity in this suit.see also batchik summit county sheriff dep t,wl,at ohio,unreported noting that the summit county sheriff,but not the summit county sheriff department,was an entity capable of being sued.
we also affirm the district court dismissal of defendant franklin county,but on alternate grounds.under monell department of social services,d,county liability is limited to situations in which the deprivation of constitutional rights results from an official policy or custom of the county.the mandate of monell and its progeny requires that a municipality be held liable only when execution of a government policy or custom,whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy,inflicts the injury,monell,at,and that there be an affirmative link between the policy and the particular constitutional violation alleged,oklahoma city tuttle,d.see bennett,at cir.the initial question,then,is whether or not petty complaint properly states a claim for municipal liability under monell and tuttle.
the third claim in petty complaint,labeled as municipal liability,states in full as follows 
plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference thereto the preceding paragraphs as if fully rewritten herein.
said acts by the individual defendants county,franklin county sheriff department,jim karnes,john doe and john doe,were proximately caused by certain customs and policies of defendants county,franklin county sheriff department and karnes,including but not limited to,a failure to adequately and reasonably train,supervise and discipline officers in such a way to properly protect the constitutional rights of citizens and a specific set of policies established during the days of the incidents described above,which had the effect of permitting,encouraging,approving and ratifying violations of the constitutional rights of citizens,including plaintif,as described above.
defendants actions and conduct were the actual and proximate cause of
