jolene moss applied for disability insurance benefits after injuring her right ankle in a car accident.an administrative law judge alj concluded that moss impairment is severe but not disabling.the social security appeals council declined to review the decision.moss sought review in the district court,which upheld the commissioner denial of benefits.moss now appeals to this court.we conclude that the alj erred in discounting the opinions of moss treating physician and in assessing moss credibility.we also conclude that the alj finding that moss impairment does not meet or equal a listed impairment in the social security regulations is not supported by substantial evidence.accordingly,we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
background 
moss filed her application for benefits in october.she had been working as a attendant for six years before she fractured and dislocated her right ankle and suffered a severe laceration on her right knee in a car accident.at the time of the accident,she was years old,had a education,and had previously worked as a housekeeper in hotels and nursing homes.after the accident,however,moss was unable to return to her job at the gas station.
moss underwent immediate surgery to repair her ankle and was released from the hospital three days after the accident.two months later,the pins that had been used to repair the fracture were removed.moss surgeon,asamonja roy,an orthopedic specialist,thought that moss was doing well and encouraged her to begin walking and putting weight on her right foot.moss started physical therapy and by was walking and able to bear to of her weight on her right foot.by december she was able to walk at least feet with the use of a cane.
in the months following her accident,moss also was treated by her family physician,steven norris.a month after the injury,norris detected damage to the peripheral nervous system of her ankle as a result of the fracture.in january he reviewed of her ankle and observed a bone formation that he suspected was limiting her range of motion,which,he reported,was generally pretty good.norris also noted that moss was suffering from r ight lower extremity neuropathy,for which he prescribed neurontin and advised her to continue with physical therapy.
five months after the accident,in march,moss was still experiencing difficulties,so she scheduled appointments with a neurologist as well as a second orthopedic specialist.moss met first with the neurologist,rakesh garg,who was referred to her by roy.following his examination,garg concluded that moss had a slight limitation of movement in her right ankle,but he did not detect any nerve damage.
five days later moss met with steven kodros,the orthopedic specialist,who,unlike garg,described her range of motion as quite limited.kodros noted that moss was experiencing pain when she flexed her ankle,and that she had stiffness,tenderness,and diminished sensation in her right foot.he further observed that moss was walking with a steppage gait pattern and using a cane.kodros reviewed an outside ct scan and of moss ankle and found some mild residual bony deformity and some early degenerative changes.he noted that moss had residual symptoms consistent with the natural history of her injury itself and more specifically related to residual posttraumatic arthrofibrosis,periarticular soft tissue adhesions,and likely the early development of some early posttraumatic arthritis.kodros ordered a second ct scan and several weeks later followed up with moss about his findings.the new ct scan confirmed that the fracture itself had healed but not without leaving small bony fragments and debris in the ankle.he noted some early degenerative changes and features that suggested avascular of the bone tissue.based on these findings,kodros recommended conservative management that would include use of a customized arizona and corticosteroid injections.should these measures fail,he indicated during this march consultation,he would recommend surgery.
moss next saw kodros in february.the exam revealed that her condition had not improved.moss had not obtained the arizona brace because her insurance would not cover it,so kodros gave her a temporary brace and repeated his recommendation that she attempt conservative management before resorting to more surgery.several weeks later,moss also visited norris for a routine.he noted that she was wearing an ankle brace and had a limited range of motion in her right ankle and an altered gait due to pain.
before her car accident,moss had received medical treatment for other unrelated ailments.medical records document treatment in early for diverticulosis,chronic constipation,hyperthyroidism,sinusitis,and fatigue.and before that,in,moss was diagnosed as suffering from migraine headaches.
the social security administration denied moss application a month after it was filed.a month after that,the agency also denied reconsideration.moss requested further review,and in january an alj heard testimony from moss and a vocational expert.
moss testified that she experiences chronic pain,as well as stiffness,tightness,and swelling in her right ankle.she stated that she is unable to sit or stand for extended periods of time and can not walk with full weight on her right foot,resulting in back and hip pain.the pain,she said,interferes with her sleep,requiring her to take sleeping pills.she continues to take neurontin to alleviate the burning feeling and pins and needles sensation in her ankle.she also takes tylenol arthritis and motrin,which provide only minimal relief but do not cause the drowsiness and constipation she experienced with the prescription pain medications she had been taking.
in describing her daily activities,moss stated that she is able to dress herself and bathe using a stool.she tries to do housework but can no longer squat or bend she is able to make light meals and wash dishes,though standing is painful.she no longer drives or does any yard work,laundry,or grocery shopping.moss testified that during her husband frequent business travels,her adult daughter,who lives with them,helps with the laundry and shopping.for exercise,moss said,she uses her cane to take occasional walks around the block and up and down the driveway.
the alj asked a vocational expert ve whether there are jobs available to a graduate who is limited to unskilled,sedentary work that requires no climbing and only minimal standing and walking.the ve responded that although moss can not perform her past relevant work and has no transferrable skills,he found three positions that exist in significant numbers in the national cashier,ampule sealer,and surveillance system moss could perform given the limitations described.
the alj concluded that moss is not disabled because she can perform some sedentary jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy.the alj applied the sequential analysis,see,and at step one found that moss had not been engaged in substantial gainful activity and at step two that her ankle injury constitutes a severe impairment.the alj acknowledged that moss also suffers from back and abdominal pain,sinusitis,fatigue,and headaches.at step three,however,the alj found that moss ankle injury does not meet or equal a listed impairment.moving to step four,the alj found that moss can not perform her past relevant work as a cashier or housekeeper but even with all of her ailments still retains the residual functional capacity to perform some sedentary jobs.
in making these determinations,the alj declined to fully credit moss complaints of pain because,the alj said,there had been no medical finding that she needs a cane or that she is unable to effectively ambulate.the alj further stated that the medical evidence and moss own account of her daily activities do not corroborate her testimony concerning the intensity,duration,and limiting effects of her symptoms.the alj additionally discounted the medical opinions of kodros,the orthopedic specialist.the alj characterized kodros opinions as inconclusive and inconsistent with garg findings,and surmised that some of kodros medical opinions may have been made to
