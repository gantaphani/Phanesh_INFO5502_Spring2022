the federally supported health centers assistance act of fshcaa,stat.codified as amended at,makes community health centers and their employees,officers,and individual contractors eligible for medical malpractice coverage under the federal tort claims act ftca,to the same extent as federal employees of the united states public health service.see g.the el rio santa cruz neighborhood health center,the center in arizona and physicians before the court provide obstetric and gynecological services for patients of the center.as a clinic that receives federal funds,the center receives professional liability coverage from the federal government pursuant to the fshcaa.see id.when the physicians were sued in the arizona state court for malpractice,the center notified the united states department of health and human services hhs of the suit and submitted information for a determination of the physicians coverage under the ftca.hhs denied the physicians coverage because they had contracted with the center through their professional corporations.joined by the center,the physicians filed a separate lawsuit challenging the denial of coverage under the administrative procedure act apa,and the district court ruled in their favor.
hhs appeals the grant of summary judgment to the center and the physicians,challenging both the district court jurisdiction under the apa and its findings that hhs failed to examine relevant evidence,namely the physicians separate guarantees to the center of their personal performance,and to treat similar cases similarly.upon de novo review,we hold that the district court had jurisdiction of the apa claim because the removal remedy under the fshcaa was not an adequate remedy that precluded apa review,and that hhs was arbitrary and capricious in failing to address evidence before it in concluding that the physicians were ineligible for medical malpractice coverage pursuant to the fshcaa.accordingly,we affirm the grant of summary judgment remanding the matter to hhs.
under the ftca,b,and public health service act phsa,congress protected officers and employees of the public health service from personal liability for the negligent or wrongful act or omission while acting within the scope of their employment by providing that the united states may assume any such liability.in enacting the fshcaa,g,congress extended ftca coverage for public health service employees to public or private entities receiving federal funds under the phsa,and to their officers,board members,employees,and contractors who are physicians or other licensed or certified health care practitioners,and meet certain criteria.id.g a see id.e,h,i.upon approval by the hhs secretary of an application,such individual is deemed to be an employee of the public health service.id.g f.the attorney general,upon notice from a deemed defendant,shall defend against,or compromise,civil actions or proceedings for such damage or injury.id.b,d.the remedy against the united states,as relevant here,for damages for personal injury,including death,resulting from the performance of medical,surgical,dental,or related functions by any commissioned officers or employee of the public health service is exclusive.id.g a.congress enacted the fshcaa to relieve publicly funded health centers of the burden of rising malpractice insurance costs,at,reprinted in.ii,at.
in order to be considered for ftca coverage,a health center must submit an application to the hhs secretary verifying that the health center,and the appropriate officer,board member,employee,or contractor of the health center,meet fshcaa requirements.g d see id.g b c,h.the secretary is required to determine within days of receipt of the application whether the applicant is to be deemed covered by the ftca.id.g e.once the secretary has determined that an applicant is covered,this determination is final and binding upon the secretary,attorney general,and other parties to a civil action or proceeding.id.g f.however,the attorney general,in consultation with the secretary,and after notice and opportunity for a hearing,may determine,based on five criteria,that covering an individual health care professional would expose the government to an unreasonably high degree of risk of loss,and that the individual shall not be deemed to be an employee of the public health service for fshcaa purposes.id.i.
once a civil action or proceeding is filed in state or local court against a public health or non profit entity or its officers or employees or contractors,the statute provides for two circumstances in which the case can be removed to the federal district court.first,if the attorney general appears in state or local court within days after being notified of the filing of the case and advises that the secretary has deemed the defendant to be a public health service employee,the case shall be removed to the federal district court.id.l see id.c.second,if the attorney general fails timely to appear,the case shall be removed to federal district court upon petition by a defendant.id.l.the case then shall be stayed until the district court conducts a hearing and determines the appropriate forum or procedure for the assertion of the claim.id.
the undisputed facts are that in january,the physicians were sued for medical malpractice by sergio puig and others plaintiffs in state court in arizona.the complaint and summonses were served on the physicians on july.by letter of january,gianturco letter,elizabeth jordan gianturco,chief of the claims and employment branch,denied el rio request for representation pursuant to the fshcaa because the individual physicians can not be deemed employees of the public health service because their contracts were between the health center and a professional corporation,and therefore did not meet the criteria under the fshcaa for coverage under the ftca.
on march,the physicians removed the malpractice action to the federal district court in arizona pursuant to and.they filed two pleadings on may,in the arizona district court.the first was a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief that they were covered by the ftca.the second was a petition pursuant to l for determination of their ftca coverage.on june,the arizona federal district court ruled that the physicians notice of removal was untimely and remanded the case to the state court the court also ruled that the remand rendered the complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief moot.
on august,the physicians and the center hereinafter the physicians filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against hhs and its secretary under,a,and the apa,in the district court in the district of columbia.ten days later they filed in the arizona state court a motion to dismiss the malpractice lawsuit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that the plaintiffs had admitted the physicians status as federal employees.the arizona state court,on october,denied the physicians motion to dismiss,and,according to the parties briefs,stayed the malpractice action pending resolution of their apa claim in federal court in the district of columbia.
on january,the district court in the district of columbia ruled that it had federal question jurisdiction under to entertain the physicians challenge to hhs coverage determination,and that no statute barred its review under the apa of the negative coverage decision.on the merits,the district court granted the physicians motion for summary judgment and remanded for want of reasoned decisionmaking.the court reversed hhs refusal to deem the physicians as public health service employees,which contradicted hhs position in a similar case,because hhs had ignored each physician contractual liability as guarantors.
on appeal,hhs challenges the grant of summary judgment to the physicians on three principal grounds,each of which the physicians dispute.our review is de novo.see dbi architects am.express servs.we first address hhs contention that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the apa because the removal remedy under the fshcaa l is adequate.we then address hhs contention that the apa action was barred under the doctrine.finally,because we conclude that hhs first two contentions are unpersuasive,we address the merits of hhs denial under the fshcaa of ftca coverage for the physicians and affirm the grant of summary judgment remanding the matter to hhs.
section of the apa provides that a gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review.hhs contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction of the physicians apa claim because the fshcaa provides removal as the means of obtaining access to a federal forum to determine the federal status of federally supported health centers and their employees or contractors,and removal is an adequate remedy precluding apa review.hhs maintains that the physicians waived their opportunity to challenge hhs negative coverage determination because their petition for removal was,in hhs view,untimely.against the background of supreme court and our caselaw defining the nature of an adequate remedy,we hold that any remedy afforded by the fshcaa is too doubtful to constitute an adequate remedy precluding apa review.
the supreme court has long instructed that the generous review provisions of the apa must be given a hospitable interpretation such that only upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review.abbott labs.gardner,d quoting shaughnessy pedreiro.rusk cort,d.in abbott laboratories,the court allowed review of agency regulations under the apa,rejecting the argument that statutory provision for review of some matters necessarily implied that congress intended to deny judicial review of other matters.id.the court pointed out that its inquiry turned on whether in the context of the entire legislative scheme the existence of that circumscribed remedy evinces a congressional purpose to bar agency action not within its purview from judicial review.id.observing that the legislative history evinced no such intent,id.at,and that the statute itself provided its remedies were not in lieu of others,id.at,the court adopted a literal reading of the statutory language.it rejected an interpretation that the savings clause was limited to review of regulations enumerated in the statute as requir ing a considerable straining both of language and of common understanding.id.at.
in bowen massachusetts,d,the supreme court addressed the meaning of adequate remedy under of the apa.while observing that was not intended to provide additional judicial remedies where the congress has provided special and adequate review procedures,the court explained that t he exception that was intended to avoid such duplication should not be construed to defeat the central purpose of providing a broad spectrum of judicial review of agency action.id.at.in that case,the court concluded that relief in the claims court is plainly not the kind of special and adequate review procedure that will oust a district court of its normal jurisdiction under the apa.id.at.not only was reviewability of a disallowance decision by the claims court doubtful,the claims court lacked equitable jurisdiction to grant prospective relief,which the court considered appropriate in light of the interaction between the states administration of an approved medicaid plan and the hhs secretary regulatory interpretation.id.at.the court was unwilling to assume a money judgment will always be an adequate substitute for prospective relief id.
this court,in turn,in determining whether an adequate remedy exists,has focused on whether a statute provides an independent cause of action or an alternative review procedure.see,envtl.def.fund reilly edf,wrestling coaches ass dep t of,council of for the blind regan council,en banc.succinctly put,where a statute affords an opportunity for de novo review,the court has held that apa review was precluded because congress did not intend to permit a litigant challenging an administrative denial to utilize simultaneously both the review provision and the apa.edf,at see wright dominguez,wl per curiam.in a distinct line of cases,the court also has held apa review is unavailable where there is a private cause of action against a third party otherwise subject to agency regulation.see wrestling coaches ass n,at godwin sec y of hous.urban.legal found.alexander,women equity action league cavazos weal,coker sullivan,council,at.while originally deferring to congressional intent to provide a remedy for an acknowledged problem,council,at,this court later embraced the doctrinal view disfavoring suits directly against federal enforcement authorities administering laws,holding that remedies against the discriminating entity were of the same genre as that which the court in council had held were adequate so as to preclude apa review,weal,at citing council,at.
a review of the removal remedy under the fshcaa indicates congress almost certainly did not intend for the fshcaa removal provisions of l to provide a review procedure for a negative deeming determination by the secretary.the plain text of the fshcaa speaks only to the final and binding nature of the secretary affirmative coverage determinations,and not to negative coverage determinations.g f.the removal of a state or local court action to the federal district court is mentioned in connection with the attorney general appearance to certify that the defendant was acting in the scope of his employment and assumes the secretary already has made a positive determination as to his status as a public health service employee.id.c.the statute later provides for the removal of a state or local court action when either the attorney general timely appears and advises that the secretary has deemed the defendant to be a public health service employee with respect to the particular action or omission at issue,or the attorney general does not timely appear and the defendant petitions for removal,and a hearing is held in the federal district court to determine the appropriate forum or procedure for the damages claim.id.l.
when the attorney general does not timely appear,the legislative history indicates that congress intended the removal section of the fshcaa to apply only where the secretary already has determined that a defendant is covered by the ftca.the house report states that the amendment to the fshcaa 
includes a provision requiring that,if a civil action or proceeding is filed in a s tate or local court against any covered health center or its covered personnel,the attorney general,within days after being notified of such filing,shall make an appearance in such case and advise such court as to whether the defendant is covered under the ftca i f the attorney general fails to appear timely,upon petition of the covered health center or its covered personnel,the civil action proceeding shall be removed to the appropriate united states district court,and the civil action or proceeding shall not be acted on until a hearing is conducted 
at emphasis added.consistent with congress concern with the length of time being taken to process malpractice claims,id.at,the house report also noted that under then current law,there was a void such that if the attorney general response was not timely,a default judgment could be filed against the covered center or covered individual.see id.at.
thus,the fshcaa text and legislative history show that the removal remedy under l was not designed to afford independent district court review of the secretary negative coverage determinations.the fshcaa is silent regarding negative coverage determinations.the removal section neither authorizes the federal district court to make the deeming determination itself de novo,or to overturn a negative coverage determination.although the text of l,when the attorney general does not timely appear,references a hearing by the district court to determine the proper forum or procedure for the assertion of the claim,the legislative history indicates this was intended to protect a covered defendant against a default judgment due to the attorney general untimeliness,rather than a negative coverage determination.
congress silence on the question of review of a negative coverage determination is understandable upon review of the statutory scheme.as the amendment makes clear,congress envisioned eliminating delays in malpractice litigation by enacting provisions requiring the secretary to act promptly on a defendant application for ftca coverage,g e,requiring the attorney general to appear promptly in state or local court,id.l,and by affording a covered defendant protection against a default judgment when the attorney general failed timely to appear,id.l.where the secretary makes a prompt negative coverage determination in accordance with g e prior to the filing of a malpractice action in state court,but see infra,the defendant could challenge the denial of coverage as final agency action in a separate action under the apa.see bennett spear,d.under the scenario that congress evidently envisioned,a defendant physician in a state court malpractice action would have no occasion to invoke l when the attorney general failed to appear,unless the secretary had deemed the physician covered by the ftca.the hearing in federal district court following l removal was designed simply to assure that the united states was substituted as the defendant in place of the center its personnel and that the case proceeded as a tort action,unless such a remedy is precluded because compensation or other benefits were available against the united states under other laws,in which event the case would be dismissed.c.
in other words,there was no need for congress to address review of negative coverage decisions.by requiring the secretary to act within days of receiving an application for coverage,congress could reasonably contemplate that physicians seeking to associate with public health care centers would have an incentive to apply promptly to the secretary and to know,prior to being sued for malpractice,whether or not they were covered by the ftca.if hhs rendered a negative coverage determination,they could challenge the decision directly under the apa,or purchase private medical malpractice insurance.
the question remains whether the relief potentially available for uncovered defendants under the removal section,l,is of the same genre,weal,at,as that available under the apa or other remedies held sufficient to preclude apa review.id.for reasons similar to those stated in weal,the fact that congress may not have intended l to be a remedy for reviewing negative coverage decisions is not dispositive.see id.however,congress lack of intent to provide a remedy,coupled with the uncertainty of the availability of a remedy in the statute,leads us to conclude that apa review is not precluded.
there is facial attractiveness to treating l as an adequate remedy for an uncovered fshcaa defendant.doing so would mean that all coverage issues under the fshcaa would be addressed in the same removal procedure,and all questions relating to the proper procedure would be before a single federal judge.the legislative history of the fshcaa indicates that when congress added the removal section it was concerned about the length of time it takes for medical malpractice actions to be processed,at.while the focus of that concern was on executive agency processing,see,and the possibility that default judgments could be rendered against covered health centers their covered personnel,id.at,requiring a malpractice defendant to use the removal procedure under l to seek judicial review of a negative coverage decision would not be inconsistent with reducing delays.were the district court to make a de novo determination of whether the defendant should be deemed a public health service employee,as the arizona federal district court suggested it would have done,then the physicians would have a federal forum to obtain the relief that they seek in their apa action.wright,wl.it also is conceivable that the district court might stay the malpractice action until the secretary has made a determination if one had not been made,although this would tend further to delay resolution of the malpractice action.or the district court might review the negative coverage determination under a standard comparable to the deferential standard of the apa,and then there would be no difference between the removal remedy and the apa remedy.
nevertheless,there are fundamental problems with this approach.the first relates to the manner in which hhs has implemented the secretary deeming responsibilities under g e.although the statute provides that the secretary shall make a determination of whether an applicant is deemed a member of the public health service covered by the ftca within days after the receipt of an application,g e,the bureau of primary health care bphc has issued a policy information notice pin stating that it does not maintain any database of individual providers covered by the ftca.see bphc pin april,at xii xix.rather,as the physicians allege in their complaint,and hhs admits in its answer to the complaint,coverage determinations for individuals are not made in advance but,instead,only after a lawsuit is filed against such individuals and is reported to hhs.the effect of postponing the coverage decision is that an individual physician providing services to a publicly funded health center can not be certain of protection from medical malpractice to possible review by the attorney general,i until after being sued.at least where a physician has not insisted on being hired as an employee of a center,the physician must either risk exposure to personal liability,incur or require the health center to incur potentially redundant medical malpractice insurance costs,contrary to the purpose of the fshcaa,or forego providing services to the health center altogether.if not for hhs manner of implementing the application provision,it is unlikely that l would have been available as an option for review of hhs negative coverage determination because such decisions likely would have been challenged before l could be invoked.
second,the removal section is silent on the time frame within which a defendant must petition for removal.several approaches are possible.hhs approach would import the limit of the general removal statute,b,triggered after the expiration of the attorney general period to appear.the arizona federal district court,ruling that until the date of the gianturco letter,there was no diversity and no federal question and hence no basis for removal,applied the limit of the general removal statute from the date of the letter.the doctrine of laches,barring removal for unreasonable delay,also might be an appropriate vehicle.ass for the advancement of colored people naacp legal def.educ.fund.whichever analysis is correct,the point is that the absence of a time limit in l underscores the uncertainty of the availability of the removal remedy.the risk is that,as here,the physicians unknowingly may lose any opportunity to challenge a negative coverage determination.
under hhs implementation of the application process under g e,therefore,the text and legislative history of the fshcaa left the uncovered physicians,upon being sued for malpractice,with a void.as such,l as a remedy for review of a negative deeming decision is fraught with uncertainty.the fshcaa does not authorize the district court upon removal to overturn a negative deeming determination or set a deadline for petitioning for removal.hhs itself is unclear on appeal whether the district court is to make a de novo coverage determination after a l removal,arguably contrary to congress decision to place that responsibility in the secretary,or to apply a deferential standard,in which event there would be little reason to bar an apa action seeking the same relief.therefore,to afford the physicians a remedy for negative deeming determinations in l,hhs approach would require some recrafting of the removal section.by contrast,by its silence on judicial review,there is no reason to conclude that in enacting the fshcaa congress intended to bar apa review of a negative coverage determination.
