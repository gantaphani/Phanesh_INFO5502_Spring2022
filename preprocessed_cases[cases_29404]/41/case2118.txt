dale schafer and marion fry challenge federal convictions that arise from their operation of a medical marijuana growing operation and dispensary in the sierra nevada community of cool,california.a jury found appellants guilty of conspiring to manufacture and distribute at least marijuana plants.the jury specifically convicted schafer of manufacturing at least marijuana plants and found fry guilty of manufacturing fewer than marijuana plants.appellants raise three claims on appeal the district court improperly denied their motion to dismiss the indictment on a theory of entrapment by estoppel without conducting an evidentiary hearing the district court erred when it precluded appellants from presenting an entrapment by estoppel defense and a medical necessity defense at trial and the district court should have reduced their sentences on a theory of sentencing entrapment.we have jurisdiction over their appeal under,and we affirm.
fry,a medical doctor,was diagnosed with breast cancer in december.she received a recommendation to use marijuana in early to help alleviate the side effects of the chemotherapy treatments she was undergoing.consequently,schafer,her husband and a practicing attorney,began cultivating marijuana plants for fry use.in july,fry contacted detective robert ashworth,an officer with the el dorado county sheriff office,to inform deputies of the marijuana grow operation detective ashworth and sergeant timothy mcnulty visited appellants residence and inspected their marijuana plants.
in late,schafer cultivation of marijuana for his wife developed into a much larger marijuana recommendation and sales business,extending well beyond personal use amounts of marijuana.during the time that schafer and fry were operating their marijuana business,ashworth and mcnulty repeatedly visited their residence and office.on one particular occasion,ashworth and mcnulty visited appellants to discuss the unrelated investigation and arrest of two of their former employees.the employees had been involved in a major marijuana growing operation on a rural ranch elsewhere in el dorado county that was not affiliated with appellants business.that separate police raid and investigation involved law enforcement personnel from both local and federal narcotics units who cooperated with one another in a joint interagency task force.
federal authorities with the drug enforcement administration dea separately began investigating appellants in late after a shipping company reported intercepting several packages containing marijuana sent from dale.this investigation included receiving reports from numerous undercover visits by local law enforcement operatives to appellants place of business for the purpose of obtaining marijuana recommendations.the information gathered through these undercover investigations was then given to federal agents.local and federal agents ultimately executed a federal search warrant at appellants business and home on september.
a federal grand jury returned an indictment against appellants on june,charging them with one count of conspiring to manufacture and distribute marijuana plants,and one count of manufacturing at least plants.appellants filed a motion to dismiss the indictment,arguing that the united states could not prosecute them because of their defense of entrapment by estoppel.in support of their motion to dismiss,they filed a memorandum from the office of national drug control policy and a letter from the attorneys general of arizona and california.the attachments emphasized that local law enforcement officers would support federal attempts to enforce the federal laws criminalizing marijuana.in their motion to dismiss,appellants alleged that both mcnulty and ashworth admitted that they were working on behalf of the federal government and further claimed that officer mcnulty had said appellants conduct was legal.
the united states opposed the motion,arguing that appellants were not entitled to invoke an entrapment by estoppel defense because they had not relied on the representations of a federal official or an authorized agent of the federal government.the opposition included a declaration from mcnulty denying that he ever represented himself as a federal official or that he encouraged appellants to continue growing marijuana.alternatively,the government contended that appellants had not reasonably relied on any of the alleged misrepresentations.to prove lack of reliance,the government submitted copies of written recommendations distributed to patients by appellants business.these recommendations included a disclaimer that unequivocally stated that marijuana remained illegal under federal law.
at a hearing conducted to address the motion to dismiss,appellants requested an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of resolving the conflict between the factual allegations in their pleadings and those in mcnulty sworn declaration.the district court denied appellants request and assumed for purposes of deciding the legal issue that mcnulty was a federal official.notwithstanding that assumption,the district court refused to dismiss the case because appellants had not adequately shown that they relied on any alleged misinformation.
before trial,the government filed a motion in limine seeking to prevent appellants from asserting either a medical necessity defense or an entrapment by estoppel defense.the government argued that the supreme court decision in united states oakland cannabis buyers cooperative,hereinafter ocbc ii,precluded any entitlement by a defendant to rely on the claimed medicinal value of marijuana and prohibited appellants from asserting a cognizable medical necessity defense.the government also sought exclusion of an entrapment by estoppel defense for the reasons stated in their opposition to appellants motion to mcnulty and ashworth were not federal officials or authorized agents of the federal government and appellants did not reasonably rely on any of their alleged misrepresentations.
appellants contested the applicability of ocbc ii and argued that a retroactive application of the supreme court decision would be a violation of the ex post facto clause.although the district court had previously rejected appellants entrapment by estoppel defense,they asked that the district court keep an open mind as to the characterization of the evidence.to further support their argument that mcnulty and ashworth were federal officials,appellants submitted an affidavit from their attorney attesting to the fact that an agent with the dea directed the investigations conducted by local law enforcement officers.appellants incorporated excerpts of the police reports chronicling the investigation of appellants business.these reports established that officers from local law enforcement agencies collaborated with federal agents to conduct undercover investigations of appellants.
the district court granted the government motion in limine.it reasoned that ocbc ii applied retroactively because the decision was foreseeable in light of a circuit split on the issue,and because marijuana had been illegal under federal law to use or possess since at least.in the alternative,the district court found that the medical necessity defense was viable for only a limited time,and appellants illegal conduct began prior to the application of the defense and continued until after the supreme court rejected the defense.the district court affirmed its earlier denial of the entrapment by estoppel defense because appellants could not identify an authorized federal government official who erroneously told them it was permissible to sell marijuana.
after the federal jury returned a guilty verdict appellants sought mitigation of their sentences on a theory of sentencing entrapment.they claimed that ashworth encouraged them to continue growing medical marijuana,that he induced them into expanding the amount of marijuana they were growing,and that they were not predisposed to illegally grow marijuana.again,appellants requested an evidentiary hearing.the district court denied the request after concluding that appellants had not shown that a federal official either bought or sold any marijuana or engaged in any transactions to make appellants manufacture a higher number of marijuana plants.appellants their sentencing entrapment claim at sentencing.the district court interpreted our precedent to require active participation by a law enforcement officer in the purchase or sale of controlled substances,and it rejected appellants request for sentence mitigation because they could not show that ashworth was actively involved in their production or distribution of marijuana.consequently,appellants were sentenced to the statutory minimum term of sixty months imprisonment.appellants timely appeal their convictions and sentences.
appellants first challenge focuses on the district court denial of their request for an evidentiary hearing on their motion to dismiss.they argue that they were entitled to an evidentiary hearing because the filings submitted in support of and in opposition to the motion to dismiss presented significant factual disputes.we review a district court denial of an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion.united states hagege,cir.
federal rule of criminal procedure allows a defendant to assert a defense in a pretrial motion if the merits of the defense can be determined without a trial of the general issue.b.however,if the pretrial motion raises factual questions associated with the validity of the defense,the district court can not make those determinations.united states shortt accountancy,cir hereinafter shortt.doing so would invade the province of the ultimate finder of fact.id.quoting united states jones,f d,cir.
appellants requested an evidentiary hearing to resolve two factual disputes presented by the motion to dismiss whether mcnulty and ashworth were federal officials or authorized agents of the federal government and whether mcnulty and ashworth erroneously informed appellants that their marijuana grow was legal under federal law these two factual disputes directly impacted the validity of appellants defense because to establish the defense appellants were required to prove reliance either on a federal government official empowered to render the claimed erroneous advice or on an authorized agent of the federal government and affirmative misleading by a government official.united states brebner,cir.thus,the factual disputes raised by the pretrial motion to dismiss were intertwined with the general issue to be decided at trial.the district court would have usurped the role of the jury had it conducted an evidentiary hearing and answered these factual questions.shortt,at.
appellants reliance on cases discussing the propriety of evidentiary hearings to resolve factual disputes raised by motions to suppress is misplaced.generally,any factual differences highlighted by a motion to suppress do not impact the ultimate issue of guilt.evidence must be suppressed when it is obtained in violation of a defendant constitutional rights.mapp ohio.a district court may make factual findings with regard to whether evidence was unconstitutionally obtained because such issues are entirely segregable from the issue of guilt.see generally shortt,at discussing the types of factual findings a district court can make to resolve pretrial motions.in this case,however,the questions raised by appellants motion to dismiss establish the viability of appellants defense the factual disputes were not segregable from the issue that was to be decided at guilt.pursuant to rule,the district court could not resolve these disputes before trial,and therefore it did not abuse its discretion when it denied appellants request for an evidentiary hearing.
in addition to challenging the district court denial of an evidentiary hearing,appellants argue that the district court further erred in denying their motion to dismiss on the merits.we review the denial of a motion to dismiss de novo.united states.holler,cir.
in order to succeed on their motion to dismiss,appellants would have had to show that they were entitled to an entrapment by estoppel defense as a matter of law.in sherman united states,the supreme court found that the defendant had established entrapment as a matter of law because it did not need to choos e between witnesses,nor judg e credibility in order to determine the merits of the defense.conversely,we have held that a defendant is not entitled to a defense of entrapment as a matter of law when there are definite conflicts in the testimony on the issue of how the defendant began selling heroin.united states griffin,cir.when such conflicts arise,the issue of whether the defendant was entrapped is a credibility question for the jury.id.
whether appellants were lulled into believing their marijuana operation was legal and done on the express authorization of agents who could bind the federal government necessitated a credibility determination that fell within the province of the jury.see mathews united states,the question of entrapment is generally one for the jury,rather than for the court.as such,the district court was precluded from holding that appellants were entitled to an entrapment by estoppel defense as a matter of law until the jury resolved the truth of the factual dispute.it did not err when it denied appellants motion to dismiss on the merits.
appellants next set of arguments contend that the district court improperly granted the government motion in limine and prohibited appellants from presenting entrapment by estoppel and medical necessity defenses.a district court decision to exclude evidence of a particular defense is reviewed de novo.brebner,at.a district court may preclude a defense if the defendant fails to make a prima facie showing that he is eligible for the defense.see united states moreno,cir.
entrapment by estoppel is the unintentional entrapment by an official who mistakenly misleads a person into a violation of the law,and it is a theory derived from the due process clause.united states batterjee,cir internal quotation and citation omitted.to establish this defense,a defendant must show that an authorized government official,empowered to render the claimed erroneous advice,who has been made aware of all the relevant historical facts,affirmatively told the defendant the proscribed conduct was permissible,that the defendant relied on the false information,and that the reliance was reasonable.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.
an entrapment by estoppel defense is available only when the defendant can demonstrate a reasonable belief that his conduct was sanctioned by the government.united states burrows,cir.even assuming what is ascribed to mcnulty and ashworth was true,appellants failed to present evidence to the district court that they relied on the alleged erroneous statements.during pretrial proceedings,the government filed examples of the written marijuana recommendation forms issued to patients by appellants business and excerpts of prior sworn expert testimony given by fry in an unrelated judicial proceeding.each of the recommendations,dated from october to september,contained a patient declaration that clearly stated that cannabis remains illegal under federal law and that appellants had not represented otherwise.fry expert testimony,given on july,unequivocally established that fry knew that marijuana remained a schedule i controlled substance under federal law and that federal law prohibited her from prescribing it since any drug listed on schedule i is deemed without medical efficacy.appellants submitted no admissible evidence that refuted the recommendations and testimony or that supported an inference that they relied on any of the alleged misrepresentations of mcnulty and ashworth.
instead,the government uncontradicted evidence established that appellants were aware that marijuana was illegal under federal law during the time that mcnulty and ashworth allegedly stated that it was legal under federal were not misled into believing that their conduct was permissible under federal law.the defense of entrapment by estoppel is inapplicable if the defendant is not misled.united states tallmadge,cir.because appellants failed to present prima facie evidence that th
