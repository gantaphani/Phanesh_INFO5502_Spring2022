gwendolyn smith,a former employee of the district of columbia department of mental health dmh,filed suit against the district,claiming she was the victim of discrimination and retaliation under the americans with disabilities act ada.the district court granted summary judgment to the district on both claims smith now appeals.we find the district court properly granted summary judgment on smith retaliation claim but abused its discretion by granting the district late motion for summary judgment on the discrimination claim.we therefore remand the case for trial on the discrimination claim.
smith worked for the dmh as a mental health specialist for over thirty years.during her service in the gulf war,smith was diagnosed with a bacterial infection the treatment for this condition led to diabetes and hypertension.smith also suffered back and shoulder injuries.after returning to work in june,she informed her supervisors at the dmh of her disabilities and was given a handicapped parking space and permitted to change her work schedule to start at rather than 
in smith role as a mental health specialist at the dmh,she had to make home visits to patients this requirement was always part of her job description,but the required frequency of visits increased in.smith claims her disability prevents her from making frequent trips up and down stairs or getting in and out of vehicles constantly,and because of these restrictions,she is physically able to make only occasional home visits to patients.
on may,smith filed a complaint with the office of human rights and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging the dmh had discriminated against her by denying her a reasonable accommodation of her disability.in the section of the complaint form designated cause of discrimination,smith checked the boxes for retaliation and disability.in part,smith complaint stated she believe d that she had been discriminated against because of her disability,in violation of the americans with disabilities act of,as amended.the eeoc dismissed her complaint and issued a right to sue letter on november,informing her that she had days to file suit.
on january,smith requested additional accommodations,including not being counted as absent without leave for time she missed,as well as being excused from home visits.on march,a dmh director noted smith patients had not been receiving home visits over the previous three months and found this unacceptable.smith informed the dmh she was unable to make home visits due to her disability all of her patients were then assigned to other employees.later that month,the district sent smith a letter stating that conducting home visits was an essential function of her position.the district found her to be an individual with a disability,and thus entitled to reasonable accommodations,but concluded there were n o p robable g rounds to support a finding that her rights in the workplace were being violated.
the dmh also filed disciplinary charges against smith based on her refusal to acknowledge kevin martin as her designated supervisor.smith admitted that she would not accept martin as her supervisor,claiming he lacked the educational background to give her instructions.smith stated that if she was given an instruction she viewed as wrong,she would not comply i do come out and say,no,i not going to do it.i just do do it.
on june,the dmh ordered smith to report for a detail at the comprehensive psychiatric emergency program cpep crisis hotline at general hospital.smith informed the dmh she would be unable to report to the cpep,claiming the hospital was too far from her home and driving there would compromise her health and place her in a position for potential imminent severe medical complications.on july,the dmh notified smith she had no accumulated leave time available and that it was instituting disciplinary measures against her.on august,the dmh denied smith request for an advance of hours of sick leave because regulations did not allow such a large advance and informed her she was going to be terminated.the stated grounds for her removal were insubordination,refusal to carry out assigned duties and responsibilities,inexcusable neglect of duty,negligence in performing official duties,including failure to follow verbal or written instructions,and insubordination and discourteous treatment,knowingly making false or unfounded and written discourteous statements concerning her immediate supervisor.
on october,after the detail to cpep would have ended,smith notified the dmh that she was ready and medically able,given accommodations,to return to work.she was not given another assignment,however,and filed another complaint with the office of human rights and the eeoc on november.in the section of the complaint form designated cause of discrimination,smith again checked the boxes for retaliation and disability.smith alleged that since she filed her first eeoc complaint,the district had retaliated against her by not allowing her a reasonable accommodation for her disability.on december,the eeoc dismissed smith complaint and issued her another right to sue letter,stating that she had days to file suit.smith retired from the dmh before disciplinary actions were finalized.
smith filed suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia on march,alleging disability discrimination and retaliation in violation of the ada the district moved for summary judgment on both claims.the district court denied the motion with respect to the discrimination claim,finding genuine issues of material fact as to whether home visits were essential to smith job and whether a reasonable accommodation was possible.smith district of columbia,d,smith i.however,the court granted summary judgment to the district on the retaliation claim,finding smith had not established a prima facie case.id.at.the court found her temporary reassignment to cpep was not an adverse action,and smith did not present a single reason or scrap of evidence permitting the inference that her request for sick leave was denied as retaliation rather than because her request exceeded the amount allowed by regulation.id 
the district court had set december,as the deadline for the district to file motions for summary judgment.on april,ten days before the scheduled start of trial,the district again moved for summary judgment,arguing smith disability discrimination claim should be dismissed as untimely.the district court granted the motion on april,finding smith had days after the eeoc sent her first right to sue letter to file suit on her disability discrimination claim,but that she had waited almost months to do so.smith district of columbia,wl,at april,unpublished opinion smith iii.the district court also found smith second eeoc complaint alleged only retaliation,not disability discrimination thus,it held that smith had not exhausted her administrative remedies with respect to her attempt to renew her claim of disability discrimination.id.at.although smith protested the district late filing,the trial court concluded the district dilatoriness did not amount to the kind of delay and game playing that have led the courts to hold that the defendant has waived the failure to exhaust defense.id.at.at the same time,the district court attempted to cure the prejudice smith suffered without nullifying the congressional policy that the courts enforce the procedural requirements congress mandated in the ada.id.all of the fees and costs generated since the district filing of its answer were completely unnecessary,the district court reasoned,as the district could have moved to dismiss the complaint at that early point hence,the district court ordered the district to pay all costs and attorney fees incurred by smith since that point,except those incurred in response to this final motion.id.
as a preliminary matter,we find that we have jurisdiction to hear smith appeal.after the district court granted summary judgment on smith disability discrimination claim,the parties filed several motions contesting the costs and attorney fees and asking for reconsideration.smith also filed a notice of appeal.the
