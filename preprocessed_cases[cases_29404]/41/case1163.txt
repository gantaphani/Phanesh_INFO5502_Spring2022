larry young appeals from the grant of summary judgment in favor of his former employer,the township of green oak,michigan.he claims that he was wrongfully discharged from his position as a police officer for the township.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
larry young,a veteran of the united states navy,began working as a police officer for the green oak township police department in.in august of,young suffered a back injury during a training exercise.the injury was diagnosed as a herniated disc,which prevented young from working for several days.
when young returned to work,he performed only light duty assignments until december of.the township chief of police,robert brookins,then suggested that young seek workers compensation benefits.young heeded brookins advice,stopped working,and submitted an application for workers compensation benefits,which was approved later that month.in april of,young physician gave young a letter that released him to return to work with a restriction to light duty.the township,however,did not allow him to return to work.
in late september of,young workers compensation benefits ceased for reasons not disclosed in the record.young alleges that the police department notified him the following month,after he had asked to be paid for work that he had performed testifying in court proceedings,that he was suspended from active duty.the police department required him to turn in his equipment and his badge at that time.
between october of and january of,young received no workers compensation benefits.in january of,however,the benefits resumed,again for reasons not disclosed in the record.the township insurer challenged the continuation of benefits in,asserting that young was no longer disabled as a result of a injury.young successfully opposed the challenge and continued to receive benefits until.
although the police department would not permit young to return to work after,he was subpoenaed on several occasions to provide court testimony about matters that he had witnessed before his injury.the last such subpoena in the record is dated in february of.young was maintained as an employee on the township records,however,until january.
according to young,he learned in that a fellow police officer had failed to report discharging his firearm during the pursuit of a suspect.the township police officers are required to report such incidents.young informed his supervisors,the township,and the county prosecutor of the violation by his fellow officer.as a result,young contends that the police department began retaliating by harassing him at work.in,a detective sergeant position became available at the police department.young applied.after learning that he had not received the position,young filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.young alleged that he had been improperly denied a promotion to the detective sergeant position at least in part because he had reported a fellow officer misconduct.
in may of,young again sent a letter to chief brookins,asking to be returned to work in a restricted capacity.his letter specified that he had weapon,lifting,weight,and movement restrictions.he also requested that he be allowed to carry an electric stun gun as part of his accommodations.brookins did not reply.in june of,young filed a second eeoc claim,alleging disability discrimination under the americans with disabilities act ada.the eeoc issued a letter to young on february.
young also learned during the spring of that the insurer that had been paying his workers compensation benefits intended to challenge the continuation of benefits.a magistrate judge with the michigan department of consumer and industry services held hearings in august and september of on whether to continue young benefits.in a written opinion filed in october of,the magistrate judge determined that young no longer suffers a work related disability and that any problems he currently suffers are the result of a degenerative condition not related to the work he was doing at the time of his injury.accordingly,young workers compensation benefits ceased.the record does not reveal whether young appealed that determination.
young filed the present suit in federal district court on may,but he failed to serve a copy of the complaint on the township.in june of,the township notified young by mail that it intended to hold a hearing before the township board of trustees the board pursuant to michigan veterans preference act vpa in order to determine whether his employment should be terminated.the hearing was scheduled to start days after the date of the letter.as the basis for young potential termination,the township stated that he was unable to perform the essential functions of a green oak township police officer,with or without accommodation,and that the conditions upon which he had requested to return to work would pose an undue hardship on the police department.
prior to the hearing,young sent chief brookins a renewed request for accommodations and sought a job as a investigator.brookins again did not reply.instead,the board held a hearing over two days in july and august of to determine whether the township should terminate young employment.after receiving testimony from several witnesses and considering oral and written arguments from the lawyers for both parties,the board issued a written decision on january,terminating young as of that date.young did not inform the township or the police department of the pending federal lawsuit at any time during the hearings.
on january,the michigan association of police,the police union,filed a grievance on young behalf that challenged his termination.chief brookins denied the grievance on the ground that young had waived his right to invoke the grievance process by electing to utilize the procedures set forth in the vpa.as alternate bases for the denial,brookins noted that the grievance was filed outside of the period specified in the parties collective bargaining agreement and was meritless in any event because young was no longer qualified to be a police officer.
procedural background 
young and the township are not strangers to litigation with each other.in july of,young filed suit against the township in the circuit court for the county of livingston,michigan the action.the complaint alleged violations of michigan civil rights act elcra and the michigan handicapper civil rights act mhcra for failure to promote,retaliation under the elcra because young had filed an eeoc claim,retaliation because he had filed a workers compensation claim,and age and disability discrimination that resulted in his constructive discharge in october of.
in july of,the trial court granted partial summary disposition in favor of the township on all but young retaliation claims.a final order was entered in september of,reflecting that the parties had entered into a conditional settlement agreement resolving these remaining issues.but the settlement agreement allowed young to appeal his mhcra claim,which young in fact pursued.the michigan court of appeals,however,affirmed the trial court,concluding that young had not established a prima facie case of discrimination under the mhcra.young green oak,wl,at.
in june of,young filed a second complaint in the livingston county circuit court,naming the township and chief brookins as defendants the action.he alleged multiple claims,including breach of contract on the basis that he was terminated without just cause for being disabled,failure to accommodate in violation of the elcra and the mhcra,disability discrimination in violation of the elcra and the mhcra,intentional infliction of emotional distress,continual harassment,hostile work environment,and conspiracy to deprive him of his civil rights.the trial court granted summary disposition for the defendants on all of young claims and,in a final order filed in november of,dismissed the case with prejudice.young timely appealed.the michigan court of appeals dismissed his appeal in an unpublished order in august of for want of prosecution.
in july of,while his state court appeal in the action was still pending,young filed a lawsuit in federal district court against the township and the police department the action.he alleged violations of his constitutional rights under,violations of michigan law enforcement administration act,and a hostile work environment.two months after the lawsuit was filed,young attorney withdrew because he was disqualified from the practice of law for reasons not reflected in the record.young then entered into a settlement agreement with the defendants in january of,and the case was dismissed with prejudice.
the present complaint was filed in may of,but,as previously noted,young did not promptly serve the township.in august of,the district court issued an order to show cause why the case should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute.young new attorney responded that young was awaiting the board decision on whether to terminate him.the district judge issued a second order to show cause in february of because the case had still not progressed.in response,young filed an amended complaint and served the township.this amended complaint alleged violations of the ada,michigan persons with disabilities civil rights act pwdcra,employment discrimination,deprivation of procedural due process,retaliatory discharge under,and a violation of the state whistleblowers protection act.the township filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that young claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata.in september of,the district court agreed and granted the township motion.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court decision to grant summary judgment.int l union cummins,cir.summary judgment is proper where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
b.the yinger decision 
the district court relied on this court unpublished decision in yinger city of dearborn,wl cir,in concluding that res judicata barred young complaint.in yinger,this court held that res judicata barred a former police officer successive lawsuit for breach of contract and violations.id.at.at the outset,we must determine whether the district court reliance on yinger was appropriate.
brian yinger was a dearborn,michigan police officer who was placed on indefinite medical leave without pay after two psychologists diagnosed him with paranoid personality disorder and deemed him psychologically unfit to serve as a police officer.id.yinger then filed a complaint in federal court against the city,its pension board,and various city employees,alleging state and federal constitutional violations as well as wrongful discharge.his complaint was dismissed.a third psychologist later found yinger fit for service based in part on yinger of his distinguished,but entirely fictitious,military service record.the city declined,after investigation,to return him to duty.id.
yinger then filed a second lawsuit in michigan state court,alleging breach of contract and various constitutional violations.this complaint was also dismissed,and the michigan court of appeals affirmed because yinger had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.while his appeal was pending,yinger filed an administrative charge against his union,which was denied by an administrative law judge alj.the michigan employment relations commission affirmed the alj decision.id.finally,yinger applied for a duty disability pension.after hearing argument from yinger,the pension board granted him a disability pension,determining that his paranoid personality disorder was not work related.
yinger then sued the city in federal court,alleging violations of the ada and the mhcra,failure to accommodate,breach of contract,and several constitutional violations.the district court dismissed the ada,mhcra,and due process claims on the basis of res judicata and the applicable statutes of limitations,and the equal protection claim for failure to state a cause of action.id.
this court affirmed,finding that the heart of yinger claims in each lawsuit was his disagreement with the defendants determination that he was unfit to serve as a police officer because of his psychological condition.id.at.yinger introduced no new evidence to establish that he was fit for duty,and the city and other defendants responded to each lawsuit by stating that they had not changed their position regarding his return to work.id.the yinger court noted that yinger failed to recognize that a discrimination claim accrues when the operative decision is made,not when a plaintiff experiences the consequences of that decision.id.at,citing chardon fernandez,d.further,the court concluded that michigan law regarding res judicata bars the parties from relitigating claims that they could have raised in an earlier action.id.at citations omitted.
young contends that yinger can be distinguished on its facts because yinger suffered from a condition paranoid personality disorder that rendered him unfit to serve as a police officer.in contrast,young argues that he is fit to serve as a police officer with certain reasonable accommodations.but this is a difference in degree only,and one that we find insufficient to distinguish yinger.young situation is factually very similar to involve plaintiffs who had filed previous lawsuits raising substantially the same claims arising out of the same events against their respective police departments.even though yinger was an unpublished decision of this court,we conclude that the district court nevertheless appropriately considered yinger for its persuasive value.
young next suggests that we should follow the tenth circuit case of morgan city of rawlins,cir,which decided a res judicata issue arising from an action brought in wyoming.the wyoming supreme court had circumscribed that state res judicata doctrine in the case of cook elmore,holding that the doctrine does not bar a second suit unless the second suit is not only between the same parties,but between them in the same right or capacity.id.at.accordingly,the morgan court applied wyoming law to determine that res judicata did not bar a second case between the plaintiff and his former employer where the first case alleged procedural issues and the second case alleged substantive issues.morgan,at finding that wyoming common law recognizes equitable considerations in the application of res judicata and will not preclude litigation for highly technical reasons that would prevent litigants from presenting their claims against others for determination on their merits.quotation marks omitted.michigan,in contrast,has adopted the broad doctrine of res judicata,barring every claim arising from the same transaction that the parties,exercising reasonable diligence,could have raised but did not.adair michigan,rev on other grounds.we thus find morgan distinguishable and of no benefit to young.
res judicata under michigan law 
the res judicata effect of a judgment in federal court is governed by the full faith and credit act.see,smith,hinchman grylls,assocs.tassic,cir concluding that the full faith and credit act requires a federal court to look to state court law of res judicata.law directs federal courts to give to a state court judgment the same preclusive effect as would be given that judgment under the law of the state in which the judgment was rendered.migra warren city sch.dist.bd.of,d.the doctrine of res judicata bars a successive action in michigan if the prior action was decided on the merits,both actions involve the same parties or their privies,and the matter in the second case was,or could have been,resolved in the first.adair,at.if the three elements are established,then res judicata serves to bar every claim arising from the same transaction that the parties,exercising reasonable diligence,could have raised but did not.adair,at.
prior final decision on the merits 
the district court reviewed the litigation history between the parties and found that the township had established that a final decision has been reached on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction as to the first and second cases filed before the livingston county circuit court.moreover,the record establishes that the district court properly concluded that the claims raised in the action and the action,which were decided on the merits,suffice to meet the first element of the res judicata determination.in contrast,the action was dismissed pursuant to a settlement agreement.
same parties 
the parties do not dispute that the lawsuit before us involves the same parties as the previous three lawsuits.this establishes the second element of the res judicata determination.
matters that were or could have been resolved in the prior actions 
young contends that the claims in the instant lawsuit could not have been raised in any of his prior actions against the township because the claims had not yet accrued.we will consider each of his claims below.
ada and pwdcra claims 
the district court agreed with the township that the case now on appeal constituted an attempt to challenge the township original,unchanged decision not to permit young to return to work.young concedes that he has had prior claims against the township,but asserts that the claims in his present case were not ripe for adjudication at the time.specifically,young argues that his claims arising from the vpa hearing did not accrue until he was actually terminated in.young also contends that he could not have brought the present action until he received a letter from the eeoc,which he did not receive until.
the township,however,argues that young is simply seeking to launch a fresh attack on the township decision that ended his active duty service.both the action and the action raised claims relating to the township allegedly discriminatory action and,in both cases,the township prevailed.
the district judge,applying yinger,found that the d efendant in this case has never changed its position from its decision in that young was unable to return to work because his disability rendered him unable to perform the duties of a police officer.an employer refusal to undo a discriminatory decision is not a fresh act of discrimination.yinger,wl,at.the michigan court of appeals had found in favor of the defendants on the age and claims in young action,and the state trial court granted summary disposition to the defendants on all of young claims in the action.because those actions included claims for age and disability discrimination,as well as alleged violations of the mhcra the predecessor to the pwdcra,the district court properly held that res judicata barred counts i ada and ii pwdcra of young present lawsuit.
employment discrimination claims under 
the district court found that young claims for employment discrimination,retaliatory discharge,and procedural due process violations were barred by res judicata as well.these claims were based on the board decision to terminate young after it conducted a hearing under the vpa in.the district court determined that t he board decision was not a fresh act of discrimination because it was the same decision made by defendant in not to return plaintiff to work.with respect to the employment discrimination claim count iii,young action alleged constructive discharge,indicating that young recognized that he could bring an employment discrimination claim at least as early as.
but young contends that he could not have raised his claims for employment discrimination and retaliatory discharge until after the vpa hearing.he argues that n either officer young nor anyone else could have anticipated that he would be terminated at some unknown future point in time for whatever reasons.at the time of the prior actions in the,he was still employed by the township,had not yet made his and requests for accommodation,had not had a vpa hearing or been terminated by the board,and had not received a letter from the eeoc.all of these points,however,are insufficient to overcome the application of res judicata to most of his claims.
although young was technically still employed by the township prior to january of,he had been sufficiently dissatisfied with his situation to complain of employment discrimination,retaliation,and constructive discharge long before.young had requested accommodation on at least two occasions prior to,once when he sought to return to work on light duty and again when he applied for a position as a investigator with the police department.these requests were denied,and the denials formed the basis for young first charge of discrimination with the eeoc in.the record does not include a letter from that time,but young alleged employment discrimination and retaliation in both the action and the action.
all of young employment discrimination and retaliation claims arise from the township refusal to return him to work.we thus conclude that the district court properly found that res judicata barred the relitigation of these claims.
whistleblowers protection act claim 
young also argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the township on his whistleblowers protection act wpa claim.he contends that he was terminated in retaliation for bringing an eeoc discrimination charge and for contacting public officials and the media about alleged violations of police department reporting rules,both of which are protected activities under the wpa.see phinney perlmutter,discussing the required elements of a prima facie case under the wpa.the district court found that young wpa claim arose from the same allegedly discriminatory township refusal to return him to set forth in both the and the actions.
under the wpa,
a n employer shall not discharge,threaten,or otherwise discriminate against an employee because the employee reports,verbally or in writing,a violation or a suspected violation of a law or regulation or rule promulgated pursuant to law of this state,a political subdivision of this state,or the united states to a public body,unless the employee knows that the report is false,or because an employee is requested by a public body to participate in an investigation,hearing,or inquiry held by that public body,or a court action.
comp.laws.nothing in the wpa prevented young from bringing a claim under the act prior to his termination.
as previously discussed,young raised two claims of retaliation for engaging in protected activity in his action the filing of a charge of discrimination with the eeoc and the filing of a workers compensation claim.this supports the district court determination that young was aware that he could bring a retaliation claim as of.in his present complaint,young alleges that the township and members of the police department began retaliating against him for his whistleblowing activities as early as.but he gives no reason as to why he could not have raised his wpa claim in a prior action.the statutory language clearly allowed him to do so.res judicata thus operates to bar his wpa claim in the present lawsuit.
veterans preference act and due process claims 
young contends that his due process claim under did not accrue until after the board issued its opinion terminating his employment because,prior to that time,he technically remained a township employee.both the language of the vpa and a survey of michigan caselaw support his contention that he could not have raised these claims in any of his earlier actions against the township.see.comp.laws no veteran shall be removed except for incompetency and such veteran shall not be removed except after a full hearing before the township board emphasis added see also,deleon city of ecorse,wl,dist.lexis denying summary judgment to the city because disputed issues of fact remained about whether the city failure to hold a vpa hearing before terminating a police officer violated his due process rights sherrod city of detroit,the failure of a defendant to
