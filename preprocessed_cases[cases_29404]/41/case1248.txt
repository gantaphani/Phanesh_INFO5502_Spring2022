petitioner eastover mining appeals an order issued by the benefits review board of the united states department of labor,finding respondent dorothy sue williams,widow of decedent gordon williams,entitled to an award of benefits pursuant to the black lung benefits act.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the benefits review board.
decedent was born on january,and died on july.according to his death certificate,decedent died from a pulmonary embolism due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd,itself caused by an acute gastrointestinal bleed.decedent smoked between one pack and pack of cigarettes daily for approximately four decades before quitting in.decedent worked as a surface miner for years,retiring in when the mine where he worked ceased operations.he applied for and ultimately received federal black lung benefits,although state officials denied his claim for occupational disability benefits 
decedent relevant medical history begins in april of,when jerry woolum diagnosed decedent with copd and acute bronchitis woolum has board certifications in general practice and surgery.decedent saw many other physicians in connection with his claim for living worker benefits and these doctors ordered numerous.sixteen different readers analyzed these images,and only one of the six in radiology felt any film showed pneumoconiosis 
in march of,dahhan examined decedent in connection with his living miner disability claim.although dahhan believed decedent suffered from a pulmonary or respiratory impairment,dahhan thought decedent continued smoking caused the problem because the pattern of impairment disclosed in pulmonary function studies,the absence of evidence of pneumoconiosis,and the presence of occasional crepitations on clinical examination are all indicia of disability induced by smoking,not coal dust.
on october,robert penman examined decedent.although penman had neither certification nor board certification in radiology,penman diagnosed decedent with pneumoconiosis based on decedent.penman concluded that decedent suffered pulmonary impairment partly from pneumoconiosis and partly from smoking.penman could not separate the two risk factors.
william anderson examined decedent on november.anderson found no evidence of pneumoconiosis in decedent.anderson instead suspected copd due to smoking.anderson also diagnosed hypertensive cardiovascular disease,mixed psychoneurosis and osteoarthritis.
clarke examined decedent on december.he diagnosed pneumoconiosis by as well as severe restrictive and obstructive lung disease based on pulmonary function studies.clarke declared that pneumoconiosis rendered decedent totally disabled.
ballard wright examined decedent on march.wright read one of decedent as positive for pneumoconiosis and interpreted his pulmonary function studies as showing severe restrictive and obstructive impairment,but concluded that smoking caused decedent poor pulmonary function.
with respect to the woolum,decedent treating physician,pneumoconiosis is mentioned only briefly in the previous history section of his report pneumoconiosis appears in woolum medical record twice,in december of,when decedent reported anxiety and depression related to his pursuit of black lung benefits,and second,in january of,when woolum again listed pneumoconiosis in the previous history portion of a medical report.these are the only references to pneumoconiosis woolum recorded.
over the next eleven years between decedent initial visit to woolum and his eventual death,woolum treated decedent for a cyst,hypertension,a hernia,acute influenza,peripheral vascular disease,acute bronchitis,pneumonia,a transient ischemic attack,several episodes of respiratory distress,carotid artery disease,acute gastrointestinal bleeding,a urinary tract infection,and acute septicemia.in july of,woolum diagnosed copd.during decedent final hospitalization,woolum reported massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding,erosive gastritis,and active peptic ulcer disease.decedent died despite surgical intervention intended to stop the bleeding.
the hospital discharge papers included these final diagnoses pulmonary embolism pulmonary fibrosis emphysema acute upper gi bleed ulcer acute anemia due to severe blood loss gastritis with hemorrhage cor pulmonale and peripheral vascular disease.during his treatment of decedent,woolum never conducted regular pulmonary function studies or blood gas tests,nor did woolum diagnose pneumoconiosis.
procedural history 
respondent filed for survivor benefits on august,two weeks after decedent death.on january,after administrative processing by the department of labor dol,a claims examiner denied respondent claim because she failed to establish decedent died from pneumoconiosis.on may,dol reversed itself and found the evidence sufficient.at petitioner request,the claim proceeded to an administrative law judge alj for trial.
on may,the alj issued a decision and order denying respondent claim.alj charles rippey considered a february,report by woolum that claimed 
decedent pulmonary disease progressed during the years i cared for him and the last several years of his life he was in respiratory failure most of the time.he was hospitalized several times requiring ventilatory support to keep him alive.the terminal event was likely a pulmonary embolus.unfortunately,an autopsy was not granted by the family.i have no problem stating that this gentleman was disabled secondary to his lung disease of which pneumoconiosis,in my mind,was certainly a contributing factor.
at.before trial,however,alj rippey met with both sides and informed respondent counsel that this letter alone did not constitute sufficient proof.
at trial,respondent introduced a new letter from woolum dated march.this time,woolum concluded,within a reasonable degree of medical probability,that pneumoconiosis hastened decedent death.id.although alj rippey gave extra weight to the opinion of woolum because he was the treating physician,alj rippey based his decision to deny benefits on several factors.first,the march,opinion conflicted with his february,letter.second,the march,letter failed to specify in what matter the pneumoconiosis hastened decedent death.id.judge rippey asked,rhetorically,whether it led to his development of an embolus earlier than it would otherwise have developed did the pneumoconiosis cause death earlier than would otherwise have occurred once the embolus developed id.third,alj rippey noted that the march,letter stated only that woolum could conclude with a reasonable degree of medical probability that the pneumoconiosis hastened the death,as opposed to the usual language,with a reasonable degree of medical certainty.id.
finally,alj rippey refused to ignore the surrounding circumstances.id.judge rippey infer red that woolum march,opinion was given following a discussion with respondent counsel,and that woolum wanted to say all that he could to strengthen respondent case.at.
petitioner filed a timely appeal to the benefits review board brb,which vacated alj rippey decision on april.the brb rejected alj rippey characterization of woolum second opinion as a shift or departure from his initial conclusion rather,the brb termed woolum new opinion a clarification of his earlier conclusion.at.the board also refused to find that the timing of woolum second letter made woolum statements less reliable.the brb thus remanded the case to a new alj for further consideration.
the new alj,clement kichuk,gave little weight to petitioner experts.instead,holding for respondent,alj kichuk argued that 
i t is apparent from the voluminous medical reports that woolum had decedent under close and constant treatment over a period of fourteen years which provided him with an outstanding opportunity to determine the exact nature and cause of his patient pulmonary and respiratory impairment with reliance upon repeated tests,evaluations,and observations of response to proscribed medicines and therapy.
at.this time,petitioner appealed to the brb.although the brb initially affirmed alj kichuk,the brb remanded the case to alj kichuk following petitioner motion for reconsideration.specifically,the brb found that alj kichuk based his decision on the true doubt test that the supreme court found impermissible in director,owcp greenwich collieries,d 
on the second remand,petitioner introduced evidence that radiologists who examined decedent found no evidence of pneumoconiosis.importantly,petitioner offered the analysis of dahhan,a physician in internal medicine and pulmonary medicine who was one of the many doctors to physically examine decedent in the early.dahhan stated that decedent died due to an upper gi bleed,possibly caused by the steroids he took for bronchospasms after reviewing all and medical records,dahhan concluded 
there is insufficient objective evidence to justify the diagnosis of coal worker pneumoconiosis h is death was contributed to greatly by his advanced chronic obstructive lung disease with no evidence that his death was contributed to or hastened by his exposure to coal dust or coal worker pneumoconiosis.
at.dale sargent,board certified in pulmonary diseases and critical care,rendered an opinion similar to dahhan.sargent noted that decedent blood gases showed severe hypoxemic hypercapnic respiratory failure on a chronic finding suggesting copd due to smoking,not pneumoconiosis.according to sargent 
in my opinion,with a reasonable degree of medical certainty,decedent had severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease secondary to cigarette smoking.this is the diagnosis put forth by woolum.in fact,coal worker pneumoconiosis is not mentioned in woolum diagnostic impressions either at the time of admission or time of discharge.chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary emphysema can cause severe lung disease without characteristic chest changes of pneumoconiosis.therefore,i believe the cause of this miner respiratory impairment was pulmonary emphysema due to cigarette smoking,and not due to coal worker pneumoconiosis.
at.sargent also stressed that even assuming decedent had pneumoconiosis,it did not cause his death.sargent wrote 
very clearly,this man died of an acute event gastrointestinal bleeding during the time he was hospitalized in july.there is no post mortem examination,so the cause of the death is conjectural.nevertheless,this man had been bleeding recurrently during his hospitalization and it is certainly possible that he died from acute gastrointestinal bleeding.woolum thought that another possibility for cause of death was pulmonary embolism.none of the physicians caring for the patient at this point indicated that decedent died due to either his lung disease or to coal worker pneumoconiosis.therefore,the cause of death is either gastrointestinal bleeding or pulmonary embolism,neither of which have been shown to be caused by pneumoconiosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
at.in his decision,alj kichuk disregarded the conflicting analyses,observing that the evidence of record does not indicate that respondent has established the presence of complicated coal workers pneumoconiosis by chest.at judge kichuk also noted the lack of any biopsy or autopsy evidence to support a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis.
nevertheless,alj kichuk found respondent position more compelling.alj kichuk said that woolum opinion 
was the most reasoned and persuasive because it includes the most comprehensive analysis of all the elements of the miner occupational and medical history.moreover,woolum personally treated the miner and was his principal caregiver for fourteen years,from,until decedent passed away in july of.his treatment of decedent over the years is fully and painstakingly documented in the record,which includes,but is not limited to,thirteen hospitalizations at least five for acute respiratory failure and each time conducting chest,ekgs,and arterial blood gas studies.from january of,woolum also diagnosed decedent with cor pulmonale and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
i accord greatest weight to woolum opinion,not simply because he was the miner treating physician for many years,but because he based his medical opinion upon numerous objective studies obtained during the miner multiple hospital admissions for acute respiratory distress.in sum,woolum specifically identified the studies and observations upon which he relied and the conclusions he reached are consistent with and supported by the underlying objective evidence of record.
at.alj kichuk added that he did not believe woolum opinion was a gratuity extended to a patient by a sympathetic treating physician.id.
when the brb affirmed,petitioner timely appealed to this court.
discussion 
this appeal presents issues of administrative practice and procedure that are mixed questions of law and fact.we review questions of law de novo.peabody coal greer,cir this court has plenary authority to review the board legal conclusions.citing gibas saginaw mining,cir.to the extent we must review factual conclusions as well,we do so with much greater deference.b.this court will affirm an alj factual findings when substantial evidence supports those conclusions.consolidation coal worrell,cir.where,however,an alj has improperly characterized the evidence or failed to account of relevant record material,deference is inappropriate and remand is required,owcp rowe,cir.from the outset,we note that claimants have the burden of proof in black lung benefit proceedings.the black lung benefits act,creates an adversarial administrative procedure designed to require mining companies to pay those miners or the survivors of those minors who legitimately suffer from a class of different coal pulmonary injuries commonly categorized as pneumoconiosis.petitioner is eligible for benefits if pneumoconiosis caused or hasten e d the miner death.c.congress defined pneumoconiosis as a chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae,including respiratory and pulmonary impairments,arising out of coal mine employment.b.
department of labor dol regulations help further describe pneumoconiosis by providing an illustrative listing of diseases that pneumoconiosis includes 
for the purpose of the act,pneumoconiosis means a chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae,including respiratory and pulmonary impairments,arising out of coal mine employment.this definition includes,but is not limited to,coal workers pneumoconiosis,anthracosilicosis,anthracosis,anthrosilicosis,massive pulmonary fibrosis,progressive massive fibrosis,silicosis,or silicotuberculosis,arising out of coal mine employment.
as this regulation makes clear,legal pneumoconiosis encompasses medical conditions other than clinical pneumoconiosis.see,nance benefits review,cir.clinical or medical pneumoconiosis is a lung disease caused by fibrotic reaction of the lung tissue to inhaled dust that is generally visible on chest films.see,usery elkhorn mining,d.legal pneumoconiosis includes all lung diseases meeting the regulatory definition of any lung disease that is significantly related to,or aggravated by,exposure to coal dust.see,hobbs clinchfield coal,cir.
under dol regulations,a claimant may establish legal pneumoconiosis by any of four different methods of proof evidence autopsy or biopsy evidence evidence of complicated medical pneumoconiosis or progressive massive fibrosis or reasoned and documented medical opinions.a.as noted,the claimant bears the burden of proof.greenwich collieries,at.the presence of evidence favorable to the claimant or even a tie in the proof will not suffice to meet that burden.id.
despite a certain degree of lingering confusion among the courts of appeals,it has become overwhelmingly evident that the testimony of the treating physician receives no additional weight.sometimes termed the treating physician rule,claimants have argued that the treating physician analysis should receive greater significance in alj decisions if not dispositive weight relative to analyses performed by other experts.
in addition to the black lung context,the treating physician rule plays a role in social security proceedings pursuant to regulations that stipulate that the commissioner of social security must give special weight to the claimant treating physician when determining whether a claimant deserves disability benefits.see d,d.courts have also applied the treating physician rule in disability determinations under employee benefit plans covered by the employee retirement income security act of erisa.see,darland fortis benefits ins,cir,overruled by black decker disability plan nord,d ginsburg,criticizing,in an opinion by a unanimous court,the usefulness of granting deference to the opinion of a treating physician.
in black decker disability plan nord,at.at,the supreme court recently reversed a ninth circuit decision,nord black decker disability plan,cir,that afforded deference to treating physicians in disability determinations.although black decker dealt with erisa,the unanimous court disapproved of the treating physician rule with language that criticizes the principle itself,rather than its operation in an erisa context.see black decker,at.at.as justice ginsburg explained,erisa regulations that require a full and fair assessment of claims do not command plan administrators to credit the opinions of treating physicians over other evidence relevant to the claimant medical condition.id.at.the court explained in detail 
the question whether a treating physician rule would increase the accuracy of disability determinations under erisa plans seems to us one the legislature or superintending administrative agency is best positioned to address.as compared to consultants retained by the plan,it may be true that treating physicians,as a rule,have a greater opportunity to know and observe the patient as an individual.nor do we question the concern that physicians repeatedly retained by benefits plans may have an incentive to make a finding of not disabled in order to save their employers money and to preserve their own consulting arrangements.but the assumption that the opinions of a treating physician warrant greater credit than the opinions of plan consultants may make scant sense when,for example,the relationship between the claimant and the treating physician has been or short duration,or when a specialist engaged by the plan has expertise the treating physician lacks.and if a consultant engaged by a plan may have an incentive to make a finding of not disabled,so a treating physician,in a close case,may favor a finding of disabled.intelligent resolution of the question of whether routine deference to the opinion of a claimant treating physician would yield more accurate disability determinations,it thus appears,might be aided by empirical investigation of the kind courts are to conduct.
id.at internal quotations and citations omitted.the court thus notes that treating physicians may have strong biases and lack the expertise held by doctors.these critiques of the treating physician rule apply with equal force to the notion that treating physicians should receive deference in black lung proceedings.
in fact,the courts of appeals,including this one,have often recognized that there is no treating physician rule in black lung cases,although this court jurisprudence is somewhat equivocal.in tussey island creek coal,cir,this court wrote that opinions of treating physicians are entitled to greater weight than those of physicians.id.at.subsequently,however,we withdrew from the language in tussey,explaining that tussey did not suggest that treating physicians should automatically be presumed to be indicated that their opinions should be properly credited and weighed.peabody coal groves,cir quoting tussey,at.in another case more recent than peabody coal,we unambiguously stated that the misconceived treating physician presumption does not exist.wolf creek collieries,owcp,cir emphasis added see also jericol mining,napier,cir quoting mining ass dep t of labor,for the proposition that t he consensus among courts has been that an agency adjudicator may give weight to the treating physician opinion when doing so makes sense in light of the evidence and the record,but may not mechanistically credit the treating physician solely because of his relationship with the claimant griffith,owcp,cir citing tussey for the court conclusion that under these circumstances,the alj was not required to give greater weight to the opinion of the treating physician.
other circuits have also rejected the treating physician rule in black lung litigation.see,kennellis energies,hallmark,cir a preference or the treating physician opinion has been rejected by this circuit.citations omitted peabody coal mccandless,cir calling a treating physician preference irrational,in part because t reating physicians often succumb to the temptation to accommodate their patients and their survivors at the expense of third parties such as insurers,which implies attaching a discount rather than a preference to their views lango,owcp,cir finding treating physician conclusory statement that coal miner pneumoconiosis hastened his death did not support black lung benefits claim.as the fourth circuit explained 
neither this circuit nor the benefits review board has ever fashioned either a requirement or a presumption that treating or examining physicians opinions be given greater weight than opinions of other expert physicians.we have often stated that as a general matter the opinions of treating and examining physicians deserve especial consideration.we stated,for example,in hubbard califano,cir,that we place great reliance on a claimant treating physician,and,citing hubbard,in king,cir,that we place great reliance on the conclusions of a claimant examining physician.in neither case,however,did we suggest,much less hold,that the opinions of treating or examining physicians must be accorded greater weight than opinions of other physicians.it is,of course,one thing to say that we give great weight to the treating or examining physician opinion it is quite another to say that as a matter of law we give greater weight to such an opinion than to opinions by other physicians.the alj therefore was not required to defer to soliva diagnoses or to accord them greater weight than the opinions of the other physicians.
grizzle pickands mather chisolm mines,cir see also island creek coal compton,cir an alj may not discredit a physician opinion solely because the physician did not examine the claimant.thus,most courts do not afford additional deference to treating physicians.
the department of labor recently promulgated regulations with respect to the role treating physicians should play in black lung benefit determinations,but these rules do little more than explain that sometimes a treating physician may have a thorough understanding of a miner condition,but in other cases,aljs should not rely on the opinions of treating physicians.see d.rejecting automatic acceptance of the treating physician opinion,the dol intended the rule to force a careful and thorough assessment of the treating relationship.regulations implementing the federal coal mine and safety act of,as amended,hereinafter implementing regulations.to effectuate this end,the dol regulation states 
d treating physician.in weighing the medical evidence of record relevant to whether the miner suffers,or suffered,from pneumoconiosis,whether the pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment,and whether the miner is,or was,totally disabled by pneumoconiosis or died due top neumoconiosis,the adjudication officer must give consideration to the relationship between the miner and any treating physician whose report is admitted into the record.specifically,the adjudication officer shall take into consideration the following factors in weighing the opinion of the miner treating physician 
nature of relationship.the opinion of a physician who has treated the miner for respiratory or pulmonary conditions is entitled to more weight than a physician who has treated the miner for conditions 
duration of relationship.the length of the treatment relationship demonstrates whether the physician has observed the miner long enough to obtain a superior understanding of his or her condition 
frequency of treatment.the frequency of visits demonstrates whether the physician has observed the miner often enough to obtain a superior understanding of his or her condition and 
extent of treatment.the types of testing and examinations conducted during the treatment relationship demonstrate whether the physician has obtained superior and relevant information concerning the miner condition.
d.the regulation says nothing about prioritizing a treating physician perspective rather,the regulation expects aljs to analyze the nature and duration of the relationship along with the frequency and extent of treatment.this is similar to the kind of critical analysis an alj should apply when considering any expert opinion.the dol further expects aljs to weigh the report of a treating physician against all other relevant evidence in the record.implementing regulations.at.
a simple principle is evident in black lung litigation,the opinions of treating physicians get the deference they deserve based on their power to persuade.skidmore swift.affording an administrative agency pronouncement only the weight it deserved in light of the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade.for instance,a highly qualified treating physician who has lengthy experience with a miner may deserve tremendous deference,whereas a treating physician without the right pulmonary certifications should have his opinions appropriately discounted.the case law and applicable regulatory scheme make clear that aljs must evaluate treating physicians just as they consider other experts.
as explained,respondent may prove her case through autopsy or biopsy evidence,evidence,evidence of complicated medical pneumoconiosis or progressive massive fibrosis,or reasoned and documented medical opinions.a.since respondent offered no autopsy or biopsy evidence,we may move directly to decedent.
writing that the evidence of record does not indicate that respondent has established the presence of complicated coal workers pneumoconiosis by chest,the alj never relied on evidence.at.this is unsurprising given the paucity of analyses that support respondent position.only one of the six readers found pneumoconiosis,and he did so based on a film taken ten years before decedent died at.less qualified analysts reached myriad results,but the alj permissibly considered the readers respective qualifications and appropriately discounted the opinions of those not fully qualified.see staton norfolk,cir.
in addition to woolum two letters,the alj considered opinions from eight other physicians.for simplicity,one can group these eight physicians into two categories those respondent argues support her clarke,penman,powell,and wright and those who back petitioner position simmons,powell,anderson,sargent,and dahhan.
as the alj appropriately recognized,three of the opinions offered by respondent group clarke,penman and powell have very little significance because they did not conduct complete pulmonary evaluations of the miner and these physicians based their opinions on the evidence,which i have previously found not sufficient to establish the existence of cwp coal workers pneumoconiosis.at.as we have concluded before,merely restating an does not qualify as a reasoned medical judgment.cornett benham coal,cir.furthermore,an alj may not rely on a doctor opinion that a patient has medical pneumoconiosis when the physician bases his opinion entirely on evidence the alj has already discredited.island creek,at sahara coal fitts,cir.
although still problematic,wright offered the most persuasive testimony on respondent behalf.he based his conclusion partly on a putatively positive taken on march,but also on pulmonary function studies revealing severe restrictive and obstructive defects and arterial blood gas studies that indicated substantial impairments.on this basis,the alj gave greater weight to wright opinion on the issue of the existence of pneumoconiosis.at.but wright opinion is troubling because he only maintains board certifications in anesthesiology and pain management,neither of which is germane here.moreover,wright testified that pneumoconiosis was a substantial and contributing factor that led to the problems detected by the pulmonary function studies and blood gas tests,but wright also stated that cigarette smoking was the predominant cause of decedent lung disease.wright testified 
counsel getting right down to the in this,doctor,you do think this man very poor pulmonary function is a result of medical pneumoconiosis,do you 
counsel what is your opinion as their cause sic 
wright his chronic obstructive lung disease with emphysema.
counsel and in your opinion,what is the most probable or predominant cause of that disease 
wright the predominant cause is probably cigarette smoking.
dep.at.even if one understands wright to mean that smoking caused most of the problem,but medical pneumoconiosis still contributed to wright poor pulmonary says nothing about the ultimate issue,which is whether legal pneumoconiosis hastened decedent death.recall that the alj concluded his discussion of wright testimony by explaining that he gave great weight to wright opinion on the issue of the existence of pneumoconiosis.at emphasis added.wright never testified that pneumoconiosis legal or medical hastened decedent demise.
the conclusions reached by petitioner group of experts are somewhat more useful.the alj reasonably discounted simmons contribution because simmons seemed equivocal at best.at.the alj also discredited anderson opinion because he did not do pulmonary function studies on the miner and only suspected smoking caused the copd.sargent opinion,however,is more helpful,because sargent,in pulmonary medicine,expressly concluded that pneumoconiosis did not cause the miner death.the alj criticized sargent analysis because sargent never examined decedent and evidently relied on an incomplete medical file that did not include pulmonary function studies.nevertheless,sargent concluded that 
very clearly,this man died of an acute event gastrointestinal bleeding during the time he was hospitalized in july woolum thought that another possibility for cause of death was pulmonary embolism therefore,the cause of death is either gastrointestinal bleeding or pulmonary embolism,neither of which have been shown to be caused by pneumoconiosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
at.again,the ultimate question is not whether decedent had medical or legal pneumoconiosis,but whether legal pneumoconiosis hastened his death.even assuming,arguendo,that access to pulmonary function studies would have caused sargent to reconsider his opinion that the miner did not have medical pneumoconiosis,this ancillary point does not implicate sargent two primary conclusions articulated in the passage the miner died of an acute event,probably gastrointestinal bleeding but perhaps a pulmonary embolism and neither pneumoconiosis nor copd causes either gastrointestinal bleeding or pulmonary embolism.therefore,sargent concluded that pneumoconiosis,even if it existed,did not cause the miner death.
the alj also struggled to dispatch with dahhan opinion.dahhan,in pulmonary medicine,found no medical pneumoconiosis.the alj analysis of dahhan reasoning is somewhat desultory,but he seems to criticize dahhan for fail ing to adequately explain why the miner year mining history has nothing to do with his lung condition,and for neglecting that copd falls within the definition of legal pneumoconiosis.at.it makes no sense,however,to assume that because dahhan does not explain why decedent work as a miner has not caused his lung impairment,then his work as a miner must have caused his lung impairment furthermore,although dahhan concluded that the miner had copd,only copd caused by coal dust constitutes legal pneumoconiosis.see a.otherwise,everyone who developed copd from smoking would have legal pneumoconiosis.dahhan concluded that the miner death was contributed to greatly by his advanced chronic obstructive lung disease with no evidence that his death was contributed to or hastened by his exposure to coal dust or coal worker pneumoconiosis.at emphasis added.
thus,dahhan did not,as the alj claims,ignore copd.rather,dahhan stated that coal dust did not cause the copd.most important,dahhan appropriately addressed the real issue when he explained that decedent death would have been at the same time and the same manner regardless of his exposure to coal dust or the presence of occupational pneumoconiosis,since it was the result of an upper gi bleed,a condition of the general public at large.at.
if one analyzed the evidence without the treating physician opinion,it would be evident that substantial evidence does not support the alj conclusion that respondent met her burden of proof.consider the evidence without woolum input respondent offered no biopsy or autopsy reports.five of the six readers saw no pneumoconiosis,and the sixth simmons was indecisive.none of the other medical evidence is incredibly compelling.the dispositive question is whether legal pneumoconiosis contributed to the miner death.only two physicians sargent and dahhan,both specialists in pulmonary medicine,addressed this issue,and both concluded that coal disorders legal pneumoconiosis did not hasten decedent death.
in fact,without woolum contribution,petitioner would have no argument but to infer that decedent must have suffered from legal pneumoconiosis because he worked for decades as a miner,and since he had legal pneumoconiosis,it must have contributed to his death.since this baseless statement is grossly insufficient,the supportability of the alj conclusion depends on woolum,the treating physician 
woolum testimony suffers from several serious problems that render his opinion an inadequate basis for the alj conclusion unless his hypothesis receives disproportionately great weight simply because he worked as decedent treating physician.since no such presumption exists,there is no substantial evidence supporting the alj conclusion.
circumstantial factors strongly indicate that woolum changed his original opinion to meet respondent needs.as summarized above,the original alj,judge rippey,held a conference between the parties on february.at that session,alj rippey told respondent counsel that he found woolum initial letter insufficient to establish that pneumoconiosis played a role in decedent death.woolum first analysis stated that this gentleman was disabled secondary to his lung disease of which pneumoconiosis,in my mind,was certainly a contributing factor.at.woolum did not claim pneumoconiosis caused the miner death.
after respondent attorney learned that woolum initial conclusion would not suffice,woolum drafted a new letter,this time reckoning that,within a reasonable degree of medical probability,pneumoconiosis hastened decedent death.id.woolum wrote the first letter on february,but did not write the second memorandum until march,than a month after the parties met with alj rippey.woolum treated decedent for fourteen years,but did not diagnose him with pneumoconiosis until after he allegedly died from it.
this seems like a case in which the treating physician wanted to help his patient family.despite woolum almost certainly benevolent intent,the sequence of events makes his new conclusion dubious 
notwithstanding woolum significant credibility problem,there are other reasons to doubt his conclusion.first,as alj rippey noted,even in his second letter,woolum could only conclude with a reasonable degree of medical probability that pneumoconiosis contributed to the miner death,rather than the usual phrase,reasonable degree of medical certainty.at.emphasis added.it is unclear what reasonable degree of medical probability means.the more common reasonable degree of medical certainty already reflects the incertitude inherent in medical conclusions certainty in medicine only means nearly sure relative to the existential sense of the word certain.if a medical certainty is a conviction short of complete certainty,then a medical probability must mean something even less sure.
second,woolum attempted to connect the pulmonary embolism to decedent mining history by surmising that,although the pulmonary embolus directly caused the miner death,pneumoconiosis hastened his demise because the miner lack of oxygen and his retained carbon dioxide all played an effect on all parts of his body.at.put differently,woolum argued that because decedent had pneumoconiosis,his body lacked oxygen and excessively retained carbon dioxide.this weakened the miner,played an effect on all parts of his body,and thereby hastened a death that would have occurred anyway from the pulmonary embolus.id.even if this is an accurate medical conclusion,it is legally inadequate.
again,petitioner must show that pneumoconiosis hasten e d the miner death.c.one can always claim,as woolum did,that if pneumoconiosis makes someone weaker,it makes them less resistant to some other trauma.if,for instance,a miner with pneumoconiosis gets hit by a train and bleeds to death,woolum or someone adopting his position would argue that the pneumoconiosis hastened his death because he bled to death somewhat more quickly than someone without pneumoconiosis.this is absurd,of course,and presumably not what congress meant by hasten.under woolum interpretation,pneumoconiosis would virtually always hasten death to at least some minimal degree.legal pneumoconiosis only hastens a death if it does so through a specifically defined process that reduces the miner life by an estimable time.woolum letter is conclusory and inadequate because woolum just asserts that because in woolum opinion the miner had pneumoconiosis,the disease must have hastened his death.
third,the alj ignores woolum credentials.woolum has no special expertise in reading,but the alj gave weight to woolum analysis that he did not give to the readers who found no evidence of medical pneumoconiosis.woolum has no board certification in pulmonary medicine,but the alj accepted woolum assertion that a coal ailment contributed to the miner demise over the opinions of two pulmonary specialists who reached the opposite conclusion.
although the dol new regulations regarding treating physicians did not take effect until after the alj reached his decision,they would not alter the outcome of this case.under the new regulations,the alj must consider a multitude of factors that,viewed overall,simply ask whether the treating physician has offered a persuasive opinion.see d.in this case,he did not.to reach his conclusion,the alj had to give preference to the treating physician.since that is impermissible,the brb erred in affirming the alj decision 
for all the aforementioned reasons,we reverse the benefits review board.
with respect to his federal black lung benefits,an alj found the existence of pneumoconiosis established because conflicts in the record among qualified physicians created true doubt that the alj resolved in decedent favor,because pneumoconiosis is a progressive disease,and because the alj concluded that a single doctor opinion could not outweigh a greater number of medical opinions supporting decedent.the supreme court and other courts,including this one,have subsequently discredited the methods employed in the proceeding.see,owcp greenwich collieries,d rejecting the true doubt rule mining ass dep t of labor,rejecting the view that latent pneumoconiosis is generally progressive based on the department of labor concession that latent pneumoconiosis rarely progresses woodward,owcp,cir rejecting reliance on numerical superiority as a valid method to resolve conflicts in the record.
decedent first saw woolum in.
a has demonstrated proficiency in assessing and classifying for pneumoconiosis by successfully completing an examination conducted by or on behalf of the department of health and human services.a ii e.radiologist has received a certification in radiology from either the american board of radiology or the american osteopathic association.id.at a ii c.four of the six readings performed by analysts involved films taken between and.the remaining two analysts reviewed films from july of,less than two weeks before decedent died.the one reader who found pneumoconiosis reached his conclusion based on the analysis of an october,film,and he later partly recanted his readers with less expertise analyzed the with conflicting result
