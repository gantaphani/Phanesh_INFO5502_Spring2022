on january,the board of supervisors of los angeles county voted to reduce expenditures by closing rancho los amigos national rehabilitation center rancho and by reducing the number of hospital beds at los angeles medical center.rancho is a county hospital dedicated primarily to providing inpatient and outpatient rehabilitative care,also a county hospital,is an acute care facility that provides a full range of hospital services.plaintiffs challenged the planned closure and reduction through this action.the district court granted plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction,barring the county from going forward with its plan.the county appealed,challenging the district court decision that plaintiffs have standing to sue and the court issuance of an injunction.we have jurisdiction under a,and we affirm.
factual background 
a.the county healthcare system 
in march,the county closed several primary health care centers that served the indigent and working poor.these closures effectively eliminated office visits per year.later that year,the county closed additional facilities,eliminating hospital beds and office visits per year.in addition,since,the county has eliminated about beds from its inpatient system.this constitutes a percent reduction.as a result,county emergency rooms are overwhelmed,creating what witnesses in this case have called an extremely dysfunctional and dangerous patient environment,in which people are dying preventable deaths.some patients spend up to hours or more on a gurney in a county emergency room waiting to get a bed,and patients sometimes wait hours or days for necessary emergency surgeries.
nevertheless,on january,the county decided to close rancho,one of only six county hospitals,because of anticipated future budget deficits.the county planned to reduce services at rancho beginning may,and to close the facility entirely by june.in addition,the county planned to eliminate hospital beds from another of its six hospitals,over a period.however,by the time the district court issued an injunction,no budget shortfall was expected until at the earliest.
rancho los amigos national rehabilitation center 
rancho is a facility that specializes in rehabilitation and the acute care needs of patients with chronic diseases as we explained in rodde 
rancho has served los angeles homeless,mentally ill,disabled and elderly populations since it opened in.important health care innovations,including the halo device used to support the head and neck of spinal cord injury patients,were invented at rancho.rancho was also the first facility to replace wood with plastic for prosthetic limbs.by the early,rancho was becoming legendary for its occupational therapy.later,during world war ii,rancho began providing care and rehabilitation for polio patients in,the majority of the los angeles area polio victims were treated at rancho.

rancho annually provides care to about inpatients and outpatients.county doctors rely heavily on rancho to rehabilitate patients with infectious diseases and neurological,orthopedic,and liver conditions.it is the only facility that offers rehabilitation for patients discharged from.rancho is a unique facility no other facility in the area currently provides many of the services it offers.see id.at.plaintiffs evidence shows that the county would be unable to meet the medical needs of the indigent and uninsured if it closed rancho.
los angeles medical center 
provides percent of the county emergency care needs and almost percent of the county trauma care for insured and uninsured patients.the hospital can accommodate up to almost beds,but currently is budgeted to provide only beds the county plan would lower this number to.percent of available beds are full at any given time.the evidence demonstrates that the hospital is overcrowded,and patients spend long sometimes the emergency department waiting to be admitted.the evidence also shows that delayed treatment because of overcrowding is causing preventable deaths,and that the proposed reduction in beds will exacerbate the existing situation.further,one study concluded that eliminating beds from will cause a percent increase in the number of patients with medical needs leaving emergency departments without being seen by a health care professional.
in addition,current ambulance diversion rate the percentage of time the emergency room is closed to incoming ambulances is already unacceptably high by medical standards.the proposed bed reduction will increase ambulance diversion rate.as the ambulance diversion rate increases,so do the morbidity and mortality rates for transported patients.
plaintiffs 
plaintiffs are eight indigent and uninsured county residents with serious health problems who regularly rely upon the county health care system for routine,rehabilitative,and emergency care.they are medhat elsadoni,who recently suffered a heart attack,waited ten days for a bed to become available at,then waited three additional days for necessary surgery which was interrupted and continued after a seven hour delay and is now on five medications luther rabb,a former inpatient and current outpatient at rancho who is paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair gary harris,also a former inpatient and current outpatient at rancho who was confined to a wheelchair due to a spinal cord injury but learned to walk on crutches at rancho susan haggerty,a diabetic amputee who is a rancho outpatient and former inpatient and who may still have an unhealed bone infection dean lane,who waited ten months for necessary wrist surgery at and has been unable to alleviate his pain and swelling or to find work due to the delay and ping yu,joan,and mary phong,who each suffer from multiple medical conditions including liver problems,hypertension,hyperlipidemia,diabetes,breast cancer,arthritis,asthma,and partial blindness.los angeles coalition to end hunger and homelessness lacehh,a organization composed of indigent individuals who depend upon the county health care system,is also a plaintiff.
plaintiffs presented evidence that the county healthcare system is not equipped to absorb indigent and uninsured patients,including themselves,who would be displaced by the threatened closure of rancho and the reduction of beds at.further,plaintiffs submitted evidence that the county proposal would delay treatment,cause avoidable death,disease,and suffering,increase risk of infections,spread of communicable diseases,and medical complications,and ultimately lead to unnecessarily lengthy and expensive hospitalizations.
ii.procedural background 
shortly after the county decided to close rancho and to eliminate beds at,plaintiffs filed this action to enjoin the impending service reductions.plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction soon after filing suit.judge florence marie cooper of the central district of california held that plaintiffs had standing to pursue their action.the district court also concluded that plaintiffs established a likelihood of success on their california welfare and institutions code claims and their medicaid discharge planning claim.
in support of that decision,the district court found that the county health care system presently lacks the ability and specialized expertise to absorb rancho patients,and that the county hospitals are not equipped to accommodate the patients that would be displaced from by the proposed reduction in beds.thus,the district court concluded that plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury absent a preliminary injunction 
the closing of rancho and the proposed bed reduction at will result in dangerous delays of needed medical treatment resulting in unnecessary deaths,strokes,heart attacks,amputations,renal failure,blindness,seizures,severe pain,and increased risk of infection it will result in the spread of communicable diseases,including respiratory illnesses such as tuberculosis,staphylococcus it will result in complications from delayed rehabilitative services,including joint deformities and arthritis,pressure sores,and muscle atrophy it will result in patients being discharged without access to appropriate rehabilitation care and it will result in unnecessarily lengthy and expensive hospitalizations.
finally,the district court held that the likely severe and irreparable physical harm to plaintiffs outweighed any potential harm to the county,and that the public interest favored the granting of an injunction.
iii.standards of review 
preliminary injunction standard 
to obtain a preliminary injunction in the district court,plaintiffs were required to demonstrate a strong likelihood of success on the merits,the possibility of irreparable injury to plaintiff s if preliminary relief is not granted,a balance of hardships favoring the plaintiff s,and advancement of the public interest.johnson cal.state bd.of accountancy,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.alternatively,injunctive relief could be granted if plaintiffs demonstrate d either a combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury or that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in their favor.id.emphasis in original citations and internal quotation marks omitted.these two alternatives represent extremes of a single continuum,rather than two separate tests clear channel outdoor city of los angeles,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.as a result,the greater the relative hardship to the party seeking the preliminary injunction,the less probability of success must be established by the party.id.citation omitted.
in cases where the public interest is involved,the district court must also examine whether the public interest favors the plaintiff.fund for animals,lujan,cir citing caribbean marine servs.baldrige,cir

iv.standing 
the district court correctly concluded that plaintiffs have standing to challenge the county decision to eliminate beds from and to close rancho.
to establish standing,plaintiffs must satisfy a three part test.first,they must suffer an injury in fact a concrete and particularized and actual or imminent harm to a legally protectable interest.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.second,plaintiffs must demonstrate a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of such that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant actions.id.third,it must be likely that plaintiffs injury will be redressed by a favorable court decision.id.at.
a separate test governs an association standing to sue on its members behalf the organization members must otherwise have had standing to sue on their own the interests the organization seeks to protect must be germane to its purpose and neither the asserted claim nor the requested relief may require the members individual participation in the suit.audubon soc y,davis,cir.
this action may go forward if at least one plaintiff has standing.see pub.citizen dep t of,cir watt energy action educ,d.
injury in fact 
to satisfy the injury in fact requirement,plaintiffs must allege an imminent threat of concrete injury,and must distinguish themselves from the public at large by demonstrating that the alleged injury affect s them in a personal and individual way.defenders of wildlife,at.warth seldin,d t he threshold question in every federal case is whether the plaintiff has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant his invocation of the jurisdiction and to justify exercise of the court remedial powers on his behalf quotation and citation omitted.
the supreme court has consistently recognized that threatened rather than actual injury can satisfy article iii standing requirements.friends of the earth,gaston copper recycling,cir en banc see also friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d.and this circuit recently confirmed that a concrete risk of harm to the plaintiffs is sufficient for injury in fact.covington jefferson county,cir emphasis added see also cent.delta water agency united states,cir a credible threat of harm constitutes actual injury emphasis added hall norton,cir evidence of a credible threat to the plaintiff physical well being sufficient to satisfy injury requirement emphasis added.
in covington,at,the plaintiffs lived across the street from an improperly run landfill.the risk of fires,explosions,and groundwater contamination among other problems at the landfill was heightened because the facility was improperly run.we held that plaintiffs had standing to sue because they lived close to and from the landfill,the increased risk of injury they faced was in no way speculative.id.at.the probability that plaintiffs would be harmed because of conditions at the landfill was sufficient to satisfy the injury in fact requirement.
similarly,in gaston copper,at,the plaintiff property owner lake was in the path of the defendant toxic chemical discharge.the fourth circuit concluded the plaintiff had standing to challenge the defendant discharge violations because his fear that the water in which he swam and fished would become contaminated was reasonable,and because he filed suit to vindicate his private interests in his and his family.id.at.
in contrast,in defenders of wildlife,at,the plaintiff organization challenged a government regulation that made the endangered species act inapplicable to american actions in foreign nations.two group members alleged they had observed the habitats of certain endangered species in foreign countries,and that they intended to return sometime in the future to try to see the animals.they feared that american involvement in foreign development projects would damage the habitats and therefore risk the animals extinction.id.at.the supreme court concluded that the plaintiffs some day intentions were insufficient to confer standing to sue.id.at.
the county contention that plaintiffs injuries are too speculative is unpersuasive.plaintiffs are more like the property owners in covington and gaston the path of likely danger from like the environmentalists in defenders of some day plans to travel abroad to try to observe an endangered animal.plaintiffs introduced evidence that they rely on the county health care system.and,as chronically ill individuals,their future need for medical attention is far more certain than the intent to return to areas visited in the past alleged in defenders of wildlife.further,plaintiffs have demonstrated that the county already has difficulty providing them access to timely care.given the current crisis in the county health care system and the existing shortages and delays,it is not speculative to anticipate that reducing the resources available will further impede the county ability to deliver medical treatment to plaintiffs in their times of need.plaintiffs will inevitably face longer delays and suffer increased pain and complications if the county further reduces the available resources as planned.the threat of delayed treatment arising out of the county decision to pare down its healthcare system threatens
