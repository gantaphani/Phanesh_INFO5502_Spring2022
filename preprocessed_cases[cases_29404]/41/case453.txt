on this appeal we review a complaint asserting violations of the false claims act act,et,brought by a plaintiff employee against her former employers,who are health care providers.the appeal raises issues of first impression in this circuit concerning the applicability of medical standards of care to the act.
congress enacted the false claims act after disclosure of widespread fraud during the revealed that the union government had been billed for nonexistent or worthless goods,had been charged exorbitant prices,and had its treasury plundered by profiteering defense contractors.see united states mcninch,d.in the act was substantially amended to combat fraud in the fields of defense and health care.see,at,reprinted in.as of february over half of the billion recovered since that amendment derived from cases alleging fraud against the department of health and human services.see shelley slade thomas colthurst,fraud and the false claims act the supreme court supports a federal weapon,bus.today,at.
the act contains a qui tam provision designed to encourage private individuals to file suit by offering them a percentage of any money recovered.those persons bringing a qui tam suit are known colloquially as.the plaintiff in this case purports to blow the whistle on those practices of her employers she believes violate the medicare statute,payment for which would defraud the government.regardless of whether such suit is successful or unsuccessful and here it is unsuccessful,a stands out,and risks being thought as bad as those alleged to be the.
background 
in defendants marc straus,jeffrey ambinder and eliot friedman,physicians specializing in oncology and hematology,formed a partnership called pulmonary and critical care associates to extend their practice to include pulmonology,the branch of medicine covering the lungs and related breathing functions.in july of that year defendants hired plaintiff patricia mikes,a pulmonologist,to provide pulmonary and critical care services in defendants offices in westchester and putnam counties,new york.in september mikes discussed with straus her concerns relating to spirometry tests being performed in defendants offices.three months later,plaintiff was fired.
the parties dispute the reason for mikes termination.plaintiff says she was fired because she questioned how defendants conducted their medical practice.defendants declare that mikes employment agreement provided she was,and that plaintiff had difficulty procuring privileges at area hospitals.
on april,mikes commenced the instant litigation against defendants in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,asserting not only causes of action for retaliatory discharge and unlawfully withheld wages,but also a qui tam suit under the false claims act.she served the complaint on the united states attorney who,on april,notified the district court that it declined its statutory right to substitute for mikes in the prosecution of this litigation.see b,b b.
prior proceedings 
plaintiff qui tam cause of action under the act alleged that defendants had submitted false reimbursement requests to the federal government for spirometry services.plaintiff contended that defendants failure to calibrate the spirometers rendered the results so unreliable as to be false under the act.in addition,mikes averred that spirometry is an eligible service under the medicare statute,and that defendants submitted medicare claims for reimbursement during the period relevant to this said to be claims from through a total medicare payout of.
after the government declined to take over as plaintiff,mikes served defendants with her complaint on december.district court judge vincent broderick,before whom the complaint was then pending,dismissed it in may finding fraud had not been pleaded with particularity as required by.b.see united states ex rel.mikes straus.
mikes then filed an amended complaint repeating the spirometry,retaliation and withholding wages claims,and also asserting that defendants improperly received medicare reimbursement for referrals to magnetic resonance imaging mri facilities in which they held a financial interest.it was mikes contention that receipt of these referral fees violated the provision of the medicare statute,b,and thus defendants claims for reimbursement for the mris also violated the false claims act.district court judge william conner,now assigned to the case,denied a motion to dismiss the false claims act causes of action,and ordered arbitration of the claims.see mikes strauss.
mikes then filed in march a second amended complaint that eliminated the claim for improperly withheld wages,and on july,filed a three count supplemental pleading relevant to the present only the spirometry claims brought under the false claims act.the case was again reassigned,this time to district court judge colleen mcmahon.
defendants moved for summary judgment on august,and the government again chose not to intervene.in granting defendants motion on november,the district court ruled that submitting a claim for a service that was not provided in accordance with the relevant standard of care does not make that claim false or fraudulent for false claims act purposes.united states ex rel.mikes straus,d.defendants submission of claims for reimbursement,the court continued,did not implicitly certify that their performance of spirometry conformed to any qualitative standard.see id.at.and,it concluded,that even were the medicare claims objectively false,plaintiff had not shown defendants submitted the claims with the requisite scienter.see id.at.plaintiff motion for reconsideration was denied.united states ex rel.mikes straus,d.
after plaintiff complaint had been dismissed,defendants asked for attorneys fees pursuant to d of the act.the district court conducted a bench trial and found plaintiff withdrawn mri claims were vexatious,but that her spirometry claims were not.see united states ex rel.mikes straus,d.it held that defendants ambinder and friedman were entitled to either of any attorneys fees attributable solely to defending the mri claims or a default fee of.see id.at.
despite defendants declaration that they had expended defending the action,the district court agreed with the magistrate whom the attorneys fees issue had been defendants records did not sufficiently delineate the time spent between the mri and spirometry causes of action.judge mcmahon accordingly awarded defendants only the default sum of.from this disposition,plaintiff appeals the grant of summary judgment and the award of attorneys fees for defendants.defendants with respect to the amount of the attorneys fees award we affirm.
spirometry 
before turning to a discussion of the law,it will be helpful to define subject that lies at the heart of this plaintiff allegations regarding defendants performance of this diagnostic test.spirometry is an pulmonary function test used by doctors to detect both obstructive such as asthma and emphysema and restrictive such as pulmonary fibrosis lung diseases.the type of spirometers used by defendants measures the pressure change when a patient blows into a mouthpiece,thereby providing the doctor with analysis of the volume and speed by which patients can exhale.the spirometry equipment consists of readily transportable lightweight machines,and defendants apparently used at least one in each of their several offices.
plaintiff expert stated that spirometers are susceptible to inaccuracy through time and usage because they become clogged,causing false readings.erroneous measurements may also arise from damage to the instrument through cleaning or disturbance during transport,or from variations in barometric pressure,temperature or humidity.mikes claims that guidelines first published in and later updated in and by the american thoracic society ats guidelines,a division of the american lung association,set out the generally accepted standards for spirometry.to ensure accuracy,these guidelines recommend daily calibration of spirometers by use of a three liter calibration syringe,the performance of three successive trials during test administration and the appropriate training of spirometer technicians.in support of her contention that the ats guidelines are the medical standard for spirometry,mikes notes they are incorporated by reference in the federal longshore and harbor workers compensation act,and included in regulations promulgated pursuant to the social security act,see pt,subpt.p,app,pt.a,e,the radiation exposure compensation act,see d ii b,and the federal mine safety and health act.
mikes maintains further that defendants performance of spirometry did not conform to the ats guidelines and thus would yield inherently unreliable data.she argues that defendants allowed medical assistants to perform spirometry tests when they were not trained in its proper administration.plaintiff states she personally observed the medical assistants fail to calibrate the spirometer daily and that she was informed the assistants could not recall the last time the machine had been calibrated.moreover,defendants did not possess a three liter calibration syringe,nor did the assistants properly instruct the patients during the administration of the test or perform three successive tests.
defendants insist that after plaintiff raised her concerns regarding the spirometer and its use in their practice,they told her to review exam results for inaccuracy,and to train the medical assistants in proper spirometric administration.straus reports that plaintiff did not apprise the practice of any false readings in response to this directive,nor did she supervise the medical assistants.with this factual background,we turn to the law.
discussion 
i elements of plaintiff false claims act causes of action 
mikes challenges the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants that resulted in the dismissal of her false claims act causes of action.summary judgment is a remedy we review de novo,see hamilton bank,kookmin bank,cir,affirming only if we conclude there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,fed civ.c see also anderson liberty lobby,d.
liability under the false claims act occurs when a person 
knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval 
knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government or 
conspires to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid.
a.plaintiff brought suit under each of these subdivisions,but since our analysis applies equally to all three,we limit discussion primarily to the first.as the language of that subdivision makes clear,to impose liability under the act mikes must show that defendants made a claim,to the united states government,that is false or fraudulent,knowing of its falsity,and seeking payment from the federal treasury.because plaintiff claims fail on other grounds,we need not decide whether the act contains another element of proof,namely a showing that the united states sustained damages.harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir noting split of authority on whether false claims act contains damages element.we set out briefly the requirements of the above five elements.
the act expansively defines the term claim to cover any request or demand,whether under a contract or otherwise,for money or property if the united states government provides any portion of the money or property which is requested or demanded.c.as required by the medicare implementing regulations,see,defendants submitted medicare reimbursement claims for spirometry on form or an electronic equivalent.each submission of the form meets the first two elements of a false claims act cause of action in that it qualifies as a claim made to the united states government.see united states krizek,holding that number of claims under act based upon submission of forms.
regarding the third element,the term false or fraudulent is not defined in the act.a common definition of fraud is an intentional misrepresentation,concealment,or nondisclosure for the purpose of inducing another in reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing belonging to him or to surrender a legal right.webster third new international dictionary.false can mean not true,deceitful,or tending to mislead.id.at.the juxtaposition of the word false with the word fraudulent,plus the meanings of the words comprising the phrase false claim,suggest an improper claim is aimed at extracting money the government otherwise would not have paid.see clarence kipps,et,materiality as an element of liability under the false claims act,center for continuing legal educ.inst,wl,a claim can not be determined to be true or false without consideration of whether the decisionmaker should pay the is,a claim is false only if the government or other customer would not pay the claim if the facts about the misconduct alleged to have occurred were known.
this notion also applies to subdivisions of a.the former prohibits a party from knowingly using or making a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government,id.a emphasis added,while the latter prohibits conspiring to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid,id.a emphasis added.the language of these provisions plainly links the wrongful activity to the government decision to pay.
on this appeal,the parties dispute whether defendants medicare claims rise to the level of being false or fraudulent.they disagree,in addition,as to the fourth,whether any false or fraudulent claims were knowingly made.the act defines knowingly as either possessing actual knowledge acting in deliberate ignorance of falsity or acting in reckless disregard of falsity.see id.b.
the fifth element of the act further supports the conclusion that the statute reaches only those claims with the potential wrongfully to cause the government to disburse money.the senate report accompanying the amendments to the act states that t he purpose of the amendments is to enhance the government ability to recover losses sustained as a result of fraud against the government,at,reprinted in.the supreme court has further indicated that the act primary purpose is to indemnify the its restitutionary penalty losses caused by a defendant fraud.see united states ex rel.marcus hess.with these understandings of the act language in mind,we turn to plaintiff contentions.
ii legally false certification theory 
the thrust of plaintiff qui tam suit is that the submission of medicare reimbursement claims for spirometry procedures not performed in accordance with the relevant standard of care,that is,the ats the false claims act.mikes relies principally on the certification theory of liability,which is predicated upon a false representation of compliance with a federal statute or regulation or a prescribed contractual term.see lisa michelle phelps,note,calling off the bounty hunters discrediting the use of alleged violations to support civil false claims actions,vand.this theory has also been called legally false certification.see robert fabrikant glenn solomon,application of the federal false claims act to regulatory compliance issues in the health care industry.it differs from factually false certification,which involves an incorrect description of goods or services provided or a request for reimbursement for goods or services never provided.id.
although the false claims act is not designed to reach every kind of fraud practiced on the government,united states mcninch,at,it was intended to embrace at least some claims that suffer from legal falsehood.thus,a false claim may take many forms,the most common being a claim for goods or services not provided,or provided in violation of contract terms,specification,statute,or regulation,at,reprinted in,emphasis added.
just as clearly,a claim for reimbursement made to the government is not legally false simply because the particular service furnished failed to comply with the mandates of a statute,regulation or contractual term that is only tangential to the service for which reimbursement is sought.since the act is restitutionary and aimed at retrieving funds,it would be anomalous to find liability when the alleged noncompliance would not have influenced the government decision to pay.accordingly,while the act is intended to reach all types of fraud,without qualification,that might result in financial loss to the government,united states,d,it does not encompass those instances of regulatory noncompliance that are irrelevant to the government disbursement decisions.
we join the fourth,fifth,ninth,and district of columbia circuits in ruling that a claim under the act is legally false only where a party certifies compliance with a statute or regulation as a condition to governmental payment.see united states ex rel.siewick jamieson sci.eng g,a false certification of compliance with a statute or regulation can not serve as the basis for a qui tam action under the false claims act unless payment is conditioned on that certification.harrison,at,united states ex rel.thompson healthcare,cir united states ex rel.hopper anton,cir.
we add that although materiality is a related concept,our holding is distinct from a requirement imposed by some courts that a false statement or claim must be material to the government funding decision.see,harrison,at.a materiality requirement holds that only a subset of admittedly false claims is subject to false claims act liability.united states ex rel.cantekin of pittsburgh,cir,cert.denied,d finding that hopper held that not every regulatory violation is a knowingly false statement and distinguishing this holding from a materiality requirement.we rule simply that not all instances of regulatory noncompliance will cause a claim to become false.we need not and do not address whether the act contains a separate materiality requirement.
express false certification 
we analyze first plaintiff argument that defendants claims contained an express false certification.an expressly false claim is,as the term suggests,a claim that falsely certifies compliance with a particular statute,regulation or contractual term,where compliance is a prerequisite to payment.
plaintiff contends that by submitting claims for medicare reimbursement on forms or their electronic equivalent,defendants expressly certified that they would comply with the terms set out on the form.form expressly says i certify that the services shown on this form were medically indicated and necessary for the health of the patient and were personally furnished by me or were furnished incident to my professional service by my employee under my immediate personal supervision.both the form,which further provides no part b medicare benefits may be paid unless this form is received as required by existing law and regulations,and the medicare regulations,see,state that certification is a precondition to medicare reimbursement.we agree that defendants certified they would comply with the terms on the form and that such compliance was a precondition of governmental payment.united states ex rel.piacentile wolk,wl,at,finding false claims act violation where defendant altered medicare certificates of medical necessity without doctor authorization,because the forms contained a certification that the claims represented the physician judgment.
yet plaintiff objections to defendants spirometry tests do not implicate the standard set out in the form that the procedure was dictated by medical necessity.the term medical necessity does not impart a qualitative element mandating a particular standard of medical care,and mikes does not point to any legal authority requiring us to read such a mandate into the form.medical necessity ordinarily indicates the the the service.for example,the requisite level of medical necessity may not be met where a party contends that a particular procedure was deleterious or performed solely for profit,see united states ex rel.kneepkins gambro healthcare,d,procedures chosen solely for defendants economic gain are not medically necessary as required by claim submission form,or where a party seeks reimbursement for a procedure that is not traditionally covered,see rush parham,cir upholding state exclusion of experimental medical treatment from definition of medically necessary services under medicaid.
this approach to the phrase medically necessary as applying to ex ante coverage decisions but not ex post critiques of how providers executed a also conform to our understanding of the phrase reasonable and necessary as used in the medicare statute,a a disallowing payment for items or services not reasonable and necessary for diagnosis or treatment.see new york ex rel.bodnar sec y of health human,cir acknowledging secretary authority,in determining whether procedure is reasonable and necessary,to consider type of service provided and whether service was provided in appropriate,setting goodman sullivan,cir per curiam affirming exclusion of experimental procedures from medicare coverage pursuant to requirement that procedures be reasonable and necessary see also friedrich sec y of health human,cir noting that the health care financing administration,when determining whether a procedure is reasonable and necessary,considers the procedure safety,effectiveness,and acceptance by medical community.
moreover,the section of the medicare statute setting forth conditions of participation has separate provisions governing the medical necessity of a given procedure and its quality.compare a practitioner shall assure that the service will be provided economically and only when,and to the extent,medically necessary,with id.a practitioner shall assure that the service will be of a quality which meets professionally recognized standards of health care.this statutory design supports the conclusion that the medical necessity for a procedure and its quality are distinct considerations.
inasmuch as mikes challenges only the quality of defendants spirometry tests and not the decisions to order this procedure for patients,she fails to support her contention that the tests were not medically necessary.nor has she proffered evidence to support an allegation that the defendants did not personally furnish the spirometry tests as required by the form.the form allows for reimbursement when a procedure is rendered under the physician immediate personal supervision by employee,which covers the medical assistants performance of spirometry at defendants direction.thus,plaintiff cause of action insofar as it is founded on express false certification is without merit.
implied false certification 
viability of implied certification theory 
plaintiff insists that defendants submissions to the government for payment were impliedly false certifications.an implied false certification claim is based on the notion that the act of submitting a claim for reimbursement itself implies compliance with governing federal rules that are a precondition to payment.see phelps,supra,at.foundational support for the implied false certification theory may be found in congress expressly stated purpose that the act include at least some kinds of legally false claims,see,at,reprinted in,and in the supreme court admonition that the act intends to reach all forms of fraud that might cause financial loss to the government,see,at.
the implied certification theory was applied in construction,united states,aff,unpublished table decision.the court of federal claims held that the defendants submission of payment vouchers,although containing no express representation,implicitly certified their continued adherence to the eligibility requirements of a federal small business statutory program.see id.at.the failure by defendants to honor the terms of this certification rendered their claims for payment false,resulting in false claims act liability.see id.at.
but caution should be exercised not to read this theory expansively and out of context.the rationale,for example,does not fit comfortably into the health care context because the false claims act was not designed for use as a blunt instrument to enforce compliance with all medical rather only those regulations that are a precondition to to construe the impliedly false certification theory in an expansive fashion would improperly broaden the act reach.moreover,a limited application of implied certification in the health care field reconciles,on the one hand,the need to enforce the medicare statute with,on the other hand,the active role actors outside the federal government play in assuring that appropriate standards of medical care are met.interests of federalism counsel that the regulation of health and safety matters is primarily,and historically,a matter of local concern.hillsborough county automated med,d accord medtronic,lohr,d.
moreover,permitting qui tam plaintiffs to assert that defendants quality of care failed to meet medical standards would promote federalization of medical malpractice,as the federal government or the qui tam relator would replace the aggrieved patient as plaintiff.see patrick scheiderer,note,medical malpractice as a basis for a false claims action.beyond that,we observe that the courts are not the best forum to resolve medical issues concerning levels of care.state,local or private medical agencies,boards and societies are better suited to monitor quality of care issues.see fabrikant solomon,supra,at.
for these reasons,we think a medical provider should be found to have implicitly certified compliance with a particular rule as a condition of reimbursement in limited circumstances.specifically,implied false certification is appropriately applied only when the underlying statute or regulation upon which the plaintiff relies expressly states the provider must comply in order to be paid.see siewick,at holding that court will infer certification from silence only when certification was a prerequisite to the government action sought.liability under the act may properly be found therefore when a defendant submits a claim for reimbursement while that term is defined by the act,see b that payment expressly is precluded because of some noncompliance by the defendant.
plaintiff allegations under the implied theory 
mikes asserts that compliance with a a and a of the medicare statute is a precondition to a request for federal funds and that submission of a form attests by implication to the providers compliance with both of those provisions.
a a.section a a of the medicare statute states that no payment may be made under the medicare statute for any expenses incurred for items or services which are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member.a a emphasis added.because this section contains an express condition of is,no payment may be made it explicitly links each medicare payment to the requirement that the particular item or service be reasonable and necessary.the supreme court has noted that this section precludes the government from reimbursing a medicare provider who fails to comply.see heckler ringer,d see also united seniors ass shalala,if a service is deemed not to have been reasonable and necessary,medicare will not make payment and the doctor generally is prohibited from charging the patient.mount sinai,weinberger,cir explaining that controls whether particular services are covered by medicare.since a a expressly prohibits payment if a provider fails to comply with its terms,defendants submission of the claim forms implicitly certifies compliance with its provision.
yet,mikes insistence that defendants performance of spirometry was not reasonable and necessary is without support.as set forth in our discussion of express certification,the requirement that a service be reasonable and necessary generally pertains to the selection of the particular procedure and not to its performance.see goodman,at.while such factors as the effectiveness and medical acceptance of a given procedure might determine whether it is reasonable and necessary,the failure of the procedure to conform to a particular standard of care ordinarily will not.see id.at noting that under y a a the secretary of health and human services prohibits payment of benefits for any experimental,investigational,or unproven treatment or diagnostic method not yet generally accepted in the medical profession.since plaintiff contends only that defendants performance of spirometry was qualitatively deficient,her allegations that defendants falsely certified compliance with a a may not succeed.
a.plaintiff implied false certification claims rely more heavily upon a.that section does mandate a qualitative standard of care in that it provides 
it shall be the obligation of any health care practitioner who provides health care services for which payment may be made to assure,to the extent of his authority that services or items ordered or provided by such practitioner 
will be provided economically and only when,and to the extent,medically necessary 
will be of a quality which meets professionally recognized standards of health care and 
will be supported by evidence of medical necessity and quality as may reasonably be required by a reviewing peer review organization in the exercise of its duties and responsibilities.
a emphasis added.
mikes avers that the ats guidelines comprise a professionally recognized standard of health care for spirometry,and that defendants failure to conform to those guidelines violates the medicare statute.she believes defendants,by submitting forms for spirometry tests that did not comply with the ats guidelines,engaged in implied false certification.but plaintiff allegations can not establish liability under the false claims act a a the medicare statute does not explicitly condition payment upon compliance with a.
instead,a simply states that i t shall be the obligation of a practitioner who provides a medical service for which payment may be made to assure compliance with the section.hence,it may be seen that a acts prospectively,setting forth obligations for a provider to be eligible to participate in the medicare program.see fischer united states,d describing a as a statutory obligation to qualify to participate in the medicare program see also corkill shalala,cir in order to qualify for reimbursement under the medicare program,a physician must comply with three statutory requirements including a.
the structure of the statute further informs us that a establishes conditions of participation,rather than prerequisites to receiving reimbursement.the statute empowers peer review organizations to monitor providers compliance with a.see a.if a peer review organization determines that a provider has failed in a substantial number of cases to comply with the requirements of a or that the provider has grossly and flagrantly violated the section,the organization reasonable notice and an opportunity for corrective sanctions.see id.b supp.v.if the secretary agrees that sanctions should be imposed,and further finds the provider unwilling or unable substantially to comply with its obligations,the secretary may exclude the provider from the medicare program.see see also doyle sec y of health human,cir explaining statutory and regulatory procedures.
the fact that b permits sanctions for a failure to maintain an appropriate standard of care only where a dereliction occurred in a substantial number of cases or a violation was especially gross and flagrant makes it evident that the section is directed at the provider continued eligibility in the medicare program,rather than any individual incident of noncompliance.see fabrikant solomon,supra,at arguing that quality of care standards are conditions of participation in the medicare program and not conditions of payment.this conclusion is reinforced by the ultimate sanction provided by b exclusion of the provider from medicare eligibility.further,the section explicitly provides that the secretary may authorize an alternate of the cost of the noncompliant service to the united states as a condition to the continued eligibility of the health care provider in the medicare program.b.accordingly,a is quite plainly a condition of participation in the medicare program.
since a does not expressly condition payment on compliance with its t
