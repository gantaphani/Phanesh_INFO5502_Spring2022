on november,brenda diane jones was sentenced to months in prison for aiding and abetting a controlled substance crime.she was then held at the blue earth county jail for three days awaiting transfer to the minnesota department of corrections facility in shakopee.blue earth officers told shakopee officers that jones had been fine until told of the transfer,at which point she became violently sick and uncooperative.as suggested by blue earth,shakopee had extra officers to assist jones from the vehicle.jones arrived at shakopee at,during the second watch shift.officers directed her to exit the vehicle.she did not respond,mumbling and exhibiting a blank stare.as two officers tried to help jones out of the vehicle,she swung her legs to the side as if attempting to exit one officer pushed jones from behind,another pulled from the front,in order to remove her from the vehicle.jones had an unpleasant odor,like urine or body odor,which was noted by various officers throughout the intake process.
once outside the vehicle,she sat down on the floor of the intake garage.jones,mumbling,did not comply with instructions to stand up.one officer applied a technique to make jones comply,which produced no response.officers called for more assistance.one officer described jones as grunting and rolling around on the floor.many officers described jones breathing as heavy,labored,and fast paced.no officer thought jones was having trouble catching her breath.most officers stated that her breathing was rapid as if she had been exerting herself.one officer said that her breathing sounded like his breathing used to sound when he was overweight.one officer thought jones might be.another officer would have called for an response and medical,but did not because the and watch commander were already there.the officers lifted jones into a wheelchair,transporting her to the mead unit for the intake process.
by policy,inmates must be screened for medical,dental,and mental health within hours of arrival at shakopee.that,due to her size,jones could not walk or stand during the screening immediately.nurse pamela smith began the evaluation,but did not complete it because jones did not answer her questions.nurse smith did take jones pulse which was normal and respiration which was three times faster than normal.nurse smith stated that jones respiration returned to normal by the end of the examination,but her records do not indicate a second respiration rate.jones drank two glasses of water after nurse smith offered her a drink.nurse smith noted that jones appeared uncomfortable,grunting,with dried blood on her mouth and lips.westphal also noticed severe chapping and cracking of her lips.nurse smith records indicate that blue earth had not noted any heart problems,and that she planned to jones in a day or so when she might be more cooperative.nurse smith told officers that jones was able to proceed with intake.
by policy,inmates must submit to an unclothed body search as part of intake.told of the search,jones replied you want me to do what asked to remove her clothing,jones took one arm out of her jail uniform,but did not respond to further requests.officers stated that jones seemed unwilling or unable to get out of the wheelchair,commenting that her feet hurt and she wanted to remove her socks.one officer helped remove her socks,looked at her feet and legs,but did not think they appeared swollen.because jones would not cooperate with the unclothed body search,four female officers performed a unclothed body search.she moaned and grunted throughout the search,saying her neck and arm hurt when the officers held them.when one officer inquired whether jones was ok,she grunted in response.
a medical examination is required after a unclothed body search.hedtke asked nurse smith to perform the examination.nurse smith claims she performed the examination,finding no signs of injury.two officers and another inmate stated,however,that nurse smith was in the cell with jones for only seconds,telling her,this is what happens when people do listen to officers,without asking jones any medical questions.
shortly after the body search,the second watch officers left due to a shift change.westphal briefed the watch commander for the third shift on the occurrences of the day.during the third shift,inmates reported that jones was moaning in her cell.officer jones eyes appeared strange and were darting back and nurse smith if she was planning to look in on jones during her rounds although not required by policy since jones was not on medication.nurse smith responded that she had seen jones earlier in the day and nothing was wrong with her.as part of her rounds,officer eskelson checked on jones every half hour each time it appeared jones was resting.later,officer eskelson sent an email stating,this new one on the bed one cares.eskelson found jones unresponsive in her cell at emergency medical staff performed cpr.jones was pronounced dead at,about hours after arriving at shakopee.autopsy revealed she died of a pulmonary edema.during her hours at shakopee,jones never told anyone that she needed medical attention only complaining that her feet hurt,and that her neck and arm hurt during the search.
jela jones,as trustee for his mother heirs,sued the minnesota department of corrections,individual officers,and nurse smith.in addition to the eighth amendment claims,jones also brought claims for excessive force and wrongful death.the district court dismissed the claims against the department and the individual defendants in their official capacity,based on the eleventh amendment.the court granted summary judgment to the individual defendants in their personal capacities,finding that jones did not suffer from an objectively serious medical need,the defendants were not subjectively aware of a serious medical need,and the defendants did not deliberately disregard a serious medical need.the court declined supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims,dismissing them without prejudice.jones appeals the grant of summary judgment to the individual defendants in their personal capacities.
this court reviews de novo a grant of summary judgment.see rsbi aerospace,affiliated fm ins,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if,taking the facts in the light most favorable to the party,there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c celotex catrett,d.a genuine issue of material facts exists if there is a dispute about a fact material to the outcome of the case,and the dispute is genuine in that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for either party.see rsbi,at.
it is well established that the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment extends to protect prisoners from deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.gregoire class,cir.in a deprivation of medical care case,the inmate must show an objectively serious medical need and the defendants actually knew of the medical need but were deliberately indifferent to it.see grayson ross,cir.
