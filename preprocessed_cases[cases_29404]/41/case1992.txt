carol jean brooks brought this action against the manufacturer of simplex bone cement claiming damages for injury resulting from its failure to give adequate warnings about product dangers.the case was dismissed on summary judgment after the district court concluded that her claim was preempted by federal law,of the medical device amendments mda to the food,drug and cosmetic act,et.a panel of this court reversed with one judge dissenting,brooks howmedica,cir,a petition for rehearing en banc was granted,and the panel opinion was vacated.after examining the record and considering medtronic,lohr,d,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
carol jean brooks is a licensed practical nurse whose work as a surgical technician included mixing bone cement.bone cement is used to bond with a bone or prosthesis in orthopedic surgeries,including joint replacements.brooks began mixing bone cement during while she worked at mary hospital in duluth,minnesota,but her principal exposure occurred after she moved to luke hospital in duluth in.at luke she initially participated in a variety of surgeries,but in she began to assist almost exclusively in orthopedic surgeries,mixing bone cement or being present during its preparation approximately four times a week.by she was mixing bone cement or was close to the mixing process during approximately ten surgeries a week.although brooks is unable to identify the brand of bone cement used at mary,it is undisputed that luke used simplex p radiopaque bone cement simplex,which was manufactured and marketed by appellees collectively howmedica 
brooks began to cough at some time in or.she went to see a doctor about it in when she was told she had asthma.an occupational health physician at luke hospital also investigated possible causes for her cough,reviewed howmedica material safety data sheet,and talked with a howmedica chemist,but that investigation did not link her cough to simplex.luke restricted her exposure to a number of chemicals after an acute asthma attack in the restriction included methyl methacrylate which is an ingredient in simplex.brooks was later diagnosed to have occupational asthma caused by exposure to methyl methacrylate.brooks has been unable to work since.
brooks brought a failure to warn claim against howmedica,alleging that it had not provided adequate warnings and instructions for simplex use and that as a result,she had contracted severe asthma and associated respiratory complications.howmedica asserted federal preemption and also denied that the simplex label contained inadequate warnings and instructions or that it proximately caused brooks injury.luke hospital intervened,seeking compensation from howmedica for what it had paid brooks in workers compensation benefits,costs,interest,disbursements,and attorney fees,but it is not involved in this appeal.
starting in the early howmedica began to market bone cement in the united states under the trade mark simplex.bone cement is sold in two separately packaged components methyl methacrylate monomer which is a colorless liquid and a powder mixture containing polymethyl methacrylate,methyl methacrylate styrene copolymer,and barium sulfate.the liquid and powder are mixed together in the operating room to form a pliable mass that later hardens into a cement like consistency.the mixing process releases vapors containing methyl methacrylate,which is classified as a hazardous chemical by the occupational safety and health administration.
it is undisputed that simplex has been heavily regulated by the fda since it entered the market when it was treated as a drug subject to the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act of act.the act required howmedica to submit a new drug application nda before it could sell simplex see,and the nda is a rigorous process.the nda process required howmedica to disclose details of animal studies,manufacturing and quality control procedures,the identification of possible side effects,results of clinical trials,summaries of surgical cases and post operative complications,long term toxicity,and carcinogenicity studies.the process also produced reports from the investigational use of simplex by sixty seven physicians in hip replacements which involved preparations of the product.all these submissions were then studied and reviewed by a panel of fda experts.under the act,simplex could not be marketed without approval by the secretary of health and human services.see c premarket approval process.
the nda included review by the fda of the proposed design and content for all simplex labels,including labels for a vial,a pouch,two internal boxes,an outer box,and a package insert.howmedica employees met with members of the fda on several occasions to discuss its application,including the product labels.the fda reviewed every word that appeared on simplex labels,and the fda drafted the language that was used in the package insert.that package insert included the following warning 
as the liquid monomer is highly volatile and flammable,the operative room should be provided with adequate air circulation.caution should be exercised during the mixing of the two components to prevent excessive exposure to the concentrated vapors of the monomer which may produce irritation of the respiratory tract,eyes,and possibly the liver.
the vial containing the liquid component and the box with the powder both referred the user to the package insert for information regarding dosage and administration.
simplex was approved by the fda for use in total hip replacement surgeries in.the fda wrote w e have completed the review of this application and have concluded that the drug is safe and effective for use as recommended in the submitted labeling.accordingly,the application is approved.
these review requirements were affected by the medical device amendments mda to the act.the mda created three classes of medical devices,categorized by the risk to the public and the degree of regulation required.class i devices present no unreasonable risk of illness or injury and are subject only to general controls.a a.class ii devices present greater risk than those in class i,and they must comply with federal performance regulations called special controls but may be marketed without advance approval.id.at a b.class iii devices carry a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury,or are used for supporting or sustaining human life,or are seen to be of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health.id.at a c.class iii devices are highly regulated and must receive premarket approval pma from the fda before they may be sold.id.at a 
devices such as simplex,which had been treated as drugs prior to the amendments to the act,were automatically reclassified by the mda as class iii medical devices see l.the statute provided that these devices were deemed to have pma approval if they had gone through the nda approval process.id.at l a.beginning in simplex was accordingly treated as a class iii medical device with pma approval.
under both the act and the mda,the fda has continuing authority and responsibility to control the content of any information or warnings howmedica provides simplex users.howmedica was required to provide the fda with regular reports of any new information learned about simplex.see k.the company was not permitted to make any changes to the product label affecting the safety or effectiveness of the device without submitting a supplemental pma,but it could temporarily add or strengthen warnings during the time the fda had any supplement under consideration.a,d.
howmedica learned that some individuals exposed to simplex had developed contact dermatitis,and in it requested permission from the fda to insert the following language into its warnings the liquid component is a powerful lipid solvent,and may also act as a sensitizer in certain individuals.after its consideration of the request,the fda decided to direct howmedica to revise its package insert to include this additional language 
the liquid component is a powerful lipid solvent.it has caused contact dermatitis in susceptible individuals.wearing of a second pair of surgical gloves and strict adherence to the mixing instructions may diminish the possibility of hypersensitivity reactions.the compound should not be allowed to come into direct contact with sensitive tissues or be absorbed by the body.
in,the fda required bone cement manufacturers to participate in a review of the inhalation toxicity of methyl methacrylate vapors,and the simplex warnings were reexamined.after a number of discussions,the fda required simplex to modify the package insert warnings concerning vapor inhalation as follows 
as the liquid monomer is highly volatile and flammable,the operating room should be provided with adequate ventilation so as to eliminate the maximum amount of monomer vapor.caution should be exercised during the mixing of the two components to prevent excessive exposure to the concentrated vapors of the monomer which may produce irritation of the respiratory tract,eyes,and possibly the liver.
the fda also directed howmedica to send a dear doctor letter to simplex users to warn about inhalation hazards associated with methyl methacrylate.howmedica told the fda it believed the letter was unnecessary because studies had shown that the concentration of methyl methacrylate vapors in operating rooms was within accepted limits,but the fda insisted on compliance with its directive.howmedica and the fda then worked together to draft the letter,which directed attention to methyl methacrylate vapor inhalation studies and to the package insert warning.it also recommended that hospital facilities be inspected for adequate ventilation.the final paragraph of the letter warned 
in some sensitive individuals,exposure to mma can cause dermatitis and other allergenic responses.if any of your operating room personnel develop such responses when using simplex,both prudence and good medical practice would suggest that they avoid all procedures involving use of simplex.
howmedica sought to expand the uses of simplex,and in march the fda approved its request from the previous year to use the product in fixing pathological fractures.the fda approved the request with the condition that howmedica send the dear doctor letter to members of the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons and to all hospital administrators and operating room supervisors at hospitals and clinics which had recently purchased simplex.in july,howmedica submitted a supplemental nda to seek approval of simplex use in elbow,wrist,ankle,shoulder,and finger joint replacement surgery.during this application process,the fda again reviewed simplex labels and required specific changes be made to reflect these uses.after howmedica had made the required labeling changes,the fda approved the application.
in,howmedica received information that soft contact lenses could be damaged by methyl methacrylate vapors and requested that additional warnings be added to simplex labels.the fda approved the addition of the following warning 
it has been recommended by manufacturers of soft contact lenses that such lenses should be removed in the presence of noxious and irritating vapors.since soft contact lenses are quite permeable,they should not be worn in an operating room where methyl methacrylate is being mixed.
this addition was the final adjustment made to the simplex warning related to occupational use during the period when carol brooks was exposed to the product.
after discovery was complete in the district court,howmedica moved for summary judgment.it argued that brooks failure to warn claim was preempted by the mda because she sought to impose a requirement on simplex that was different from,or in addition to,federal requirements developed through the nda process.it also argued that any inadequacy in simplex warnings was not the proximate cause of brooks injury because she admitted she had never read the product labels or package insert.brooks argued that her claim was not preempted because the duty to warn is a general obligation applicable to all devices,and approval by the pma or nda does not impose specific federal requirements with preemptive effect.she also asserted at this time that howmedica had failed to comply with general fda labeling regulations although she had not pled such a claim in her complaint.
the district court granted howmedica motion and dismissed the case.after a comprehensive discussion of the relevant case law,the court concluded that even if brooks could show that her injury had been caused by howmedica failure to provide her with adequate warnings and directions for use,her failure to warn claim was preempted by federal law and that she had not submitted sufficient support for any claim that howmedica failed to comply with fda rules or regulations.
brooks appealed,arguing that her general common law duty to warn claim was not preempted and that the nda and pma are not specific federal requirements with preemptive force.she also argued that howmedica alleged breach of its duty under common law amounted to a violation of general fda labeling requirements.howmedica responded that simplex is deemed under the mda to have pma approval and that the pma has been recognized by this court to be a federal requirement with preemptive effect,citing martello ciba vision,cir.it argued that brooks claim was a state requirement different from,or in addition to,the federal requirement and therefore preempted under of the mda.howmedica also argued that brooks had provided no evidence that it had violated any fda rules or regulations.both sides contended that the supreme court decision in medtronic lohr,d,favored their respective positions.
a panel of this court reversed the dismissal of the failure to warn claim,with one judge dissenting.brooks howmedica,cir.the majority interpreted lohr to permit the claim to go forward,holding that the claim would not result in any actual conflict between state common law and federal requirements and was therefore not preempted.id.at.the dissent pointed out that the device at issue in lohr had been approved through a much less rigorous process than the pma and the nda review of simplex,and that during the regulatory process for simplex the fda had considered a particular federal requirement,had concluded how competing considerations regarding that requirement should be resolved,and had imposed a specific mandate on howmedica to that end.id.at.the panel treated brooks allegation that howmedica had not complied with fda regulations as a common law negligence per se claim and affirmed its dismissal.id.at.
howmedica petition for rehearing en banc was granted,and the panel opinion was vacated.the parties submitted additional briefs,and the product liability advisory council,was given permission to submit an amicus brief at oral argument,the parties advanced substantially the same points they had made earlier,but brooks put increased emphasis on her contention that the link between methyl methacrylate and occupational asthma had not been made until.she asserts that the product warning was not changed in response to the publication in of two articles linking methyl methacrylate and occupational asthma and that it is not clear that the fda ever considered such a risk.howmedica responds that the fda decided on the wording of the warnings for the simplex package insert with full awareness of the respiratory risks.
a grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.united states scherping,cir.summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party would be entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.brooks contends that her state claim for failure to warn is not preempted under the mda,and she also advances an argument that she has a state claim of inadequate labeling which parallels federal labeling requirements.howmedica responds that the district court correctly dismissed the claims on summary judgment.
state law which conflicts with federal law is preempted under the supremacy clause of the constitution,art.vi,cl.congressional intent to preempt state law can either be expressed in statutory language or implied in the structure and purpose of federal law.cipollone liggett group,d at the time carol brooks was exposed to simplex,the product was regulated as a class iii device under the mda,which contains an express preemption provision,codified at 
a n o state or political subdivision of a state may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement 
which is different from,or in addition to,any requirements applicable under this act to the device,and 
which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this act.
at first glance the preemption issue presented here under might seem quite simple since the state law result sought by brooks relates to safety and would impose different or additional requirements on the product warning for simplex.that the issue is not so simple is evidenced by medtronic,lohr,d,a case in which a sharply divided supreme court interpreted.
lohr involved claims relating to the design,manufacture,and labeling of a pacemaker,including claims for common law failure to warn and violation of fda regulations.id.at.the manufacturer unsuccessfully attempted to persuade a majority of the court that lohr failure to warn claim was barred by the mda preemption provision.the court split,with justice breyer the swing vote as he joined first one group of justices,then the other.justice stevens,writing for a four justice plurality,stated that would rarely,if ever,preempt state common law claims.id.at.justice on behalf of four dissenting justices disagreed,believing that preempts any state a common law is different from,or in addition to a federal requirement.id.at.justice breyer agreed with justice that state common law claims can be subject to preemption under,id.at,but he joined justice stevens and the plurality in ruling on lohr claim for failure to warn.
in a part of the opinion written by justice stevens and joined by justice breyer,the lohr court examined the regulations promulgated by the fda which contain the agency interpretation of 
d state or local requirements are preempted only when the fda has established specific counterpart regulations or there are other specific requirements applicable to a particular device under the act,thereby making any existing divergent state or local requirements applicable to the device different from,or in addition to,the specific fda requirements 
does not preempt state or local requirements of general applicability where the purpose of the requirement relates either to other products in addition to devices or to unfair trade practices in which the requirements are not limited to devices.
ii generally,does not preempt a state or local requirement prohibiting the manufacture of misbranded devices unless such a prohibition has the effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific device,a specific labeling requirement,that is different from,or in addition to,a federal requirement established under the act 
d.these regulations attempt to clarify the intended meaning of the statutory language,and the lohr court said it was substantially informed by them.at.
drawing on the statute and the regulations,the stevens majority in lohr described a series of requirements necessary for a finding of preemption under the mda.state requirements are preempted only if they relate to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to another matter included in a requirement applicable to the device.id.at.state requirements must be with respect to medical devices,and state requirements of general applicability are subject to preemption only if they have the effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific device.id.federal requirements must also be applicable to the device at issue that is,they must be specific counterpart regulations or specific to the particular device.id.state law will be preempted under the mda when a particular state requirement threatens to interfere with a specific federal interest.id.
the court concluded that lohr failure to warn claim was too general to require preemption.id.at.although the duty to inform users of potential product dangers applies to all manufacturers,this general duty was not specifically developed with respect to medical devices.id.at.medtronic duty to warn in respect to the pacemaker was not the kind of requirement that congress and the fda feared would impede the ability of federal regulators to implement and enforce specific federal requirements.id.
if some of the language in lohr were read without careful consideration of the separate opinions,it might imply that no state tort claim could ever be preempted since each is based on broadly applicable common law duties.such a reading would directly contradict the view of a separate majority of the court,however,for five justices concurred in justice statement that clearly preempts any state action that would impose a requirement different from,or in addition to a specific federal requirement.id.at.see also id.at.breyer,concurring.
the crux of the disagreement in lohr between the stevens majority and the dissenters is the meaning to be given to the statutory phrase a requirement different from,or in addition to.lohr instructs that state common law preempted to the extent that they interfere with specific federal requirements.the state and federal restrictions must be carefully compar ed to ascertain whether there is interference between being the overarching concern of the test articulated by justice stevens and joined in by justice breyer.id.at.a state claim will be preempted in circumstances where a particular state requirement threatens to interfere with a specific federal interest.id.in his concurring opinion justice breyer phrased the issue as whether an actual conflict exists between the state and federal requirements,id.at.and that opinion deserves close attention since his vote created the majority.the key question before the court is whether the specific state requirement brooks wishes to impose on simplex would interfere with a specific federal requirement,but the question may also be phrased as whether the specific state and federal requirements conflict.
in lohr,the plaintiff failure to warn claim did not conflict with the federal requirements imposed on the medtronic pacemaker.the product had received fda approval through a system intended to allow rapid introduction of improvements to existing devices.id.at.under the k process involved in lohr,a device can be sold without pma approval if it is substantially equivalent to one already on the market.see b b c.a substantially equivalent device is examined in the k process only for similarities with existing devices safety and effectiveness are not the focus.lohr,at.section k approval is a mere grant to market it imposes no requirements of its own.id.at.the pacemaker there was subject to a federal regulation requiring medtronic to provide a label indicating any relevant hazards,contraindications,side effects,and precautions.c.this requirement applied to all manufacturers in the industry and reflected generic concerns about device regulation.it did not require the fda to be involved in the drafting or approval of the pacemaker product label.the requirement was not specific,and a common law claim would not impede the ability of federal regulators to implement and enforce it.at.
the facts in the case before the court are very different from those in lohr.the fda drafted or approved every word of the simplex label,and any changes were subject to close fda scrutiny.pma review typically requires hours of rigorous testing for device safety.in contrast,k review focuses on substantial equivalence and is completed in an average of twenty hours.id.at.the two processes are by no means comparable.lohr,at.
our court considered the preemptive effect of the mda in a decision predating lohr,martello ciba vision,cir.in martello,we held that the pma is a specific federal requirement within the meaning of which preempts state court claims involving safety when the claims would impose additional requirements in areas it has regulated.id.at.under lohr this holding requires some modification because common law claims are only preempted to the extent that they threaten to interfere with specific federal requirements.at.
most courts of appeal have interpreted lohr to mean that the mda preempts common law claims to the extent that they interfere or conflict with specific federal requirements.see,martin medtronic,cir kemp medtronic,cir mitchell collagen,cir papike tambrands,cir.but see oja howmedica,cir common law failure to warn claim is not subject to preemption under the mda.martin,kemp,and mitchell all considered failure to warn claims involving products which had had a full pma like that undergone by simplex.the fifth circuit in martin concluded that a general duty of care under state law is preempted if the elements needed to prove its violation are specific and therefore threaten specific federal requirements.at.because the design of the martin product label had been approved by the fda through the pma process,a failure to warn claim would impose state requirements that would conflict with specific federal requirements and it was therefore preempted.id.at.similarly,the sixth circuit in kemp held that a common law claim is preempted if it would add different or additional elements to specific federal requirements approved through the pma.at.the seventh circuit also concluded in mitchell that when a manufacturer has adhered to the pma process,a common law claim of mislabeling is preempted because it would impose different or additional requirements.at.papike,at failure to warn claim preempted by fda labeling regulations regarding toxic shock syndrome.
those circuit court decisions since lohr which have not found preemption in failure to warn cases were faced with circumstances different from those in this case.in oja,the tenth circuit held that a common law duty to warn is not a substantive requirement subject to preemption,but that case involved approval through an investigational device exemption,a considerably less rigorous process than the full pma.at.in goodlin medtronic,cir,a case in which the fda had issued no statement or order of requirements beyond review and approval of the initial pma,the eleventh circuit ruled that simple approval of the pma application imposes no federal requirements.id.at.the goodlin court implied,however,that it would find preemption in a case involving an ascertainable requirement in an express fda order or regulation.id.citing papike,at.that is what we have here,where the fda has issued a series of specific mandates regarding the label for simplex.simplex has been subject to continuing and specific fda regulation,beyond its initial approval through the pma process.
the failure to warn claim asserted by brooks would interfere or conflict with the specific federal requirements imposed during the regulation of simplex.a jury finding of negligent failure to warn would be premised on the fact that the label for simplex was not written in a particular way or did not contain certain information.this would be equivalent to a state regulation imposing specific label requirements.justice breyer illustrated this principle in his concurring opinion in lohr when he pointed out that if a jury were to find negligence in the use of a wire longer than one inch in the manufacture of a hearing aid when the fda had required a two inch wire,there would be federal preemption as surely as if a state regulation were to impose such a limitation.id.at.breyer,concurring 
the effect of a jury finding of negligent failure to warn would be that state law would require howmedica to change the label and package insert for simplex,but howmedica may not unilaterally make such changes under federal law.a device may not be labeled in a manner inconsistent with any conditions specified in its pma.a manufacturer must submit a supplemental pma for any proposed labeling changes that affect the safety of the device.id.at a.brooks points out that the regulations permit manufacturers to make temporary changes in the interest of safety,see id.at d,but such changes are valid only after the manufacturer has submitted a supplemental pma and only during the pendency of that application.id.at a,d.once the supplemental pma has been approved,modified,or denied,the manufacturer must comply with the fda decision.id.at.
brooks argues that limiting the warnings on a label would not seem to advance the fda purpose to ensure device safety.there are,however,a number of sound reasons why the fda may prefer to limit warnings on product labels.warnings about dangers with less basis in science or fewer hazards could take attention away from those that present confirmed,higher risks.a label with many varied warnings may not deliver the desired information to users.space on product labeling material is also a factor,and the most effective labels are those with large,bold warnings and a simple design.see generally ctr.for devices radiological health,dep t of health human,guidance on medical device patient labeling final guidance for industry and fda reviewers,available at.pdf.see also richard cooper,drug labeling and products liability the role of the food drug administration,food,drug cosm.the fda enabling statute also reflects these concerns warnings must be prominent and conspicuous,as compared with other material on the label.c.
the arguments advanced by brooks ignore the need for national uniformity in product regulation,one of the explicit goals of the mda.the legislative history indicates that this was the reason the preemption provision was included within the mda,i f a substantial number of differing requirements applicable to a medical device are imposed by jurisdictions other than the federal government,interstate commerce would be unduly burdened.the state requirement in this case would come from a common law duty as applied by an individual jury.trials of tort claims pose incentives to overwarn the visible monetary costs of additional warnings are typically quite few pennies for a bit more paper and a little more ink.james henderson aaron twerski,doctrinal collapse in products liability the empty shell of failure to warn.it would be difficult for a jury focused on a single case to take into account the cumulative,systemic effects of a series of verdicts.richard stewart,regulatory compliance preclusion of tort liability limiting the system,geo.in contrast,the fda possesses a broader perspective.regulation by the fda allows the agency to craft labels that maximize safety and effectiveness.
brooks also claims that an alleged link between methyl methacrylate and occupational asthma first became known in,well after the original fda approval of simplex in.she suggests that the fda did not consider such a danger nor impose any warning requirement with respect to it.she bases this argument on the fact that two articles appeared in which describe case studies linking methyl methacrylate and occupational asthma and one claimed there had been no previous published report of the chemical association with asthma.lozewicz et,occupational asthma due to methyl methacrylate and cyanoacrylates,thorax.neither of the two experts put forward by brooks nor the cited articles claimed,however,that the risk of respiratory irritation from methyl methacrylate had not been previously appreciated,and the product labeling for simplex and the dear doctor letter are evidence to the contrary 
the record demonstrates that the fda was aware of a possible link between methyl methacrylate and respiratory damage for several decades,and the agency required howmedica to take specific steps in response.the label for simplex incorporated the danger of sensitivity to vapors from the very beginning.when simplex was introduced in,the fda drafted a package insert which warned that the liquid methyl methacrylate used in mixing is highly volatile and that the mixing process required both adequate air circulation and caution to prevent excessive exposure to the concentrated vapors which could produce irritation of the respiratory tract.in howmedica requested permission to add to the warning to indicate that the ingredients of the product could act as a sensitizer,but the fda decided on different wording,requiring a warning about strict adherence to the mixing instructions to diminish the possibility of hypersensitivity reactions and to prevent absorption of the product.
the fda conducted an official review of the inhalation toxicity of methyl methacrylate vapors by operating room personnel in,and it subsequently directed howmedica to send a dear doctor letter to simplex users drafted by both howmedica and the fda.the letter directed user attention to methyl methacrylate vapor inhalation studies and to the package insert warning and recommended that user facilities be inspected for adequate ventilation.the fda also mandated changes in the package label.the new version read 
as the liquid monomer is highly volatile and flammable,the operating room should be provided with adequate ventilation so as to eliminate the maximum amount of monomer vapor.caution should be exercised during the mixing of the two components to prevent excessive exposure to the concentrated vapors of the monomer which may produce irritation of the respiratory tract,eyes,and possibly the liver.emphasis added 
in,after receiving reports of damage to soft contact lenses,howmedica requested,and the fda approved,an additional warning for the simplex package insert referring to the vapors created during the mixing process as noxious and irritating.
the fda was deeply involved in drafting and editing the warnings on the simplex label and package label,beginning with the product approval in and continuing on through the period in which brooks was exposed to it.through its approval of the pma application for simplex and its continuing series of directives,the agency imposed specific federal requirements on howmedica.the failure to warn claim brooks seeks to assert could impose state requirements which conflict or interfere with these federal directives.because these particular state requirement s threaten to interfere with specific federal interest s,lohr,at,brooks claim is preempted by the mda.
brooks also argued in the district court that simplex instructions were inadequate under federal law because fda regulations require package labeling for prescription products to contain information about any relevant hazards,contraindications,side effects,and precautions.c.brooks claims that her common law claim contains requirements identical to those imposed under federal law and is therefore not preempted.brooks is correct in her assertion that a claim of failure to comply with fda regulations is not preempted by the mda,lohr,at,since such a state claim imposes no requirement different from,or in addition to any federal requirement.id.at.see also id.at,concurring in part and dissenting in part.her assertion that she has put forward such a cause of action is a separate issue,however.the district court dismissed any claim that howmedica failed to comply with fda rules or regulations because it found no showing of noncompliance.the panel treated this claim as one for negligence per se unsupported in the record.brooks asserts that her argument has been misunderstood and that she alleges a violation of state law that parallels similar requirements under federal law.
this unpled claim lacks both clarity and support,and we find no error in its dismissal.to the extent that brooks attempts to distance herself from the categorization of this claim as one for negligence per se,the claim begins to sound very similar to the preempted failure to warn claim just discussed.papike,at denying a claim that general labeling regulations require warnings beyond those contained in specific fda requirements.under the type of theory brooks advances the general duty of c could trump even the most specific fda labeling directive and of the mda could be completely circumvented.moreover,brooks has presented no evidence that howmedica violated federal regulations or refused to add warnings drafted by the fda,changed labels failed to meet regular reporting requirements,failed to report a known hazard to the fda,or failed to comply with federal law in any other respect.we conclude that this claim was properly dismissed on summary judgment.
simplex package labeling was subject to meticulous and ongoing federal regulation from the product approval in through the time of brooks exposure to it.the fda imposed specific federal requirements on simplex through the pma and nda process.the specific state requirement brooks seeks to establish by her common law claim would interfere with the specific federal requirements set for simplex.her claim is therefore preempted under of the mda because it would impose a specific state requirement different from,or in addition to specific federal requirements.there is also no showing that howmedica violated federal regulations.for these reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the majority stitches together a coherent,scholarly explication of preemption from the complicated opinions of the supreme court in medtronic,lohr,d.i admire the majority efforts.i also agree with its development of a test,in which courts must discern the federal requirement imposed on a medical device manufacturer,then the state requirement imposed on that manufacturer,and finally compare the two to determine whether they present conflicting obligations.though i agree with the standard expressed by the majority,i strongly disagree with its application of that standard to the facts of carol brooks case and i respectfully dissent in that respect.
following lohr,we search for incompatibility between state laws or putative state court judgments and federal requirements imposed on manufacturers.howmedica claims that the fda labeling requirements for simplex conflict with a hypothetical adverse judgment on brooks claim.howmedica raises two distinct arguments in support of this claim,but neither survives careful scrutiny.the majority adds two considerations in favor of preemption that i find unpersuasive.i address these four arguments in turn.
howmedica professes that it is powerless to alter simplex packaging or warning insert,and hence it could not comply both with a judgment and the federal labeling regulations.in effect,while a judgment would require howmedica to add to its labeling and package insert,it asserts,federal regulations would require howmedica not to add to its labeling and package insert.howmedica submits that this epitomizes the need for,and importance of,preemption.
howmedica argument misstates a critical premise.fda labeling regulations do not mandate that simplex label and package insert remain in their state.the fda regulations authorize howmedica to initiate changes to simplex labeling.see d i authorizing medical device manufacturers to change labels to add or strengthen a contraindication,warning,precaution,or information about an adverse reaction,d ii permitting l abeling changes that add or strengthen an instruction that is intended to enhance the safe use of the device.section d is not a relic of past regulatory efforts to which we attach little or no importance.the provision is a vital component of the fda larger regulatory mission of ensuring that manufacturers amend their warnings and their products in response to safety concerns and scientific advancements.the supreme court explicitly acknowledged the provision importance in lohr we also note that the agency permits manufacturers of devices that have received pma to make certain labeling changes which would enhance the safety of the device or the safety in the use of the device without prior fda approval.see cfr d and.lohr,at.punctuation removed.
if,for example,howmedica learns that simplex poses an unforeseen risk to consumers health,howmedica may immediately alter simplex labeling and package inserts to warn users of the risk.howmedica does not have the final say,of course howmedica has only the power to initiate review before the fda concerning the merits of additional warnings.interim warnings added by a manufacturer must be simultaneously submitted for fda approval,and the proposed additions will be vetted by fda doctors.if the fda approves the additional warnings,the manufacturer may continue to display them.if the fda rejects the additional warnings,however,the manufacturer must then remove the warnings to maintain compliance with the fda specific mandate.in sum,while fda approval is pending,a manufacturer may include additional warnings on labeling and package inserts.
section d relieves any tension between brooks claim and the fda ongoing oversight of simplex labeling.simplex label and package insert have never contained warnings or information about the risk of contracting asthma.brooks asserts that the scientific community began to learn of the propensity of methyl methacrylate vapors in and,more than a decade after the fda approved simplex for use in the united states.brooks claims that howmedica negligently failed to warn simplex users that repeated exposure to vapors released in the mixing process could cause occupational asthma.though the fda approved simplex labeling without the type of asthma warnings suggested by brooks,howmedica could have sought fda approval to add such warnings in the.under d,howmedica could have altered its label or package alert users to the dangers of contracting asthma,pending permanent fda approval of those warnings.
had the fda refused permission to add asthma warnings,brooks claim would almost certainly be preempted.in that hypothetical instance,howmedica would face the dilemma it so fears a state law judgment would effectively require it to add an asthma warning that the fda mandated must not be included.that hypothetical example is not the present case,however.in this case,howmedica made no effort to warn simplex users about asthma,though it had the power to do so initially,and could have done so permanently with the fda approval.brooks attempt to hold howmedica liable for this alleged shortcoming in no way conflicts with fda oversight of medical device labeling generally,or with simplex federal labeling requirements specifically.
my understanding of d role in the preemption analysis is identical to that of the former chief counsel of the fda,richard cooper.in some situations,fda has not,at the relevant time,considered the precise question of whether the insert it had previously approved should be changed in light of subsequent information.where that is the case,there would seem to be no relevant federal decision entitled to supremacy.richard cooper,drug labeling and products liability the role of the food and drug administration,food drug cosm,discussing the regulatory predecessor to d.cooper cautions courts not to fda regulations as permitting drug manufacturers carte blanche authority to change labeling or package inserts,id.at,a point with which i fully agree.but cooper ultimately ascribes to the fundamental point we raise above manufacturers possess the authority,consistent with d,to initiate the process of changing a medical device label to warn users of a risk.manufacturers who negligently fail to seek fda approval for such additional warnings and to supplement their warnings pending fda approval can not benefit from preemption defense because they encounter no conflict between their respective state and federal obligations.
in the present case,brooks state law claim and the fda scheme of regulatory oversight may coexist without impediment,and thus preemption is inappropriate.
howmedica also argues there is actual conflict between state and federal accepting my interpretation of d for argument sake.howmedica contends the fda rejected the type of asthma warning that brooks advocates when it approved simplex initial warnings in,and when it oversaw simplex labeling changes in and.howmedica asserts it presented possible warnings to the fda that encompassed risks.the fda incorporated some of those warnings into the package insert,but rejected others.in either event,howmedica posits,the fda decision to accept or reject such warnings constitutes specific federal regulations inconsistent with brooks effort to obtain a judgment requiring an asthma warning.
the record does not substantiate howmedica assertions.in the first place,howmedica has not directed the court to any evidence that warnings specifically pertaining to asthma were discussed by the fda or presented for its consideration.howmedica is therefore left to contend that the warnings it did propose,and those considered by the fda,encompass the same territory as an asthma warning.howmedica argues,in effect,that some of the warnings it proposed would have done the work of an asthma warning,and thus the fda rejection of those warnings implies a specific federal prohibition.this contention also lacks any basis for support in the record presented to the district court.
the package insert warnings drafted by the fda in during the pma process mention the following 
caution should be exercised during the mixing of simplex two components to prevent excessive exposure to the concentrated vapors of the monomer which may produce irritation of the respiratory tract,eyes,and possibly the liver.
brooks app.aff.of christopher lawler,exh.k.
it is obvious this warning does not encompass asthma in the manner howmedica suggests.warning a simplex user of possible irritation of the respiratory tract is not equivalent to warning the user about contracting asthma through repeated exposure.the warning does not adequately reflect the medical reality of an asthmatic condition.asthma is a chronic disease that derives from repeated exposure to irritants or allergens,see gale encyclopedia of medicine brooks app.depo.of kaye,yet the simplex warning bears no mention of duration or exposure.to the contrary,the warning implies to the reader that possible irritation will be only temporary.moreover,the label does not even hint that such exposure might cause disease.
howmedica argument fares no better if the warning in fact connotes permanent harm.viewed most charitably to howmedica,the warning reference to irritation of the respiratory tract might incorporate the possibility of suffering.brooks strongly disagrees any such inference may be drawn,and thus a dispute of material fact perhaps a dispute of medical fact would prevent the entry of summary judgment.because we are presently reviewing the propriety of summary judgment entered against brooks,we are in no position to draw factual inferences in favor of howmedica.if such a factual dispute exists,its thus the overarching preemption question presented in this require some initial.brown hotel rest.employees bartenders int l union,d expressing an inability to resolve a preemption question until appropriate findings of fact had been made to permit review of the legal question.
howmedica assertion that the fda considered and rejected warnings encompassing asthma in and is even less believable.in early,the fda commenced review of the inhalation toxicity of methyl methacrylate vapors.howmedica and other manufacturers were required to participate in committee meetings and other proceedings with the fda.as a result of these discussions,the fda required howmedica to alter the simplex package insert to state simplex liquid component was highly flammable and operating rooms should be adequately ventilated.see brooks app.lawler aff.the fda also required howmedica to send a dear doctor letter pertaining to concerns of inhalation toxicity.see id.at lawler,exh.z.
it can not fairly be contended that the warnings the fda required in the were germane to asthma.the fda was then concerned with the inhalation toxicity of methyl methacrylate vapors.toxins are essentially poisons.see supra,gale encyclopedia at.but brooks does not claim she was poisoned by exposure to simplex.she claims she contracted asthma from repeated exposure to the vaporous byproducts of the simplex mixing process.howmedica has not directed our attention to any evidence that suggests the fda considered and rejected warnings that would have notified simplex users of the risk of contracting asthma.the fda consideration of inhalation toxicity studies simply does not indicate the fda considered warnings related to asthma.
and even if the fda had considered and rejected asthma warnings in the,howmedica would still fail.brooks claim is predicated upon scientific discoveries of the.see,brooks app.plaintiff
