this case presents us with a question of statutory construction viewed through the lens of the administrative procedure act apa,which cautions that agency decisions may only be set aside if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law or are unsupported by substantial evidence or otherwise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute.a,e.
because the parties do not contest the facts underlying this dispute,we will rely upon the district court factual recitation to set the stage 
both parties stipulated to the relevant facts in a hearing before the board,and the court agrees with the parties that there is no dispute as to any material factual issues.acmc is a hospital located in ashtabula,ohio.in may,acmc entered into an agreement for purchase of the right to operate nursing home beds with the county commissioners of ashtabula county,the owners of the ashtabula county home ach,under which acmc acquired the right,title,and interest to fifteen of ach beds at a price of per bed.acmc and ach are separate and unrelated health care institutions,and acmc acquired no other assets from ach.under ohio law,which has imposed a moratorium on nursing facility beds in the state of ohio,acmc was required to purchase existing beds from another provider and apply for a certificate of need con before commencing operations.it applied in june for a con granting it authority to acquire,relocate,and place into service fifteen care beds on its premises,and the application was granted in october.acmc,which had not operated as a nursing facility or a skilled nursing facility snf previously,became on march.when acmc began operating its snf,no ach personnel became acmc employees or managers.ach continued to operate as a distinct entity,without any change in its licensure or certification.furthermore,no ach residents were transferred to acmc when acmc began operating the snf.rather,all of the admissions and residents of acmc distinct part snf during the first six months of operation had home addresses within health service area hsa,one of the ten regions into which ohio is divided for the purposes of administering the con program.both ach and acmc are located within hsa,about seven miles from one another.
in july,acmc submitted a request for an exemption under the new provider provision from the routine cost limits rcls applicable under the medicare statutes.the new provider provision is an exemption from the statutory caps placed on medicare reimbursement for health care providers,who,under the medicare program,are generally reimbursed up to the statutory limit for their reasonable costs in providing necessary health care services.on july,the health care financing administration hcfa since renamed the centers for medicare and medicaid services denied the request.acmc appealed to the prrb the board,which affirmed hcfa decision.the board opinion became the final decision of the secretary pursuant to f.acmc now seeks judicial review of the prrb determination that acmc does not qualify for a new provider exemption to the rcls.

the social security act,which established the medicare program,provides payment to qualified hospitals and snfs nursing homes in return for the services that they provide to older and disabled citizens.for the relevant period,the medicare program restricted payments to snfs to an amount equal to the lesser of the reasonable cost of or the customary charge for its services 
the reasonable cost of any services shall be the cost actually incurred,excluding therefrom any part of incurred cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services,and shall be determined in accordance with regulations establishing the method or methods to be used,and the items to be included,in determining such costs for various types or classes of institutions,agencies,and services 
v a.this reasonable cost restriction applies to routine service costs,which include things like a room,board,and nursing care.whenever a snf routine service costs go over per diem cost limitations,they are deemed unreasonable.the manner in which the applicable routine service cost limits,referred to as rcls,are calculated has been adequately summarized elsewhere by this court.see francis health care ctr.shalala,cir.
as the passage quoted from the district court opinion makes clear,the central issue in this appeal is an exception to the rcl restrictions,known as the new provider exemption.as the provider reimbursement manual prm explains,e provides for an exemption from the snf routine service cost limits for new providers.this provision was implemented to recognize the difficulties in meeting the applicable cost limits due to underutilization during the initial years of providing skilled nursing rehabilitative services.hcfa pub,at.the disputed regulation,which has since been amended,defined a new provider in these terms 
a new provider is a provider of inpatient services that has operated as the type of provider or the equivalent for which it is certified for medicare,under present and previous ownership,for less than three full years.an exemption granted under this paragraph expires at the end of the provider first cost reporting period beginning at least two years after the provider accepts its first patient.
e.the prm provides the following gloss on this exemption 
although a complete change in the operation of the institution shall affect whether and how long a provider shall be considered a new provider,changes of the institution ownership or geographic location do not in itself alter the type of health care furnished and shall not be considered in the determination of the length of operation.
however,for purposes of this provision,a provider which relocates may be granted new provider status where the normal inpatient population can no longer be expected to be served at the new location

as already mentioned,acmc purchased the right to operate fifteen nursing home beds from ach in.for its part,ach had provided skilled nursing care since.acmc paid to acquire the beds from ach,which it then relocated to its hospital complex.in the process,it obtained a con from the state of ohio,as well as medicare certification.
acmc sought the new provider exemption described above for its facility.after the hcfa determined that the snf did not qualify as a new provider,the hospital appealed to the board,which affirmed the denial in a decision rendered on june.in its decision,the board relied upon the factual stipulations recited by the district court.the board based its denial on the theory that a change of ownership had occurred with respect to the fifteen long term care beds and,because ach had operated those beds as part of a participating nursing facility under the medicare and medicaid programs since,acmc could not be deemed a new provider.
acmc appealed to the district court pursuant to f.both parties filed motions for summary judgment.the district court reversed the board and granted judgment to acmc.after substantial preliminary discussion,the district court attempted to determine whether the term provider as used in the regulation at issue was ambiguous the district court viewed the following as the crucial question by purchasing ach con rights to the fifteen beds,did acmc si
