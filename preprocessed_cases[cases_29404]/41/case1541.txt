this shareholder derivative suit arises from a consent decree between abbott laboratories abbott and the food and drug administration fda.the action was brought in federal court on behalf of abbott shareholders against abbott board of directors alleging that the directors breached their fiduciary duties and are liable under illinois law for harm resulting from a consent decree which required abbott to pay a million civil fine to the fda,withdraw types of medical diagnostic test kits from the united states market,destroy certain inventory,and make a number of corrective changes in its manufacturing procedures after six years of federal violations.the district court dismissed the original complaint for failure to plead demand futility with particularity under.and has now dismissed the amended complaint for the same reason.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
abbott,an illinois corporation,is a diversified health care company that develops and markets pharmaceutical,diagnostic,nutritional,and hospital products.abbott diagnostics division add manufactures hundreds of different kinds of diagnostic kits and devices,including tests which indicate the safety of donated blood,detect heart attacks,and identify cancerous tumors.these products are heavily regulated by the fda and must be manufactured in accordance with the quality system regulations qsr,and the requirements of the current good manufacturing practice cgmp,as defined in.these regulations expressly assign corporate management the responsibility to assure compliance with the cgmp.the fda periodically inspects manufacturing plants to ensure compliance.
during a period from until,the fda conducted thirteen separate inspections of abbott abbott park and north chicago facilities.the inspections,some lasting for two months or longer,were conducted under a program designed not only to ensure that data and information concerning the in vitro diagnostic products are scientifically valid and accurate,but to ensure that the human subjects are protected from undue hazard or risk during the course of the scientific investigations.after each inspection,the fda first sends a form to the manufacturer which notes any deviations under the cgmp,then discusses the findings with the manufacturer representative,and requests a plan for correcting the violations.
in addition to the form and the ensuing after each inspection,the fda sent four formal certified warning letters to abbott.the first was sent by the fda district director to david thompson,president of add,on october,noting that an fda inspection at the north chicago facility from april through may,had found adulterated in vitro diagnostic products not in conformance with the cgmp.the letter stated,failure to correct these deviations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the food and drug administration without further notice.these actions include,but are not limited to seizure,injunction,civil penalties.all of the warning letters and letters contained that statement.a second warning letter from the district director was sent on march,to thompson and copied to duane burnham,chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer ceo of abbott.after an inspection at the abbott park facility,the fda reiterated that certain in vitro diagnostic test kits had failed to comply with the cgmp.a letter from the fda acting director to the manager of add,again copied to burnham,was sent by overnight mail on october,detailing the continuing deficiencies of certain diagnostic test kits.this letter also noted that the fda had reviewed abbott responses to the issued on june,and july,and requested written documentation of any other specific steps you have taken or will be taking to correct these violations and to prevent the recurrence of similar violations in current and future studies.
on january,the wall street journal published an article discussing the fact that the fda had uncovered a wide range of flaws in abbott laboratories procedures used in assembling products,including kits to test for hepatitis and aids.the article also noted that abbott stock had fallen fifty cents to a share.
in july,the fda and abbott entered into a comprehensive voluntary compliance plan to work together to achieve compliance in areas recognized by fda and abbott to be problematic at the abbott park and north chicago facilities.on february,the fda district director sent the equivalent of a warning letter to abbott,stating that although the fda recognize d abbott laboratories efforts to meet all of the compliance plan commitments,after finding continued deviations from the regulations,the fda was closing out the compliance plan.
on march,the fda district director sent the fourth and final certified warning letter to miles white,a member of abbott board of directors and current ceo.this letter discussed the findings of adulterated in vitro diagnostic kits and other problems after an inspection at the abbott park facility from september to november.the letter stated that the fda would be conducting a to determine the adequacy of abbott compliance.
on april,white sold percent of his abbott stock,totaling shares sold at per share,receiving.on june,the march warning letter was reported in bloomberg news,a news service providing national and international financial information.the article stated that abbott was working with the fda to resolve the problems and noted that abbott shares had risen slightly to close at.
on september,abbott issued a press release disclosing that it had been notified by the fda of alleged noncompliance of the cgmp and qsr.the release stated that a lthough abbott believes that it is in substantial compliance with these regulations,the fda disagrees,and noted that if the discussions were not successful,the fda had advised the company that it would file a complaint for injunctive relief which would include the cessation of manufacturing and sale for a period of time of a number of diagnostic products.
on september,bloomberg news reported that shares of abbott laboratories fell percent to after regulators threatened to halt sales of some abbott diagnostic products on concerns about quality controls,stating this was the latest setback in a string of manufacturing problems for abbott dating from and that the fda has given them a swift kick to prod them into fixing things.the article noted that add represented approximately percent,or billion,of abbott total sales in,with an operating profit of million,or percent of the company total profit.although the article quoted a stock analyst as having a buy rating on the stock,the analyst also stated that he did not understand why abbott seems to have dragged their feet fixing the problems.wall street punishes companies that have with the fda.
on september,abbott filed a disclosure form with the securities and exchange commission sec,acknowledging it had received notification by the fda of noncompliance with the qsr at two of its facilities.abbott also reported they disagreed with the findings of noncompliance and would fight any legal suit.on november,the fda filed a complaint for an injunction,detailing its problems with abbott over the prior period.on the same date,both parties signed a consent decree which prohibited abbott from the continued manufacture of certain in vitro diagnostic devices until independent experts and fda inspectors deemed the two facilities in conformity with the cgmp and fda regulations.the decree also stated that abbott would pay a million fine,the largest penalty ever imposed for a civil violation of fda regulations at that time.
in addition,under a proposed master compliance plan,abbott was ordered to destroy under fda supervision certain inventories of specific in vitro diagnostic kits and withdraw those kits from the market until compliance had been achieved.the suspension of these kits would result in a loss of approximately million in annual revenue.in a press release following the consent decree,abbott announced that it would take a million charge against abbott earnings in the third quarter of to cover the fda fine and the loss from the unmarketable test kits.
plaintiffs also maintain that these problems with the fda caused the collapse of abbott acquisition of alza corporation alza,a drug delivery company,in a planned acquisition valued at approximately billion,which plaintiffs assert was in the best interest of abbott.alza shareholders were to exchange one share of alza stock for shares of abbott stock.plaintiffs allege that the directors had a motive to conceal abbott quality problems because disclosure of the continuing pattern of violations over a period would have possibly doomed the buyout or,at the very least,jeopardized the price.on december,abbott announced it was abandoning the acquisition.on december,the wall street journal reported,wall street and industry officials widely viewed the transaction as being in jeopardy in recent weeks because the value to alza shareholders had fallen following a decline in the price of abbott stock after the fda filing and consent decree.
shortly thereafter,several abbott shareholders brought derivative actions which have been consolidated in this case.these plaintiffs seek to hold abbott directors personally liable for the extensive corporate losses which arose from the continuing fda violations.
at the time the litigation was initiated,abbott had thirteen directors.two of those thirteen,miles white,abbott chairman and ceo,and robert parkinson,president and chief operating officer,were inside directors who are both corporate officers and abbott employees.the remaining eleven were outside or independent directors who received a monthly stipend for their services but were not abbott employees.at the time the suit was filed,all of the directors except for four had served on the board throughout the period 
in their claim for breach of fiduciary duty,plaintiffs maintain that the directors were aware of the history of noncompliance problems with the fda and that they had a duty to take necessary action to correct these problems in a division of abbott which accounted for percent of the company annual revenues.they allege that the directors demonstrated gross negligence by ignoring the fda problems for six years.
plaintiffs also maintain that the directors had a duty of due diligence by signing the sec forms,which specifically address in part government regulations in the development,manufacture,sale,and distribution of products.these forms were signed by the directors every year during the period in question.as the illustrates,the directors signed off on statements alluding to the regulatory problems,such as,abbott products are subject to comprehensive government regulation which substantially increases the time,difficulty,and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining the approval to market newly developed and existing products,t he fda approach to regulations will increase the cost of compliance with those regulations,t he company facilities including abbott park and north shore are deemed suitable,t he company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings and management is of the opinion that their disposition should not have a material adverse effect on the company financial position,cash flows,or results of operations.
the plaintiffs allege that the directors met officially seven times in,six times in,eight times in,and ten times in.plaintiffs maintain that the directors received relevant information concerning regulatory actions and that the warning letters,several of which were sent to the chairman of the board,and form were clearly information that was required to be brought to the attention of the board members by the chairman who had a duty to do so.
plaintiffs state that the directors were aware of the problems as several directors were also members of the audit committee,which is charged with communicating regularly with abbott management concerning management assessment of business risks facing abbott,and that one of the functions of the audit committee was to familiarize themselves with any risks involving the legal and regulatory framework which would affect abbott operations.plaintiffs also stated that during the relevant time period,abbott proxy statements noted that the audit committee met with abbott internal auditors to evaluate the effectiveness of their work in ensuring that abbott various departments,including its regulatory affairs department which was responsible for abbott compliance with fda regulations,operated properly.
plaintiffs,however,did not make any demand on abbott board of directors to institute an action against themselves for breach of their fiduciary duties,stating that such a demand would have been futile,due in part to the fact that a majority of the board who would have reviewed the demand were the same directors who had been board members during the period in question.plaintiffs maintain that the facts as alleged in the complaint demonstrate that the directors knew of the continuing pattern of noncompliance with fda regulations and knew that the continued failure to comply with fda regulations would result in severe penalties and yet ignored repeated red flags raised by the fda and in media reports and chose not to bring a prompt halt to the improper conduct causing the noncompliance,nor to reprimand those persons involved,nor to seek redress for abbott for the serious damages it has sustained 
the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to plead demand futility with particularity under,stating that the complaint did not plead facts to show abbott directors faced a substantial likelihood of liability for their actions.plaintiffs filed an amended complaint,which the district court again dismissed.plaintiffs now appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the seventh circuit has held that a uniform approach applies to procedural questions which concern the allocation of responsibility between the trial court and appellate court.see mayer gary partners,cir.state law does not govern the relation between the trial court and the appellate court in a diversity litigation.id.therefore,while the district court was required to apply state substantive law,appellate review is governed by federal law,which is deferential except on questions of law.see gasperini center for the humanities,d starrels first bank of chicago,cir powell gant,d.appellate review of the legal precepts used by the district court and the court interpretation of those precedents is plenary.salve regina college russell,d courts of appeals review the determinations of district courts de novo donovan robbins,cir.
given the district court dismissal of the case on defendants motion,any inferences reasonably drawn from the factual allegations of the complaint must be viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.in re healthcare compare.sec,cir.
demand futility 
because abbott was incorporated under the laws of illinois,illinois law applies in determining whether a demand may be excused when shareholders file a derivative complaint on behalf of the company.see kamen kemper fin,d.illinois case law follows delaware law in establishing demand futility requirements and uses the test to determine demand futility set forth in aronson lewis,overruled on other grounds by brehm eisner,overruling abuse of discretion standard of review on rule motion to dismiss derivative suit.see spillyards abboud,d.both parties correctly agree that delaware law controls.
in a derivative suit,an individual shareholder seeks to enforce a right that belongs to the corporation.see kamen,at.however,given the basic principle of corporate governance that the decisions of a the decision to initiate be made by the board of directors or the majority of shareholders,most jurisdictions require a demand be made of the corporation board of directors.id.at.this allows the directors to exercise their business judgment and determine whether litigation is in the best interest of the corporation.id.
rule requires the plaintiff to allege with particularity the efforts,if any,made by the plaintiff to obtain the action the plaintiff desires from the directors and the reasons for the plaintiff failure to obtain the action or for not making the effort.however,the requirement of a shareholder demand is more than a pleading requirement,it is a substantive right of the shareholder and the directors.see kamen,at.it is the law of the state of incorporation which controls these substantive rights and governs what excuses are adequate for failure to make demand.see id.at.boland engle,cir.
the futility exception establishes the circumstances in which the shareholder is allowed to circumvent the directors authority to manage corporate affairs.see kamen,at.whether a shareholder should be allowed to proceed without making demand is based on the application of the state futility doctrine id.at.as a prerequisite to a derivative action,illinois law requires that a demand be made unless the demand is excused because the request would be futile.comp.stat.b also referred to as b of the business corporation act of see also schnitzer,d,stating that demand rule b is almost identical to.
the shareholder must state with particularity why a demand would have been futile.starrels,at citations omitted.however,it is not sufficient for the shareholder to simply state in conclusory terms that he made no demand because it would have been futile.id.citation omitted.although plaintiffs have a conclusory paragraph in their claim of demand futility,they have also incorporated all of the detailed factual allegations.
after carefully reviewing the plaintiffs complaint,we conclude that the district court erred in determining the interpretation and application of state law.
rales test 
the district court,in interpreting delaware state law,applied the test for demand futility under rales blasband.in rales,the delaware supreme court was asked to determine whether the plaintiffs had alleged facts sufficient to show that demand on a board of directors was excused,accepting the factual allegations of the derivative complaint as true when based on a motion of dismissal.id.at.plaintiffs pleaded that review was based upon the aronson test.id.at.the court noted that its analysis was not limited to the aronson test but required a determination as to whether demand was excused under the substantive law of the state of delaware.id.
the rales court found that the essential predicate for applying the aronson test was that a decision of the board of directors is being challenged in the derivative suit.rales,at citing pogostin rice.the court in rales stated that where the board that would be considering the demand did not make a business decision which is being challenged in the derivative suit,there are three scenarios in which the aronson test would not apply 
where a business decision was made by the board of a company,but a majority of the directors making the decision have been replaced where the subject of the derivative suit is not a business decision of the board and where the decision being challenged was made by the board of a different corporation.
id.at.given the facts in the present case that a majority of the directors during the six years in question remained at the time the demand was made and that the board of a different corporation was not involved,the district court determined that plaintiffs were alleging an omission rather that a conscious decision of the board.in re abbott,d,citing rales,at.however,in arriving at this conclusion,we find the district court failed to fully scrutinize delaware case law and the necessary circumstances for application of the rales test.
the plaintiffs in in re caremark int l.derivative litigation,charged the board of directors with a breach of their duty of attention or care in connection with the operation of corporate business.where there is no conflict of interest or no facts suggesting suspect motivation,it is difficult to charge directors with responsibility for corporate losses for an alleged breach of care.id.in determining the directors alleged breach of the duty of care,the court noted that liability may arise from two possible for decisions made by the directors or liability for the directors failure to monitor the actions of the corporation.
director liability for a breach of the duty to exercise appropriate attention may,in theory,arise in two distinct contexts.first,such liability may be said to follow from a board decision that results in a loss because that decision was ill advised or negligent.second,liability to the corporation for a loss may be said to arise from an unconsidered failure of the board to act in circumstances in which due attention would,arguably,have prevented the loss.
id.at citation omitted emphasis in original.the first setting for liability is subject to review under the business judgment rule,assuming the decision was the product of a process that was either deliberately considered in good faith or was otherwise rational.id.citing aronson,at.
the caremark court labels the second approach as unconsidered failure to act,id.at,the same characterization the district court gave in describing the board inaction in abbott.d at,plaintiffs allege an omission,rather than a conscious board decision discussing defendants inaction.in analyzing a case of unconsidered failure to take action by the directors,the court in caremark followed the reasoning in graham,which addressed the issue of director liability for corporate losses suffered as a result of violations.in re caremark,at.there was no claim in graham that the directors knew about the behavior of employees of the corporation that had resulted in the liability.id.
in re caremark is a case where the corporation was comprised of employees with ninety branch operations,having had a decentralized management structure,and,as a result of government investigations,had begun making attempts to centralize management oversight of the company business practices.id.at.the court compared the defendants in in re caremark to the defendants in graham,stating that the claim asserted in both cases was only that the directors ought to have known of the violations,and that the directors had no duty to ferret out wrongdoing which the directors have no reason to suspect exists,particularly where there were no grounds for suspicion and the directors were blamelessly unaware of the conduct leading to the corporate liability.in re caremark,at quoting graham,at emphasis added.the court noted that the true intent of a review where there is no considered board action is based more upon corporate there is a corporate information gathering and reporting system in existence.see id.at.
as the court in caremark explained,review of directors liability was predicated upon ignorance of liability creating activities,at,where there were no facts to indicate the directors conscientiously permitted a known violation of law by the corporation to occur.id.at.plaintiffs in abbott allege facts that the directors were aware of known violations,providing evidence that there was direct knowledge through the warning letters and as members of the audit committee.under proper corporate governance existence of which is not contested by either party in of the violations would have been shared at the board meetings.in addition,plaintiffs have alleged that,as fiduciaries,the directors all signed the annual sec forms which specifically addressed government regulations of abbott products.the abbott case is clearly distinguished from the unconsidered inaction in in re caremark.
plaintiffs allege that the directors knowingly in an intentional breach reckless disregard of their fiduciary duties chose not to address the fda problems in a timely manner.although brehm eisner,dealt with a shareholder derivative action which was limited to breach of the duty of care,we agree with the court analysis as to the proper application of the rales test.
this is a case about whether there should be personal liability of the directors of a corporation to the corporation for lack of due care in the decisionmaking process and for waste of corporate assets.this case is not about the failure of the directors to establish and carry out ideal corporate governance practices.
at.the facts in abbott do not support the conclusion that the directors were blamelessly unaware of the conduct leading to the corporate liability.in re caremark,at quoting graham,at.
the district court noted,correctly,that the plaintiffs did not allege that abbott reporting system was inadequate.in abbott,the first two warning letters were copied to burnham,chairman of the board.after the voluntary compliance plan was initiated in,the fda sent a letter in closing down the plan due to continued violations.the final warning letter was sent to white,at the time a member of the board.the directors who were members of the audit committee were aware of the violations.the sec disclosure forms acknowledging noncompliance with the qsr imputes knowledge to the directors.and as early as,the fda problems with abbott were public knowledge.all of these alleged facts imply knowledge of violations which had not been corrected.in abbott,reasonable inferences determined from all of the facts taken together are exactly the opposite of caremark members of the board in abbott were aware of the problems.where there is a corporate governance structure in place,we must then assume the corporate governance procedures were followed and that the board knew of the problems and decided no action was required.therefore,we can not agree that the rales test is applicable in this particular factual situation.
aronson test 
to determine whether demand is futile under illinois law,the illinois courts have applied the standard set forth by the delaware supreme court in aronson,at,holding that demand can only be excused where facts are alleged with particularity which create a reasonable doubt that the directors action was entitled to the protections of the business judgment rule.see spillyards,at powell,at see also starrels,at silver allard,d.
the court in aronson stated that the entire question of demand futility is inextricably bound to issues of business judgment and the standards of that doctrine applicability,explaining that the business judgment rule is a presumption that in making a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis,in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.at.plaintiffs have the burden of establishing facts to rebut this presumption.id.
the test in aronson provides that demand futility is established if,accepting the facts as true,the alleged particularized facts raise a reasonable doubt that either the directors are disinterested or independent or the challenged transaction was the product of a valid exercise of the directors business judgment.at starrels,at.
first or independence 
a disinterested director can neither appear on both sides of a transaction nor expect to derive any personal financial benefit from the challenged transaction in the sense of,as opposed to a benefit which devolves upon the corporation or all stockholders generally.aronson,at.plaintiffs have not offered any specific facts to indicate that any of the directors had divided loyalties.there were no allegations of improper motives or conflicts of interest.nor,with the exception of white sale of stock prior to the fda legal action,have plaintiffs presented allegations that any of the other directors profited in any way by their actions,or lack thereof.see in re instr.sec,d,using aronson test in finding eight directors out of thirteen who sold their company stock at inflated price for over million while concealing adverse financial information about company raised reasonable doubt as to directors disinterest.
in addition,plaintiffs have not pleaded sufficient facts to raise reasonable doubt as to the directors independence.independence exists when a director decision is based on the corporate merits of the subject before the board rather than extraneous considerations or influences.aronson,at.although plaintiffs have raised the allegation that perhaps one of the reasons behind the board refusal to act was to conceal the extent of abbott problems while a buyout of alza was pending,there are no specific allegations indicating that individual directors were influenced by outside sources or considerations in making decisions,or that burnham or white dominated or controlled the board.see id.at.
we find the plaintiffs have not pleaded specific allegations to create a reasonable doubt as to the majority of the directors disinterestedness or independence.
second judgment 
the business judgment rule is a presumption that in making a business decision,the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis,in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.aronson,at citations omitted.to determine whether the complaint raises a reasonable doubt that the directors exercised proper business judgment,the second prong of the aronson test requires us to look at both the substantive due care substance of the transaction as well as the procedural due care an informed decision used by the directors.starrels,at citing grobow perot,overruled on other grounds by brehm,at.
under aronson,the mere threat of personal liability for approving a questioned transaction,standing alone,is insufficient to challenge either the independence or disinterestedness of directors at.however,demand may be excused if in rare cases a transaction may be so egregious on its face that board approval can not meet the test of business judgment,resulting in a substantial likelihood of director liability,or if the directors exhibited gross negligence in breaching their duty of care.brehm,at citing aronson,at.
delaware law imposes three primary fiduciary duties on the directors of corporations the duty of care,the duty of loyalty,and the duty of good faith.emerald partners berlin,citing malone brincat.the shareholders of the corporation are entitled to rely upon their board of directors to discharge each of their three primary fiduciary duties at all times.id.
the chairman of the board received copies of the two warning letters in and another in early.although the district court described the language in the warning letters as boilerplate and stated that the plaintiffs ascribe much greater importance to the warning letters than they probably deserve,in re abbott,d at,continuing violations of federal regulations over a period of six years can not be minimized.several of the directors were members of the audit committee,which was charged with assessing any risks involved in regulatory compliance.in addition,the directors had a fiduciary duty under the sec to comply with comprehensive government regulations and signed sec forms attesting to knowledge and responsibility for government regulation compliance,noting that the company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings regarding these regulations,as stated in the.
the fda met at least ten times with abbott representatives,including white and other senior officers,concerning the continuing violations.the wall street journal published information about abbott fda problems in.by,even a analyst questioned why abbott continued to drag their feet fixing the fda problems.although abbott sought to negate the effects of this news in its press release of,the release itself substantiates the fact that the company,and,correspondingly,the board of directors,knew of the problems and were aware that the fda had threatened to file an injunction against abbott.
delaware law states that director liability may arise for the breach of the duty to exercise appropriate attention to potentially illegal corporate activities from an unconsidered failure of the board to act in circumstances in which due attention would,arguably,have prevented the loss.in re caremark,at citation omitted emphasis in original.the court held that a sustained or systematic failure of the board to exercise oversight will establish the lack of good faith that is a necessary condition to director liability.id.at.in caremark,there was a claim of fraud with no evidence to indicate that the caremark directors knew of the violations of law and the directors liability was predicated upon ignorance of activities which resulted in unconsidered failure to act.see id.given the extensive paper trail in abbott concerning the
