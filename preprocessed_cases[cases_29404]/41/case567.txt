opinion of the court 
this appeal by robert sommer,a former employee of the vanguard group,presents a question of first impression regarding the construction of the family and medical leave act fmla,and the corresponding department of labor dol regulations.we must decide whether vanguard illegally interfered with sommer fmla rights when,upon his return from approximately eight weeks of disability fmla leave,it did not award him a full annual bonus payment under its partnership plan,but instead awarded him a payment prorated on the basis of the time he was absent.central to this question is a determination of what the bonus program rewards employee production or the absence of an occurrence.if it rewards employee production,then proration for fmla absences is generally allowed if it rewards the absence of an occurrence like a safety or perfect attendance bonus,then proration is not allowed.
in a summary judgment dated august,the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania determined that the vanguard partnership plan is a production bonus and that the company had not unlawfully interfered with sommer fmla rights by prorating his bonus.we agree and will affirm 
congress enacted the fmla in to accommodate the important societal interest in assisting families,by establishing a minimum labor standard for leave.churchill star,cir quoting.at,at.congress stated purposes for the act are to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families,to promote the stability and economic security of families,and to promote national interests in preserving family integrity and to entitle employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons,for the birth or adoption of a child,and for the care of a child,spouse or parent who has a serious health condition b.to accomplish these goals,the fmla grants an eligible employee the right to of leave over any period because of,among other things,a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee position.a.after a period of qualified leave,an employee is entitled to reinstatement to his former position or an equivalent one with equivalent employment benefits,pay and other terms and conditions of employment.a.moreover,the taking of fmla leave,shall not result in the loss of any employment benefit accrued prior to the date on which leave commenced.a.this right is limited,however,by the proviso that the restored employee shall not be entitled to the accrual of any seniority or employment benefits during any period of leave,or any right,benefit,or position of employment other than any right,benefit,or position to which the employee would have been entitled had the employee not taken the leave.a a,b.
to protect these rights,the fmla declares it unlawful for any employer to interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise,any right provided in the fmla.a.such a claim is typically referred to as an interference claim,and is acknowledged to set floors for employer conduct.callison city of philadelphia,cir.to deter such interference,congress has provided that an employer may be found liable for civil damages that include compensatory damages for any wages,salary,employment benefits or other compensation lost by reason of the violation and liquidated damages.a a.
to assert an interference claim,the employee only needs to show that he was entitled to benefits under the fmla and that he was denied them.callison,at citing a,a.under this theory,the employee need not show that he was treated differently than others,and the employer can not justify its actions by establishing a legitimate business purpose for its decision.id.at.an interference action is not about discrimination,it is only about whether the employer provided the employee with the entitlements guaranteed by the fmla.id.at.because the fmla is not about discrimination,a analysis is not required.see parker hanhemann,d,citing hodgens gen l dynamics,cir.
addressing unlawful fmla interference,the dol has stated that it includes not only refusing to authorize fmla leave,but discouraging an employee from using such leave.b as for company bonus,more specifically,the distinction between absence of occurrence bonuses,safety and perfect attendance bonuses and production dol has explained 
many employers pay bonuses in different forms to employees for performance such as for perfect attendance,safety absence of injuries or accidents on the job and exceeding production goals.bonuses for perfect attendance and safety do not require performance by the employee but rather contemplate the absence of occurrences.to the extent an employee who takes fmla leave had met all the requirements for either or both of these bonuses before fmla leave began,the employee is entitled to continue this entitlement upon return from fmla leave,that is,the employee may not be disqualified for the bonus es for the taking of fmla leave.see b and c.a monthly production bonus,on the other hand does require performance by the employee.if the employee is on fmla leave during any part of the period for which the bonus is computed,the employee is entitled to the same consideration for the bonus as other employees on paid or unpaid leave as appropriate.see paragraph d of this section.
c.the referenced subsection d provides that a n employee may,but is not entitled to,accrue any additional benefits or seniority during unpaid fmla leave.d.
although the regulations do not speak specifically to the proration of bonuses,the dol has issued several opinion letters detailing how companies should compute the bonuses of those employees who take fmla leave 
if a bonus is calculated based on hours worked or yearly or monthly earnings,the fmla leave taker would naturally receive a lesser amount.conversely,any methodology for calculating bonuses that are not based on worktime or accrued earnings can not be reduced at all for fmla leave takers who qualified for the bonus before they started fmla leave and return to work and continue an otherwise perfect record for the remainder of the bonus period.
dol opinion letter.the dol revisited this question several years later,again stating 
under the fmla,while an employee is not automatically entitled to accrue seniority or benefits during unpaid fmla leave,an employer can not use unpaid fmla leave as a negative factor in employment actions.for example,in the case of a monthly perfect attendance bonus that tracks absences rather than performance,an employee who had not missed any time before taking unpaid fmla leave would continue to be eligible for the bonus upon returning from fmla leave.where the amount of the bonus is calculated from hours worked,however the fmla leave taker would naturally receive a lesser amount than an employee who had not been on leave.
dol opinion letter see also id.s ince bonuses may be based upon hours worked,it would not be a violation under fmla to determine the bonus percentage based only upon the actual hours of work during the monthly rating period.
the precept that we derive from the regulations and dol opinion letters is that although an employer may not reduce an absence of occurrence bonus paid to an fmla leave taker if the employee was otherwise qualified the taking of the fmla leave,that employer may prorate any production bonuses to be paid to an fmla leave taker by the amount of any lost production be it hours or another quantifiable measure of productivity caused by the fmla leave.this rule is an appropriate application of the admonition found at a that,while on fmla leave,an employee is not entitled to the accrual of any right of employment,but is entitled to those rights of employment to which the employee would have been entitled had the employee not taken the leave.
having set forth the relevant statutory and regulatory framework,we now turn to the facts of this case.while employed at vanguard as a financial administrator sommer was on disability leave under the fmla from december,to february,approximately eight weeks.he returned to work on february,having used sick days to cover his absences on february.in his certification of health care provider form,submitted in support of his fmla leave request,he stated that he was absent due to major depression and generalized anxiety,which required hospitalization at hospital php app.at.because of this absence,vanguard prorated the bonus payments received by sommer under both its partnership plan and bonus program reducing his december bonus program payout by and his june,partnership plan payout by.both bonus payments were for calendar year.
the vanguard bonus program is not at issue in this appeal,see infra,section iv,so we will focus exclusively upon the partnership plan.vanguard created the partnership plan in to recognize crew members contributions to vanguard growth and success in a tangible way,and to allow employees to share in vanguard growth and financial success.vanguard partnership plan policy hereinafter policy,app.at.the amount that the company will distribute annually under the plan depends upon vanguard operating performance,its competitors operating performance,the performance of the securities markets,the investment performance of the vanguard funds and company earnings.id.at articles of the vanguard group.partnership plan hereinafter articles,app.at.company earnings,for purposes of the partnership plan,are calculated by the company compensation committee.articles,app.at.
qualification for the bonus is based on three requirements the recipient must be employed on the last calendar day of the year,on the date of the plan distribution,and all days in between.policy,app.at.the amount a qualifying employee will receive under the plan depends upon three criteria job level,length of service to the company,and hours worked.id.at.hours worked,or hours of service as it is referred to in the partnership plan articles,is defined as 
t he actual hours for which an employee is paid or entitled to be paid by the company for the performance of duties or for vacation,holidays,sick time,or an approved leave of absence including bereavement leave,court duty leave,and military leave.any employee who is on a disability leave of absence under the company or disability program shall not be credited with hours of service during such leave of absence.
articles,app.at.
if an employee does not meet the annual goal for hours worked,hours,his or her partnership plan payment is prorated by the amount of hours that he or she is deficient.partnership and leaves of absence q a hereinafter q a,app.at.vanguard explains its proration policy as follows 
how is my partnership payment impacted by a leave of absence 
the partnership payment is based on hours worked during the plan year.time spent on leave is not considered time worked for purposes of calculating your partnership payment.the basic proration is based on the following formula number of hours worked divided by hours proration percentage 
how many days can i be on leave before my partnership is prorated 
the partnership payment is always prorated for the leave time no matter how short the amount of time the employee is on leave,from a few hours to a few months.however,vacation and sick time,typically used during the elimination period,are considered time worked for purposes of calculating the partnership payment.
id.at emphasis in original.as indicated,vacation and sick leave are considered hours worked under the partnership plan most other forms of leave are treated differently.vanguard prorates the bonus amount of a qualifying employee if that employee retired from vanguard or was on disability std,disability ltd,workers compensation,or family and medical leave fmla in the plan year,or is on one of these leaves at distribution time.policy,app.at emphasis added.those who take personal leave and unpaid court leave also have their bonuses prorated.id.at.
on june,sommer filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania that alleged that vanguard interfered with his rights under the fmla,in violation of a,by prorating his partnership plan and bonus program payments for the time he spent on fmla leave.he sought compensatory damages for his lost income and benefits,liquidated damages,costs and attorney fees.on october,sommer amended his complaint and added two claims that vanguard proration policy interfered with the fmla rights held by all employees,and that in violation of a,vanguard illegally retaliated against sommer for his objection to vanguard proration policy by ceasing the medical benefits that he had been receiving after the date of his termination.
on november,sommer filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint adding class allegations,which the court denied without prejudice in an order filed december.it held that before it would address the propriety of bringing this suit as a class action,as distinguished from a collective action,it would first address the underlying fmla legal issue.sommer and vanguard consequently filed for summary judgment on the issue of fmla liability on february,and march,respectively.on august,the district court entered an order denying sommer motion,granting vanguard,and entering judgment in favor of vanguard.sommer vanguard group,d.the court held that vanguard proration of sommer partnership plan bonus did not interfere with his fmla rights because the partnership plan is a production bonus,for which proration is allowed,sommer fmla claim regarding the legality of vanguard proration of his bonus program payment was barred by the fmla statute of limitations,and his retaliation claim failed because sommer failed to show any causal connection between the termination of his medical benefits and his fmla challenges.
sommer now appeals the district court ruling that vanguard proration of his partnership plan payments does not interfere with his fmla rights.he also appeals the court denial of his motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.he does not appeal the court denial of his bonus program fmla claim or his retaliation claim.

although the fmla has been in effect for over ten years,this is the first case in which an appellate court has been required to distinguish between the two classifications of company bonus programs for purposes of an fmla interference action.sommer contends that the district court erred in rejecting his argument that vanguard policy of mandatorily prorating the partnership plan bonus payments of those employees who take fmla leave unlawfully interferes with those employees fmla rights.specifically,he contends that the district court incorrectly classified the partnership plan as a bonus program that rewards employees for production under which proration for time spent on fmla leave is allowed and not for the absence of an occurrence under which proration is not allowed.he argues that partnership plan eligibility is only contingent upon the employee remaining employed during the period in which the bonus is calculated,which means that the bonus program rewards the absence of an occurrence,not leaving or getting fired.for support,he analogizes this bonus program to the stay bonus considered in dierlam wesley jessen,d.there,the district court determined that a company stay bonus was an absence of an occurrence bonus because it was rewarding continued employment during a pe
