the medicaid program,created in when congress added title xix to the social security act,provides federal financial assistance to states that choose to reimburse certain costs of medical treatment for the poor,elderly,and disabled.see et.supp harris mcrae,d.although participation in the program is voluntary,participating states must comply with certain requirements imposed by the act and regulations promulgated by the secretary of health and human services.wilder.hosp.ass n,d.at issue here is the requirement that participating states provide early and periodic screening,diagnostic,and treatment services for individuals who are eligible under the plan and are under the age of.a b see also r defining such services.the required services include periodic physical examinations,immunizations,laboratory tests,health education,see r,eye examinations,eyeglasses,see r,teeth maintenance,see r,diagnosis and treatment of hearing disorders,and hearing aids,see r.

ii.discussion 
as a preliminary matter,we must consider whether our determination in westside mothers i that p laintiffs have a cause of action under for alleged noncompliance with the screening and treatment provisions of the medicaid act,westside mothers i,at,was binding on the district court under the law of the case doctrine.on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the district court reconsideration of whether the screening and treatment provisions of the medicaid act create enforceable rights under was barred by the law of the case doctrine,and the district court therefore had no power or authority to deviate from our earlier decision in this case.
the law of the case doctrine provides that when a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.scott churchill,cir quoting arizona california,d.the doctrine precludes a court from reconsideration of issues decided at an early stage of the litigation,either explicitly or by necessary inference from the disposition.hanover ins.am.eng g,cir quoting coal,gulf western,cir.pursuant to the law of the case doctrine,and the complementary mandate rule,upon remand the trial court is bound to proceed in accordance with the mandate and law of the case as established by the appellate court.id.quoting petition of steel,cir,cert.denied,d.the trial court is required to implement both the letter and the spirit of the appellate court mandate,taking into account the appellate court opinion and the circumstances it embraces.brunet city of columbus,cir.
the law of the case doctrine precludes reconsideration of a previously decided issue unless one of three exceptional circumstances exists where substantially different evidence is raised on subsequent trial where a subsequent contrary view of the law is decided by the controlling authority or where a decision is clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.hanover ins,at.none of these exceptional circumstances are present which would permit the district court to reconsider whether the provisions in question create enforceable rights under.
however,the district court reasoned that the law of the case doctrine did not preclude it from reconsidering whether specific provisions of the medicaid act create enforceable rights under because our earlier decision in westside mothers i did not decide this issue as to each specific statutory provision identified in the amended complaint.in support of the district court decision,defendants contend that our failure to explicitly decide whether a,a,a,a confer enforceable rights left the matter open for review by the district court.as the district court recognized,the law of the case doctrine is limited to those issues decided in the earlier appeal,and the district court may therefore consider those issues not decided expressly or impliedly by the appellate court.see hanover ins,at.thus,we must determine whether we expressly or impliedly decided in plaintiffs first appeal whether a,a,a,a create rights enforceable under.
in westside mothers i,we identified a specific issue,whether there is a private right of action under.at.we held that the district court erred in failing to consider this issue within the framework established by the supreme court in blessing.id.at.applying the blessing test,we then concluded that p laintiffs have a cause of action under for alleged noncompliance with the screening and treatment provisions of the medicaid act.id.in reaching this conclusion,we determined that the provisions were clearly intended to benefit the putative plaintiffs,impose a binding obligation on michigan,and are not so vague and amorphous as to defeat judicial enforcement.id.
because the holding refers generally to the screening and treatment provisions,the opinion in westside mothers i creates considerable ambiguity as to whether the prior panel applied the blessing test to each of the statutory provisions identified in the plaintiffs amended complaint.there is therefore no assurance that the panel considered whether the specified provisions of the medicaid act confer enforceable rights under before holding that the plaintiffs have a cause of action under.where there is substantial doubt as to whether a prior panel actually decided an issue,the district court should not be foreclosed from considering the issue on remand.see united artists theatre circuit,township of warrington,cir.accordingly,we conclude that the law of the case doctrine does not apply and that our earlier decision in this case did not foreclose the district court consideration of whether plaintiffs have a right of action under to enforce violations of a,a,a,a.
the district court ruled that plaintiffs failed to state a claim for violations of a,a to the extent that they alleged failure by defendants in their official capacity to ensure the actual provision of,or arrangement for,medical services.at.in so ruling,the district court concluded that a,a require the state to pay some or all of the costs of certain medical services available to eligible individuals,but do not require the state to provide the services directly.at.before the district court and in their briefs before this court,plaintiffs argued that a,a mandate the actual provision of,or arrangement for,certain medical services,including care,medicine,and equipment.thus,the issue presented by this claim is whether the individual rights to medical assistance created by these provisions imposes an obligation on the state to provide services directly.
there appears to be some disagreement among the courts of appeals as to whether,pursuant to the medicaid act,a state must merely provide financial assistance to eligible individuals to enable them to obtain covered services,or provide the services directly.see sabree richman,cir bruggeman blagojevich,cir t he statutory reference to assistance appears to have reference to financial assistance rather than to actual medical services,though the distinction was missed in bryson shumway,cir,and doe chiles,cir.however,the medicaid act explicitly defines the term medical assistance as used in a,a.medical assistance means payment of part or all of the cost of the enumerated services to eligible individuals who are under the age of.a see schott olszewski,cir the act defines medical assistance as payment of part or all of the cost of the covered care and services for individuals.
plaintiffs nevertheless contend that the language of a,a expands the definition of medical assistance beyond simply payment for services to include actual provision of services.after examining the text and the structure of the statute,we do not believe a,a require the state to provide medical services directly.the most reasonable interpretation of a is that all eligible individuals should have the opportunity to apply for medical assistance,financial assistance,and that such medical assistance,financial assistance,shall be provided to the individual with reasonable promptness.the most reasonable interpretation of a is that medical assistance,financial assistance,must be provided for at least the care and services listed in paragraphs through,and of a.see clark richman,d.the regulations that implement these provisions also indicate that what is required is a prompt determination of eligibility and a prompt payment to eligible individuals to enable them to obtain the necessary medical services.see.
at oral argument,plaintiffs asserted that the payments were insufficient to enlist an adequate number of providers,which effectively frustrates a,a by foreclosing the opportunity for eligible individuals to receive the covered medical services.they now argue,for example,that they want to show that such payments are so inadequate in the upper peninsula of michigan that there are no available providers.see health care for all,romney,wl,at.july,setting reimbursement levels so low that private dentists can not afford to treat medicaid enrollees effectively frustrates a by foreclosing the opportunity for enrollees to receive medical assistance at all,much less in a timely manner.chapter of am.acad.of pediatrics fogarty,d,finding a violation of a and reasoning that w ithout financial assistance provider reimbursement sufficient to attract an adequate number of providers,reasonably prompt assistance is effectively denied sobky smoley.holding defendants liable for failure to comply with a where insufficient funding has caused providers of methadone maintenance to place eligible individuals on waiting lists for treatment.plaintiffs did not raise this argument in the amended complaint,before the district court,or in their briefs before this court.because this appeal is from a dismissal for failure to state a claim,we are concerned with the sufficiency of the complaint,which does not contain this allegation.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of the claim for violations of a,a.however,because plaintiffs may be able to amend the complaint to allege that inadequate payments effectively deny the right to medical assistance
