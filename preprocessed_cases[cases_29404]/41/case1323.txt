tricia mason committed suicide on march,two days after she started taking paxil,a popular antidepressant.her parents sued the manufacturer of the drug,the smithkline beecham corporation,claiming it was negligent among other things for not warning that taking paxil increases the risk of suicide,especially among young adults.the district court granted summary judgment for the company in.the court concluded that the masons claims were preempted under federal law because the warnings they say should have been included about paxil conflicted with the warning labeling for the drug.
one year after the district court granted the defendant motion for summary judgment,the supreme court decided wyeth levine,a case that represents a sea change in the way courts are to consider issues of federal preemption.keeping the changed landscape in mind,we today consider the masons appeal in light of levine.
before going further,however,we note that the district court,on the opening page of its opinion granting summary judgment,said 
the court notes that the portions of the briefs addressing statements of undisputed and disputed fact that have been submitted by both plaintiffs and defendant are so replete with argumentative posturing that they are essentially useless both in determining the basic factual information underlying this case,as well as in resolving the pending motions.the inclusion of and pages of introduction that is reminiscent of closing argument is also wholly inappropriate.counsel should consider themselves on notice that future filings of this nature will be immediately stricken by the court.
any improvement in the tone and substance of the briefs on appeal is slight at best.they are still,as the district court observed,replete with argumentative posturing.that unfortunate.at this point in the proceeding,all that really needs to be said is that tricia mason committed suicide two days after taking paxil.the briefs,however,go far beyond this statement.the plaintiffs paint a rather bright picture of tricia.the defendant picture is much darker.
the masons tell us this about their daughter 
throughout her life,tricia mason was an excellent student,she was close with her family and enjoyed dancing.she was the salutatorian of her high school graduating class,excelled in science and aspired to become a pediatrician.she was pursuing a masters degree at illinois state university.
on february,tricia went to a medical clinic complaining of a sore throat.during her consultation with the nurse practitioner,she informed the nurse that she was also having difficulty getting up in the morning,she was eating less and believed she might be suffering from seasonal affective disorder.the nurse practitioner diagnosed tricia with depression and gave her some samples of paxil.on march,two days after starting paxil,tricia committed suicide by ingesting cyanide.
here how the defendant paints the picture 
tricia mason had a family history marked by depression and suicide attempts.mason herself struggled with depression long before her suicide in march.in,mason began experiencing depression during the winter months.
as time progressed,mason depression worsened.after a new year eve party,dones mason boyfriend again told mason the relationship had no future.upon hearing that,mason told dones she had prepared a mix of lethal chemicals and intended to kill herself.dones made mason promise she would not commit suicide.
mason depression continued throughout february.around valentine day,mason told jason pemberton,another boyfriend,she intended to kill herself.
on february,mason visited her nurse practitioner complaining of cold symptoms.mason took the opportunity to discuss her depression and expressed interest in seeing a counselor.contrary to the suicide threats she had recently expressed,mason denied she had been having suicidal thoughts.the nurse provided mason with samples and a prescription for paxil.
two days later,on march,mason corresponded with dones by instant messaging.dones told mason her behavior over the past few months made it impossible to continue their relationship.mason told dones,farewell,my love.she then signed off her computer.
hours later,tricia mason committed suicide by ingesting cyanide.she was years old.
if this case ever gets to a jury,it will consider all the facts and circumstances surrounding tricia life and suicide.we need not concern ourselves with how she should be viewed.in addition,a jury might well conclude that she committed suicide without any help from paxil.these are not our concerns.our issue is a legal one,and so we soldier on,mindful,however,that the parties have been extremely partisan in the way they have presented the case to us.
the central issue of this case is federal preemption,which occurs when a state law is invalidated because it conflicts with a federal law.the constitutional basis for federal preemption is found in the supremacy clause article vi,clause of the constitution,which states,t he laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land.preemption comes in three forms.first,and the easiest to apply,is express preemption which occurs when congress clearly declares its intention to preempt state law.second,we have implied preemption which occurs when the structure and purpose of federal law shows congress intent to preempt state law.finally,we come to conflict preemption which occurs when there is an actual conflict between state and federal law such that it is impossible for a person to obey both.see english,d.conflict preemption is the type of preemption at issue in this case.
interestingly enough,the idea of conflict preemption in prescription drug cases is relatively new.until the early,prescription drug companies infrequently invoked the preemption defense,and when they did,it rarely succeeded.see,tobin astra pharm,cir,cert.denied,hill searle,cir.this changed in when district courts were inundated with preemption motions in prescription drug cases.in a number of these cases,the fda filed amicus briefs in support of the pharmaceutical industry.in,the fda also released statements and revised its regulations in an attempt to bolster the drug manufacturers preemption defense.not surprisingly,courts began to issue contradicting opinions,which led the supreme court to grant certiorari in levine to decide the issue.
in levine,the supreme court restored the preemption landscape to its form.the plaintiff in levine was severely injured she developed gangrene and her forearm had to be amputated when a physician assistant injected her artery with the antinausea drug phenergan by using the method of injection.she sued wyeth,the manufacturer of phenergan,for failing to provide an adequate warning about the different risks involved with the various methods of administering the drug.a jury concluded that wyeth had indeed failed to provide an adequate warning about the significant risks involved when phenergan is administered by using the method.
on appeal,wyeth argued that the plaintiff state law claims were preempted because it was impossible for the manufacturer to comply with both state law duties and federal labeling obligations.it also argued that the state law suits would undermine congress intent to trust labeling decisions to the expertise of the fda.the supreme court rejected both contentions and held that there was no preemption in either instance.in fact,the court noted that state law claims are an important complement to the fda herculean task of regulating the safety and effectiveness of all prescription drugs.although the court found that preemption did not exist in levine,it held that there could be preemption if the manufacturer met the stringent standard of proving that there was clear evidence the fda would have rejected the proposed change in the drug label.the supreme court,however,did not clarify what constitutes clear evidence.therefore,the only thing we know for sure is that the evidence presented in levine did not meet this exacting standard 
the journey to deciphering the clear evidence standard begins with understanding how drug manufacturers receive approval to market new prescription drug
