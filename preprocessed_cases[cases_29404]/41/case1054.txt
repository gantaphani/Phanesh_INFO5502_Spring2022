sherman greene petitions for review of an order of the benefits review board board affirming the administrative law judge denial of his claim under the black lung benefits act the act,et.greene challenges the board determination that substantial evidence supported the alj finding that greene failed to establish the existence of pneumoconiosis.
greene was born in.he worked as a coal miner off and on between and and again between and.his last employer was the respondent,king james coal company,for whom he worked a total of one and a half to two years,ending in.the alj found that greene had established a total of eleven years of coal mine employment.the alj also found that greene had a long history of cigarette smoking,attributing to him a total of.green does not challenge either of these factual findings on appeal.
greene filed his first claim for benefits on july.that claim was denied after greene failed to establish any of the medical elements of entitlement.he filed the instant claim on july.four physicians submitted medical opinions in connection with his claim tammy brown glen baker byron westerfield and bruce broudy.
brown was greene treating physician.she diagnosed greene with black lung disease based upon symptoms of shortness of breath,cough,wheezing,and recurrent bouts of acute bronchitis.in her report,brown stated that greene chest and pulmonary function tests were diagnostic of emphysema which,based upon his history,was related to silicosis.brown diagnosed greene with chronic pulmonary disease related to what she believed was his eighteen years of employment in the coal mines.this diagnosis was based upon a chest that revealed emphysematous lungs,as well as greene supposed history of exposure to coal dust.
baker,the department of labor dol examining physician chosen by greene,examined greene on october.he noted that greene had been smoking a of cigarettes per day for years,and accepted greene representation of sixteen years of coal mine employment.baker diagnosed greene with coal workers pneumoconiosis based upon an abnormal chest and coal dust exposure.in addition,baker diagnosed copd,hypoxemia,chronic bronchitis,and chest pain.baker attributed the pneumoconiosis solely to coal mine dust exposure,but explained that the copd,hypoxemia,and chronic bronchitis were produced by a combination of coal mine dust exposure and cigarette smoking.responding to the alj request for clarification,baker provided a supplemental report,dated august,in which he confirmed his prior findings on the bases stated in his initial report,as well as the presence of changes consistent with pneumoconiosis and a history of occupational exposure of at least ten years which,according to baker,was usually felt to be presumptive evidence in the absence of other causes that the changes are due to coal mine employment and coal dust exposure.the supplemental report also noted the copd,chronic bronchitis,and arterial hypoxemia diagnoses,which baker felt could be contributed to,to some extent,by greene coal dust exposure.although the supplement was intended to clarify baker earlier report,it included the following equivocal and rather confusing passage 
if he only had years of coal dust exposure and smoked years,the coal dust exposure would be minimal,and perhaps,not a significant contribution to his conditions.if he indeed had years,then it would probably be significant and therefore be a cause of the miner condition.he does have a mild impairment.it is related primary sic to the obstructive airway disease and chronic bronchitis,as well as his resting arterial hypoxemia.these in turn can be related to pneumoconiosis as his coal dust exposure may have contributed to some extent in the causation of these problems.
westerfield,a pulmonologist and examined greene on november.he noted that greene had a smoking history,which he described as truly dangerous.he took a chest and interpreted it as negative for pneumoconiosis.westerfield noted moderate obstructive pulmonary impairment,which he found was inconsistent with pneumoconiosis.instead,he attributed the impairment to cigarette smoking.in formulating his opinion,westerfield assumed a underground coal mining history.he did,however,discount greene coal mine employment as a cause of the pulmonary impairment because that employment ended in,and the respiratory symptoms had appeared only in recent years westerfield ultimately concluded that greene had no medical condition that was caused,contributed to or aggravated by his exposure.
westerfield,a pulmonologist and greene medical records and the reports of the other examining physicians.in his report,broudy opined that,with only a single positive interpretation,the medical evidence did not support a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis.broudy also found that greene did not have any pulmonary disease that was caused,contributed to,or aggravated by coal dust exposure.rather,he attributed greene pulmonary disease and dysfunction to chronic bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema caused by cigarette smoking.in addition,greene had typical chronic obstructive airways disease,also due to smoking.
on august,the district director issued a proposed decision denying benefits because greene failed to demonstrate a change in any of the applicable conditions of entitlement since the denial of his initial claim and the evidence did not show that greene had pneumoconiosis.greene requested a hearing,but the alj remanded because baker initial report failed to credibly address all the conditions of entitlement.after baker provided the supplemental report discussed above dated august,a hearing was held before the alj on february.
the alj issued a decision and order denying benefits,finding that while greene had established a change in one of the conditions of entitlement total disability,the evidence failed to establish the existence of pneumoconiosis.specifically,the alj found that the evidence,which was conflicting,did not support a finding of coal worker pneumoconiosis.greene never appealed that finding,and we do not revisit it here.discounting the opinions of baker and brown,the alj also determined that the medical opinion evidence was insufficient to establish either clinical or legal pneumoconiosis.as to clinical pneumoconiosis,the alj concluded that baker and brown failed to support or explain their diagnoses in light of the credible negative evidence.with regard to legal pneumoconiosis,the alj found brown opinion conclusory,and discounted it for failing to address the possible effect of greene heavy smoking history.likewise,the alj found that baker underestimated greene smoking history and overestimated the duration of his coal mine employment.the alj also refused to credit the opinions of westerfield and broudy,finding that they relied upon questionable generalizations regarding the comparative effects of cigarette smoking and coal dust exposure.because greene bore the burden of proof,the inadequate analysis in the negative opinions did nothing to advance his claim.
greene appealed the alj decision to the board,arguing that the alj erred by failing to credit the medical opinions of baker and brown.greene appeal to the board also attacked the alj purported reliance upon the opinions of westerfield and broudy.king james coal.a majority of the board affirmed,concluding that the alj opinion was supported by substantial evidence.the board declined a remand,which the director had requested,finding that baker had provided greene with a complete pulmonary evaluation,thus fulfilling the dol obligation.two judges dissented from this portion of the ruling,maintaining that remand was the proper remedy due to defects in the reasoning underlying baker report.
greene now appeals the board decision to this court,raising the following issues whether the alj decision to reject the medical opinions of baker and brown was supported by substantial evidence and whether the alj decision to credit the medical opinions of westerfield and broudy was erroneous because those opinions are hostile to the act.in the alternative,greene argues that if the alj properly rejected baker opinion as unreasoned,then the board erred by refusing to remand the case so that greene can receive a complete pulmonary evaluation within the meaning of a.
the court reviews the board legal conclusions de novo.paducah marine ways thompson,cir.while we must affirm the board decision if the board has not committed any legal error or exceeded its statutory scope of review of the alj factual determinations,our review on appeal is focused on whether the the substantial evidence upon which to base his decision.jonida trucking,hunt,cir.the alj findings are conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence and accord with the applicable law.consol.coal kirk,cir.substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.kolesar youghiogheny ohio coal,cir quoting richardson perales,d.i n referring to a singular reasonable mind,the supreme court has directed us to uphold decisions that rest within the realm of rationality a reviewing court has no license to set aside an inference merely because it finds the opposite conclusion more reasonable or because it questions the factual basis.piney mountain coal mays,cir quoting smith director,owcp,cir and discussing richardson,at.
where the substantial evidence requirement is satisfied,the court may not set aside the alj findings,even if the court would have taken a different view of the evidence were we the trier of facts.ramey kentland elkhorn coal,cir.in deciding whether the substantial evidence standard is satisfied,we consider whether the alj adequately explained the reasons for crediting certain testimony and documentary evidence over other testimony and documentary evidence.peabody coal hill,cir.a remand or reversal is only appropriate when the alj fails to consider all of the evidence under the proper legal standard or there is insufficient evidence to support the alj finding.mccain director,owcp,cir citing cornett benham coal,cir and director,owcp rowe,cir.
to establish entitlement to benefits,the claimant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he has pneumoconiosis his pneumoconiosis arose at least in part out of his coal mine employment he is totally disabled and the total disability is due to pneumoconiosis disability causation.see adams director,owcp,cir.the regulations provide four methods of establishing the existence of pneumoconiosis by chest by autopsy or biopsy evidence by certain presumptions described in or by reasoned medical opinion.only the fourth method is at issue in this appeal.
pneumoconiosis is defined as a chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae,including respiratory and pulmonary impairments,arising out of coal mine employment.b.it includes both clinical pneumoconiosis and legal pneumoconiosis.a.the regulations define clinical or medical pneumoconiosis as those diseases recognized by the medical community as pneumoconiosis,the conditions characterized by permanent deposition of substantial amounts of particulate matter in the lungs and the fibrotic reaction of the lung tissue to that deposition caused by dust exposure in coal mine employment.a.such conditions include,but are not limited to,coal workers pneumoconiosis,anthracosilicosis,anthracosis,anthrosilicosis,massive pulmonary fibrosis,silicosis or silicotuberculosis,arising out of coal mine employment.id.legal or statutory pneuomoconiosis is a broader term.cornett benham coal,cir.it describes any chronic lung disease or impairment and its sequelae arising out of coal mine employment,including any chronic restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease arising out of coal mine employment.a.
pneumoconiosis 
greene sought to establish pneumoconiosis by way of evidence and reasoned medical opinion.
the alj found that the evidence did not establish pneumoconiosis and greene has not appealed that conclusion.
in assessing the medical evidence,the alj considered the opinions of baker,brown,westerfield,and broudy.baker and brown both concluded that greene suffered from pneumoconiosis,while westerfield and broudy opined in the negative.greene argues that,in concluding that he failed to meet his burden of establishing the existence of the disease,the alj discounted the opinions of baker and brown and accorded significant weight to the negative opinions of westerfield and broudy.on appeal,he attacks this treatment of the four medical opinions.
baker opinion 
greene argues that the alj decision to reject baker opinion was not supported by substantial evidence.we disagree.
the determination as to whether a physician report was sufficiently documented and reasoned is essentially a credibility matter.as such,it is for the factfinder to decide.director,owcp rowe,cir.to make this determination,the alj must examine the validity of the reasoning of a medical opinion in light of the studies conducted and the objective indications upon which the medical opinion or conclusion is based.id.footnote omitted.
in his opinion,baker cited abnormal chest coal dust exposure as the bases for his pneumoconiosis diagnosis.as explained previously,the alj properly concluded that the evidence did not support a finding of pneumoconiosis.baker reliance upon that evidence as support for his diagnosis was misplaced.the alj permissibly discounted baker reference to coal dust exposure because it was premised upon inaccurate accounts of greene coal mine employment and smoking history.baker opinion was based upon a history of underground coal mining work and a smoking history.those figures diverged significantly from the alj factual findings,which credited greene with years of coal mine employment and of smoking.the alj appropriately considered these miscalculations in weighing baker opinion.finding serious flaws in the two stated bases for baker pneumoconiosis diagnosis,the alj properly viewed that opinion as lacking adequate support.when a physician opinion lacks support and detail,the alj may disregard it.see wolf creek collieries director,owcp,cir citing risher owcp,cir.
relying on cornett benham coal,cir,greene also argues that the alj improperly criticized baker opinion for failing to explain the effect cigarette smoking,as distinguished from coal dust exposure,had on the diagnosis.the argument is without merit because cornett and the instant case are distinguishable.in cornett,the court held that the alj committed legal error by using the contributing causality of smoking as a reason for discounting the opinions of two doctors.at.baker acknowledged that both smoking and coal dust contributed to greene condition,but his discussion of the interplay of these factors was vague and equivocal.see griffith director,owcp,cir affirming alj decision to discredit medical opinion as equivocal where physician named both smoking and coal dust exposure as possible causes.it was also based upon erroneous information that significantly understated greene smoking history and overstated the length of his coal mine employment.under the circumstances,the alj criticisms of baker opinion were well within the alj discretion,and the decision to discredit baker finding of pneumoconiosis was supported by substantial evidence.
brown opinion 
the alj similarly discounted the opinion of brown,greene treating physician.greene challenges the alj analysis,arguing that the alj mischaracterized brown opinion by stating that brown failed to state a basis for these diagnoses apart from history.greene maintains that brown considered numerous factors beyond greene history and supported her opinion with adequate reasoning.here again,greene essentially challenges the alj credibility determination.
contrary to greene contention,the alj did not mischaracterize brown opinion.brown explanation of the pneumoconiosis finding cited an diagnostic of emphysema,rather than pneumoconiosis,and summarily stated that greene emphysema had by history been related to pneumoconiosis.brown tied greene emphysema to coal dust exposure,but in doing so relied upon an erroneous account of greene coal mine employment years,which was inconsistent with the years of coal mine employment found by the alj.brown,who was not a pulmonary expert,offered no basis for attributing greene emphysema to coal dust rather than his lengthy and significant history of cigarette smoking.under these circumstances,the alj acted within her discretion in discrediting brown pneumoconiosis finding.
greene also contends that the alj erred in discounting brown opinion because,as his treating physician,brown opinion was entitled to greater weight.we disagree.the alj need not defer to a treating physician opinion.peabody coal groves,cir.a medical opinion is not entitled to any additional weight simply because it was rendered by the claimant treating physician.eastover mining williams,cir.according to the regulations,
in appropriate cases,the relationship between the miner and his treating physician may constitute substantial evidence in support of the adjudication officer decision to give that physician opinion controlling weight,provided that the weight given to the opinion of a miner treating physician shall also be based on the credibility of the physician opinion in light of its reasoning and documentation,other relevant evidence and the record as a whole.
d.thus,the weight to be accorded a treating physician opinion is based on its power to persuade.mountain clay,spivey,cir citing eastover,at d.
here,the alj adequately explained her reasons for finding brown opinion poorly reasoned and documented.the alj did not mischaracterize brown opinion and based her analysis on substantial evidence.brown status as greene treating physician did nothing to improve upon the analytical and documentary defects the alj found in the report.accordingly,we find no error in the alj treatment of brown opinion.
because we conclude that the alj committed no error in giving little weight to all of greene affirmative evidence of pneumoconiosis,greene could not have met his burden of proof,even in the absence of countervailing evidence.accordingly,we must affirm the decision denying benefits.
westerfield and broudy opinions 
greene also attacks the alj purported reliance on the opinions of westerfield and broudy that he did not suffer from pneumoconiosis.
greene argues that westerfield attributed no significance to his years of underground mining which the alj found to be an overestimate in the causation of his lung problems but,rather,attributed his respiratory disability to cigarette smoking alone he also asserts that,because westerfield examined him only once,his opinion should be afforded less weight than brown he challenges westerfield opinion because he was hired by king james coal solely for the purpose of providing a negative report and he asserts that baker opinion should hold more weight because baker was employed by the dol finally,greene maintains that westerfield opinion was hostile to the act and therefore the alj erred in relying upon it.
greene challenges to broudy the opinion should be discounted because he did not examine greene and that he was biased because he was hired and paid by king james mirror his objections to westerfield opinion.like westerfield,broudy also expressed the view that obstructive,rather than restrictive,pulmonary impairment was not indicative of pneumoconiosis.greene asserts that this viewpoint contravenes the regulatory definition of the disease,rendering broudy opinion hostile to the act.
greene actually somewhat misconstrues the alj opinion with respect to westerfield and broudy.although the alj did,indeed,give their opinions more weight when it came to interpreting the evidence because they had superior credentials as compared to the other two doctors and in determining that greene had not established clinical pneumoconiosis because their opinions on this issue were better documented,she did not credit their opinions regarding legal pneumoconiosis any more than those of baker and brown.in fact,after summarizing the opinions of the four doctors on this issue,the alj stated 
thus,brown and baker have relied upon little more than symptomatology,test results,and coal dust exposure over a certain period of time,without explaining how they reached their conclusions based upon the symptomatology and test results and,in the case of brown,how cigarette smoking factored into her opinion,while westerfield and broudy have reached their conclusions based upon questionable generalizations as to the comparative effects of cigarette smoking and coal mine dust,which generalizations are unsupported,even if not hostile to the act 
none of the opinions,in my view,adequately address the role that cigarette smoking coal mine dust exposure played in this individual case.brown did not address the possible effect of cigarette smoking baker assumed the two factors worked together,based upon an arbitrary cutoff of ten years of coal mine employment and an underestimated smoking history and westerfield and broudy relied upon particular generalized assumptions without citing support for those assumptions.i do not find any of these opinions to be persuasive.however,inasmuch as it is the claimant burden of proof,he is not assisted by the inadequacy of the analysis in the medical opinions.accordingly,i find that claimant has failed to establish legal pneumoconiosis based upon the medical opinion evidence.
decision and order denying benefits,at.clearly,the alj rejected all of the medical opinions as inadequate on the issue of legal pneumoconiosis and concluded that greene,therefore,failed to meet his burden of proof on that issue.
since the alj rejected all four doctors opinions,greene assertion that the opinions of westerfield and broudy should not have been considered because they were hostile to the act is a red herring.
the rule allows an alj to disregard medical testimony when a physician testimony is affected by his subjective personal opinions about pneumoconiosis which are contrary to the congressional determinations implicit in the act provisions.blakley amax coal,cir quoting pancake amax coal,cir.application of this rule requires determining whether and to what extent those hostile opinions affected the medical diagnosis.wetherill director,owcp,cir.standing alone,however,a physician expression of a view that conflicts with the act is not sufficient to bar consideration of that opinion.wetherill,at.
the alj actually noted,in the section of the decision where she laid out all the medical evidence,that westerfield had made statements that were arguably hostile to the act.see,decision at,notes and.in particular,westerfield had noted that greene respiratory symptoms arose after he stopped working as a coal miner and cited this fact as a reason for discounting pneumoconiosis,which is clearly contrary to the regulations recognizing that pneumoconiosis is a latent and progressive disease which may first become detectable only after the cessation of coal mine dust exposure.c.both westerfield and broudy indicated their belief that pneumoconiosis generally causes a restrictive lung pattern,whereas greene exhibited chronic obstructive lung disease.this,too,is contrary to the regulations which define pneumoconiosis to include any chronic restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease arising out of coal mine employment.a.
it is apparent that the alj found no need to address this issue because she rejected the doctors opinions on other grounds.
for the reasons discussed above,we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the alj decision to deny greene claim for benefits because he failed to establish that he had pneumoconiosis.
complete pulmonary evaluation 
both greene and the director claim that if baker opinion was so poorly reasoned and documented as to justify the alj refusal to rely upon it,then the case must be remanded so the dol can provide him with a proper evaluation.the regulations entitle each claimant to a complete pulmonary evaluation,which includes a report of physical examination,a pulmonary function study,a chest roentgenogram and,unless medically contraindicated,a blood gas study.a.
king james coal argued that greene waived this argument by failing to raise it before the district director or the alj.the board disagreed,concluding that the director had standing as a to raise the issue and that the director failure to raise it ear
