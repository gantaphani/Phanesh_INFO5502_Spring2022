cheryl lombardi appeals from the decision of the united states court of federal claims claims court affirming the decision of a special master denying compensation under the vaccine act for injuries that she alleged were a result of receiving hepatitis b vaccinations.doe sec y of of health human,fed.cl.claims court op.because we agree with the claims court that the special master did not err in concluding that lombardi failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she suffered the alleged injuries,we affirm.
background 
facts of the case 
the facts in this case are mostly undisputed.lombardi was born on october.she received the first dose of the hepatitis b vaccine on april,and the second dose on may.she suffered no immediate adverse reactions to those first two doses.on october,she received a third dose of the vaccine.then,on november,lombardi visited a hospital emergency room,complaining of right flank pain radiating into her right chest.various tests were performed,but the evaluation failed to find a cause of her symptoms.she was discharged the same day with a diagnosis of atypical chest pain.lombardi returned to the emergency room on november,once again complaining of right flank pain.the various tests that were performed on her during that visit also failed to detect any identifiable problems.
on january,lombardi sought treatment from an internal medicine specialist,michael conaway.records from that visit document lombardi complaints of ongoing pain on her right side,as well as weakness and fatigue.lombardi also informed conaway that she had experienced a weight gain of pounds in the past five years.conaway reviewed the results of tests on blood drawn on january,which indicated that petitioner had a positive antinuclear antibody ana rate.conaway notes indicate that lombardi had a chest that showed some pleural thickening and that he ordered additional tests to determine whether petitioner had systemic lupus erythematosus sle.those notes also indicate that lombardi had consulted cordasco and was undergoing a for possible sle.
in february,teresa george,a rheumatologist,evaluated lombardi for possible sle,but found nothing based on that examination.instead,the doctor noted that lombardi had a history of joint pain which was not associated with swelling.george wrote that lombardi denied having any skin rashes,hair loss,photosensitivity,or changes in memory or concentration.george also noted a higher ana rate,but found all other laboratory tests,including other serologies for diagnosing sle,were normal.she suspected that lombardi probably had a positive ana in the past,and concluded that her right chest pain was of unclear etiology and that there was not enough evidence for systemic lupus erythematosis sic or another autoimmune process at this time.
in february and march,lombardi returned to conaway three times with complaints of pain,nausea,and fatigue.after conducting a thorough workup,conaway wrote that he was really at a loss to explain both her pain and her fatigue at this point.after lombardi third visit,conaway referred her to the cleveland clinic to obtain a more comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.
on march,lombardi saw john campbell,a preventative medicine specialist at the cleveland clinic.campbell ordered blood tests,which revealed that lombardi had a vitamin deficiency and an elevated level of methylmalonic acid.he directed her to have additional tests performed and to see a neurologist.a radiology report from that time indicates that lombardi had decreased bone density,consistent with osteopenia of her lumbar spine,and osteoporosis in her left hip.on one of the physical evaluation forms entitled impressions,campbell notes state post hepatitis b fatigue,followed by an illegible word.on april,lombardi was examined by patrick sweeney,a neurologist at the cleveland clinic,and ian lavery in the colorectal surgery department.lavery did not diagnose any problems and sweeney was doubtful that lombardi suffered from any neurologic problem,stating in his notes that he doubt ed neuro disease.following her return from the other cleveland clinic physicians,campbell summarized his findings,based on their evaluations,as post vaccine syndrome.campbell recommendation to lombardi was that she take and follow up with her local physician.
on april,conaway assessed lombardi with chronic fatigue,expressing uncertainty as to whether the mild vitamin deficiency could explain her symptoms.lombardi reported that she could walk only for about ten minutes before becoming exhausted.conaway also noted that lombardi had chronic right lateral rib cage pain,but was unable to determine a cause of the pain.at the visit,conaway referred lombardi to elizabeth hurst for a psychological evaluation to investigate whether underlying depression or trauma could account for her symptoms.there is no record of lombardi visit to hurst.
on may,lombardi returned to conaway explaining that a friend had told her about a news report suggesting that hepatitis b vaccine could lead to chronic fatigue by causing rheumatologic problems.in his notes from that visit,conaway was doubtful of that diagnosis,noting that the fact that i have seen no objective signs of a rheumatologic condition and her erythrocyte sedimentation rate has always been normal combined with the fact that she has not responded in the past to drugs steroids tend to push me away from that diagnosis.conaway did however indicate that he was unsure what to make of her positive ana.
in july,lombardi saw andrew campbell,a specialist with experience evaluating chronic fatigue syndrome due to the hepatitis b vaccine.campbell assessed her as having fatigue,chest pain,and polyneuropathy.on another visit a few weeks later,campbell again diagnosed lombardi as having fatigue and polyneuropathy.he added the diagnosis of an adverse reaction to a vaccine,and recommended a reassessment in days.campbell notes from another visit three weeks later stated that the decline in lombardi health was a direct result of her hepatitis b vaccination.later,in october,campbell indicated that she also suffered from high cholesterol and prescribed vitamins,including a vitamin b complex.
on october,lombardi visited albert beraducci of neurologic associates,but there is no diagnosis from that visit in the record.on october,she saw joseph plouffe,an infectious disease specialist,who also found that specific antibodies to test for sle were negative.plouffe concluded that petitioner had a p ossible immunologic process of questionable etiology hep b vaccine certainly possible.throughout,lombardi continued to see andrew campbell with little change in her condition.on september,petitioner again had a positive ana test.in late,following another positive ana test,campbell began intravenous immunoglobin treatment for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and lombardi remained on the treatment through at least may.
in august and september,lombardi visited sandra stewart pinkham,a pediatrician who assessed that her problems were best explained by an adverse reaction to hepatitis b vaccine which contains mcg of mercury in each injection.stewart pinkham noted that lombardi problems are identical to individuals with chronic fatigue immune dysfunction,a disease of unknown etiology.lombardi was evaluated by a dermatologist,adam hessel,in september for a recurrent episodic rash.a skin biopsy was performed on march,after which petitioner was diagnosed with wells syndrome.hessel indicated that wells syndrome could be seen in association with a vaccination reaction but that the relationship is uncertain.hessel later concluded that the rash was likely caused by a reaction to toxic black mold found in her home.
on june,a ct scan of lombardi abdomen indicated a tiny,unobtrusive stone in the upper portion of the right kidney and an even smaller stone possibly in the lower portion of the right kidney.the study was otherwise normal.urologist bruce woodworth stated that based on the ct scan results,one wonders if the patient episodes of right flank pain may be due to passage of tiny calculi.a radiographic examination of lombardi cervical spine taken on october,showed multilevel degenerative disk disease with spondylosis and compression of the spinal cord at levels to the left and to the right,associated with disc protrusions and foraminal stenoses.in a november,progress note,conaway assessed petitioner with.cervical disk degeneration and cervical spinal stenosis and.chronic fatigue syndrome.he referred her to a chiropractor and an anesthesiologist for a steroid injection.during the pendency of this litigation,lombardi was also being treated by kevin schlessel,a rheumatologist.
other pertinent details from lombardi medical history include the fact that she became a vegetarian at the age of,underwent a hysterectomy at the age of,and had her appendix removed in her early.at the age of,lombardi had problems with her gallbladder and subsequently underwent surgery for its removal.in august,her only child died under tragic and extraordinary circumstances.at the time of vaccination,lombardi was employed at abbott laboratories,where she packaged medical devices and worked with a chemical called cyclohexane.prior to working at abbott,lombardi was employed at ross laboratories,where her duties involved handling boxes contaminated with bodily fluids.
claims court proceedings 
on july,lombardi filed a petition under,et the vaccine act seeking compensation for certain injuries that she claimed were a result of her hepatitis b vaccinations.the petition did not identify any injuries,but claimed that she had sought frequent medical treatment following the vaccination.subsequently,lombardi focused her case and offered expert opinions in support of claims that she suffered from three different conditions that are not listed on the vaccine injury table transverse myelitis,chronic fatigue syndrome,and sle.
the case was assigned to a special master of the claims court who conducted three evidentiary hearings.because lombardi claimed injuries,she was required to prove causation in fact.see c c ii.both parties retained medical experts,who submitted reports and testified at the hearings regarding lombardi condition and whether the hepatitis b vaccine caused her injuries.the government experts included thomas leist,a neurologist,and lawrence kagen,a rheumatologist.lombardi also retained two experts carlo tornatore,a neurologist,and yehuda shoenfeld,an immunologist and rheumatologist.on december,at tornatore request,an mri of lombardi thoracic spine was performed.the condition stated in the resulting radiology report was mild atrophy of thoracic cord at mid thoracic levels without neurally compressive lesion or intrinsic focal cord lesion depicted.
at the first hearing on november,tornatore testified that lombardi mri indicated atrophy,which in his opinion was caused by transverse myelitis that he concluded resulted from the hepatitis b vaccine.leist offered his opinion that lombardi suffered from a vitamin deficiency an evolving,mixed collagen vascular disorder and osteopenia,with degenerative changes in her cervical spine.leist rejected tornatore hypothesis that lombardi suffered from transverse myelitis as a result of the series of hepatitis b vaccinations.
at the second hearing,on april,shoenfeld,lombardi expert,testified that lombardi suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome,which was a direct result of the hepatitis b vaccine.although not stated in his expert report,shoenfeld opined for the first time at that hearing that lombardi condition met the diagnostic criteria for sle,which he believed was also caused by the hepatitis b vaccinations.kagen,the government expert,offered multiple possible diagnoses for lombardi condition,but did not comment as to whether she suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome.kagen list of diagnoses included a mixed connective tissue disease with rheumatoid arthritis overlap,osteoarthritis with spinal cord and nerve root compression,a nutritional deficit due to a lack of vitamin b in her diet,an allergic reaction to mold,and depression.
at the third hearing,on november,kagen testified that lombardi did not meet the diagnosis for sle under the criteria set out by the american college of rheumatology acr.shoenfeld reiterated his diagnosis of sle.
on january,the special master published an opinion denying lombardi entitlement under the vaccine act.doe sec y of health human,vv,wl,special master op.the special master conducted a thorough analysis of all the tests performed on lombardi,and the opinions of the treating physicians as well as the conflicting opinions of the testifying experts.see id.at.the special master concluded that petitioner was not entitled to compensation because she had not established that she suffers from any of the three conditions that provide the basis for her experts opinions.id.at.the special master stated that under our holding in althen secretary of health human services,when a petitioner claims compensation for an injury not listed on the vaccine injury table,the petitioner must establish three elements,the second being a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury.however,because the special master found that lombardi had failed to establish that she suffered from any specific injury,he found no need to determine whether the claimed conditions were caused by vaccination under the second prong of althen.special master op.at.
with regard to transverse myelitis,the special master concluded that lombardi clinical presentation between november and april was not consistent with the signs and symptoms of transverse myelitis.id.at.he noted that her treating doctors,including her treating neurologist,had never diagnosed her with transverse myelitis and that the mri,the only imaging study done on lombardi,did not counter the conclusions reached by her treating doctors.id.
on lombardi second claim,the special master acknowledged that lombardi had experienced some of the symptoms attributable to chronic fatigue syndrome,but also found a number of alternative causes for her fatigue,including vitamin and thiamine deficiency.id.at.further,he noted that most of lombardi treating doctors did not diagnose her with chronic fatigue syndrome,a diagnosis that requires chronic fatigue plus ancillary factors and the exclusion of other causes of the fatigue.id.
with regard to lombardi sle claim,the special master employed criteria issued by the acr,requiring that at least four of the eleven symptoms be met in order for a diagnosis of sle to be made.id.at.the special master concluded that lombardi met only three.id.at.moreover,he noted that from to,none of lombardi numerous treating doctors had ever diagnosed her as suffering from sle,some of them even having specifically investigated lombardi for sle.id.in conclusion,the special master reasoned that while the answer to what lombardi suffered from was elusive,it was not the government burden to provide that answer.id.at.the special master thus denied lombardi petition for compensation under the vaccine act.
lombardi sought review of the special master decision in the claims court.the claims court affirmed the special master decision,concluding that the special master properly considered the entire record.claims court,fed.cl.at.the claims court concluded that the special master was not arbitrary or capricious in his decision and had laid out a detailed assessment of whether petitioner had proven each diagnosis transverse myelitis,chronic fatigue syndrome,and sle for which she alleged entitlement to compensation.id.the claims court also concluded that the special master had considered,and properly rejected,whether lombardi could recover under a medical theory of a nonlabeled,medical syndrome or symptomatology giving rise to a autoimmune disease.id.the claims court noted that there was no agreement among lombardi expert witnesses,her treating physicians,or in the underlying medical records,as to any injury,symptomatology,or medical diagnosis from which lombardi suffered following her hepatitis b vaccinations.id.the court therefore held that such a record of divergent diagnoses and symptoms could not support an analysis under althen.id.
lombardi appeals the decision of the court of federal claims.we have jurisdiction pursuant to f.
discussion 
we review an appeal from the claims court in a vaccine act case de novo,applying the same standard of review as the claims court applied to its review of the special master decision.andreu sec y of health human.we owe no special deference to the claims court or the special master on questions of law.id.whether the special master applied the appropriate standard of causation is a legal determination reviewed by this court de novo under the not in accordance with law standard.see munn sec y of health human.we uphold the special master findings of fact unless they are arbitrary or capricious.capizzano sec y of health human.thus,although we are reviewing as a matter of law the decision of the claims court under a standard,we are in effect reviewing the decision of the special master under the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard on factual issues.lampe sec y of health human.
a petitioner seeking compensation under the vaccine act must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the injury or death at issue was caused by a vaccine.c,a.if the claimed injury is not listed in the vaccine injury table injury,the petitioner may seek compensation by proving causation in fact.moberly sec y of health human,c c ii.when a petitioner has suffered an injury,we have established the following test for showing causation in fact under the vaccine act 
the petitioner burden is to show by preponderant evidence that the vaccination brought about her injury by providing a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury and a showing of a proximate temporal relationship between vaccination and injury.
althen,at.t he function of a special master is not to diagnose injuries,but instead to determine based on the record evidence as a whole and the totality of the case,whether it has been shown by a preponderance of the evidence that a vaccine caused the petitioner injury.andreu,at quoting knudsen sec y of health human.
lombardi argues that she has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that hepatitis b vaccination caused her injuries.according to lombardi,she was denied compensation merely because her medical condition is complex and she suffers from more than one injury.lombardi contends that under the standard employed by the special master and the claims court,she would have to provide direct evidence of a single unwavering specific diagnosis without the possibility of any other diagnosis in order to succeed on her claim.she contends that the special master and the claims court erred by failing to analyze her condition under the althen test merely because her treating doctors and experts suggested different diagnoses.lombardi argues that she proffered sufficient evidence that she suffered from each of the three conditions,transverse myelitis,chronic fatigue syndrome,and sle,thus requiring the special master to conduct a causation analysis under althen.instead,lombardi continues,the special master improperly shifted to her the government burden of proving that her condition was unrelated to the vaccination.
the government responds that the special master and claims court applied the correct legal standard in reviewing lombardi case,and properly concluded that she had failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that she suffers from any of the three claimed diseases.according to the government,the special master did not impose the government burden on her,or raise her burden of proof to require absolute certainty as to each of the diagnoses.instead,the government contends,he provided a sound rationale for his conclusions,detailing why appellant experts failed to offer reliable evidence to establish any prima facie case,and these factual findings are entitled to significant deference under this court precedent.the government further argues that there was no need to evaluate lombardi claim for causation under althen because she failed to show that she actually suffers from the specific conditions that she alleges.according to the government,it would be illogical for the special master to assess whether or not the hepatitis b vaccine caused those injuries when she has failed to prove that she suffers from them.
we agree with the government that the special master properly denied lombardi claim for compensation under the vaccine act.lombardi primary argument is that she is entitled to recover once she proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the vaccine caused her injury,and thus the special master was required to analyze causation.instead of making that determination,lombardi continues,the special master and the claims court were focused on deciding if she even suffered from one of the three claimed conditions,thus requiring the petitioner to prove a specific diagnosis.that,according to lombardi,imposed on her an improper burden of proving a diagnosis with scientific certainty even before she could prove causation under althen.lombardi arguments,however,are unpersuasive in view of our recent precedent.
in broekelschen secretary of health human services,we addressed the same issue as that presented here.broekelschen,the petitioner in that case,suffered from symptoms that were consistent with two different conditions a vascular condition and an inflammatory condition which differ significantly in their pathology.id.at.in ruling on his petition for entitlement under the vaccine act,the special master decided first to determine which injury broekelschen suffered from,and then proceeded to determine whether the vaccinations caused that injury.id.at.broekelschen had claimed and presented causation evidence on only one of those two conditions.because the special master made a factual determination that the condition that broekelschen actually suffered from was not the one for which he had claimed or presented causation evidence,he denied the petition.id.as in this case,broekelschen argued to us that the special master erred by failing first to determine whether broekelschen had established a prima facie case that the vaccine caused the condition that the petitioner had alleged before determining that he actually suffered from that illness.id.at.we rejected that argument,explaining that the question of causation turned on which injury the petitioner suffered.id.at.we determined that if the existence and nature of the injury itself is in dispute,it is the special master duty to first determine which injury was best supported by the evidence presented in the record before applying the althen test to determine causation of that injury.id.that,we held,is mandated by the vaccine act,which creates a cause of action for persons suffering a injury,a,illness,disability,injury or condition,that has to be more than just a symptom or manifestation of an unknown injury,broekelschen,at.thus,under broekelschen,identification of a petitioner injury is a prerequisite to an althen analysis of causation.
lombardi case,although unusual in that the identification of the injury and its nature is in dispute,is similar to broekelschen.as the special master noted,lombardi case is complicated by the fact that she alleged that she suffers from three different medical conditions.it is further complicated by the fact that there was little agreement as to her symptoms or the diagnosis of her condition among her treating physicians or among the experts.special master op.at.the special master pointed out that even the two experts that lombardi retained specifically for this litigation differ in their opinions as to her injury one of them diagnosed transverse myelitis,and the other offered two alternatives,chronic fatigue syndrome or sle.id.as the special master correctly observed,lombardi has not argued that the three conditions are so similar that doctors consider them to be conditions along a spectrum of diseases.id.at.in contrast,the government experts refuted each of those diagnoses and proposed five other possible conditions that lombardi may have suffered from.in the face of such extreme disagreement among medical experts,each of whom had evaluated the petitioner,it was appropriate for the special master to first determine what injury,if any,was supported by the evidence presented in the record before applying the althen test to determine causation.broekelschen,at.in the absence of a showing of the very existence of any specific injury of which the petitioner complains,the question of causation is not reached.
lombardi argues that by finding that she had failed to prove the existence of any of her injuries,and therefore declining to conduct an althen analysis on any of her alleged injuries,the special master penalized her for alleging that she suffered from more than one injury.lombardi misstates the special master reasoning.the special master did not require lombardi to narrow the number of alleged injuries to one.but the statute places the burden on the petitioner to make a showing of at least one defined and recognized injury.here,the special master merely found that lombardi had failed to meet her burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that she suffered from any medically recognized injury,not merely a symptom or manifestation of an unknown injury.see c c ii i requiring that an injury petitioner must allege that he sustained,or had significantly aggravated,any illness,disability,injury,or condition not set forth in the vaccine injury table but which was caused by a vaccine referred to in subparagraph a.we therefore conclude that the special master imposed the proper burden on lombardi.
next,we review the special master findings on each of lombardi claims.in reaching his conclusions,the special master thoroughly evaluated lombardi medical records as well as the medical opinions of several treating physicians and experts.we afford these findings of fact substantial deference.hines health human,if the special master has considered the relevant evidence of record,drawn plausible inferences and articulated a rational basis for the decision,reversible error will be extremely difficult to demonstrate.we address each in turn.
transverse myelitis 
lombardi argues that tornatore testimony concerning his diagnosis of transverse myelitis after reviewing lombardi mri,combined with the medical literature that he submitted to support his diagnosis,should have sufficed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that she had transverse myelitis.the special master,however,articulated several reasons for rejecting that diagnosis.first,the special master properly recognized the special value that we have placed on the opinions of treating physicians.special master op.at citing capizzano,at.the special master noted that the neurologist and rheumatologist treating lombardi shortly after the vaccines were administered,namely,sweeney,who conducted a complete neurological exam,and george,who performed a comprehensive evaluation,did not diagnose transverse myelitis.id.at noting also that the idea that petitioner suffers from transverse myelitis originated in this litigation.the special master found that even tornatore did not arrive at that diagnosis after reviewing medical records.instead,tornatore suggested that lombardi undergo an mri of her spine,reasoning that if the mri reveals a demyelinating lesion of the thoracic spine,the etiology of her flank pain and its association with the hepatitis b vaccination would be clarified.id.the mri,however,failed to reveal a lesion,and showed only mild atrophy of the thoracic cord.yet,tornatore found that result sufficient to diagnose transverse myelitis and further to connect it to lombardi symptoms nine years earlier.id.at.it was not arbitrary or capricious for the special master to have rejected that expert testimony.see moberly,at.moreover,the special master explained that lombardi seems to have had none of the typical problems associated with transverse myelitis,such as numbness,weakness,sensory abnormalities,and problems with the bowel and bladder.special master op.at.the special master finding that many of lombardi complaints did not match the symptoms of transverse myelitis was not arbitrary or capricious.we thus affirm the special master conclusion that lombardi failed to establish that she suffered from transverse myelitis.
chronic fatigue syndrome 
lombardi argues that the special master improperly rejected evidence,including medical records,showing that her treating physicians,campbell and stewart pinkham,diagnosed her with b fatigue,and testimony from her expert,shoenfeld,that she met at least four of the eight diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome.we disagree.the special master explained that chronic fatigue syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion,and should be made only after other chronically fatiguing conditions have been ruled out.id.at citing the journal of clinical investigation.kagen testified that there were at least two alternative explanations for lombardi fatigue vitamin deficiency and osteoarthritis that precluded the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome.id.at.there is also support in lombardi extensive medical records for a finding that she may have suffered from both of those conditions.moreover,the special master found support in the cited medical literature that those two conditions could also explain some of her symptoms such as fatigue as well as joint and muscle pain.
in addition,the special master meticulously reviewed lombardi medical records to determine if any of her treating physicians had actually diagnosed her with chronic fatigue syndrome.he paid special attention to any fatigue reference in lombardi treating physician statements,but concluded that they did not amount to preponderant evidence of chronic fatigue syndrome.id.at.in doing so,he explained in detail his reasoning for rejecting each of the references as an actual diagnosis of that medical condition.id.
the special master decision on lombardi claim for chronic fatigue syndrome required reconciling conflicting testimony from opposing experts.he found the opinions of leist and kagen to be persuasive,but not shoenfeld.id.at.we conclude that the special master reasonably weighed the evidence before him and that his decision on lombardi claim of chronic fatigue syndrome was well within the discretion granted to special masters under the vaccine program.see andreu,at see also munn,at we do not reweigh the factual evidence,or assess whether the special master correctly evaluated the evidence or the credibility of the witnesses.
lombardi argues that the special master imposed an improper burden by employing the criteria developed by the american college of rheumatologists for a diagnosis of sle and requiring her to prove that she met at least four of the eleven criteria before such a diagnosis can be made.lombardi contends that that requirement reflects a diagnosis of sle with percent certainty,and her burden under the vaccine act can not be that high.even so,lombardi argues,shoenfeld extensively detailed the presence of more than four of the required criteria yet the special master improperly discredited that opinion and arbitrarily denied lombardi claim.
we agree with the government that the special master decision here was reasonable.first,we find no error in the special master decision to analyze lombardi claim under the acr criteria.those criteria are generally accepted in the medical community for diagnosing sle,and lombardi own expert referenced them in analyzing her condition.the special master properly decided that her burden of showing that she suffers from sle would have been satisfied if lombardi could have demonstrated that she met the acr criteria for a diagnosis of sle.see moberly,at a petitioner needs to provide a reputable medical or scientific explanation that pertains specifically to the petitioner case.
the special master noted that the sle claim was raised for the first time more than eight years after lombardi initial petition was filed.special master op.at.following her hepatitis b vaccinations,lombardi treating physicians actively investigated whether she suffered from sle,but in the ten years that ensued,no doctor ever diagnosed her with that disease.on the
