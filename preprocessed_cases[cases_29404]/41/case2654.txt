background 
medicaid is a cooperative program under which states choosing to participate receive federal funds for medicaid services provided they comply with the requirements of the medicaid act,et,and its implementing regulations,et.under the medicaid act,a participating state may ask the secretary of health and human services to provide a waiver allowing the state to pay for home or services as medical assistance under its approved medicaid plan.c.new mexico has chosen to participate in medicaid and has received a waiver from the secretary allowing for the inclusion of two waiver services in its plan the developmental disabilities home and services waiver and the disabled and elderly home and services waiver.
in addition to an advocacy group called protection and advocacy,the initial plaintiffs in this case were individuals who claimed they were eligible for medicaid services because of their physical or developmental disabilities or because of their advanced age after applying for waiver services under new mexico medicaid plan,the plaintiffs were placed on waiting lists for as many as seven years.the plaintiffs argue that the state must provide the waiver services to which they are entitled with reasonable promptness as required by a.alleging violations under both the medicaid act and the americans with disabilities act ada,et,as well as due process violations actionable under,the plaintiffs brought suit against two state agencies,the new mexico department of health and the new mexico department of human services.in addition,the plaintiffs sued alex valdez in his official capacity as both secretary of the department of health and of the department of human services,as well as governor gary johnson in his official capacity as governor of new mexico.the plaintiffs seek a declaration that the defendants current administration of the waiver services violates federal law and injunctive relief ordering the defendants to comply with the medicaid act by providing waiver services with reasonable promptness.
the plaintiffs also initially sought injunctive relief under the ada,requesting that the state agencies provide them with services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.since the district court issued its order,however,the plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their ada claim,leaving only their claims alleging violations of their federal rights under the medicaid act and the constitution.accordingly,the only remaining defendants are the two individuals named in their official capacities,narrowing our inquiry concerning eleventh amendment immunity to whether the plaintiffs claims fall within the ex parte young doctrine,which allows plaintiffs to seek prospective equitable relief for violations of federal law by state officials.we conclude ex parte young applies and affirm the district court denial of the defendants motion to dismiss based on eleventh amendment immunity.
ii.standard of review 
because an assertion of eleventh amendment immunity involves questions of law,we review the district court decision de novo.see powder river basin resource council babbitt,cir see also dang unum life ins,cir recognizing that appellate court reviews questions of law de novo.
iii.eleventh amendment immunity 
although citizens may not generally sue states in federal court under the eleventh amendment,the ex parte young doctrine has carved out an alternative,permitting citizens to seek prospective equitable relief for violations of federal law committed by state officials in their official capacities.ex parte young.in elephant butte irrigation district of new mexico department of the interior,cir,we discussed at length the ex parte young doctrine and the federal courts struggle to define it.in addition,we specifically outlined the inquiry required by supreme court precedent,particularly idaho coeur tribe,d,and florida treasure salvors,d.see elephant butte irrigation,at.in order to conclude that the plaintiffs in this case may proceed against the defendant state officials,we must find that the following four requirements are met the plaintiffs are suing state officials,rather than the state itself the plaintiffs have alleged a violation of federal law the plaintiffs seek prospective equitable relief,rather than retroactive monetary relief from the state treasury and the suit does not implicate special sovereignty interests.id.after addressing each of these elements,we conclude the plaintiffs claims meet the requirements of the ex parte young doctrine,and the defendants are therefore not immune from suit under the eleventh amendment.
alleging a suit against state officials 
the ex parte young doctrine allows plaintiffs to sue state officials even if they claim to be acting under valid state law because,if the officials conduct constitutes an ongoing violation of federal law,the state can not cloak their actions with state authority or state immunity.id.that is,when state officials are arguably violating federal law,t he state is not the real party in interest because the state can not authorize the officials to violate federal law.id.at.hence,in allegedly violating federal law,the officials are stripped of their state authority and the eleventh amendment will not protect them from suit.in the case before us,the defendants are two state officials exercising considerable control over the implementation and administration of the waiver services under new mexico medicaid plan.the plaintiffs claim these officials,acting pursuant to state authority,are violating federal law in failing to provide waiver services to eligible individuals with reasonable promptness.the plaintiffs have,therefore,properly sued state officials,rather than the state itself.
moreover,we are not persuaded by the defendants contention that the plaintiffs have failed to bring a permissible suit against state officials because the relief would require that the courts interfere with discretionary,rather than simply ministerial,acts by state officials.we have previously addressed the same argument,noting that a lthough this general premise is sound,ex parte young does not extend this rule to preclude judicial review of discretionary acts that violate federal law.id.at.when plaintiffs establish a violation of federal law,we have held we will not deny jurisdiction solely on the basis that a ruling might indirectly impact state officials discretionary acts.id.the relief sought in the present case requires only that the court order state officials to comply with federal law because the court would not instruct the defendants in how to use their discretion to comply,any impact on the official exercise of discretion would be indirect.
alleging a violation of federal law 
we must next determine whether the plaintiffs have alleged a claim for relief that does not merely allege a violation of federal law solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.although this question may rest on the later decision on the merits,we have characterized the two steps as separate,distinct inquires.id.as the supreme court has recognized,a state official must act in violation of federal law and therefore outside any delegated authority in order for plaintiffs to avoid dismissal based on eleventh amendment immunity.see,larson domestic foreign commerce,cited in elephant butte,at.the question of whether state officials violated federal law therefore affects both the initial immunity inquiry and the court ultimate decision on the merits.id.at.at the immunity stage,however,federal courts apply the limited jurisdictional standard u
