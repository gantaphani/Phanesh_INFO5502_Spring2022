lorenzo taylor appeals from a district court order granting the secretary of state motion for summary judgment.taylor claimed that the state department violated the rehabilitation act of,when it refused to hire him as a foreign service officer because he is.this case presents the question whether an otherwise qualified individual with hiv would pose a direct threat to himself if employed by the foreign service,which requires officers to be available to serve in assignments throughout the world.a.
taylor applied to the foreign service in july.after extending a conditional offer of employment,the state department declined to hire him because he is,and perhaps because he also has a pulmonary condition.taylor sued the secretary of state under of the rehabilitation act,alleging that the state department discriminated against him on the basis of his status.discovery followed,and the secretary moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted.the evidence,viewed in taylor favor,see anderson liberty lobby,d,was as follows.
the mission of the foreign service,part of the state department,is to advocate american foreign policy,protect american citizens,and promote american interests throughout the world.foreign service officers are of two types.generalists perform traditional diplomatic responsibilities,including trade promotion,political and economic reporting,and consular services and protection.specialists have positions requiring special skills,such as construction engineering,information technology,and regional security.
during the period relevant to this case,the foreign service maintained posts around the world.about percent of these posts are considered hardship generally outside of western europe,canada,and factors such as climate,quality of local health care,and pollution levels render living conditions more arduous than in the united states.the state department frequently assigns junior foreign service officers to hardship posts during their first four years of service to determine their qualifications for tenure as career foreign service officers because serving in a hardship post is challenging,the state department seeks to equalize employee service at these posts and reward those who complete such service 
to ensure that it hires qualified applicants to fill these posts,the foreign service has a rigorous hiring process.candidates must successfully take the foreign service written exam and pass an oral assessment.see b,c.they then join the list of eligible hires,from which candidates are drawn in rank order to receive conditional offers of employment based on the hiring needs in various career tracks within the foreign service.the offers are conditional because they are subject to satisfactory completion of security,medical,and overall suitability reviews.see id.d,e,f.these reviews are designed to ensure that in all respects candidates are able to fulfill congress aspiration for foreign service officers to be representative of the american people,aware of the principles and history of the united states and informed of current concerns and trends in american life,knowledgeable of the affairs,cultures,and languages of other countries,and available to serve in assignments throughout the world.a.
most relevant to this appeal are the state department medical review procedures for foreign service candidates.see id.b,b.according to state department regulations,the purpose of the medical examination is to determine the candidate physical fitness to perform the duties of a foreign service officer on a worldwide basis and to determine the presence of any physical,neurological,or mental condition of such a nature as to make it unlikely that they would be able to function on a worldwide basis.e.the state department foreign affairs manual requires that a ll candidates who have received conditional offers of employment in the foreign service receive a medical examination and be issued a medical clearance.department of state,foreign affairs manual fam b.class clearances are i ssued to examinees who have no identifiable medical conditions that would limit assignment abroad.id.the state department refers to those with a class clearance as worldwide available.class clearances are i ssued to examinees who have a medical condition that requires periodic specialized medical evaluation or treatment,or whose medical condition would be aggravated by conditions at specific posts.id.class is no class or class i ssued to examinees who have a medical condition which is incapacitating or for which necessary specialized medical care is best obtained in the united states.employees with a class medical clearance may not be assigned outside the united states.id.class clearance is necessary for a foreign service candidate to complete the medical examination successfully.
upon completing the medical examination,candidates not receiving class clearances are issued class clearances and may request an administrative waiver of the medical standards for employment.id.b.waiver decisions are made by the director general of the foreign service or a deputy assistant secretary of human resources,and such decisions are final.id.a,c.various factors enter the waiver calculus,including the percentage of posts for which the candidate is eligible,the permanence of the disqualifying condition,the nature of the position sought,and any extraordinary skills the candidate possesses.id.b.the secretary represents that because a candidate special skills are relevant to waiver determinations,id.b,the vast majority of waivers go to specialist candidates,not generalists.
the state department has specific policies about hiring candidates and retaining current employees who contract hiv as a general rule,the state department considers hiv positive individuals,even those who are stable with respect to their disease,a s not being worldwide available and therefore ineligible for class medical clearance.this follows from the state department belief that foreign service officers can safely be stationed only at overseas posts that have both a physician with experience treating patients and laboratories comparable to domestic standards,capable of performing testing to monitor the virus course.qualified physicians and laboratories were available at approximately percent of the state department overseas posts at times pertinent to this appeal despite the general rule,it is the state department policy to retain foreign service members who become hiv positive after appointment,and to assign them abroad as their medical conditions permit.this is consistent with the state department treatment of current employees who develop some kind of medical condition that limits their availability.
foreign service officers who experience medical serving in overseas posts have limited options.to the extent satisfactory local medical facilities are available,they are expected to seek treatment there.but when local treatment is not can happen in hardship foreign affairs manual provides that an officer shall be eligible to travel at government expense to the nearest facility where he can get the treatment he needs.fam.however,t ravel will not be authorized for employees to take routine medical examinations or to receive routine immunizations.id.because foreign service officers undergo comprehensive physical examinations roughly every two years,an officer who develops a physical or mental health condition limiting future be a class clearance thus,even though candidates for the foreign service without class clearances generally are rejected because they are not worldwide available,experienced officers with the same limitations often are retained and dispersed as their health allows because the state department values their experience and expertise.
taylor submitted his application to become a generalist foreign service officer after serving for many years in jobs preparing him for a career in foreign diplomacy.he passed the written and oral examinations and received an offer of employment in november.the offer was conditioned on his passing the medical and security clearance screenings.when he reported to the examination clinic of the state department medical office in december,he was given a document entitled hiv testing information,which stated that b ecause new applicants for the foreign service must be worldwide available class,those who are hiv positive will not be eligible for employment.taylor proceeded with the examination and returned a week later to discuss his results with lori brandshaft in the examination clinic.although the results of the hiv test were not yet reported,he voluntarily revealed his status to brandshaft.
taylor had learned of his infection when he tested positive for hiv antibodies in march.he describes his condition today as a chronic manageable condition that requires only periodic monitoring and the use of medication,not constant medical attention.douglas ward,taylor treating physician,monitors his hiv infection three times a year,though he has told taylor that as a foreign service officer he would need to be monitored only twice a year.ward is on record saying that taylor faces no greater health risk in countries with substandard health care than individuals who are not.
on january,ward sent a letter to brandshaft describing taylor stable condition and stating that it should not pose an obstacle to his employment in the foreign service.four days later taylor met with the chief of the examination clinic,who reiterated that taylor was not eligible for employment as a foreign service officer because he is.on january,the state department notified taylor officially that he would not be hired a few days later taylor sent a letter seeking a medical waiver.his request was rejected by letter in july.in august,when taylor sent a letter to the state department expressing his opinion that its hiring policy unfairly discriminated against people with hiv,the director general of the foreign service stated in a responsive letter that taylor had been denied employment not just because of his hiv status,but also because of his asthma.this apparently was the first time that the state department indicated to taylor that his pulmonary condition had anything to do with the decision not to hire him 
taylor had noted his pulmonary condition on a foreign service medical examination form,reporting that he had asthma and that he took three different asthma medications daily.he also reported having at least one acute asthma episode since august that required inhalation therapy.based on this information,the state department concluded that taylor could not be safely posted to approximately of overseas locations.
taylor developed evidence in the district court indicating that he was misdiagnosed with asthma,and that he experiences eosinophilic benign,inflammatory condition that affects his lungs.his doctor,charles read,associate professor of medicine at georgetown university medical center,stated that there is no reason that taylor should not be able to travel and live anywhere in the world,as his prognosis is very good,and his condition is very easy to treat,even from afar.
after the state department rejected his waiver request,taylor exhausted his administrative remedies and filed suit in district court.the parties conducted discovery and the secretary moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the secretary motion,concluding that reasonable worldwide availability the ability to serve at many but not all of the state department overseas an essential function of the foreign service,and that,because of his status,taylor is not capable of fulfilling that function without posing a direct threat to himself.in so holding,the court determined that the significant risk to taylor health could not be reduced by any reasonable accommodation without also imposing undue hardship on the state department.the court did not evaluate the secretary alternative argument that taylor pulmonary condition was an independent justification for the state department decision not to hire him.
taylor claims that the district court wrongly resolved genuine issues of material fact in the secretary favor and erred as a matter of law in concluding that his proposed accommodations are unreasonable and would impose undue hardship on the state department.taylor describes the two accommodations he proposes as follows the department c ould grant him class ii clearance and place him at a post where he can access local hiv physicians and diagnostic laboratories,or the department c ould permit him to use his allotted leave time to access routine medical care while posted abroad.appellant final opening br.the secretary defends the district court decision,and also claims that taylor asthma provides a separate and independent reason for affirming the district court decision.final br.for.
rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.to determine what factual disputes were material and whether the secretary was entitled to judgment as a matter of law,the logical place to begin is with the law,here the rehabilitation act of,and its amendments.langon dep t of health human,anderson liberty lobby,d.our review is de novo.breen dep t of.
taylor accuses the secretary of violating of the rehabilitation act,the basic tenet of which is that the government must take reasonable affirmative steps to accommodate the handicapped,except where undue hardship would result,barth gelb.see e expressly applying to the foreign service.section b requires federal employers to take affirmative action when making hiring,placement,and advancement decisions regarding individuals with disabilities.b as relevant here,the statute defines individual with a disability as anyone who has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits a major life activit y,has a record of such an impairment,or is regarded as having such an impairment.id.b i iii 
the statute instructs courts to use the standards of the americans with disabilities act of,to evaluate a complaint like taylor alleging nonaffirmative action employment discrimination.g see b applying the regulations set forth in pt.to claims under.the disabilities act prohibits discrimination against any qualified individual with a disability.a emphasis added see.an individual with a disability under the rehabilitation act,b,therefore must be qualified to be protected by the disabilities is,he or she,with or without reasonable accommodation,must be able to perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.see m breen,at applying to a plaintiff suing under of the rehabilitation act.
defendants have at their disposal a number of defenses to rehabilitation act liability,two of which the secretary employs in this case.first,a defendant may avoid liability by demonstrating that the employee disability pose s a direct threat to the employee health or safety in a manner that can not be reasonably accommodated.b see id.r see also chevron echazabal,d second,a defendant may avoid liability by demonstrat ing that the accommodation even if reasonable would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business.a accord id.d see us airways,barnett,d barth,at see also langon,at.the district court concluded that the secretary was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on both theories.we begin with the direct threat defense.
an employer may require,as a qualification standard,that an individual not pose a direct threat to his health or safety in the workplace.b see also b.direct threat in this context means a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual that can not be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.r see also.in chevron echazabal,the supreme court explained what this entails 
the direct threat defense must be based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge the best available objective evidence,and upon an expressly individualized assessment of the individual present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job,reached after considering,among other things,the imminence of the risk and the severity of the harm portended.
at.quoting r.as the district court recognized,to evaluate the individual present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job,id.quoting r internal quotation mark omitted,we must first determine what functions are matter the parties contest.
essential functions are the fundamental job duties of the employment position.n.to determine which job duties are fundamental,one must consider,among other things,the secretary judgment as to what functions of a job are essential,t he work experience of past incumbents in the job,n vi,and t he current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs,id.n vii.the essential function at issue here is a foreign service officer ability to be worldwide available,and the question is to what extent foreign service officers must be available to serve at overseas foreign service posts.in particular,must officers be able to serve at nearly percent of overseas posts,as the secretary claims,or only at a substantial number of overseas posts,as taylor claims the district court concluded that some reasonable level of worldwide availability is an essential function of the job,and that taylor availability to serve in,at most,percent of overseas posts was unreasonable.we believe this conclusion can not be reached without resolving material factual disputes in the secretary favor.
the foreign service act and regulations thereunder indicate that foreign service officers must serve abroad,a,in assignments throughout the world,id.a,and on a worldwide basis,e.see n i a job function may be considered essential because the reason the position exists is to perform that function.these general terms do not specify how many posts officers must be available to fill.the fact that a candidate can not go everywhere in the world does not necessarily mean that he is not available on a worldwide basis.e.for example,after stating that candidates must be available for worldwide assignment,the foreign service guidebook states that foreign service employees must be able to serve in a wide variety of overseas posts.see i f an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job,this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.the foreign service statute and regulations therefore do not indicate precisely what level of worldwide availability is essential for foreign service officers.
the record no more conclusively establishes the secretary position.there is evidence suggesting that,in practice,the secretary does not require every foreign service officer to be available to serve everywhere in the world.this is apparent from the fact that some candidates unable to serve at every overseas foreign service post are nevertheless hired with class clearances.the secretary admits that between and the foreign service hired twelve candidates who were given class medical clearances because of their asthma.see breen,at.other evidence is to the same effect.ambassador peter burleigh,who spent more than thirty years as a foreign service officer,testified that the realities of foreign service assignment procedures and practices often deviate substantially from th e formal requirements.see n vi considering t he work experience of past incumbents as e vidence of whether a particular function is essential pt,app.note discussing n same.he explained that a t any given time between and of foreign service officers are not available for worldwide assignment for a variety of reasons.he further testified that t his is true for junior,and senior foreign service officers.one of the secretary mullican,office director in the bureau of human similar testimony,estimating that of the generalists and of the specialists are currently restricted from availability due to medical conditions,a figure that does not account for other foreign service officers who might be unavailable for other reasons.
the record therefore reveals a genuine issue of material fact regarding the extent to which foreign service officers must be available to serve in overseas posts.compare swanks.metro.area transit.for this reason,the secretary was not entitled to summary judgment on the ground that taylor availability to serve in percent of overseas posts rendered him unqualified to serve in the foreign service.
the district court went on to conclude that taylor would pose a significant risk to his own health or safety if he were posted anywhere in the world and that no reasonable accommodation could eliminate that risk without imposing undue hardship on the state department.taylor quarrel is with the court conclusion that any such risk could not reasonably be accommodated without imposing undue hardship on the state department.recall the two accommodations that taylor proposed granting him class clearance and only placing him at overseas posts where he can access local hiv physicians and diagnostic laboratories,or,alternatively,sending him to any overseas post,but permit ting him to use his allotted leave time to access routine medical care.appellant final opening br.
an accommodation may be reasonable on its face,ordinarily or in the run of cases,barnett,at.accord barth,at,or it may be reasonable as applied,on the particular facts of the case,barnett,at.whether a proposed accommodation is reasonable and whether it imposes undue hardship are separate inquiries.but the analyses often overlap,see sch.bd.of nassau county arline,d barth,at,especially when evaluating claims of inquiry particularly pertinent here this is because an employer undue hardship claim depends on the particular circumstances of the case,barnett,at.see also barth,at,just as an employee claim of as applied reasonableness turns on the particular facts of the case,barnett,at.
the disabilities act does not provide a comprehensive definition of reasonable accommodation,but it gives examples of what the term may include.o see id.o defining reasonable accommodation as m odifications or adjustments to application processes,work environment,and access to benefits and privileges of employment.among these are accommodations such as providing a modified work schedule for an employee,b,or adjusting the circumstances under which the employee performs his job responsibilities,o.while taylor proposed accommodations might be seen as falling generally within these examples,still we must determine whether his proposed modifications or adjustments are reasonable.an accommodation may be unreasonable if it either imposes undue financial and administrative burdens or requires a fundamental alteration in the nature of the employer program.arline,at,d quoting se.cmty.coll.davis,d.
an a reasonable undue hardship on an employer if it requir es significant difficulty or expense,when considered in light of several statutory factors.a see p.those factors include the nature and cost of the accommodation,b i,and the composition,structure,and functions of the employer workforce,id.b iv.see also p id.pt,app.note discussing p.an employer invoking the undue hardship defense must use these factors to show special typically circumstances that demonstrate undue hardship in the particular circumstances.barnett,at.
as to taylor first proposed request for class clearance and placement only at overseas posts where hiv physicians and diagnostic laboratories are district court found it unreasonable because it requires the state department to waive an essential function of the job.even if an accommodation that effectively dispenses with an essential function is unreasonable,see robertson neuromedical,cir,the parties genuinely dispute the level of worldwide availability essential for foreign service officers.we therefore have no way of knowing whether this proposed accommodation would effectively do away with an essential function.in any event,the secretary claim that granting taylor class clearance is unreasonable and would impose undue hardship is suspect because the secretary admits that between and the foreign service hired twelve employees who were denied class clearances because of asthma,but granted waivers and class clearances 
as to taylor second proposed him to use his allotted leave time to obtain medical care while posted district court concluded this was unreasonable for three reasons.the court first held that to determine how often taylor would need to travel for routine medical monitoring,the state department could rely on the department of health and human services guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents,which recommends medical monitoring three or four times a year,rather than on taylor treating physician,ward,who testified that taylor needed medical monitoring only twice a year.the court then concluded that because taylor proposed less routine medical care than health and human services has indicated is safe,this accommodation is unreasonable.
in the language of the rehabilitation act,the district court seems to have concluded that it would be unreasonable in the run of cases for an employee to receive less medical care than public authorities recommend is safe.barnett,at.if that is correct and we do not say it is or is claim that his special circumstances warrant a finding that the requested accommodation is reasonable on the particular facts still remains.id.at.taylor presented medical testimony that he faces no specific risk of experiencing acute complications as a result of his hiv status.ward testified that taylor immune system is strong enough to enable him to serve throughout the world without increased risk of harm and that he needs medical monitoring only twice a year.this evidence is more than enough to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding the reasonableness of the proposed accommodation.
accepting for the sake of argument ward estimate of how often taylor would need medical monitoring,the district court found a second reason why taylor second proposed accommodation it is unreasonable for an employee to miss several days of work to obtain medical care in another city or country at the government expense.taylor disputes both the number of days he would miss for medical care and the significance of the expense.the state department grants to junior foreign service officers thirteen days of annual leave,ten days of leave for federal holidays,and thirteen sick days each year,the latter being designed to allow foreign service officers to obtain medical,dental,or optical care.an employee proposed accommodation seeking to use leave time to receive necessary medical care will be reasonable in many circumstances.see pt,app.note discussing o identifying as a reasonable accommodation permitting the use of accrued paid leave or providing additional unpaid leave for necessary treatment and making employer provided transportation accessible see also criado ibm,cir hudson mci telecomms,cir.this is precisely what taylor proposes doing,and he has presented evidence suggesting that the leave to which junior foreign service officers are entitled is sufficient for him to receive the medical care he would need.his evidence tended to show that every foreign service post is within one day travel of a city with adequate hiv medical care and that his medical visits would involve examinations typically lasting but thirty minutes.this conflicts with the secretary evidence suggesting that taylor would need to spend between six to ten days away from work for each medical visit.nor is it clear from the record that it would be unreasonable for the government to pay for taylor travel expenses ambassador burleigh testified that it is actual state department practice to allow foreign service officers to travel a few times a year for routine medical monitoring,and that this does not pose a significant or unusual burden on the department,either financially or administratively.
the district court third reason for finding unreasonable taylor second proposed accommodation is that it would contravene the state department prohibition against authorizing travel for routine medical policy created based on legitimate concerns for the safety of state department employees.see fam ambassador burleigh testimony quoted above regarding the practice of the state department bears on this subject.if taylor proposal turns out to be consistent with the state department practice,that would tend to support its reasonableness.and as a legal matter,the fact that an accommodation would require a change in policy does not necessarily demonstrate unreasonableness or undue hardship.see barnett,at.t he fact that the proposed difference in treatment violates an employer rule can not by itself place the accommodation beyond the act potential reach.o ii reasonable accommodation may include appropriate adjustment or modifications of policies mcalindin county of san diego,cir mcwright alexander,cir because there were disputed material facts regarding taylor second accommodation,the secretary was not entitled to summary judgment on either of the asserted threat or undue hardship.
the secretary urges us to affirm on an altogether different taylor pulmonary condition renders him unqualified for the foreign service.we evaluate an agency claim that it refused a job application for reasons unrelated to the person handicap,barth,at,under the framework established by mcdonnell douglas green,d,barth,at discussing mcdonnell douglas and.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d.the initial burden is on the plaintiff to produce evidence making out a prima facie case of discrimination.if the plaintiff does so,the employer has the burden of presenting evidence supporting its claim that it had a reason for the personnel action.if the employer carries this burden,it is up to the plaintiff to prove to the trier of fact that the employer reason was pretextual and that intentional discrimination occurred.barth,at discussing burdine,at.we shall assume,as does the secretary,that taylor made out a prima facie case.the question is whether the secretary produced evidence that taylor pulmonary condition was a reason for rejecting his application to the foreign service.
on that subject there are numerous unsettled factual issues.for instance,because the secretary admits hiring twelve foreign service candidates with asthma between and,the fact that a candidate has a pulmonary disorder may not in itself be disqualifying.the parties dispute the severity of taylor pulmonary condition.the record does not indicate how taylor compares to the candidates with asthma who the state department has hired in the past.and as discussed above,the parties genuinely dispute the extent to which foreign service officers must be available to serve dispute that affects any determination about whether taylor pulmonary condition disqualifies him from performing this alleged essential function.even if the secretary had established that taylor pulmonary condition was a disqualifying characteristic,taylor has some evidence suggesting that his pulmonary condition was a his status is the true reason he was not hired.see charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed.i n suits charging disability discrimination,summary judgment often has been denied because of the presence of material fact questions involving motive or intent.footnote omitted.in light of these factual disputes,the secretary was not entitled to summary judgment on this theory.
for the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
so ordered.
assignments are made through a bidding process in which foreign service officers submit requests for desired assignments drawn from a list of current openings.after close consultation with an officer,the bureau of human resources selects an appropriate assignment.the bureau takes into account personal and professional factors,though the needs of the foreign service remain paramount.
for this reason,the secretary represents that the state department would have a morale problem if it hired individuals who can not serve in hardship posts,particularly if this required
