this appeal is brought by a child with a disability within the meaning of the individuals with disabilities education act idea.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court insofar as it upheld the hearing officer determination regarding the extent of the school district violation of the idea,but reverse the court affirmation of the award and remand the case with instructions to have the appropriate administrative body craft a remedy that complies with the idea.
background 
a minor child,attended preschool and elementary school through the fourth grade under the jurisdiction of the board of education of fayette county,kentucky the school district.he exhibited behavioral and academic problems beginning in kindergarten,but was not identified by the school district as a child with a disability within the meaning of the idea until may of,just prior to the conclusion of school year,the child legal guardian,requested a due process hearing pursuant to the idea,which was held by an impartial hearing officer in january of.the hearing officer found that the child was denied a free appropriate public education fape for his third and school years and due to the school district failure to refer for special education after his year.to remedy this denial,the hearing officer awarded a package that included hours of specified instruction in reading and language skills.
the exceptional children appeals board appeals board affirmed the hearing officer finding that the child was denied a fape for the two years in question,but reversed the hearing officer award of hours of compensatory education in favor of a more fluid determination of appropriate compensatory education to be prepared by the child admissions and release committee committee.in kentucky,this committee is the equivalent of a student individualized education program iep team under the idea.
was born in february of and attended elementary school in fayette county from through.he was referred for evaluation as a student with possible disabilities under the idea in january of,during his school year.the school district conducted a comprehensive evaluation of shortly thereafter,and the committee met on may,to review and act on the results of that evaluation.among other things,the committee determined that had been medically diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd and that he also met the idea eligibility requirements for a reading disability.
the school district does not dispute eligibility under the idea.and his guardian,however,argued before the hearing officer that the school district should have referred for a disability evaluation under the idea procedures as early as kindergarten.report cards from the first two grading periods of kindergarten year showed that struggled with behavioral and social skills,beginning language skills,and math.but by the end of kindergarten year,he was meeting expectations in all academic areas,even though he still exhibited behavioral problems.behavioral problems continued for the next three years,and he began experiencing severe academic problems as well.for example,his standardized test scores at the end of the second grade indicated that was reading far below grade level and was considered at risk.his teacher requested assistance from a reading specialist and the school psychologist,and discussed the possibility of a reading disability with the principal.the teacher did not,however,refer for a formal evaluation under the idea.
after completed the third grade,he was still reading far below grade level.the teacher recommended that repeat that grade.his guardian objected,however,and he was promoted to fourth grade.but attended summer school between the third and fourth grades under the school district extended school services program.
in september of,guardian notified the school that had been medically diagnosed with adhd.the school principal then referred for an idea evaluation in november of that year.in february of,the committee determined that the referral was appropriate and warranted a full evaluation,which was completed in april of.the committee reviewed evaluation and met on may,to devise a plan of action.at the meeting,the committee determined that met the eligibility requirements for special education due to several disabilities,including his adhd.the committee held several meetings during may of to develop iep.guardian,unhappy with the iep as well as the timing of referral for special education,requested a due process hearing pursuant to the idea.the hearing officer conducted hearings throughout the fall of and rendered a written decision on january.
in her decision,the hearing officer concluded that the school district failure to refer for a evaluation in the second grade deprived him of a fape in the third and fourth grades this failure resulted in a loss of educational opportunity and constituted a denial of a fape.the hearing officer further concluded that the school district failure to provide individualized extended school year esy instruction during the summer of also constituted the denial of a fape.to remedy these violations,the hearing officer awarded hours of compensatory education,consisting of instruction in reading and language skills,as well as an additional number of hours equal to the number of hours that would have been eligible for esy,had the committee considered and determined the need for esy services in the summer of.moreover,the hearing officer ordered the school district to invite private psychologist to the committee meeting and to pay for the psychologist attendance.
the school district appealed to the appeals board,which agreed with the hearing officer factual findings but altered the remedy.instead of requiring a certain number of hours of compensatory education,the appeals board ordered committee to prepare and carry out a plan for providing with compensatory education services and to meet as required to review and modify the plan,not less than once every twelve months,until the committee determines that the award is fulfilled.
unhappy with the appeals board decision,the school district filed an action in federal district court,challenging the following two determinations made by the hearing officer and affirmed by the appeals board that was entitled to esy instruction for the summer of,and that the school district pay for private psychologist to attend the committee meeting.and his guardian asserted counterclaims,of which are the sole issues now on appeal that the school district denied a fape to during the and school first and years,well as during the summer of,and that the limited nature of the award with respect to the and school years and the summer of denied meaningful relief.the district court affirmed the appeals board decision in its entirety.and his guardian timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
in a lawsuit brought to challenge an idea administrative finding,the district court i shall receive the records of the administrative proceedings ii shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party and iii basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence,shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.i c.the supreme court has construed this provision to mean that an initial reviewing court should make an independent decision based on the preponderance of the evidence but also should give due weight to the determinations made during the state administrative process.deal hamilton county bd.of,cir quoting bd.of educ.rowley,d.
a district court thus reviews idea cases under a modified de novo standard,meaning that it may set aside administrative findings in an idea case only if the evidence before the court is more likely than not to preclude the administrative decision from being justified based on the agency presumed educational expertise,a fair estimate of the worth of the testimony,or both.berger medina city sch,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.more weight is due to an agency determinations on matters for which educational expertise is relevant.deal,at.
on appeal,we will reverse the district court findings of fact only if they are clearly erroneous.id.at.the district court conclusions of law,however,are reviewed de novo.id.finally,m ixed questions of law and fact,including the question of whether a child was denied a fape,are reviewed de novo,although the panel should accord due deference to the state administrative hearing officer decision.id.
timing of referral for idea eligibility 
and his guardian first argue that the district court and the appeals board erred by failing to find that was denied a fape during the and the school first and second grades.they also assert that was entitled to esy instruction during the summer of.the hearing officer found that the school district should have referred for evaluation in the second grade,and that the failure to do so resulted in the denial of a fape for only his third and years.this finding was affirmed by both the appeals board and the district court.
the idea imposes a requirement on the states their schools must have policies and procedures in place to identify,locate,and evaluate children with disabilities who need special education and related services.a.even children who are only suspected of having a disability,although they are progressing from grade to grade,are protected by this requirement.c.and his guardian argue that the school district failure to evaluate as early as kindergarten constituted a procedural violation of the idea requirement that resulted in substantive harm to 
a school district may be held liable for procedural violations of the idea that cause substantive harm to the student.metro.bd.of pub.ed.guest,cir.what a claimant must show to establish a procedural violation is a matter of first impression in this circuit.we now adopt the standard first articulated in clay walton county sch,which provides that the claimant must show that school officials overlooked clear signs of disability and were negligent in failing to order testing,or that there was no rational justification for not deciding to evaluate.this standard was also adopted by the district court below.
first and fape claim 
the district court affirmed the appeals board finding that the appropriate time for a referral was at the end of school year.it reasoned that i t is difficult to assess whether a very young child is disabled or merely developing at a rate different from his peers,and the educational experts involved all seem to indicate that a hasty referral for special education can be damaging to a child.on appeal,and his guardian offer an exhaustive review of educational and behavioral problems in support of their contention that the school district ignored clear signs of his adhd and reading disability as early as kindergarten.none of this evidence,however,is new information that the hearing officer did not already consider,nor does any of it show why the hearing officer factual findings are clearly erroneous.an educational expert testified that performance in kindergarten should not have caused teachers to jump to conclusions.the hearing officer,and later the appeals board,also gave due weight to expert testimony concluding that the nature of ungraded primary school recognizes the progress of very young students is not uniform.
as the hearing officer noted,virtually all of the witnesses who testified at the due process hearing,including own expert,stated that difficulties would not necessarily indicate a disability or a need for special education,and that it would be inappropriate to rush to identify a child that young as disabled.school personnel similarly testified that behavioral and learning problems were not atypical of immature young boys.
the school district did not ignore early problems.it took appropriate action by implementing specialized reading instruction,reading recovery program participation,and strategies.under the idea,the school district was required to provide a basic floor of educational opportunity consisting of access to specialized instruction and related services which are individually designed to provide educational benefit to the handicapped child.rowley,at.there is no additional requirement,however,that the services so provided be sufficient to maximize each child potential commensurate with the opportunity provided other children.id.at.citation and quotation marks omitted emphasis added.the school district provided additional services designed to aid in catching up to his peers in kindergarten and first grade,even though at that point he was not identified as being disabled within the meaning of the idea.
we agree with the district court that these services provided a basic floor of educational opportunity through school year.the interventions in kindergarten and first grade were moderately successful,at least during those years.by the end of kindergarten,for example,was meeting expectations in all academic areas.did not start to fall significantly below grade level until the middle of his year.no teacher suggested that he repeat a school year until after the third grade.in short,nothing in the record compels the conclusion that the school district either overlooked clear signs of disability before entered second grade or had no rational justification for failing to evaluate him prior to that time.see clay.at.
esy instruction during the summer of 
and his guardian also contend that was entitled to esy instruction during the summer of,following his year.in lieu of esy,received summer school instruction through the school district extended school services program.extended school services are available to students with or without disabilities.there is no evidence in the record regarding the nature of the instruction provided to that summer.
under the idea,schools are required to provide extended school services as necessary in order to provide a child with a fape.a.a school must provide these services,however,only if the child iep team determines that such services are necessary for the provision of fape to the child.id.but a claimant seeking an esy must satisfy an even stricter test,because providing an esy is the exception and not the rule under the regulatory scheme.cordrey euckert,cir.this court has held that the burden is on the claimant proposing an esy to demonstrate,in a particularized manner relating to the individual child,that an esy is necessary to avoid regression so severe that the child would not be able to catch up during the following school year.id.if the child benefits meaningfully within his potential from instruction under a proper iep over a regular school year,then esy service may not be required under the act unless the benefits accrued to the child during the regular school year will be significantly jeopardized if he is not provided an esy.id.brackets and quotation marks omitted.a claimant must show,in other words,that an esy is necessary to permit the child to benefit from his instruction.see id.brackets and quotation marks omitted.claimants can rely on expert opinion testimony to make this showing and are not required to present empirical proof of actual prior regression.id.at.
and his guardian have offered no evidence that the extended school services received in the summer of were in any way inappropriate or insufficient to meet his needs.they instead make a conclusory statement that the record clearly establishes that was in need of specialized esy instruction during that summer.and his guardian also argue that because the hearing officer found that there was evidence of regression entitling to esy instruction for the summer of and that evidence of regression was cumulative from kindergarten on,ipso facto he was also entitled to esy instruction during the summer of.we reject this argument as inappropriate bootstrapping.
in any event,as noted by the district court,because has already received an award of compensatory education,a further award based on the school district failure to identify as a child with a disability after year would be premature at this point.and his guardian have failed to demonstrate that needed esy instruction instead of the extended school services that he did receive during the summer of in order to benefit from the instruction provided to
