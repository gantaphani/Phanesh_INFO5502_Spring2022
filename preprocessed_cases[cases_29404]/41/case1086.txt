carolyn phillips,the representative of sonya denise phillips estate hereinafter the estate,filed this claim under against various governmental officials,alleging that they were deliberately indifferent to phillips serious medical needs.at issue in this case is whether the district court properly denied qualified immunity to the officials.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the estate,we affirm the denial of qualified immunity to the correctional officers of roane county,duranda tipton,and thomas boduch,reverse the denial of qualified immunity to ken yager,david haggard,gloria wright,and howie rose,and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
sonya phillips died on december,while awaiting trial for the murder of her infant child at the roane county jail,located in kingston,tennessee.examiners determined her cause of death to be,or untreated diabetes.
the events leading up to phillips death began on november,when correctional officers found her unconscious in her cell,not breathing,and with no detectable pulse.before paramedics arrived,phillips had regained consciousness,though fellow inmates observed that phillips continued to walk very slow,and appeared to be very swollen,with her skin color almost purplish.when one of the paramedics,duranda tipton,asked whether phillips should be transported to the emergency room for evaluation,captain fay hall responded that she should be left in the jail if she was not in distress.
over the next two weeks,phillips physical condition continued to deteriorate.nedra forrester,an inmate confined with phillips during this time,explained that she had to clothe and bathe phillips because she could not do these things on her own.forrester also observed that phillips became worse as time went on,and began vomiting more often,and passing out.at some point phillips began vomiting what appeared to be blood.according to melinda shirks,a respiratory therapist detained in the roane county jail at the time of phillips death,phillips appeared very sick and h er breathing sounded horrible,like the type of breathing one does when they are smothering,almost fluid like.concerned about her condition,prison officials removed phillips from her prison cell to a special holding cell for medical evaluation,where phillips continued to complain of chest pains,nausea,constipation,and fatigue.
on november,phillips filed a medical request form stating that she was experiencing chest pains,numbness on the left side of her body,legs,and arms,that she could not stand up over to min utes without getting dizzy,and that she need ed to see a doctor as soon as possible.two days later,on november,thomas boduch,a contract doctor with the roane county jail,gave phillips a brief examination in which he saw her for a total of six minutes.according to boduch,phillips reported that all her previous symptoms had disappeared except for knee pain,for which boduch prescribed ibuprofen.
unsurprisingly,the estate views this interaction quite differently.an inmate who spoke to phillips immediately after the examination testified that boduch just glanced at her and prescribed some pill,and failed to even touch her.the estate also alleges that boduch knew of her collapse on november,but instead of following the protocols that he had been responsible for at the jail,which would have required officials to transport phillips to an emergency room,boduch took no action.
on december,phillips filed another medical request form complaining of nausea,constipat ion,and a possible kidney infection.when boduch appeared for his regularly scheduled weekly visit two days later,phillips was unavailable because she had been transported to a previously scheduled psychiatric appointment.in her absence,boduch reviewed her medical request and prescribed antibiotics and ordered a urinalysis,but failed to follow up with phillips or confirm that the test had been completed.
a few days later,correctional officers again placed phillips in a holding cell for medical observation.when phillips continued to complain of the same,nausea,chest pains,and officers turned off the water in the holding cell so that she could not flush the toilet in order to verify her claims.at no point,however,did officials deem phillips condition sufficiently serious to require medical evaluation.
on the morning of december,officers found phillips lying on her cell floor with blood coming from her mouth,apparently from an injured lip.later that day,at approximately,captain hall contacted ridgeview psychiatric hospital,a facility from which phillips regularly received treatment,to inquire whether phillips was overly medicated,since phillips appeared to be dizzy,lethargic,and nauseated.in response,a doctor at ridgeview directed correctional officers to reduce phillips dosage of zyprexa.at approximately,officers again found phillips unconscious this time they could not revive her.after being transported to the roane county medical center,phillips was pronounced dead.
within twelve days of her death,the estate filed a action against roane county david haggard,the sheriff of roane county and hall,the head correctional officer in roane county,alleging that they were deliberately indifferent to phillips serious medical needs in violation of the fourteenth amendment,and raising several claims.over the course of the next few months,the estate filed amendments to its complaint,adding as defendants ken yager,the roane county executive,the correctional officers in roane county,the ambulance service of roane county asrc,employees of the asrc,and boduch.
the correctional officers,paramedics,governmental supervisors,and governmental employees collectively filed a motion for summary judgment,which asserted a defense of qualified immunity.independently,boduch also filed a motion for summary judgment claiming qualified immunity.
considering each group of defendants independently,the district court denied their motions.the court first found that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the correctional officers,paramedics,and boduch were deliberately indifferent to phillips serious medical condition.estate of phillips ex rel.phillips roane county,wl,at.the court also determined that the correctional officers failure to follow established protocols demonstrated a practice or custom of deliberate indifference to inmates serious medical needs.id.at.
in response to the defendants claim for qualified immunity,the court explained that b ecause determining deliberate indifference to a serious medical need in this context is such a endeavor,summary judgment is improper.in short,where the legal question of qualified immunity turns upon which version of the facts one accepts,the jury,not the judge,must determine liability,and thus summary judgment should not be granted.id.at.the defendants timely appealed the district court denial of qualified immunity.
ii.jurisdiction 
although a denial of summary judgment is generally not a final judgment appealable to this court,parties may appeal a collateral order where the defendant is a public official asserting the defense of qualified immunity,and the issue appealed concerns not which facts the parties might be able to prove,but whether certain alleged facts reflect a violation of clearly established law.hoover radabaugh,cir.but this exception is a narrow one.a denial of a claim of qualified immunity is immediately appealable only if the appeal is premised not on a factual dispute,but rather on neat abstract issues of law.johnson jones,d citation omitted.accordingly,a defendant must essentially concede the most favorable view of the facts to the plaintiff for purposes of the appeal,and limit his argument to questions of law premised on facts taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.berryman rieger,cir.
where qualified immunity is denied due to a lingering question of whether the evidence supports a finding that particular offensive conduct occurred,we would lack appellate jurisdiction because the qualified immunity determination of whether a constitutional violation took place is inextricably linked to the merits of the underlying action.meals city of memphis,cir citing behrens pelletier,d.thus,to the extent that the defendants arguments contest the estate version of the facts,or the inferences drawn from,whether the evidence adequately shows that each defendant knew of and consciously disregarded a serious medical lack jurisdiction to consider those arguments.williams mehra,cir en banc.
iii.analysis 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity de novo.williams,at.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.the moving party bears the burden of proving that there are no genuine issues of material fact.celotex catrett,d.the ultimate inquiry is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
to state a claim under,a plaintiff must set forth facts that,when construed favorably,establish the deprivation of a right secured by the constitution or laws of the united states caused by a person acting under the color of state law.sigley city of parma heights,cir citing west atkins,d.
under the doctrine of qualified immunity,government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.in determining whether the government officials in this case are entitled to qualified immunity,we ask two questions first,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,has the plaintiff has shown that a constitutional violation has occurred second,was the right clearly established at the time of the violation see silberstein city of dayton,cir.
the district court concluded that the first step of the qualified immunity the estate had shown a constitutional the merits of phillips deliberate indifference claims were identical,since both concerned the reasonableness of the correctional officers conduct in light of the circumstances the officers faced.on this basis,the district court found summary judgment based on qualified immunity inappropriate.see phillips,wl,at w here the legal question of qualified immunity turns upon which version of the facts one accepts,the jury,not the judge,must determine liability,and thus summary judgment should not be granted.
but we believe that the district court erred in deferring the qualified immunity analysis to the jury.in so finding,we begin with the presumption that q ualified immunity is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability and like an absolute immunity it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.scott harris,d quoting mitchell forsyth,d.the approach the district court deny summary judgment any time a material issue of fact remains on the deliberate indifference claim could undermine the goal of qualified immunity to avoid excessive disruption of government and permit the resolution of many insubstantial claims on summary judgment.saucier katz,d citing harlow,at.thus,in a suit against government officials for an alleged violation of a constitutional right,the the consider the threshold question of whether the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right.id.at.we review de novo whether those facts as alleged by the estate establish a prima facie case of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs,and whether that right was clearly established.
was there a constitutional violation 
the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment generally provides the basis to assert a claim of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs,but where that claim is asserted on behalf of a detainee,the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment is the proper starting point.city of revere,d t he due process rights of a detainee are at least as great as the eighth amendment protections available to a convicted prisoner.prison officials deliberate indifference violates an inmate rights w hen the indifference is manifested by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care for a serious medical need.estelle gamble,d.
a constitutional claim for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs requires a showing of objective and subjective components.the objective component requires a plaintiff to show the existence of a sufficiently serious medical need.farmer brennan,d.we have previously explained that where a plaintiff claims arise from an injury so obvious that even a layperson would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor attention,it is sufficient to show that he actually experienced the need for medical treatment,and that the need was not addressed within a reasonable time frame.blackmore kalamazoo county,cir citation omitted.in contrast,the subjective component requires a plaintiff to allege facts which,if true,would show that the official being sued subjectively perceived facts from which to infer substantial risk to the prisoner,that he did in fact draw the inference,and that he then disregarded that risk.comstock mccrary,cir citing farmer,at.although the latter,subjective standard is meant to prevent the constitutionalization of medical malpractice claims,a plaintiff need not show that the officer acted with the specific intent to cause harm.id.indeed,deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to a prisoner is the equivalent of recklessly disregarding that risk.id.quoting farmer,at.officials,of course,do not readily admit this subjective component,so it is permissible for reviewing courts to infer from circumstantial evidence that a prison official had the requisite knowledge.id.
objective component 
in the light most favorable to the estate,the facts show that on november,approximately two weeks prior to phillips death,fellow inmates found her unconscious,not breathing,and without a pulse.over the next two weeks,phillips repeatedly complained to prison officials about her deteriorating physical condition,including symptoms of chest pains,numbness on the left side of her body,legs,and arms,dizziness,vomiting,nausea,constipat ion,and a possible kidney infection.one fellow inmate described phillips as extremely sick,and noted that her condition was obvious to normal persons.from this,we conclude that these symptoms show the existence of a sufficiently serious medical condition,which was so obvious that even a layperson would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor attention.blackmore,at citation omitted.
subjective component 
the next issue is whether the facts when viewed in the light most favorable to the estate show that the defendants had subjective knowledge of phillips serious need for medical attention and provided they did,whether the defendants disregarded that need.
a correctional officers defendants 
in the light most favorable to the estate,the facts show that each of the correctional officers knew of phillips condition.first,on november,the day in which fellow inmates found phillips unconscious,officers linda mayes,john mayes,kelly jackson,jesse rittenhouse,fay hall,and duranda tipton were on duty.second,and on that same day,correctional officers placed phillips in a holding cell intended for inmates with serious conditions so that officers could monitor closely the inmates health status.according to prison jail logs,the entire time phillips remained in the holding cell for observation,she continued to exhibit signs of a serious medical condition,including nausea,vomiting of blood,swelling,lethargy,and chest pains.and when an inmate is placed in this type of holding cell,correctional officers must inform the next incoming shift of the reason the inmate had been placed under observation.finally,the record reflects that on november,december,december,and again on december period in which every correctional officer defendant had been on repeatedly complained about shortness of breath and chest pains.in total,we conclude that the estate has sufficiently alleged that each of the officers had been exposed to phillips serious condition at some point between november,the day in which she was found unconscious,and december,the day of her death.see farmer,at.a factfinder may conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was obvious.
the facts also show that the correctional officers possessed a sufficiently culpable state of mind in denying phillips the appropriate medical care.although we have acknowledged that the requisite state of mind entails something more than mere negligence,id.at,the estate does not need to show that the correctional officers acted with the very purpose of causing harm or with knowledge that harm will result,id.in this regard,we find persuasive the correctional officers disregard of prison protocols,which describe the actions that officers should take when an inmate makes certain medical complaints or exhibits certain medical symptoms.most notably,when the inmate complains of chest pain,the protocols require the officers to t ransport the inmate to roane medical center er for evaluation.as we have previously discussed,on multiple separate occasions between november and december,phillips complained of serious symptoms,including chest pains,but at no point did the correctional officers transport her to a hospital emergency room for diagnosis.
moreover,according to the affidavit of forrester,a fellow inmate,phillips was extremely sick,and it was obvious to normal persons.when forrester told some correctional officers that she believed phillips needed medical attention,t hey would not listen,but instead,just walked on by.one eyewitness,patrick cooley,an attorney from kingston,tennessee who was at the jail just hours before phillips was found dead,heard an unidentified correctional officer say to hall,i am trying to give phillips her medicine and she acting like she sick again.according to cooley,t he statement made by the unidentified corrections officer was made in a tone that clearly indicated that such medical problems have been ongoing,and that jail personnel,including the unidentified corrections officer,were deliberately indifferent to the medical treatment of sonya phillips.
given the substantial evidence before the district court that phillips exhibited symptoms over a period,and the correctional officers failure to transport her to a hospital for diagnosis,we conclude that there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate the subjective component of deliberate indifference.the correctional officers may not escape liability if the evidence showed that they merely refused to verify underlying facts that they strongly suspected to be true,or declined to confirm inferences of risk that they strongly suspected to exist.farmer,at.see also estate of carter city of detroit,cir in most cases in which the defendant is alleged to have failed to provide treatment,there is no testimony about what inferences the defendant in fact drew.nonetheless,in those cases,a genuine issue of material fact as to deliberate indifference can be based on a strong showing on the objective component.
the correctional officers argue on appeal that the district court erred by not addressing the subjective component of a deliberate indifference claim as to each individual correctional officer.instead of analyzing the defendants separately,the district court denied summary judgment en masse to all twenty correctional officers and explained that the actions of each defendant jailer are not sufficiently clear,and,are therefore,deemed a question of fact for jury determination.phillips,wl,at.although we agree with the district court ultimate disposition,we disagree in part with its reasoning.in garretson city of madison heights,cir,we recognized that t he subjective component of a deliberate indifference claim must be addressed for each officer individually.where,as here,the district court is faced with multiple defendants asserting qualified immunity defenses,the court should consider whether each individual defendant had a sufficiently culpable state of mind.
that being said,we do not read garretson as prescribing a rule that plaintiffs can not present general allegations to prove that each individual defendant has the requisite knowledge for deliberate indifference.though broad and conclusory accusations should not necessarily be imputed to each individual defendant,here,the estate contends that each individual officer knew of phillips collapse on november and her subsequent complaints of other symptoms,that her deteriorating physical condition two weeks prior to her death was so obvious that no reasonable officer working at the jail could have seen her and not disregarded that risk,and that each individual officer had clear instructions to transport an inmate with such symptoms to an emergency room,but none did so.with those allegations in mind,we conclude that there is sufficient evidence from which a trier of fact could infer that each individual correctional officer had an objective awareness as to the seriousness of phillips ailment,and that their failure to do anything about her ailments amounted to deliberate indifference 
b paramedic defendants 
in the light most favorable to the estate,the facts show that duranda tipton,the paramedic who responded to the incident on november,knew of phillips condition.tipton filed an ambulance report indicating that phillips was found by prison officials to be unresponsive,with no pulse or respiration.although phillips regained consciousness prior to the paramedics arrival,tipton also noted in her report that phillips complained of stiffness in her extremities,chest pain,difficulty in breathing,and nausea after she regained consciousness.in her deposition,tipton also admitted that phillips symptoms were consistent with arrest.
the facts also show that tipton possessed a sufficiently culpable state of mind when denying phillips the appropriate medical care.according to the testimony of robert dukes,medical director of roane medical center,the function of ems is not to examine,diagnose,and treat patients,but instead,to transport patients who need help to the emergency department.as such,when a person is reported to have no pulse,the protocols require paramedics to transport that person to an emergency room for evaluation by a physician.in particular,c hest pain demands an evaluation.in addition to dukes statement,david brent lemonds,a licensed paramedic,stated in his affidavit that the failure to transport phillips,the failure to contact any physician,and the failure to get any response from phillips regarding a refusal to transport all constituted not only negligence,but deliberate indifference.likewise,larry davis,a licensed physician and faculty member of the university of tennessee department of family practice in knoxville,testified that the failure to send phillips to a hospital constituted a violation of written protocols and reflects a callous indifference to the medical needs of the patient.accordingly,because we find that tipton had subjective knowledge of phillips need for medical attention and disregarded that need,we affirm the district court denial of qualified immunity.
nevertheless,we conclude that the district court erred in denying qualified immunity to howie rose,the paramedic called to examine phillips the morning of her death.nothing in the record indicates that rose was informed of phillips cardiac arrest on november,or her complaints of chest pain,nausea,and vomiting.when rose found phillips in her cell,she appeared awake and alert,and answered questions appropriately.rose checked phillips blood pressure,pulse,skin,respiration rate,pupils,and abdomen,which all appeared normal.although rose advised hall to contact a physician,he noted that nothing he found at that moment really alarmed him.all of phillips vital signs were within normal limits and her level of consciousness was awake and alert
