on may,mark hiedeman,the bannock county,idaho prosecuting attorney,filed a felony criminal complaint in the district court of the state of idaho,in and for bannock county against jennie linn mccormack.the complaint charged mccormack with the public offense of unlawful abortion,idaho code,which makes it a felony for any woman to undergo an abortion in a manner not authorized by statute.as a result,mccormack faced the possibility of up to five years imprisonment for allegedly violating idaho code,which specifically targets pregnant women.idaho code.on september,the idaho state district court dismissed the criminal complaint without prejudice.prosecuting attorney hiedeman has not determined whether he will the criminal complaint.
on september,mccormack filed in the district court for the district of idaho a class action lawsuit against the prosecuting attorney,hiedeman.the suit charges,among other things,that idaho code violates various provisions of the united states constitution.the district court issued a preliminary injunction,restraining hiedeman from enforcing idaho code and.hiedeman appeals,arguing that the federal district court erred in determining that mccormack would likely succeed on the merits and the injunction is overbroad.mccormack cross appeals,arguing that the federal district court should have enjoined enforcement of idaho code in conjunction with both and.additionally,mccormack argues that she has standing to challenge the enforcement of chapter,the pain capable unborn child protection act including idaho code.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part and reverse in part the district court grant of a preliminary injunction.
background 
mccormack is a resident of bannock county,idaho.in,mccormack was unmarried,had three children ages,and,and was unemployed.in,mccormack had no source of income other than child support payments which were between and per month.
in the fall of,mccormack was pregnant and sought an abortion.she knew that abortions were not available in southeast idaho.in fact,there are no licensed health care providers offering abortion services in the eight southeastern idaho counties.mccormack knew that abortions are available in salt lake city,utah,but at costs between depending on how far along the pregnancy is but mccormack found out that abortions could be performed in idaho using medications,rather than surgery and that the cost of such medical abortions was significantly less than the cost of a surgical abortion like those offered in salt lake city,utah.she further learned that medications inducing abortions had been approved for use in the and could be purchased over the internet.
in mccormack complaint,she states that she considered terminating her pregnancy by ingesting one or more medications she reasonably believed to have been prescribed by a health care provider practicing outside bannock county,idaho.during the hearing before the district court on mccormack motion for a preliminary injunction,mccormack attorney reiterated that the medications were prescribed by a physician.mccormack attorney stated that mccormack went to a provider over the i nternet.
on may,hiedeman,in his capacity as bannock county prosecuting attorney,filed a criminal complaint in the district court of the state of idaho,in and for bannock county,charging mccormack with the felony of the public offense of unlawful abortion,idaho code.the criminal complaint alleged 
that the said jennie linn mccormack,in the county of bannock,state of idaho,on the day of december,did induce or knowingly aid in the production or performance of an abortion by knowingly submitting to an abortion soliciting of another,for herself,the production of an abortion who purposely terminated her own pregnancy other than by live birth.
a magistrate judge dismissed the criminal complaint without prejudice on september.hiedeman has not determined whether to the criminal complaint.mccormack does not want to have additional children.if she became pregnant,she would seek an abortion again.because there are no providers of medical abortions in southeast idaho,mccormack would need to seek the assistance of providers of abortion services outside of southeast idaho.
this case requires the interpretation of three idaho abortion statutes idaho code,idaho code,and idaho code.we summarize the substance of each statute.
chapter six idaho code 
idaho code makes it a felony,except as permitted by the remainder of title,chapter of the idaho code,for e very woman who knowingly submits to an abortion or solicits of another,for herself,the production of an abortion,or who purposely terminates her own pregnancy otherwise than by a live birth anyone deemed guilty of violating shall be fined not to exceed five thousand dollars imprisoned in the state prison for not less than one and not more than five years.idaho code.
chapter six idaho code 
idaho code,entitled certain abortions permitted conditions and guidelines provides the statutory content for the limitation on the applicability of idaho code.
under,a woman may terminate her pregnancy during the first trimester if the abortion is performed by a physician 
in a hospital or in a physician regular office or a clinic which office or clinic is properly staffed and equipped for the performance of such procedures and respecting which the responsible physician or physicians have made satisfactory arrangements with one or more acute care hospitals within reasonable proximity thereof providing for the prompt availability of hospital care as may be required due to complications or emergencies that might arise.
under,a woman may terminate her pregnancy during the second trimester of pregnancy,but the abortion must be performed in a hospital and must be,in the judgment of the attending physician,in the best medical interest of such pregnant woman.
chapter five,the pain capable unborn child protection act idaho code 
idaho code,or the pain capable unborn child protection act pucpa,categorically bans abortions at and after twenty weeks.any person who intentionally or recklessly performs or attempts to perform an abortion in violation of the provisions of section,idaho code,is guilty of a felony.idaho code.the act further states no penalty shall be assessed against the woman upon whom the abortion is performed or attempted to be performed.id.
the act also provides civil remedies in the form of actual damages to a ny woman upon whom an abortion has been performed in violation of the unborn child protection act or the father of the unborn child idaho code.the act also permits certain persons,including a prosecuting attorney,to file an action for injunctive relief against an abortion provider who violates.idaho code.
procedural history 
on september,mccormack filed her class action complaint against defendant mark hiedeman,in his capacity as bannock county prosecuting attorney.as part of her complaint,she sought declaratory relief,and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.
mccormack simultaneously filed a request for a temporary restraining order under.b.the parties stipulated to the entry of the temporary restraining order,and the district court approved the stipulation on october,consistent with the memorandum decision entered on september.the temporary restraining order expired on october.on november,the district court issued a preliminary injunction that enjoined hiedeman from enforcing idaho code and for those reasons and on those grounds set forth in the memorandum decision and order entered on september.hiedeman filed a timely notice of appeal and mccormack.
in this case,hiedeman asserts that the district court applied the incorrect legal standard for granting a preliminary injunction,and based its decision on clearly erroneous facts.additionally,hiedeman asserts that the preliminary injunction is overbroad to the extent that it grants relief beyond mccormack.in her,mccormack contends that the district court should have enjoined enforcement of idaho code in conjunction with both and.additionally,mccormack asserts that she has standing to challenge the enforcement of chapter,the pain capable unborn child protection act including idaho code.

this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a.
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.am.trucking ass ns,city of los angeles,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an erroneous legal standard or clearly erroneous findings of fact.sierra forest legacy rey,cir citation omitted.application of an incorrect legal standard for preliminary relief or with regard to the underlying issues in the case are grounds for reversal.see earth island inst.forest,cir sports form,united press int l,cir.the district court interpretation of underlying legal principles is subject to de novo review.sw.voter reg.educ.project shelley,cir.
discussion 
i.the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that mccormack would likely succeed with her facial constitutional challenges to idaho code and.
a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that s he is likely to succeed on the merits,that s he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,that the balance of equities tips in her favor,and that an injunction is in the public interest.winter natural resources defense council,d.
this case turns on the first factor whether mccormack established that she was likely to succeed on the merits.hiedeman contends that the district court conclusion concerning the probability of success is based on incorrect legal analysis and unsupported factual determinations.hiedeman is wrong on both counts.
the district court did not employ an erroneous legal standard.
the district court rested its decision to grant the preliminary injunction on the undue burden test set out in planned parenthood casey,d.prosecuting attorney hiedeman does not argue that the district court use of casey is an erroneous legal standard.instead,hiedeman argues that t he rationale for abortion statutes the woman health and safety applies with no less force where the woman rather than another person performs the abortion.thus,he argues that the district court erred in determining that mccormack was likely to succeed on the merits.we disagree.
history of abortion statutes.
historically,laws regulating abortion have sought to further the state interest in protecting the health and welfare of pregnant women,who alone bear the burden and risks of pregnancies.with this interest in mind,abortion statutes were first enacted to protect pregnant females from third parties providing dangerous abortions.see roe wade,d recognizing that,the purpose of abortion laws in the late and early centuries did focus on the state interest in protecting the woman health rather than in preserving the embryo and fetus.abele markle,abortions performed before,even under the best of then known medical practices,created grave risks for the health and life of the mother.there can be no doubt that this was an evil known to and appreciated by the nineteenth century legislators.state ashley,so d,at common law,while a third party could be held criminally liable for causing injury or death to a fetus,the pregnant woman could not be.citing state carey,differentiating between those actions by a third party and those taken upon oneself.
as a result,abortion statutes have traditionally criminalized the behavior of third parties to protect the health of pregnant women.see id.as one court noted 
the obvious purpose of the abortion statute enacted in was to protect the pregnant woman.when one remembers that the passing of the statute predated the advent of antiseptic surgery,the legislature wisdom in making criminal any invasion of the woman person,save when necessary to preserve her life,is unchallengeable.
people nixon,see also gaines wolcott,recognizing that,the appalling,unsanitary and unprofessional conditions under which illegal operations are in fact performed warrant the protection of the law to women.
most modern state criminal statutes continue to apply criminal liability to third parties who perform abortion in a manner not proscribed by the statute.these statutes,known as statutes,impose criminal liability on anyone other than a licensed physician from performing abortions.but many of these same criminal statutes expressly exempt women from criminal liability for obtaining an abortion and do not hold them liable for actions or inactions that affect their pregnancy outcomes when state statutes do not expressly exempt pregnant women,state courts interpreting them have concluded that pregnant women are exempt from criminal prosecution 
b.the supreme court has not authorized the criminal prosecution of women for seeking abortion care.
consistent with this history,there is no supreme court precedent that recognizes or suggests that third party criminal liability may extend to pregnant women who obtain an abortion in a manner inconsistent with state abortion statutes.nevertheless,prosecuting attorney hiedeman asserts that under current precedent provisions in abortion statutes can be applied with equal force to pregnant women who fail to comply with state abortion statutes.he argues that a state has an interest in strict adherence to requirements and need not,as a constitutional matter,carve out an enforcement exception for women who take it upon themselves to.prosecuting attorney hiedeman mistakenly relies on roe,casey,d,connecticut menillo,d per curiam,and mazurek armstrong,d per curiam,to argue that the supreme court has decided this issue,and thus,mccormack is not likely to succeed on her claims.
first,hiedeman asserts that under roe,a state may constitutionally prohibit anyone other than a licensed physician from performing an abortion.in roe,the supreme court recognized that the right to personal privacy under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment is broad enough to encompass a woman decision to have an abortion.at.roe recognized,however,that there are some limitations to this right because that right must be balanced against the state important and legitimate interest in protecting prenatal life and protecting women health.id.at.hiedeman cites the following passage from roe to support his argument that mccormack can be held criminally liable for failing to comply with idaho abortion statutes 
the state has a legitimate interest in seeing to it that abortion,like any other medical procedure,is performed under circumstances that insure maximum safety for the patient.this interest obviously extends at least to the performing physician and his staff,to the facilities involved,to the availability of aftercare,and to adequate provision for any complication or emergency that might arise.
id.at emphasis added.further,hiedeman notes that roe held that t he state may define the term physician to mean only a physician currently licensed by the state,and may proscribe any abortion by a person who is not a physician as so defined.id.at.hiedeman further argues that casey did not disturb this supreme court precedent.at recognizing the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without interference from the state,but noting that,a ll abortion regulations interfere to some degree with a woman ability to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy,thus the constitutionally critical concern is whether the regulations in a real sense deprive women of the ultimate decision.
hiedeman attempt to equate these supreme court principles with the idaho statute at issue in this case is unpersuasive.these principles,embraced by the supreme court,recognize that women health is an important interest for the state and one that is considered in crafting abortion statutes.these principles,however,in no way recognize,permit,or stand for the proposition that a state may prosecute a pregnant woman who seeks an abortion in a manner that may not be authorized by the state statute,including when a pregnant woman receives physicianprescribed medication to terminate her pregnancy.hiedeman reading of roe and casey expands these supreme court holdings to reach an unintended result.
hiedeman reliance on connecticut menillo is equally unpersuasive.in menillo,the supreme court reinstated the conviction of patrick menillo for attempting to procure an abortion.menillo,at.menillo,a nonphysician with no medical training,performed an abortion upon a female in normal good health for a fee.state menillo.a jury found menillo guilty under a connecticut statute,which prescribes that any person who gives or administers to any woman,or advises or causes her to take or use anything,with the intent to procure upon her a miscarriage or abortion,unless the same is necessary to preserve her life or that of her unborn child,shall be fined or imprisoned.menillo,at.the connecticut supreme court overturned menillo conviction,holding that the statute was null and void under federal law.id.at.the supreme court vacated and reinstated menillo conviction.id.the supreme court stated that roe supported the continued enforceablity of criminal abortion statutes against nonphysicians.id.at.the court explained 
roe teaches that a state can not restrict a decision by a woman,with the advice of her physician,to terminate her pregnancy during the first trimester because neither its interest in maternal health nor its interest in the potential life of the fetus is sufficiently great at that stage.but the insufficiency of the state interest in maternal health is predicated upon the first trimester abortion being as safe for the woman as normal childbirth at term,and that predicate holds true only if the abortion is performed by medically competent personnel under conditions insuring maximum safety for the woman even during the first trimester of the pregnancy,therefore,prosecutions for abortions conducted by nonphysicians infringe upon no realm of personal privacy secured by the constitution against state interference.
like roe,menillo also does not discuss the issue presented here whether the state can impose criminal liability on pregnant women for failing to abide by the state abortion statutes.menillo does not uphold the prosecution of pregnant women who undergo abortions in a manner not prescribed by statute.the statute at issue in menillo was directed only against the person who commits or attempts to commit the act on the pregnant woman,it criminalized the actions of a third party a nonphysician.see id.at any person who gives or administers to any woman emphasis added.thus,menillo stands for the unremarkable proposition that states may prosecute unlicensed providers of unsafe,abortions.
prosecuting attorney hiedeman also erroneously relies on the more recent case of mazurek armstrong,d per curiam.the montana statute at issue in mazurek was aimed at stopping a physician assistant,who had legally provided abortion services under the supervision of a physician,from continuing to provide that care.armstrong mazurek,cir.this court,relying on casey,held that the appellants in mazurek had demonstrated a fair chance of success on the merits.id.at.the question before the supreme court in mazurek was whether a state could bar medical professionals other than physicians from providing abortion services.mazurek armstrong,d.mazurek did not involve an attempt to prosecute a woman for seeking a abortion.consequently,like hiedeman reliance on menillo,hiedeman reliance on mazurek is unavailing.
here,idaho code explicitly makes it a felony,for e very woman who knowingly submits to an abortion or solicits of another,for herself,the production of an abortion,or who purposely terminates her own pregnancy otherwise than by live birth in a manner inconsistent with idaho abortion statutes.idaho code,which criminalizes the conduct of pregnant women as opposed to the conduct of a performing the abortion is,as described above,different from any matter the supreme court or this court has considered since roe was handed down.for the reasons explained below,it is likely that mccormack will succeed on the merits because imposes an undue burden on a woman ability to terminate her pregnancy.
c.the district court did not err in determining that mccormack is likely to succeed on the merits.the district court concluded that under casey undue burden test,mccormack established that idaho code places an undue burden on women decision to choose a previability abortion because it subjects women seeking abortions in idaho to criminal prosecution if those women fail to ensure that their abortion providers comply with the requirements of idaho code.we agree with the district court that at this stage,idaho code places an undue burden on women decision to terminate a pregnancy.
although women have a fourteenth amendment right to terminate a pregnancy,that right has some limitations.see casey,at.women challenging an abortion statute must demonstrate that the challenged abortion statute places an undue burden on a woman ability to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy.id.at.a finding of undue burden is a shorthand for the conclusion that a state regulation has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.id.at.
under casey,the challenged idaho abortion statute,constitutes a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.under idaho code,e very woman who knowingly submits to an abortion or solicits of another,for herself,the production of an abortion,or who purposely terminates her own pregnancy otherwise than by a live birth is subject to felony charges,unless the abortion was performed as permitted by the remainder of title,chapter of the idaho code,including idaho code through.a pregnant woman who violates this statute is subject to the possibility of up to five years imprisonment.idaho code.the remainder of chapter details the manner in which a woman in idaho may obtain a lawful abortion 
chapter puts an undue burden on women seeking abortions by requiring them to police their provider compliance with idaho regulations.if a woman terminates her pregnancy during the first trimester but fails to ask the physician whether the office has made satisfactory arrangements with one or more acute care hospitals within reasonable proximity thereof providing for the prompt availability of hospital care as may be required due to complications or emergencies that might arise,she would be subject to a felony charge if the physician has not made such arrangements.idaho code.if a woman finds a doctor who provides abortions during the second trimester of a woman pregnancy,but the doctor fails to tell the pregnant woman that the abortion will be performed in a clinic as opposed to a hospital,the pregnant woman would be subject to felony charges.idaho code.or,as is the case here,if a woman elects to take physician prescribed pills obtained over the internet to end her pregnancy,which is not authorized by statute,she is subject to felony charges.idaho code.
there can be no doubt that requiring women to explore the intricacies of state abortion statutes to ensure that they and their provider act within the idaho abortion statute framework,results in an undue burden on a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus under this idaho statute,a pregnant woman in mccormack position has three options carefully read the idaho abortion statutes to ensure that she and her provider are in compliance with the idaho laws to avoid felony prosecution violate the law either knowingly or unknowingly in an attempt to obtain an abortion or refrain altogether from exercising her right to choose an abortion.
this idaho statute heaps yet another substantial obstacle in the already overburdened path that mccormack and pregnant women like her face when deciding whether to obtain an abortion.for many women,the decision whether to have an abortion is a difficult one involving the consideration of weighty ethical,moral,financial,and other considerations gonzales carhart,d ginsburg,dissenting see also thomas kerenyi et,reasons for delayed abortion results of four hundred interviews,am.of obstetrics gynecology.among other things,women must contemplate whether they are ready for a child or another child,including considering whether that child conforms with plans for future education and career goals.lawrence finer et,reasons women have abortions quantitative and qualitative perspectives,persp.on sexual and reprod.health,noting that a quarter of women cite that they are not ready for a child or another child as one of the most important reasons for not having a child.additionally,women often take into account the perspective of their family members.see aida torres jacqueline forrest,why do women have abortions,fam.plan.persp,concluding that more than percent of women chose to have an abortion at least in part because their husband or partner wanted them to and more than percent of minors were influenced by their parents wishes.
further,mccormack and other women in her position,have to grapple with the cost of the abortion itself as well as the financial implications of not having one.see dep t of,expenditures on children by families,at iv finding that for a,family,annual expenses ranged from to,on average for households with before tax income less than and that the financial cost of having a child generally increase s with the age of the child.because they do not have the financial wherewithal to confirm suspected pregnancies,women are often forced to wait until later in their pregnancies to obtain an abortion.lawrence finer et al,timing of steps and reasons for delays in obtaining abortions in the united states,contraception,hereinafter timing of steps finding l women typically take more time to confirm a suspected pregnancy,which could relate to the cost of a home pregnancy test and the difficulty in getting a test from a clinic or a doctor.see also diana foster et,predictors of delay in each step leading to an abortion,contraception,finding that many women report being delayed by financial factors.delayed confirmation compounds the financial difficulties,as the cost of abortion services increases throughout the gestational period.
many women,like mccormack,must travel long distances to the closest abortion provider.see casey,at this requires a pregnant woman take time to miss work,find childcare,make arrangements for travel to and from the hospital clinic,and to possibly make arrangements to stay overnight to satisfy the hour requirement.see id.at blackmun,j,concurring.in fact,this has been shown to be a significant factor when a woman delays an abortion,and women are more likely to have this problem.timing of steps,at.once at the clinic,pregnant women may have to further manage the harassment and hostility of antiabortion protestors demonstrating outside a clinic.casey,at citation omitted see rachel jones kathryn kooistra,abortion incidence and access to services in the united states,persp.on sexual and reprod.health,finding that of nonhospital providers experienced antiabortion harassment in levels of harassment were particularly high in the midwest and the south.
while the supreme court has permitted many restrictions that make obtaining an abortion more difficult,particularly for women,see casey,at,it has not authorized the criminal prosecution of women seeking abortion care.imposing criminal liability upon women for their providers purported failure to comply with state abortion regulations places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion.accordingly,mccormack is likely to succeed on her claim that chapter constitutes an undue burden on a woman constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy before viability.
the district court did not base its decision on clearly erroneous findings of fact.
a district court factual findings that underlie a preliminary injunction are reviewed for clear error,and may be reversed only if illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.am.trucking assn,city of los angeles,cir quoting united states hinkson,en banc.
prosecuting attorney hiedeman asserts that the district court relied on clearly erroneous findings of fact.specifically,he asserts that the evidence did not establish that mccormack used fda approved medication prescribed by a physician.we disagree.
the district court explained that for mccormack to succeed on the merits of her facial challenge,she must meet the standard in casey demonstrate that the statute presents a substantial obstacle to a woman choice to undergo an abortion.the district court agreed with mccormack that at the early stage in the proceedings,idaho code puts,a woman to the hobson choice sic of finding a means to police her healthcare provider actions,or being threatened with criminal prosecution for her healthcare provider failings.as in this court,hiedeman argued before the district court that the long line of supreme court cases demonstrates that a pregnant woman who undergoes an abortion can be charged with a felony for violating abortion statutes.in addressing hiedeman argument,the district court stated that,mccormack clarified at oral argument that the medication she procured through the internet was prescribed by a physician.emphasis added.the district court reasoned that based on this information,one could argue that the abortion was performed by a physician.the district court explained that u nder these facts,she could be criminally prosecuted if the state determined that the physician had not complied with idaho statutory requirements.in sum,the court concluded that mccormack had demonstrated that she was likely to succeed on the merits of her facial challenge to.emphasis added.the district court findings of fact,namely that mccormack received from a physician medication used to induce an abortion,were not clearly erroneous.these facts were offered in both mccormack declaration and her complaint.mccormack stated in her declaration that the medication was approved for use in the united states and that these medications are currently offered for sale over the internet by abortion providers outside southeast idaho.in her complaint,mccormack stated that physicians providing abortion services in the united states often prescribe medications approved by the federal drug agency fda to cause women to abort their pregnancies medically.she also stated in her complaint that she considered ingesting one or more medications she reasonably believed to have been prescribed by a health care provider practicing outside bannock county,idaho to induce her abortion.there is no disputing that an affidavit and a complaint may be the basis for a preliminary injunction unless the facts are substantially controverted by.see k ski head ski,cir a verified complaint or supporting affidavits may afford the basis for a preliminary injunction.here,prosecuting attorney hiedeman did not offer any controverted affidavits as to whether the pills were obtained from a physician over the internet or whether they were.additionally,the district court merely commented that oral argument provided clarity to the extent that the complaint and affidavit had to be carefully worded because of the potential for mccormack prosecution.
these factual findings can not be said to be clearly erroneous such that the court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment.united states hinkson,cir en banc alaimalo united states,cir to be clearly erroneous,a decision must strike the court as more than just maybe or probably wrong it must,as one member of this court recently stated during oral argument,strike us as wrong with the force of a,unrefrigerated dead fish.
accordingly,we conclude that the district court findings of fact were not clearly erroneous and the court did not abuse its discretion in relying on those findings.
ii.the district court abused its discretion in crafting an overbroad preliminary injunction.
the scope of a preliminary injunction is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion.sec interlink data network of los angeles,cir.
the district court preliminary injunction states that prosecuting attorney hiedeman is restrained from enforcing idaho code and.hiedeman argues that the district court preliminary injunction is overbroad to the extent that it grants relief beyond mccormack herself.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the preliminary injunction is overbroad and should be limited to enforcement of the applicable code sections against mccormack only.
the supreme court has cautioned that injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.califano yamasaki,d.injunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy,winter,at,and must be tailored to remedy the specific harm alleged.park vill.apartment tenants ass mortimer howard trust,cir.a district court abuses its discretion by issuing an overbroad injunction.see also stormans,selecky,cir.moreover,the purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo between the parties pending a resolution of a case on the merits.philips kbc bank,cir.
at least one supreme court decision suggests that federal courts should only enjoin enforcement of criminal statutes against the plaintiffs before the court.in doran salem inn,the court said neither declaratory nor injunctive relief can directly interfere with enforcement of contested statutes or ordinances except with respect to the particular federal plaintiffs,and the state is free to prosecute others who may violate the statute,d.we recently held that a district court abused its discretion in entering an overbroad preliminary injunction that enjoined the rules themselves as opposed to enjoining their enforcement as to the plaintiffs before it.stormans,at.
there is no need for the preliminary injunction in this case to bar enforcement of against anyone except mccormack in order to preserve the status quo between the parties.the fact that mccormack may ultimately be entitled to a declaratory judgment stating that is unconstitutional on its face which would clearly bar prosecution of any pregnant woman under the statute does not mean that the preliminary injunction should apply so broadly,at least in the absence of class certification.
accordingly,we conclude that the district court preliminary injunction should be narrowed so that it enjoins only future prosecution of mccormack.
cross appeal 
in her,mccormack makes two arguments that the district court should have enjoined enforcement of idaho code in conjunction with both and and that she has standing to challenge the enforcement of chapter,the pain capable unborn child protection act pucpa.
iii.the district court erred in not enjoining the enforcement of idaho code in conjunction with both and.
in her,mccormack contends that the district court should have enjoined enforcement of idaho code in conjunction with both and.in granting mccormack motion for a preliminary injunction,the district court limited the injunction to,which is the code section governing abortions during the first trimester of pregnancy.the district court refused to extend the preliminary injunction to cover,which is the code section governing abortions during the second trimester of pregnancy.in its order granting the preliminary injunction,the court stated that it relied on those reasons set forth in the court september,memorandum.in its september,memorandum decision,the district court held that mccormack potential punishment for violating idaho code did not extend to all challenged subsections.the district court found that b ased on the facts alleged,there can be no argument that mccormack violated either or.thus,the court found that mccormack does not face any threat of prosecution under these subsections.accordingly,the court found that there was not a case or controversy as to or.
mccormack alleges that the district court erred because the basis for the district court injunction against enforcement of idaho code applies with equal force to.she notes that the criminal complaint fails to cite which statute either or hiedeman was charging mccormack under,in connection with.further,the criminal complaint makes no reference to the trimester of mccormack pregnancy at the time of the alleged abortion.thus,the threat she faced and still faces based on hiedeman affidavit that he has not yet determined whether to the criminal action was that she would be prosecuted for violating either subsection of the statute.for the reasons set forth below,we agree with mccormack that the district court erred in failing to extend the preliminary injunction to because mccormack faces a genuine threat of prosecution under this subsection of the statute.
this court has recognized that neither the mere existence of a proscriptive statute nor a generalized threat of prosecution satisfies the case or controversy requirement.thomas anchorage equal rights comm n,cir en banc.rather,a plaintiff must face a genuine threat of prosecution.id.in evaluating the genuineness of a claimed threat of prosecution,courts examine three factors whether the plaintiffs have articulated a concrete plan to violate the law in question,whether the prosecuting authorities have communicated a specific warning or threat to initiate proceedings,and the history of past prosecution or enforcement under the challenged statute.see also babbitt united farm workers union,d holding that,w hen contesting the constitutionality of a criminal statute,it is not necessary that the plaintiff first expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge the statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights.citation and alterations omitted 
applying these principles here,mccormack faced prosecution and continues to be threatened with prosecution as a result of her alleged violation of idaho code,in conjunction with either or.first,mccormack has allegedly already violated idaho code,which makes it a felony to obtain an abortion in a manner not authorized by the idaho abortion statutes.there is no question that prosecuting attorney hiedeman filed felony charges against mccormack for allegedly violating idaho code.but,the criminal complaint fails to specify whether in conjunction with hiedeman brought charges under,regulating abortions during the first trimester,or,regulating abortions during the second trimester.further,there is nothing in the criminal complaint that states the gestional age of the fetus or the trimester that mccormack was in when the alleged abortion occurred.it is also undisputed that the state court dismissed these charges without prejudice and hiedeman has not decided whether to the charges against mccormack.
thus,mccormack is susceptible to hiedeman recommencing the criminal charges against mccormack under in conjunction with either or.second,hiedeman,in his capacity as county prosecutor,has communicated a specific threat on two occasions to bring felony charges against mccormack,when he actually brought a criminal complaint against mccormack,and filed a declaration stating that he may still the complaint.finally,this history of past prosecution,in the form of an actual criminal complaint being filed against mccormack under idaho code,weighs in favor of a preliminary injunction for mccormack with regard to in conjunction with both and.
thus the possibility exists that hiedeman was going to and may still bring criminal charges against mccormack based on her alleged violation of either or accordingly,we conclude that the district court erred in failing to extend the preliminary injunction to in conjunction with.
iv.mccormack does not have standing to seek preenforcement prospective relief against the enforcement of the pucpa.
in her,mccormack also argues that she has standing to challenge the enforcement of chapter,the pucpa.pucpa categorically bans abortions at and after twenty weeks.any person who intentionally or recklessly performs or attempts to perform an abortion in violation of the provisions of section,idaho code,is guilty of a felony.idaho code.pucpa further states no penalty shall be assessed against the woman upon whom the abortion is performed or attempted to be performed.id.pucpa also provides civil remedies in the form of actual damages to a ny woman upon whom an abortion has been performed in violation of the pucpa or the father of the unborn child.idaho code.pucpa further permits certain persons,including a prosecuting attorney,to file an action for injunctive relief against an abortion pro
