brian self suffered permanent heart damage from a medical condition that worsened while a prisoner in the denver county jail.self sued the prison treating physician,peter crum,for deliberate indifference to his medical needs in violation of the eighth amendment.self appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of crum.we agree with the district court that self did not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether crum either knew about and failed to treat self condition or otherwise consciously disregarded self medical needs.
having jurisdiction under,we therefore affirm.
background 
police in denver,colorado arrested brian self on monday,february,and took him to the denver city jail.that night,self complained of fever,aches,chills,cough,shortness of breath,as well as redness and swelling in his left calf.a prison nurse saw self the next day.self attributed his symptoms to a possible bite by a brown recluse spider,which he believed happened prior to his arrest.
on wednesday,march,self was transferred to the denver county jail,where a second nurse examined him at intake.the nurse noted self various symptoms,including the claim of a spider bite,and referred him to peter crum,a contract physician assigned to the jail.that same day,crum performed a focused examination,a examination limited to the likely source of the problem.suspecting a respiratory tract infection,he examined only self ears,nose,throat,and lymph nodes,but did not listen to self heart.based on this examination as well as self vital signs,crum prescribed aspirin and cough medication to alleviate his fever and cough.he also ordered self to remain in the infirmary for continued observation.because self symptoms were not particularly specific,crum could not diagnose a cause of the symptoms other than to exclude the spider bite.that evening,self fever responded to the aspirin,falling from to.
crum again examined self on friday,march.self symptoms persisted,so crum continued with the same course of treatment,ordering self to remain in the infirmary over the weekend.in addition,he ordered lab work on self blood and urine,instructed the nursing staff to check self vital signs every eight hours,and scheduled time to self on monday at which time the lab work would be available.
over the weekend,self condition did not improve.an physician,who examined self over the weekend,suggested he see crum on monday.on monday,march,crum reviewed self file,noting for the first time self history of cocaine use,and again examined self.although the lab results were not yet available,crum listened to self lungs.after hearing what he thought was evidence of pneumonia,crum prescribed an antibiotic and sent self to the hospital for and,if necessary,emergency treatment.self objected to an emergency room referral,but was admonished that if he did not improve by the morning he would again be asked to visit the emergency room.
the hospital staff diagnosed self with a pronounced heart murmur and a possible bacterial infection of the heart,later identified as endocarditis the hospital initially treated self with antibiotics,but eventually concluded that surgery was necessary.on march,self was transferred to another hospital for repair of his aortic valve.during surgery,doctors determined they needed to implant a pacemaker.according to self,the surgeons stated that had the endocarditis been caught earlier,the damage to his heart might have been less severe and,consequently,surgery might have been avoided.
self filed a complaint against crum for acting with deliberate indifference towards his medical needs in violation of the eighth amendment and.after self filed his complaint and discovery had been conducted,crum filed for summary judgment arguing no genuine issue of disputed fact existed as to whether crum acted with deliberate indifference in the face of self symptoms.
the magistrate judge recommended denying the motion because she found a disputed issue of material fact as to crum state of mind when he failed to properly diagnose self medical condition.the district court,however,rejected the magistrate judge recommendation.the court found no disputed issue of fact,noting the record did not allow an inference that crum knew or reasonably believed self suffered from endocarditis,or crum deliberately disregarded information which would have led to the discovery of self actual condition.
ii.standard of review 
summary judgment is appropriate in cases where the record discloses no genuine issue as to any material fact.c.in a deliberate indifference case under the eighth amendment,we look at the factual record and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the record in the light most favorable to the party.sealock colorado,cir.the plaintiff must go beyond the pleadings and designate specific facts so as to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case in order to survive summary judgment.id.to defeat a motion for summary judgment,evidence,including testimony,must be based on more than mere speculation,conjecture,or surmise.bones honeywell int l,cir.unsubstantiated allegations carry no probative weight in summary judgment proceedings.phillips calhoun,cir accord annett of,cir noting that unsupported conclusory allegations do not create a genuine issue of fact internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
iii.discussion 
legal framework 
the supreme court first recognized claims for deliberate indifference to a prisoner medical needs in estelle gamble,d.the court held that prison officials violate the eighth amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment if their deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.id.at.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.to prevail on a claim under,however,inadvertent failure to provide adequate medical care is not enough,nor does a complaint that a physician has been negligent in diagnosing or treating a medical condition state a valid claim of medical mistreatment under the eighth amendment.id.at.rather,a prisoner must allege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.id.at.
the supreme court clarified the standards applicable to deliberate indifference claims in farmer brennan,d.in farmer,the court set forth a inquiry,comprised of an objective and subjective component.under the objective inquiry,the alleged deprivation must be sufficiently serious to constitute a deprivation of constitutional dimension.id.at.in addition,under the subjective inquiry,the prison official must have a sufficiently culpable state of mind.id.
in describing the subjective component,the court made clear a prison official can not be liable unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,and he must also draw the inference.id.at.the subjective component is akin to recklessness in the criminal law,where,to act recklessly,a person must consciously disregard a substantial risk of serious harm.id.at.quoting model penal code e.and w hether a prison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk is a question of fact subject to demonstration in the usual ways,including inference from circumstantial evidence.id.at.the fact that a serious medical need was obvious could be evidence of deliberate indifference,although a prison official may show that the obvious escaped him and avoid liability.id.at.see id.at.
our circuit has recently examined deliberate indifference claims involving medical treatment in several contexts.in sealock colorado,cir,for example,we recognized two types of conduct which may constitute deliberate indifference in a prison medical case a medical professional failing to treat a serious medical condition properly and a prison official preventing an inmate from receiving medical treatment or denying access to medical personnel capable of evaluating the inmate condition.id.at.in sealock,we concluded that the subjective component was not met where a prison nurse misdiagnosed an inmate chest pains as the flu,and failed to recognize symptoms suggesting an impending heart attack.id.at.those facts indicated at best,we noted,negligent diagnosis or treatment.id.at.we also concluded the subjective component might be met where a physician assistant failed to summon an ambulance despite candidly admitting that,had he known about the inmate chest pains,he would have done so.id.at.in that instance,we found disputed evidence as to the assistant actual knowledge concerning the inmate chest pains in other words,the facts supported an inference he knew about the chest pains yet intentionally disregarded his practice of summoning an ambulance.id.
a second recent case also involved a claim of inadequate medical care.in oxendine kaplan,cir,we observed that a prisoner who merely disagrees with a diagnosis or a prescribed course of treatment does not state a constitutional violation,id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted,absent evidence the prison official knew about and disregarded a substantial risk of harm to the prisoner health or safety.id.at.in oxendine,the prison doctor repaired a severed finger but failed to diagnose the onset of gangrene.in finding the evidence sufficient to satisfy the subjective component and defeat a summary judgment motion,we noted the obviousness of the problem the repaired tissue appeared black and was disintegrating,the inmate repeatedly informed the doctor that his finger was not healing,and the doctor himself recognized and noted these symptoms but ignored them.id.at.the court observed that given the obviousness of the inmate condition,it was clear the case involved more than a mere disagreement between the parties.id.at.we therefore allowed further discovery as to the doctor subjective state of mind in delaying both additional medical care and referral to a specialist.
finally,in mata saiz,cir,we held that a prison health official who serves solely as a gatekeeper for other medical personnel capable of treating the condition may be held liable under the deliberate indifference standard if she delays or refuses to fulfill that gatekeeper role.id.at quoting sealock,at.we reiterated that the subjective component presents a high evidentiary hurdle to the plaintiffs a prison official must know about and disregard a substantial risk of serious harm.id.at.in applying these principles,we allowed a claim against a nurse who knew the inmate was suffering from severe chest pains yet completely refused to assess or diagnose the potential cardiac emergency in violation of prison medical protocols.id.at see id.at.however,we denied a claim against a different nurse who established a good faith effort to diagnose and treat the inmate medical condition despite failing to diagnose a heart attack.id.at see id.at.
these cases show that the subjective component is not satisfied,absent an extraordinary degree of neglect,where a doctor merely exercises his considered medical judgment.matters that traditionally fall within the scope of medical judgment are such decisions as whether to consult a specialist or undertake additional medical testing.see,ledoux davies,cir noting that types of medication prescribed and referrals to specialists are generally matters of medical judgment.the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment is not violated when a doctor simply resolves the question whether additional diagnostic techniques or forms of treatment is indicated.estelle,at.
a claim is therefore actionable only in cases where the need for additional treatment or referral to a medical specialist is obvious.and obviousness in the circumstances of a missed diagnosis or delayed referral,while not subject to a precise formulation,requires direct or circumstantial evidence that can arise in several different contexts a medical professional recognizes an inability to treat the patient due to the seriousness of the condition and his corresponding lack of expertise but nevertheless declines or unnecessarily delays referral,a family doctor knows that the patient needs delicate hand surgery requiring a specialist but instead of issuing the referral performs the operation himself see,oxendine,at a medical professional fails to treat a medical condition so obvious that even a layman would recognize the condition,a gangrenous hand or a serious laceration see and a medical professional completely denies care although presented with recognizable symptoms which potentially create a medical emergency,a patient complains of chest pains and the prison official,knowing that medical protocol requires referral or minimal diagnostic testing to confirm the symptoms,sends the inmate back to his cell.see,mata,at sealock,at.
this is not to say that a plaintiff faces insurmountable obstacles in showing subjective indifference.if a prison doctor,for example,responds to an obvious risk with treatment that is patently unreasonable,a jury may infer conscious disregard.for that reason,the doctor in oxendine could be liable for failure to treat a gangrenous finger or the physician assistant in sealock could be liable for failure to summon an ambulance.but where a doctor orders treatment consistent with the symptoms presented and then continues to monitor the patient condition,an inference of deliberate indifference is unwarranted under our case law.
in the end,the negligent failure to provide adequate medical care,even one constituting medical malpractice,does not give rise to a constitutional violation.perkins.dep t of corrections,cir.so long as a medical professional provides a level of care consistent with the symptoms presented by the inmate,absent evidence of actual knowledge or recklessness,the requisite state of mind can not be met.indeed,our subjective inquiry is limited to consideration of the doctor knowledge at the time he prescribed treatment for the symptoms presented,not to the ultimate treatment necessary.see mata,at opining that the symptoms presented at the time the physician has contact with the patient is relevant to the subjective inquiry only objective seriousness is based on the ultimate harm presented.
application 
applying these standards,we consider whether self presented sufficient evidence of both the objective and subjective components of his deliberate indifference claim to create a genuine issue of material fact.in particular,self must surmount two obstacles to avoid summary judgment a showing of the objective seriousness of the medical risk he faced,endocarditis and a showing of crum culpable state of mind.the latter may be demonstrated by a showing of either crum a conscious disregard of a substantial risk of serious harm arising from self symptoms,or b actual knowledge of self heart condition and refusal to order further treatment.
neither party disputes the objective component has been met here.the only question,then,is whether a reasonable jury could find either crum conscious disregard or actual knowledge of self serious medical needs.we discuss each allegation in turn and,in each instance,conclude a jury could not find the requisite state of mind.
conscious disregard 
while crum readily admits endocarditis is an objectively serious condition,he denies that he consciously disregarded a substantial risk of harm arising from that condition.he contends,therefore,the district court grant of summary judgment was correct.self argues,in rebuttal,that he should survive summary judgment because crum failed to take sufficient steps either to diagnose or else to treat that substantial risk of harm.appellant br.at.put another way,self suggests that a competent doctor looking at self symptoms would have known that endocarditis was possible and taken additional steps to confirm such a diagnosis.
the difficulty with self argument,however,is that it removes the subjective inquiry from the deliberate indifference test.as farmer brennan and our cases interpreting farmer have made clear,a purely objective test for deliberate indifference is simply incompatible with the tenets of the eighth amendment.farmer,at.see mata,at noting that the test for d
