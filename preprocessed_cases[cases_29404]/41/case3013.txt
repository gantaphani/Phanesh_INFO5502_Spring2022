this is a patent infringement case.innovasystems,innova appeals from the final judgment of the united states district court for the district of massachusetts that it infringed claims and of united states patent the patent owned by proveris scientific corporation proveris.proveris scientific innovasystems.may.on appeal,innova argues that the district court erred in ruling that the safe harbor provision of the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of,known as the act,stat,codified at,and,does not immunize its accused activity from infringement of the patent.innova also argues that the district court erred in entering judgment as a matter of law jmol i that it infringed claims and of the patent and ii in favor of proveris on innova affirmative defenses that claims,and are invalid by reason of obviousness and that claims and and are invalid as anticipated by a single prior art reference.because we conclude that innova is not entitled to the protection of the act safe harbor provision,and that the district court did not err in granting jmol in favor of proveris on infringement and on innova affirmative defenses,we affirm.
background 
the patent is directed to a system and apparatus for characterizing aerosol sprays commonly used in various drug delivery devices,such as nasal spray pumps and inhalers.patent.during drug research and development,spray characterization measurements are frequently used to calibrate drug delivery devices in accordance with the exact physical properties of a particular drug,in order to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of drug delivery.patent.according to the patent,spray characterization also plays an important role in the regulatory approval process of the food and drug administration fda under the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,ch,stat.codified at scattered sections of title of the united states code.under the fdca,fda approval is required for drug delivery devices.patent.the system and apparatus claimed in the patent are not themselves subject to fda approval,however.
figure of the patent depicts an embodiment of the claimed invention.figure shows a spray data acquisition system which allows researchers to study and optimize the delivery of various drugs.the system operates through the action of a pumping device which generates an aerosol spray plume with a spray axis sa whose spray characteristic data is collected by an illumination device and imaging device.
the patent has thirteen claims.claims and are independent claims.claims,and are system claims,while claims are apparatus claims.claim is representative.it provides as follows 
a spray data acquisition system comprising 
a housing for supporting a pumping device whereby the pumping device is responsive to an applied force to generate an aerosol spray plume through an exit port thereon along a spray axis 
a spray pump actuator,wherein the spray pump actuator is capable of controlling a pumping force and a duration of the aerosol spray plume of the pumping device 
an illumination device for illuminating the aerosol spray plume along at least one geometric plane that intersects the aerosol spray plume and,
an imaging device for acquiring data representative of a first interaction between the illumination and the aerosol spray plume along the at least one geometric plane.
innova makes and sells a device known as the optical spray analyzer osa.the osa itself is not subject to fda approval.it is,however,used in connection with fda regulatory submissions.in that setting,the device measures the physical parameters of aerosol sprays used in nasal spray drug delivery devices.
in december of,proveris filed suit against innova in the district of massachusetts,alleging infringement of claims and of the patent.as part of its defense,innova invoked the safe harbor provision of the act.the safe harbor provision is codified at e,which states in relevant part 
it shall not be an act of infringement to make,use,offer to sell,or sell within the united states or import into the united states a patented invention solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a federal law which regulates the manufacture,use,or sale of drugs or veterinary biological products.
innova argued that its allegedly infringing activities are immunized by this provision because its osa devices are used by third parties solely for the development and submission of information to the fda.
in due course,both parties moved for summary judgment on the section e issue.after initially denying both motions,the district court asked the parties to brief further the question of what standard should be applied when considering innova safe harbor defense.after reviewing these submissions,and shortly before trial,the court ruled as a matter of law that section e does not immunize innova osa devices from infringement of the patent.the court stated from the bench,also i reflected at some length on this safe harbor.as a matter of law,that out.
at trial,the district court granted jmol in favor of proveris with respect to infringement of claims and of the patent.thus,as to claims and,the court informed the jury that there was n o dispute about infringement as to those claims.at trial,the district court also excluded certain expert testimony proffered by innova relating to its affirmative defenses that claims,and of the patent are invalid by reason of obviousness and that claims and and of the patent are invalid as anticipated by a single prior art reference.as a result,the court granted jmol in favor of proveris on innova invalidity defenses.following trial,the jury found claims and of the patent not infringed,and awarded no damages for infringement of claims and.thereafter,the district court entered final judgment of infringement and issued a permanent injunction barring innova from infringement of the patent.innova then filed this timely appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
on appeal,innova contends that the district court erred in ruling as a matter of law that section e does not immunize it from infringement of the patent,in granting jmol of infringement of claims and,and in granting jmol in favor of proveris on its affirmative defenses that the asserted claims of the patent were invalid by reason of anticipation and obviousness.we address innova contentions in turn.
innova first argument on appeal is that the district court erred in ruling as a matter of law that its manufacture and sale of the osa device are not immunized by the safe harbor provision of e.since the pertinent facts are not in dispute,this argument presents a question of statutory interpretation,an issue of law that we review de novo.romero united states.
congress enacted the act in order to eliminate two unintended distortions of the effective patent term resulting from the premarket approval required for certain products by the fdca 
the first distortion was the reduction of effective patent life caused by fda premarket approval.because patent applications were filed early in the regulatory process,but market entry was delayed pending regulatory review,the early years of the patent term were spent obtaining premarket approval for the patented invention rather than generating profits.eli lilly medtronic,d.
the second distortion was the de facto extension of effective patent life at the end of the patent term,which also resulted from fda premarket approval requirements.prior to the act,competitors activities involving a patented invention during the patent term constituted an act of infringement,even if undertaken for the sole purpose of obtaining fda regulatory approval.see roche,bolar pharm,cert.denied,d.because such activities could not begin until patent expiration,patent owners enjoyed a de facto patent term extension while competitors spent time following patent expiration obtaining fda premarket approval necessary for market entry.eli lilly,at.
the act sought to eliminate these distortions via two key provisions,now codified at and e.the first provision,section,sought to eliminate de facto patent term reduction by providing patent term extension for those patents claiming a product subject to regulatory delays caused by the fda premarket approval process for purposes of section,the term product means a drug product and a ny medical device,food additive,or color additive subject to regulation under the fdca.f.
the second provision,section e,sought to eliminate de facto patent term extension.it sought to do so by providing a safe harbor that immunized competitors from infringement on account of making,using,offering to sell,or selling within the united states or importing into the united states a patented invention solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a federal law which regulates the manufacture,use,or sale of drugs or veterinary biological products.e.the basic idea behind this provision was to allow competitors to begin the regulatory approval process while the patent was still in force,followed by market entry immediately upon patent expiration.thus,in telectronics pacing systems ventritex,we pointed out that,as a result of section e,a competitor who anticipates coming into the marketplace with a product that utilizes a currently patented invention may make,use,and sell that product so long as it is solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a federal law which regulates the manufacture,use,or sale of drugs.id.at.
for purposes of this case,the critical terms in e are patented invention and reasonably related.in eli lilly,the supreme court addressed the issue of whether a patented cardiac defibrillator fell within the section e safe harbor.at.in that case,eli lilly lilly filed an action against medtronic,medtronic in federal district court in pennsylvania,seeking to enjoin medtronic from testing and marketing an implantable cardiac defibrillator.lilly claimed that medtronic actions infringed two of its patents.medtronic defended against the suit on the ground that its activities were reasonably related to the development and submission of information under the fdca,and thus exempt from a finding of infringement under section e.id.at.the district court rejected medtronic argument,concluding that the exemption did not apply to the development and submission of information relating to medical devices.following a jury trial,the jury returned a verdict for lilly on infringement of the first patent.after the district court directed a verdict for lilly on infringement of the second patent,it entered judgment for lilly and issued a permanent injunction against infringement of both patents.id.on appeal,this court reversed,holding that by virtue of section e,medtronic activities could not constitute infringement if they were undertaken to develop information reasonably related to the development and submission of information necessary to obtain regulatory approval under the fdca.the court remanded to the district court for a determination of whether that condition had been met.id.
the supreme court granted certiorari.the question before the court was whether the scope of the section e safe harbor was limited to drugs,or also extended to medical devices,such as medtronic defibrillator.the court held that medical devices were covered.it thus affirmed the decision of the federal circuit.after analyzing the language of section e,the court confirmed the federal circuit interpretation of the statute based upon the structure of the act taken as a whole.at.after reviewing the dual distortions noted above that led to the act,the court stated 
it seems most implausible to us that congress,being demonstrably aware of the dual distorting effects of regulatory approval requirements in this entire distorting effects that were roughly offsetting,the disadvantage at the beginning of the term producing a more or less corresponding advantage at the end of the choose to address both those distortions only for drug products and for other products named in f should enact provisions which not only leave in place an anticompetitive restriction at the end of the monopoly term but simultaneously expand the monopoly term itself,thereby not only failing to eliminate but positively aggravating distortion of the patent protection.it would take strong evidence to persuade us that this is what congress wrought,and there is no such evidence here.
id.at.continuing,the court stated that,a part from the reason of the matter,there were textual indications that sections and e were meant generally to be complementary.id.at.
the court noted that interpreting the phrase patented invention in section e to include all products listed in section f produced a perfect product fit between the two provisions.id.at.the court pointed out that all of the products eligible for patent term extension under section drugs,medical devices,food additives,and color subject to fda premarket approval.id.conversely,all products subject to premarket approval that were not eligible for patent term extension under section f such as new animal drugs and veterinary biological excluded from the section e safe harbor provision as well id.at.because of this nearly perfect product correlation between sections and e,and the roughly offsetting patent term distortions those two provisions were designed to address,the court essentially interpreted section e to include at least all inventions within the ambit of section.see id.at.
in abtox,exitron,we applied the reasoning of the supreme court in eli lilly.after being sued for patent infringement,abtox,abtox alleged in a counterclaim that exitron corporation and mdt corporation defendants infringed its patent the patent.the patent claimed a medical device used in sterilizing medical instruments.abtox,at.defendants moved for summary judgment of noninfringement,claiming that their use of the invention claimed in the patent in pursuit of fda approval for a plasma sterilizer was covered by the safe harbor provision of section e.id.at.after the district court granted the motion,abtox appealed.
the patented medical device in abtox presented an issue not confronted in eli lilly,due to the varying levels of fda regulation for different medical devices.we observed that although all three categories of medical devices,classes i,ii,and iii,are subject to varying levels of fda premarket approval,only class iii medical devices are eligible for patent term extension under section.id.at.both abtox invention and defendants products were class ii medical devices,ineligible for patent term extension,unlike the eligible class iii medical device in eli lilly.faced with a tension between the supreme court broader holding in eli lilly that patented invention means all inventions within section,and the court narrower focus on statutory symmetry between the two provisions,we adopted the broader holding that the phrase patented invention of section e includes any medical device,regardless of its eligibility for patent term extension under section.id.
precedent also has addressed which activities are sufficiently reasonably related to fda approval for purposes of section e.in telectronics,we held that demonstrating an implantable defibrillator at medical conferences was reasonably related to fda approval because it facilitated the selection of clinical trial investigators.at.most recently,in merck kgaa integra lifesciences i,d,the supreme court interpreted reasonably related in determining whether section e immunizes the use of patented inventions in preclinical research if the experimental results are never submitted to the fda,id.at.in merck,patented compounds were used in preclinical studies to identify and evaluate drugs useful for inhibiting angiogenesis.id.at.the court held that reasonably related activity does not require actual submission of information to the fda it also includes those situations in which a party has a reasonable basis for believing that a patented compound may work,through a particular biological process,to produce a particular physiological effect,and uses the compound in research that,if successful,would be appropriate to include in a submission to the fda id.at.on remand,we held that the preclinical research in que
