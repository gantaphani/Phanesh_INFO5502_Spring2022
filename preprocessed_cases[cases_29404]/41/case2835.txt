judicial watch filed an action in the district court for the district of columbia,seeking enforcement of its freedom of information act foia request for all documents related to the food and drug administration fda approval of the drug mifepristone.it now appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the fda.although we affirm the district court decision in a number of respects,because the fda produced an inadequately detailed vaughn index,we remand for further explanation of some of the index entries.
background 
in september,the fda approved the drug mifepristone,better known as,for medical abortion during the first days of pregnancy.shortly thereafter,judicial watch submitted a foia request seeking all documents in the fda possession.a few months later,having not received any documents,judicial watch sought to enforce its request in the district court.the fda requested a stay,which the district court granted.the district court ordered the fda to produce all responsive documents by october.
after searching about pages of information,the fda disclosed over relevant pages to judicial watch on a compact disc.it withheld over other relevant documents in their entirety and parts of almost more.the fda compiled and produced a vaughn index to summarize the withholdings.see vaughn rosen.in addition to its vaughn index,the fda filed a supporting declaration by andrea masciale,who supervised the fda search and review of documents for judicial watch foia request.the masciale declaration described the types of withheld information and defended the application of foia exemptions,and to that information.danco laboratories and population creator and manufacturer,in the suit and filed two additional affidavits.the intervenors affidavits supported the fda reasons for using exemptions and to withhold information submitted to it during mifepristone approval.
the fda moved for summary judgment.judicial watch opposed the motion claiming the fda performed an inadequate search,filed an inadequately detailed vaughn index,and invoked several foia exemptions improperly.the district court granted summary judgment for the fda as to all matters.judicial watch now appeals the district court judgment as to the adequacy of the fda vaughn index and the exemptions.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.powell.
ii.adequacy of the vaughn index 
judicial watch primarily argues that the fda has produced an inadequately detailed vaughn index.in this section,we challenge in its broadest sense,as a facial attack on the structure of the vaughn index.although we find nothing structurally wrong with the fda submission,we find merit in the narrower part of judicial watch adequacy argument,specifically that the fda has vaguely described some individual documents.we defer discussion of the vagueness inquiries until section iii and its subsections dealing with each individual foia exemption at issue.
we also note at the outset that at oral argument judicial watch appeared to concede the untenable position of its challenge to the adequacy of detail regarding documents only partially withheld.the fda we the released portion of each document satisfied its vaughn burden by supplementing the corresponding vaughn index entries.the released content of the documents served to illuminate the nature of the redacted material,often limited to names or addresses.therefore,we find that the vaughn index adequately described the partially withheld documents.as with the vagueness questions,we reserve until section iii our discussion of the merits of the fda decision to redact certain documents.
functions of the vaughn index requirement 
because of its unique evidentiary configuration,the typical foia case distorts the traditional adversary nature of our legal system form of dispute resolution.king dep t of justice,quoting vaughn,at.when a party submits a foia request,it faces an asymmetrical distribution of knowledge where the agency alone possesses,reviews,discloses,and withholds the subject matter of the request.id.the agency would therefore have a nearly impregnable defensive position save for the fact that the statute places the burden on the agency to sustain its action.a b see also coastal states gas dep t of energy,t he burden is on the agency to establish its right to withhold information from the public.
possessing both the burden of proof and all the evidence,the agency has the difficult obligation to justify its actions without compromising its original withholdings by disclosing too much information.the vaughn index provides a way for the defending agency to do just that.by allowing the agency to provide descriptions of withheld documents,the index gives the court and the challenging party a measure of access without exposing the withheld information.the vaughn index thereby also serves three important functions that help restore a healthy adversarial process 
i t forces the government to analyze carefully any material withheld,it enables the trial court to fulfill its duty of ruling on the applicability of the exemption,and it enables the adversary system to operate by giving the requester as much information as possible,on the basis of which he can present his case to the trial court.

as past cases demonstrate,we focus on the functions of the vaughn index,not the length of the document descriptions,as the touchstone of our analysis.see,tax analysts irs,approving of vaughn index with short descriptions because a combination of declarations and in camera review provided sufficient information for the court to review the claimed exemptions coastal states gas,at finding index with short descriptions inadequate because the supporting affidavits made conclusory assertions of privilege.indeed,an agency may even submit other measures in combination with or in lieu of the index itself.keys,at i t is the function,not the form,of the index that is important.among other things,the agency may submit supporting affidavits or seek in camera review of some or all of the documents so long as they give the reviewing court a reasonable basis to evaluate the claim of privilege.gallant nlrb,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.any measure will adequately aid a court if it provide s a relatively detailed justification,specifically identif ies the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlat es those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.mead data,dep t of air force.
b.the structure of the fda index 
in this case,the fda took a combined approach.in response to judicial watch foia request,it produced a vaughn index and supplemented the index with the supporting declaration of andrea masciale.the index itself includes eleven categories,consisting of the following an index identification number the document subject its date the author the recipient the total number of pages a category entitled attach page the disposition that is,whether entirely or partially withheld the reason for being withheld the statutory authority for the withholding and the number of pages containing withheld information.whereas the index takes a approach,the masciale declaration steps through the claimed exemptions.it avoids discussion of individual documents,instead describing the kinds of information withheld and how they relate to the exemptions.the intervenors filed two additional affidavits.each covers issues specific to the documents submitted to the fda during mifepristone approval process,including matters ranging from competition in the abortion market to confidentiality issues.
judicial watch argues that the fda combination fails because it does not treat each document individually.context dictates our approach to the particularity required of agencies.an agency may not claim exemptions too broadly,thereby sweeping unprotected information within the statute reach.mays dea,rejecting withholding of all documents containing investigative details because exemption does not automatically protect such details.broad,sweeping claims of privilege without reference to the withheld documents would impede judicial review and undermine the functions served by the vaughn index requirement.the agency must therefore explain why the exemption applies to the document or type of document withheld and may not ignore the contents of the withheld documents.campbell dep t of justice,disapproving submission that had no language suggesting that the agency tailored its response to a specific set of documents.
on the other hand,abstraction can aid court review when drawing from specific examples.we have never required repetitive,detailed explanations for each piece of withheld is,codes and categories may be sufficiently particularized to carry the agency burden of proof.see keys,at.especially where the agency has disclosed and withheld a large number of documents,categorization and repetition provide efficient vehicles by which a court can review withholdings that implicate the same exemption for similar reasons.in such cases,particularity may actually impede court review and undermine the functions served by a vaughn index.
seizing on the distinction between these two approaches,judicial watch asserts that the fda claimed exemptions only in sweeping and conclusory generalities.we disagree.the fda explained itself through commonalities,not generalities.unsurprisingly,among thousands of withheld documents,certain topics and exemptions arose on multiple occasions.the index tied each individual document to one or more exemptions,and the masciale declaration linked the substance of each exemption to the documents common elements.no rule of law precludes the fda from treating common documents commonly.the fda combination does not resemble the general assertions of privilege that we have rejected in the past.
and we do not fault the fda for using the language of the statute as part of its explanation for withholding documents.as long as it links the statutory language to the withheld documents,the agency may even parrot the language of the statute.landmark legal found.irs.there are only so many ways the fda could have claimed exemptions,and for the thousands of documents generated during mifepristone approval.see id.it is not the agency fault that thousands of documents belonged in the same category,thus leading to exhaustive repetition.again,our focus is on the functions served by the vaughn index to organize the withheld documents in a way that facilitates litigant challenges and court review of the agency withholdings.see keys,at.the fda decision to tie each document to one or more claimed exemptions in its index and then summarize the commonalities of the documents in a supporting affidavit is a legitimate way of serving those functions.
iii.the claimed exemptions vagueness and merits challenges 
our holding that the fda produced a structurally sound vaughn index does not address the entirety of judicial watch challenge to the adequacy of the index.judicial watch also argues that many of the index document descriptions are indecipherable or lack information relevant to its merits claim.it further challenges the merits of the fda use of exemptions,and.judicial watch does not challenge the fda withholdings pursuant to foia exemption.b.
exemption allows agencies to withhold documents containing matters that are trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.b.unlike many other types of information subject to an agency control,materials implicating exemption are generally not developed within the agency.instead,it must procure commercial information from third parties,either by requirement or by request.the agency thus has an incentive to be a good steward of that information disclosure could result in competitive disadvantages to the submitting entity,discouraging them from giving quality information in the future.critical mass energy project nrc,quoting parks conservation ass morton.the agency may therefore withhold involuntarily submitted information as confidential if disclosure would impair the agency ability to get information in the future or cause substantial competitive harm to the entity that submitted the information.id.at citing parks,at 
the same incentive applies to the fda approval process.the fda requires applying companies to submit volumes of information related to a drug development,composition,safety,and manufacture.b.a company must submit this information in an investigational new drug application ind even prior to conducting clinical trials of a drug.pt.all the information from the ind also goes into the company new drug application nda,the formal application for sale and marketing approval from the fda.pt.each stage of the fda administrative processes therefore depends directly on submissions from outside the agency.
the nature of the approval process means exemption extends to at least some information contained in inds and ndas.if it did not,other companies could make use of the information in the inds in order to eliminate much of the time and effort that would otherwise be required to bring to market a product competitive with the product for which the submitting company filed the.pub.citizen health research group fda.similarly,i f a manufacturer competitor could obtain all the data in the manufacturer nda,it could utilize them in its own nda without incurring the time,labor,risk,and expense involved in developing them independently.webb hhs.applicants spend a great deal of resources to obtain data for an ind or nda,and the fda could not expect full and frank disclosure if it later released such proprietary information into the public domain.
exemption does not categorically exempt all information in inds and ndas,however,and the foia requester must have adequate descriptions in order to distinguish between protected and unprotected information.see pub.citizen,at.judicial watch argues that the index contains many as document study and document study with descriptions too vague to allow it to mount a merits challenge to the fda exemption claims.its brief is littered with other entries of which it can make neither heads nor tails,including documents and lab temp and document references.
the fda argues that each index entry must be considered in relation to surrounding entries and to the additional information listed in the index.specifically,the fda contends that the index clearly relates document references with document preclinical expert evaluation of and several other nearby documents,including document table of contents.we agree that document gives enough description to explain the is,a preclinical expert all documents.
other entries defy the fda claim of definition by association,though.for example,documents and lab temp appear to be freestanding documents.in its brief,the fda asserts that the description makes apparent that these records were collected during an fda inspection of a drug manufacturing facility.we disagree.in no way do these subject headings,or any other index information,connect these documents to an fda inspection or to any particular manufacturing facility.neither does the masciale declaration.although it lists information relating to the manufacturing process as one type of information redacted under exemption,it never explains that these documents fall into that category.
the same problems infect additional entries.for instance,the fda labeled document as report re protocols.surrounding entries look similar,albeit with different reference numbers,and each refers to a document of several hundred pages.in its brief,the fda characterizes two similar study and study as reference identification numbers for clinical or preclinical studies relating to the drug mifepristone.the agency added that it withheld the study titles themselves because they constituted confidential commercial information relating to unapproved uses.presumably,the same holds true for document,but we can not tell without the fda further explanation.the document descriptions themselves shed little light individually,and surrounding entries do not help.
documents through subject records also raise questions.at oral argument,the fda counsel su
