in this case,a challenge to the diversity jurisdiction claimed by a plaintiff requires us to examine the presumption of domicile and what it takes to overcome it where the plaintiff forges none of the typical ties to his new home.ultimately,we conclude that the task is one better left to the district court,with the benefit of an evidentiary hearing.
ryan padilla,brought an action in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico against pavía hospital,and miguel de la cruz castellanos and his conjugal partnership collectively,de la cruz,for damages stemming from allegedly negligent medical treatment padilla complaint,which was premised on puerto rico general tort statute,laws ann.tit,alleged federal diversity jurisdiction under.the complaint alleged that padilla was a resident of the state of florida 
on july,de la cruz moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the grounds that diversity of citizenship was lacking de la cruz claimed that as of january,the date that padilla filed his complaint,padilla actually was a domiciliary of puerto rico,not florida.on october,pavía hospital moved for summary judgment on padilla claims,also arguing that the district court lacked diversity jurisdiction.the district court granted both motions in a single order on february,without holding an evidentiary hearing.padilla timely filed this appeal.while the district court analysis ultimately may prove to be correct,because we find that the record has not been adequately developed,we reverse and remand for an evidentiary hearing on the question of diversity of citizenship.
federal jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship requires that the matter in controversy be between citizens of different states.a.for purposes of diversity,a person is a citizen of the state in which he is domiciled.lundquist precision valley aviation,cir,cir valedón martínez hospital presbiteriano de la comunidad,cir.a person domicile is the place where he has his true,fixed home and principal establishment,and to which,whenever he is absent,he has the intention of returning,at quoting charles allen wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice procedure ed.domicile is determined as of the time the suit is filed.lundquist,at valedón martínez,at hawes club ecuestre el comandante,cir.
in contesting padilla assertion of diversity jurisdiction,the appellees point out that only four days before filing his action in the district court,padilla filed a complaint in puerto rico state court,essentially making the same allegations as in his federal complaint,but alleging him to be a resident of puerto rico once challenged,the party invoking subject matter jurisdiction here padilla has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the facts supporting jurisdiction.bank one,texas,montle,cir citation omitted see also lundquist,at plaintiff must support allegation of jurisdiction by competent proof arlington trust,cir hawes,at pueblo int l,cir.padilla contended that the allegations of residency contained in his puerto rico pleadings were clerical errors and that he had,by december,permanently relocated from puerto rico to florida 
there is,ordinarily,a presumption of continuing domicile,hawes,at see also mitchell united states,wall.domicile once acquired is presumed to continue until it is shown to have been changed.because padilla was raised in puerto rico and lived there until his apparent relocation to florida,it is presumed that he was a domiciliary of puerto rico.to sustain his burden,padilla was required to show two things in order to establish a change in his domicile from puerto rico to florida presence in florida,and an intent to remain there.bank one,at valedón martínez,at hawes,at.we have stated previously that the factors relevant to determining a party intent include 
the place where civil and political rights are exercised,taxes paid,real and personal property such as furniture and automobiles located,driver and other licenses obtained,bank accounts maintained,location of club and church membership and places of business or employment.

the district court conclusion that padilla failed to meet his burden of proving that he changed his domicile to florida at the time he filed his federal complaint is a mixed question of law and fact and as such may not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.bank one,at lundquist,at valedón martínez,at,at hawes,at.a finding is clearly erroneous when,although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.anderson bessemer city,d citation omitted.though this presents a high hurdle for padilla,we believe it has been cleared only we therefore can not sustain,on the present record,the district court finding of a lack of diversity jurisdiction.see fredyma v.at t network,cir reversing district court judgment for error in procedure,but expressing no opinion on ultimate viability of complaint.
the record before us reveals that padilla offered several pieces of evidence to show that he had changed his domicile from puerto rico to florida prior to filing his federal lawsuit two declarations,one his and the other his mother,made under penalty of perjury,that he is a resident of florida and has no intention of returning to puerto rico copies of four ledgers detailing payments and charges from four different addresses in florida where padilla claims to have resided since january and a copy of a driver license issued to padilla on january,by the state of florida.in his declaration,padilla stated that he moved to florida on december,and has never returned to puerto rico.he also declared that he intends to continue living in florida,has no intention of ever returning to puerto rico,and that all of his personal contacts are in florida,with the exception of his mother in puerto rico who provides him with financial support.padilla mother declaration echoed padilla claims and clarified that she pays all of padilla expenses since he is unable to work or study 
based on these submissions,as well as the puerto rico state court pleadings alleging that padilla was a domiciliary of puerto rico,the district court found that,g iven the totality of the circumstances,the court simply can not find that padilla has established his domicile in florida for diversity purposes.the district court reasoned that,ultimately,padilla has not shown that he has taken any affirmative steps to establish a domicile in florida.specifically,the district court focused on padilla apparent failure to cultivate the sort of ties traditionally viewed as manifesting an expression of domicile 
padilla does not work nor has he indicated that he is looking for work in florida.he does not go to school.he does not own or rent any real property in florida.he does not belong to any clubs or groups,nor does he attend a church.he does not have any bank accounts.he has not registered or exercised the right to vote.other than his driver license and a stated desire to stay there,padilla does seem to have established any real presence in florida.
the district court also believed it to be contradictory that padilla stated his physical condition prevented him from working or attending school,and yet padilla also professed to live alone and far from family,to care for himself,and to drive a car.
in other words,the district court found that padilla declaration was not credible because he largely had not taken the affirmative steps described in bank one,opening a bank account or obtaining employment.however,nothing we have said in our prior decisions implies that the typical indicia of domicile are required in order to change one domicile rather,we have described these as examples of indicia of intent.
we recognize that the mode of proving diversity
