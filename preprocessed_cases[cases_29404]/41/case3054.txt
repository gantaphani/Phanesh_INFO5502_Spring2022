the saunders group,brought this patent infringement action in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia,docket.saunders alleged that the defendants are liable for infringement of patent the patent.the district court granted summary judgment of noninfringement on the ground that the asserted independent claims of the patent require,as one of the limitations of each of those claims,the presence of at least one pressure activated seal,a limitation that is not found in the accused devices.saunders now appeals.we hold that the district court claim construction was erroneous,and we therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
saunders competes with the defendants in the market for relatively inexpensive and lightweight cervical traction devices.cervical traction is a physical therapy treatment in which a device is used to generate a sustained force pulling upward on the patient neck so as to relieve pressure on enflamed or enlarged nerves.the devices at issue in this case allow patients to treat themselves at home.
both asserted independent claims of the patent,claims and,are directed to a portable cervical traction device.for purposes of this appeal,those claims are identical.claim reads as follows 
a cervical traction device comprising 
a support structure having a track 
a carriage having a slide bracket slidable along a portion of the track 
a restraining mechanism adapted to releasably restrain a portion of a patient body to the carriage 
a pneumatic cylinder having a first end and a moveable piston rod at a second end,one of the pneumatic cylinder or the piston rod attached to the support structure and the other attached to the carriage,the pneumatic cylinder adapted to move the carriage along the track relative to the support structure when in a pressurized state,the pneumatic cylinder maintaining a generally static traction force for a period in excess of minutes when in the pressurized state without additional pressurized air being supplied and 
a hand pump fluidly connected to the pneumatic cylinder and adapted to inject pressurized air into the pneumatic cylinder,the hand pump having a handle moveable relative to a body portion to injecting at least kpa psi of pressure into the pneumatic cylinder.
claim is identical to claim except that in the fourth limitation it recites during a treatment period in place of for a period in excess of minutes.
according to the patent,portable traction devices that were available at the time of the invention were unsatisfactory because of shortcomings in the methods by which the devices produced the traction force.pneumatic cylinders with low pressure inputs could not maintain the required force for the requisite amount of time,and hydraulic cylinders were not sufficiently portable.patent,ll.
the patent is the product of the third in a sequence of related applications.the first application,ser.the application,was directed to a portable traction device powered by a pneumatic cylinder.that application did not issue as a patent.the second application,which eventually matured into patent the patent and which has the same specification as the patent,was a continuation in part of the application.the patent contains claims to lumbar traction systems it issued after two rejections and an appeal to the board of patent appeals and interferences.all the claims in the patent explicitly require a pneumatic cylinder having at least one pressure activated seal.the pneumatic cylinder portion of claim of the patent is representative and reads as follows,with the pressure activated seal limitation emphasized 
a pneumatic traction force generating apparatus comprising a pneumatic cylinder attachable to the support structure adapted to move the carriage relative to the support structure when the pneumatic cylinder is in a pressurized state,the pneumatic cylinder having at least one pressure activated seal extending circumferentially around a piston,the pressure activated seal movable between a relaxed position and an extended position so the pressure activated seal engages an internal surface on the pneumatic cylinder when the pneumatic cylinder is in the pressurized state,the pneumatic cylinder maintaining a static traction force for a period in excess of minutes when in the pressurized state without additional pressurized air being supplied 
the application that led to the issuance of the patent was a continuation of the application that led to the patent.it claimed a cervical traction system instead of a lumbar traction system,and it omitted any reference to a pressure activated seal in two of the independent claims claims and and in most of their dependent claims.the pressure activated seal limitation was explicitly included in two other independent claims claims and and in two of the claims that depended from claim claims and.in connection with that application,the inventors filed a petition to make special in which they alleged that there was a device on the market that infringed certain specified claims of the application.in that petition,saunders referred to one of the cervical traction devices at issue in this case.although the petition did not specifically discuss pressure activated seals,the only claims alleged to be infringed were those that did not contain an explicit limitation directed to pressure activated seals.the patent and trademark office granted the petition and conducted an expedited examination.the patent was issued after the patentees overcame various rejections.saunders filed the present infringement action days later.
in a combined claim construction and summary judgment opinion,the district court held that the term pneumatic cylinder in claim is limited to pneumatic cylinders containing at least one pressure activated seal.the court noted that the specification only disclosed one embodiment for the internal workings of the claimed pneumatic cylinder and that the specification teaches no alternative means by which the pneumatic cylinder can maintain the required traction force.the court also ruled that the prosecution history of the patent contained an unequivocal disclaimer of type seals in particular and any seal other than a pressure activated seal in general.because saunders admitted that the accused devices do not use pressure activated seals,the court granted summary judgment of noninfringement.
on appeal,saunders argues that the district court improperly limited the scope of the term pneumatic cylinder.saunders contends that the term pneumatic cylinder does not inherently require the presence of a pressure activated seal and that nothing in the specification or the prosecution history suggests that the term pneumatic cylinder,as used in the patent,requires such a seal.for that reason,saunders argues,claim of the patent reads on the accused products,which have pneumatic cylinders without pressure activated seals.
claim terms are generally given the meaning those terms would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art.phillips awh,en banc.it is not disputed that the ordinary meaning of the term pneumatic cylinder does not require the presence of pressure activated seals.the asserted claims can be assigned a narrower scope only if there is some indication in the patent or the prosecution history that the term pneumatic cylinder was meant to have a more restrictive meaning as used in the patent,or a broader meaning was disclaimed during prosecution.see phillips,at honeywell int l,itt,scimed life,advanced cardiovascular.we conclude that the text of the patent and its prosecution history do not justify such a restrictive construction of the term.
the strongest indication that the term pneumatic cylinder,as used in the patent,was not meant to include pressure activated seals as a matter of definition can be found in a comparison of independent claim and claim,one of the claims that depend from claim.claim recites a pneumatic cylinder but does not expressly require a pressure activated seal.claim recites the apparatus of claim and then adds a limitation reciting a pressure activated seal.claim reads as follows emphasis added 
the apparatus of claim comprising at least one pressure activated seal in the pneumatic cylinder extending circumferentially around a piston,the pressure activated seal movable between a relaxed position and an extended position so the pressure activated seal engages an internal surface on the pneumatic cylinder when the pneumatic cylinder is in the pressurized state for engagement with an inside surface of a cylinder housing when in the pressurized state.
given that claim adds the pressure activated seal limitation to claim,the doctrine of claim differentiation supports the inference that claim encompasses cylinders without pressure activated seals.otherwise,claim would add nothing to claim and the two would cover identical subject matter.see phillips,at t he presence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise to a presumption that the limitation in question is not present in the independent claim.medrad.
the defendants argue that there is a meaningful difference in scope between claim and claim under their construction because claim requires the seal to extend circumferentially around a piston while being movable so as to engage the cylinder in a particular place.that language from claim,however,is better read as simply definitional language that describes the operation of a pressure activated seal.the patent does not disclose any other way of constructing a pressure activated seal,and the recitation of the operation of the pressure activated seal adds nothing of substance to the recitation of the seal itself.the defendants have not pointed to any evidence that those of skill in the art would have understood the referenced language as carving out a subset of all pressure activated seals.
the prosecution history of the patent provides further support for saunders argument that the term pneumatic cylinder,as used in the patent,is not restricted to pneumatic cylinders that use pressure activated seals.the patent resulted from a continuation application claiming priority to an application that specifically required at least one pressure activated seal in all its claims.when the patentees filed the continuation application,they omitted that limitation from some,but not all,of the new claims.had they omitted the limitation from all of the claims,it might be argued that the limitation was assumed to be present and did not need to be explicitly recited.making such a change to only some of the claims,however,is a strong indication that the claims not reciting pressure activated seals were not intended to require them.
the petition to make special is also significant because the applicants asserted in that document that a device lacking a pressure activated seal infringed the independent claims of the application.to be sure,the petition did not specifically discuss pressure activated seals.it is undisputed,however,that the petition accused the device of infringing only those claims that lacked a pressure activated seal requirement and that the accused device had no pressure activated seals.under those circumstances,the petition indicates that the applicants did not regard the presence of pressure activated seals as a necessary condition for infringement of those claims.
the defendants point to various features of the patent and the prosecution history in support of their argument that one of skill in the art would necessarily conclude that only pneumatic cylinders with pressure activated seals are within the scope of claims and of the patent.they first contend that such a limitation is evident from the claim language requiring that the cylinder be capable of maintaining a generally static traction force for a period in excess of minutes when in the pressurized state without additional pressurized air being supplied.because the specification does not describe any pneumatic cylinders without pressure activated seals,and because the specification does not disclose any other way to maintain the necessary traction force,the defendants argue that a person of skill in the art would understand that a pressure activated seal is necessary to maintain the recited traction force.accordingly,they contend that the claims must be limited to pneumatic cylinders with pressure activated seals.
a patent that describes only a single embodiment is not necessarily limited to that embodiment,at citing cases.even where a patent describes only a single embodiment,claims will not be read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope water,safari water filtration,internal quotations omitted.while an assertion by the patentee that using pressure activated seals is the only way to maintain the needed traction force would evidence an intention to narrow the scope of the independent claims,the patent contains no such assertion.
to be sure,the specification of the patent,which is identical to the specification of the parent patent,contains passages that describe the portable traction device as comprising at least one pressure activated seal.see patent,abstract,ll.but those passages do not expressly state that the pressure activated seal is an essential component of the invention.while the restrictive language of the specification might be sufficient in other contexts to limit the scope of the claims,it is not sufficient in this case,where the language of the claims so clearly distinguishes between those claims that require the presence of a pressure activated seal and those that do not.see,at.
the defendants argue that the specification in this case closely resembles the one at issue in alloc,international trade commission.in that case,the court construed the claims to include a feature that was common to all the disclosed embodiments but was not explicitly recited as a limitation in any of the claims.the claims at issue in alloc recited floor system features related to displacement and disassembly of the flooring components.id.at.the court construed the claims to require play between the flooring components because the patent specifically taught that such play enabled the displacement and disassembly features and because the patent criticized prior art systems that lacked play as being impossible to disassemble nondestructively.id.at.in contrast,the patent does not criticize prior art cylinders based on their lack of pressure activated seals.the specification indicates that pneumatic cylinders typically can not maintain an adequate traction force,but the patent does not state that the only way to accomplish the goal of maintaining traction force is through the use of pressure activated seals.accordingly,the specification does not support the narrowing construction that the defendants propose.
the defendants next argue that in the prosecution history the applicants unambiguously disclaimed pneumatic cylinders lacking pressure activated seals.in making that argument,the defendants focus on the prosecution history of the parent patent.the fact that the prosecution history relied upon was created in connection with the parent application would be unimportant if the claim language at issue were present in both patent applications.in this case,however,all the claims in the patent explicitly require at least one pressure activated seal while the patent omits that language from the asserted claims.at the same time,the alleged disclaimer distinguishing the prior art focused on a particular claim pressure activated seal limitation found in each of the claims of the was not directed to the invention as a whole.see scimed life,at.when the purported disclaimers are directed to specific claim terms that have been omitted or materially altered in subsequent applications rather than to the invention itself,those disclaimers do not apply.ventana med.biogenex,t he doctrine of prosecution disclaimer generally does not apply when the claim term in the descendant patent uses different language.invitrogen clontech,t he prosecution of one claim term in a parent application will generally not limit different claim language in a continuation application.advanced cardiovascular medtronic,omitting the claim term to which the prose
