grace healthcare,a skilled nursing facility in benton,arkansas,petitions for judicial review of a civil monetary penalty imposed by the secretary of the department of health and human services for an immediate jeopardy violation of c,which requires nursing homes to thoroughly investigate all allegations of resident neglect or abuse,including injuries of unknown sources.the secretary decision to impose a civil monetary penalty is subject to review in the court of appeals under e.see h b ii concluding that the agency decision to impose an immediate jeopardy monetary penalty is not supported by substantial evidence on the administrative record considered as a whole,we grant the petition for review and vacate that part of the secretary decision.
i.the regulatory landscape 
to remain eligible for reimbursement for services to patients under the federal medicare and medicaid programs,skilled nursing facilities must comply with comprehensive health care regulations enforced by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms,a division of the department of health and human services.the statute authorizes the secretary of health and human services to enter into an agreement with any state pursuant to which an appropriate state agency monitors compliance by skilled nursing facilities with these federal regulations.see.the office of long term care of the arkansas department of health and human services the state agency is the agency authorized to perform these functions in arkansas.
state agency surveyors refer instances of with federal standards to cms for enforcement actions that may result in program disqualification,the imposition of civil monetary penalties,or lesser sanctions.see h b ii,h c ii.a finding of immediate jeopardy exposes the medicare provider to a broader set of enforcement remedies,including substantially greater civil monetary penalties of to per day.see e b ii,a i.the regulations define immediate jeopardy as a situation in which the provider noncompliance with one or more requirements of participation has caused,or is likely to cause,serious injury,harm,impairment,or death to a resident.
ii.the health care at issue 
although the administrative proceedings encompassed many more factual issues,this appeal is focused on care provided by grace healthcare to a medicare beneficiary referred to as resident,who resided at grace healthcare for about thirty days in the spring of.resident was an woman first admitted on april,in declining health.as described by a treating physician,resident had a history of ashd,congestive heart failure,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,increasing alzheimer dementia,hypertension,rectal bleeding from internal hemorrhoids,and diverticulitis.two days later,she was transferred to saline memorial hospital after a stroke,returning to grace healthcare on april in a more deteriorated condition.because of the stroke,she was placed on plavix,a potent blood thinner,in addition to her other medications.grace healthcare admission nursing assessments on both april and noted bruises on resident arm at the sites of iv infusions and blood draws.
on may,grace healthcare daily skilled nurses notes record that resident has developed low grade fever and golf ball sized lymph node on right side of neck,and that she had bit her tongue and the inside of her lip.resident was promptly transferred to saline memorial hospital,where the emergency room physician recorded a urinary tract infection elevated blood sugar consistent with hyperosmolar state renal insufficiency with dehydration multiple ecchymoses alzheimer dementia hypertension and coronary artery disease.
on may,quade,a treating physician at the hospital,noted type ii diabetes mellitus,a new diagnosis she also noted the multiple ecchymoses without referencing possible abuse or neglect.however,the next day,grace healthcare nurse liaison overheard quade complaining at the hospital about resident dehydrated and bruised condition.the nurse liaison inquired,and quade said she wanted to talk to someone at grace healthcare about resident bruises,which were not present when resident left the hospital on april the nurse liaison promptly reported quade comment to grace healthcare director of nurses and administrator.the director of nurses called quade,as requested.quade never returned the call.the administrator interviewed several nurses and consulted resident medical records.resident l died at the hospital three days later.both grace healthcare treating physician and its medical expert later opined that resident ecchymoses were caused by the administration of plavix and aspirin,not by injury or accident.
iii.the administrative proceedings 
acting on a complaint,apparently from resident family,the state agency began a complaint and compliance survey of grace healthcare facility on may.see g c and.as relevant here,the detailed surveyor interview notes reflect that one certified nurse aide recalled seeing bruises on resident arms on may and another recalled seeing a little bruise on her right hip that was about the size of an egg on may.resident condition changed dramatically on the morning of may.when interviewed nine days later,attending staff noted multiple bruises on her legs,bottom,right side of her chest,and left side of her upper arm.one nurse aide recalled that during the rounds that morning,resident had more bruises than i ever seen on a person.the nurse liaison reported what quade said at the hospital on may.the nurse liaison stated that she then reported what she thought was an allegation of bruising and dehydration to grace healthcare director of nursing and administrator.
on the afternoon of may,the state agency informed grace healthcare that its care of resident and two other residents reflected with six federal regulations,resulting in an immediate jeopardy condition the following afternoon,with the survey not yet completed,the state agency removed the immediate jeopardy condition after grace healthcare implemented a comprehensive plan of removal that addressed compliance with each of the six regulations.
after completing its survey on may,the state agency recommended that cms take enforcement action against grace healthcare and impose civil monetary penalties of per day for the may immediate jeopardy violations,plus an additional per day until the facility is in substantial compliance.cms agreed with these recommendations and notified grace healthcare by letter dated june,that it was not in substantial compliance,that the monetary penalties were being assessed,and that other remedies would be imposed unless the facility came into substantial compliance.
cms subsequently determined that grace healthcare achieved substantial compliance on june.cms rescinded the threatened additional remedies but imposed civil monetary penalties of per day for may and per day from may through june.as a result of the immediate jeopardy findings,grace healthcare would also lose its authority to conduct a nurse aide training and competency evaluation program.see b iii.grace healthcare conceded the per day sanction for the period may but filed an administrative appeal of the six immediate jeopardy determinations.see part.a department of health and human services administrative law judge alj decided the appeal on a record consisting of voluminous documentary evidence and extensive briefs submitted by both parties.
though grace healthcare challenged all six immediate jeopardy findings,the alj upheld the per day penalty on the sole ground that grace healthcare committed immediate jeopardy violations of c when several members of its staff observed bruises on resident between may and,but the facility did not investigate the source of these injuries during that period.the alj concluded that this failure to investigate resident injuries over a three day period violated grace healthcare absolute duty to treat every resident injury from an unknown source as evidence of possible abuse,neglect,or mistreatment,until it establishes the injury cause.the violation warranted an immediate jeopardy determination and penalty because it potentially put resident at risk of great harm and put all of petitioner residents at risk.the alj did not address the other five deficiencies because the failure to investigate possible staff abuse is,in and of itself,sufficient to justify the penalties of per day.
grace healthcare appealed the alj decision to the agency departmental appeals board dab,again arguing that cms failed to prove any violation.grace healthcare noted an error in the alj factual analysis of the alleged failure to investigate the source of resident multiple bruises before she was transferred to the hospital on may.the administrative record is clear that the extreme multiple bruises referred to by the alj were not apparent until the morning of may,just before resident was transferred to the hospital emergency room suffering from far more serious changes of condition that proved to be the onset of her demise.beyond what was observed that morning,the surveyors interview notes show only that two nurse aides recalled less significant and extensive bruises on may and may,which other staff did not recall seeing.yet the alj opinion repeatedly treated the bruises first observed on may two physicians later described as multiple ecchymoses attributable to resident medication with aspirin and a potent blood a condition of unknown source which required immediate and thorough investigation.even if c required prompt investigation of the bruises observed on may and may for possible staff abuse,nothing in the administrative record suggests that the state agency and cms would have imposed an penalty solely for that.
no doubt recognizing this factual flaw in the alj analysis,the dab affirmed by finding a significantly different violation of c,one not identified or relied upon by the alj.though quade did not report possible abuse to regulatory officials,nor record possible abuse in her physician notes,the dab concluded that quade statement to grace healthcare nurse liaison on may about resident bruises 
was an allegation of facts that could indicate abuse.in addition,quade appeared to consider the bruises an injury of unknown source accordingly,even if grace staff did not see the bruises until just prior to resident transfer to the hospital,grace was still obligated to investigate the bruises after receiving quade allegation of abuse.
the dab further agreed with the alj that the treating physician june letter opining that the bruises were ecchymoses attributable to plavix and aspirin medications did not satisfy grace healthcare duty under c to promptly investigate injuries of unknown source.the dab affirmed the alj finding of an violation on the ground that grace healthcare failed to prove it was clearly erroneous,see c,and concluded the alj had discretion to ignore the other five immediate jeopardy determinations because they were immaterial to the outcome of the case,citing care mgmt.ctrs.for medicare medicaid,hhsdab lexis.finding the penalty reasonable in amount,the dab affirmed the alj decision.grace healthcare then filed this petition for review.
iv.judicial review 
grace healthcare challenges the dab determination that grace healthcare was not in substantial compliance with c,the determination that any noncompliance resulted in immediate jeopardy,and the decision not to address the other five deficiencies underlying cms immediate jeopardy determination.
general principles.judicial review of an order imposing a civil monetary penalty is governed by.see h b ii,h c ii.the statute provides that the dab findings must be supported by substantial evidence,that is,such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.horras leavitt,cir quotation omitted.because the regulations prescribe substantially greater monetary penalties for noncompliance that caused an immediate jeopardy condition,the dab immediate jeopardy finding,as well as its noncompliance findings and the amount of the penalty imposed,must be supported by substantial evidence on the administrative the record as a whole.see fairfax,at.in conducting its appellate review,the dab has held that cms obligation to present a prima facie case of noncompliance does not extend to the issue of the level of noncompliance.liberty commons nursing rehab ctrs.for medicare medicaid,hhsdab lexis,at,aff,cir unpublished.that limitation on administrative review does not affect our review of the agency immediate jeopardy determination,which is governed by the familiar substantial evidence standard.
in selecting an appropriate remedy,cms must consider whether a facility deficiencies constitute immediate jeopardy whether they are isolated,constitute a pattern or are widespread and the facility prior history of noncompliance.in determining the amount of a civil monetary penalty,cms must also consider the facility financial condition and degree of culpability.f.see generally corder united states,cir noting that civil monetary penalties are sanctions.a finding of immediate that has caused,or is likely to cause,serious injury,harm,impairment or death to a resident,obviously be based upon the specific instance s of noncompliance at issue.as the dab said in spring meadows health care ctr.ctrs.for medicare medicaid,hhsdab lexis,at,because the definition of immediate jeopardy requires that there be some causal connection between the facility noncompliance and the existence of serious injury or a threat of injury,the nature and circumstances of the facility noncompliance are of obvious importance to the evaluation.
b.the immediate jeopardy determination in this case.before completing its compliance survey,the state agency declared that grace healthcare interrelated noncompliance with six regulations in caring for three residents resulted in an immediate jeopardy condition.hours later,the state agency determined that grace healthcare had remedied the condition with a comprehensive plan of removal but nonetheless recommended an monetary penalty.cms agreed and imposed a per day civil monetary penalty for the six violations.in an affidavit filed with the alj,the compliance evaluation lead of cms region vi discussed the six deficiencies and opined the multiple failures combined with the physical condition of residents,or were likely to cause them serious injury,harm,impairment or death.
the evaluation lead affidavit further explained that grace healthcare interacting noncompliance with k,and j were the core of grace healthcare noncompliance.grace healthcare identified resident potential hydration problem,the affidavit explained,but failed to assess,or disregarded,the seriousness of too little or too much fluid.resident received a diuretic,which increased the likelihood of dehydration,and plavix,a blood thinning medication which could cause bleeding.the bruises and bleeding are indicators of possible neglect or abuse,the affidavit explained,citing c.but bleeding also would aggravate resident hydration needs,which affected her bowel impaction and heart problems.the affidavit brief discussion of the c noncompliance did not assert or even imply that this deficiency alone resulted in an immediate jeopardy condition.
if the alj and the dab had affirmed these interrelated immediate jeopardy findings,we would be presented with a far different appeal.but on appeal grace healthcare challenged each of the cms immediate jeopardy findings.for example,it placed in evidence expert medical testimony and facility records documenting resident fluid intake during her time at the facility and vigorously argued that,if resident was dehydrated when she left grace healthcare on may,that condition was not caused by any deficiency in grace healthcare care.grace healthcare also attacked the factual basis for the other findings,directly contradicting cms assertion that these multiple deficiencies were likely to cause resident or any other resident serious injury,harm,impairment,or death.
the alj did not address these issues,instead asserting without discussion that grace healthcare did not meet its burden to prove cms immediate jeopardy findings clearly erroneous the alj then ruled that the failure to investigate resident multiple bruises during the may period created an obvious likelihood of serious injury,harm,or
