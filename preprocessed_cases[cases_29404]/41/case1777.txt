background 
thomas began working for the kansas city police department kcpd in.in,she began working the evening shift in the juvenile unit as an investigative typist.sergeant janet hargarten hargarten became thomas direct supervisor in late or early.in october,thomas transferred to another kcpd division to work the day shift,but within a few months thomas requested return to her former evening shift position in the juvenile unit.thomas request was approved in early.at the time of her request,thomas recognized the juvenile unit had some workforce shortages.
when thomas returned to the juvenile unit,hargarten and thomas reviewed the office procedures and vacation policy,which limited vacations to no more than sixteen consecutive days.however,on may,thomas submitted a request to take twenty consecutive days of vacation in september.noting their earlier discussion regarding the vacation policy,hargarten denied thomas request and asked her to resubmit it.hargarten later approved thomas subsequent request of seventeen days vacation.
on may,thomas met with hargarten to discuss the vacation issue,and thomas expressed concerns regarding safety and security within the juvenile unit.during this meeting,thomas informed hargarten she felt she was treated differently than male employees,because men were allowed to carry guns and thomas was not even allowed to use pepper spray.thomas alleges hargarten told her to think carefully about filing a grievance regarding her concerns.
on july,thomas fell asleep at her desk while on duty.the following day,hargarten asked thomas to complete a form explanatory memorandum detailing the incident,but hargarten did not formally discipline her thomas claims other juvenile unit employees,including younger male employees,fell asleep at their desks,but they were never required to fill out a form.
a few weeks later on august,thomas arrived thirty minutes late to a staff meeting.hargarten again asked thomas to complete a form,but hargarten did not discipline thomas for her tardiness.at that time,hargarten told thomas that detective jackson lyle lyle had to complete a form for similar conduct the previous year.however,thomas alleges lyle later stated he did not have to fill out a form.hargarten testified lyle,in fact,did complete a form,but he simply did not remember doing so.
in january,thomas submitted a request for consecutive vacation days.no other juvenile unit employee had ever been granted a similar request.hargarten denied the request and asked thomas to resubmit the request in accordance with the juvenile unit vacation policy thomas did not do so.thomas acknowledged she also received a memorandum prepared by hargarten that sought to limit the length of vacations due to workforce shortages within the juvenile unit.
on february,thomas met with hargarten and captain byron price price to discuss her vacation request and the effects of extended vacations on the operation of the juvenile unit,a small division requiring staffing.during the meeting,hargarten stated thomas could be written up for insubordination for requesting consecutive days of vacation.hargarten also stated detectives in the juvenile unit had complained about thomas conduct,which included going into a back room to talk on the telephone,hiding her computer screen when others walked by,faxing information to her husband while at work,and coming to the juvenile unit on her days off hargarten then intimated thomas behavior could give rise to a hostile work environment claim by thomas and thomas could be disciplined for her behavior.finally,hargarten again advised thomas to be careful regarding the filing of a grievance with kcpd.
on april,thomas received her employee evaluation for the period from may,to may.the evaluation,completed by hargarten,discussed thomas professional manner in dealing with upset parents and her willingness to assist juvenile unit detectives with their workload,but the evaluation also noted some unusual behavior,such as falling asleep on duty and being late to a staff meeting.the evaluation noted the recommendation that thomas seek medical advice regarding her alleged fatigue.thomas signed the agreement,which gave her a satisfactory rating,the only alternative rating being unsatisfactory.employee evaluations do not become part of an employee permanent personnel file.
on may,thomas returned home from work and then went to the emergency room,believing she was having a heart attack.thomas was advised she was experiencing an anxiety reaction.the next day,thomas sought treatment from bernard judy judy,her primary care physician.judy believed thomas was experiencing stress,and referred her to bernard sullivan sullivan,a psychologist.thomas called the juvenile unit and requested a sick day,stating she had been to the hospital the night before for stress and had a doctor appointment scheduled for the following day.when hargarten called thomas later that evening and inquired about the cause of thomas stress,thomas indicated she likely would return to work on may.thomas did not come to work on this date.
on may,sullivan diagnosed thomas with stress and anxiety due to pressures and excused thomas from work through june.when thomas informed hargarten of this on may,hargarten inquired about what pressures thomas had been experiencing.thomas refused to explain the cause of her stress.hargarten contacted thomas at home on two other occasions to see how thomas was feeling.a series of notes from sullivan excused thomas from work due to thomas stress and anxiety,and extended thomas return to work from june to june,and finally to june.
on june,thomas called hargarten,stating sullivan cleared thomas to return to work on june.hargarten replied she was recommending thomas transfer to kcpd sick leave pool and that thomas undergo a ffd evaluation.kcpd policy provides a supervisor must submit a written request recommending a psychological or psychiatric examination to evaluate an employee ffd if the employee exhibits symptoms of a psychological or psychiatric disorder that is believed to affect job performance.in a memo dated june,hargarten recommended thomas undergo an ffd due to thomas absences from work,thomas refusal to discuss her stress,and kcpd potential liability if thomas were allowed to return to work without an evaluation.on june,thomas received a letter from captain philip lawler lawler of the employee benefits unit stating that kcpd had placed her in the sick leave pool effective june.
in late june,barbara stuart stuart,supervisor of kcpd human resources division employee benefits unit,informed thomas she had scheduled thomas psychological ffd evaluation for july,thomas agreed to participate and understood kcpd would allow her to return to work if she completed the evaluation.george harris harris,an independent licensed psychologist who spends about of his professional time with clients from kcpd,performed thomas ffd evaluation.kcpd usual practice is to inform the doctor performing an employee ffd evaluation generally of the employee problem or issue.kcpd sent harris several items a referral letter noting thomas was scheduled for a psychological ffd evaluation a copy of the letter sent to thomas regarding her assignment to the sick leave pool a copy of hargarten june,memo discussing thomas absences from work and recommending thomas transfer to the sick leave pool an informational log detailing thomas leave from work notes to kcpd from sullivan excusing thomas from work and a chart listing thomas absences from work.although kcpd did not provide harris with any specific questions to direct to thomas during the evaluation,harris assumed,based on the referral letter and accompanying documents he received,that he was to determine whether any psychological problems interfered with thomas ability to return to work.
on july and,harris interviewed thomas and administered a psychological test.thomas also completed a medical history questionnaire,in which she failed to mention she previously had taken medications.harris asked thomas to sign a medical release form so he could obtain thomas medical records.thomas initially objected,but eventually permitted harris to review information concerning her mental health and physical treatment for the from may through july.those records indicated contrary to thomas medical history questionnaire thomas previously had taken prozac and zoloft.thomas stated the medications were prescribed for fatigue,an explanation harris doubted based on his belief prozac and zoloft typically were prescribed for anxiety and depression,and harris told thomas he did not believe her.
on july,thomas submitted a,grievance to kcpd based upon thomas concerns regarding the vacation policy,security issues,and allegations hargarten was treating her more harshly than others.thomas grievance also included claims of increased monitoring of her activities by hargarten,disparate treatment of her based on gender,and hargarten creation of memoranda criticizing thomas.
based on his evaluation of thomas,in an initial report dated july,harris opined that although thomas did not appear to have any major psychological disorder,he could not recommend thomas return to work absent some indication of effective medical intervention for her anxiety or a change in working conditions to resolve thomas complaints within the juvenile unit.harris reported he could not issue a final report without access to thomas medical records.he noted,if thomas is experiencing an anxiety disorder severe enough to disrupt her work it would be reasonable to expect thomas to begin medication for the condition.based on harris belief thomas was not taking any medications,harris would not recommend thomas return to work unless her physician indicated medication was unnecessary.he opined thomas reluctance to completely disclose her medical records might indicate other reasons for thomas alleged stress and anxiety,viewing thomas complaints about her safety at the juvenile unit disproportional to the problem.harris alternatively noted thomas alleged anxiety could be somewhat manipulative,designed to get time off that she could get approved through normal procedures,and concluded examination of additional medical records might clarify the issue.harris also expressed his inability to explain thomas drowsiness,again noting his desire to examine thomas medical records for evidence of any anxiety disorder.
on august,harris asked thomas to sign a medical records release form,authorizing judy to release thomas records from,when judy prescribed prozac and zoloft to thomas.harris stated he needed to know why thomas was given those medications.thomas refused to sign the release form.although thomas did not know specifically what information her medical records contained,during her deposition thomas testified she was worried the records might reference her infertility problems and did not want others to have access to such information.thus,rather than sign the release form,thomas asked judy to prepare a letter to harris in which judy explained prozac and zoloft were prescribed for thomas fatigue and thomas symptoms were not related to her present problems of anxiety and depression.
upon receiving judy letter,harris informed kcpd he could not allow judy cursory statements to create harris opinion regarding thomas psychological difficulties.harris noted his belief that treating fatigue with medications was unusual,opining thomas treatment history suggests a predisposition to psychological which probably play some role in understanding her present condition.harris felt there were too many conflicting pieces of information and was sure he was getting the complete truth from thomas.he also was concerned about clearing thomas for return to work when no changes had been made to the work environment,which thomas alleged was the sole cause of her stress and anxiety.harris also noted his repeated attempts to encourage thomas to sign the release form and thomas refusals to do so.noting it was highly unlikely judy had performed a complete psychological examination of thomas and it was reasonable to suspect thomas could withhold information from judy about thomas present circumstances just as thomas was withholding information from harris about her past condition,harris concluded he could not recommend thomas return to work.
given thomas refusal to sign the release form,stuart asked thomas to meet with her and lawler.during this october,meeting,lawler indicated his assumption thomas would not change her mind and sign the release form.lawler also stated a kcpd attorney had recommended thomas be terminated.although not expressly ordered to sign the release form,thomas was advised harris needed specific medical records to determine her ffd,and kcpd would have no choice but to terminate her if she did not release her records.thomas confirmed she had no intention of signing the release.
approximately one month later,kcpd requested thomas sign a personnel incident report,which stated thomas had been advised harris,the psychologist,needed thomas medical records to determine her ffd.the report further stated thomas repeatedly refused to release the records,in violation of kcpd rules of conduct,which required employees to obey all lawful and proper orders and instructions issued by a regardless of the manner by which they are transmitted or received.thomas signed the incident report on november,and then thomas submitted a,response raising many issues,but acknowledging she refused requests to release her medical records before may.kcpd terminated thomas effective december,for failure to follow an order.thomas took accumulated sick leave from may,until december.kcpd replaced thomas with a younger female employee.
during the course of later settlement negotiations,thomas attorney provided kcpd with thomas medical records.the records revealed that in,thomas admitted to judy she was possibly depressed.judy testified in his deposition he did not remember reviewing thomas medical records before writing his august letter to harris,but instead adopted thomas suggestion the prozac and zoloft medications were prescribed for fatigue because it did not conflict with his own recollection.furthermore,the only mention of information related to thomas infertility was her previous tubal ligation and subsequent reversal,and thomas intermittent attempts to get pregnant.thomas had disclosed her prior tubal ligation and reversal surgeries to harris on her medical history questionnaire,and thomas had discussed with hargarten and her other juvenile unit thomas desire to have children,her fertility treatments,and her attempts to become pregnant.
thomas filed suit against jim corwin,kcpd chief of police kcpd and five members of the board of police commissioners collectively,the defendants,alleging disability discrimination,age discrimination,gender discrimination,retaliation,invasion of privacy,and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.the district court dismissed the emotional distress claims with prejudice and also dismissed kcpd as a defendant.the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on thomas remaining claims.thomas appeals.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo the grant of a motion for summary judgment,applying the same standards as the district court.samuels.city.sch,cir.if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to thomas and giving her the benefit of all reasonable inferences,shows there are no genuine issues of material fact and the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law,then summary judgment is appropriate.c see,celotex catrett,d anderson liberty lobby,d.in considering a motion for summary judgment,we do not weigh the evidence,make credibility determinations,or attempt to discern the truth of any factual issue.peter wedl,cir.rather,we view the facts and evidence as a whole in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.nitsche ceo of osage valley,cir.the party opposing summary judgment can not rest solely on the pleadings,but instead must set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial.celotex,at.mere allegations,unsupported by specific facts or evidence beyond the nonmoving party own conclusions,are insufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment.see id.
ada discrimination claim 
thomas first argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment on thomas ada discrimination claim under d a,which prohibits an employer from requiring a medical examination or inquiring into the disability status of an employee unless such examination or inquiry is shown to be and consistent with business necessity.this provision applies to all employees,regardless of whether the employee has an actual disability.see cossette.power light,cir.
to demonstrate compliance with d a,the employer bears the burden to show the asserted business necessity is vital to the business and the request for a medical examination or inquiry is no broader or more intrusive than necessary.conroy state dep t of corr,cir.c ourts will readily find a business necessity if an employer can demonstrate a medical examination or inquiry is necessary to determine whether the employee can perform duties when the employer can identify legitimate,reasons to doubt the employee capacity to perform his or her duties such as frequent absences,or whether an employee absence or request for an absence is due to legitimate medical reasons,when the employer has reason to suspect abuse of an attendance policy.id.at see,sullivan river valley sch,cir holding there must be significant evidence that could cause a reasonable person to inquire as to whether an employee is still capable of performing his job to uphold an employer request for an exam.the examination or inquiry need not be the only way to achieve a business necessity,but it must be a reasonably effective method to achieve the employer goals.conroy,at.
our review of the record convinces us the defendants request for thomas ffd evaluation was and consistent with business necessity.see d a.as a juvenile unit employee,thomas interacted with the parents or guardians of troubled children,assisted juvenile unit detectives,and served in a security capacity.thomas previously communicated to the defendants her concerns regarding the juvenile unit work situation and safety.thereafter,thomas visited the emergency room for an anxiety attack,a condition her primary care physician and psychologist attributed solely to stress and anxiety,and which necessitated a leave of absence.during this,hargarten unsuccessfully attempted to ascertain the cause of thomas stress.thomas then proposed to return to her same position in an unchanged environment,despite her repeated refusal to articulate the basis for her stress.on these facts,kcpd had legitimate reasons to doubt thomas capacity to perform her work duties without being overcome by stress and anxiety,to take proactive steps to ensure the safety of the public,thomas and other juvenile unit employees,and to seek reliable attendance from thomas,an employee within a small division requiring staffing.see conroy,at noting an employer legitimate business necessity may include safety and reducing severe absenteeism.
furthermore,kcpd request for an ffd evaluation was no broader or more intrusive than necessary.employers are permitted to use reasonable means to ascertain the cause of troubling behavior without exposing themselves to ada claims.cody cigna healthcare of louis,cir.pursuant to the ffd evaluation,in which thomas agreed to participate,kcpd sought to ascertain whether thomas was fit to return to a position under the same working conditions that allegedly caused thomas stress and anxiety severe enough to mandate a trip to the emergency room,followed by an extended absence from work.kcpd directed harris to determine whether any psychological problems interfered with thomas ability to return to work.during the course of harris evaluation,he learned thomas previously had taken medications,information omitted from thomas medical history questionnaire.doubting thomas explanation that the medications were prescribed for fatigue,harris sought to determine whether thomas medical history explained her current psychological condition.however,thomas repeatedly refused to comply with harris focused request for a limited portion of thomas medical records,which refusal led harris to believe there were other reasons for thomas stress and anxiety.we agree with the district court that examining thomas was vital to operating the juvenile unit,and the focused request for a limited portion of thomas medical records was no broader or more intrusive than necessary.
in addition,we have reviewed thomas remaining arguments regarding this claim and find each to be meritless.summary judgment therefore is proper on thomas ada claim.
age discrimination claim 
the adea prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of age.a.to establish a prima facie claim of age discrimination,thomas must show she was at least forty years old,she was meeting her employer legitimate performance expectations,she suffered an adverse employment action,and employees outside the class were treated more favorably.see haas kelly,cir.because thomas presented no direct evidence of discrimination,we analyze her claim pursuant to the framework set forth in mcdonnell douglas green,d.once thomas establishes a prima facie case,the burden shifts to the defendants to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for their actions.if the defendants satisfy their burden,the burden shifts back to thomas to show the defendants proffered reason was pretextual.mcdonnell douglas,at.
thomas alleges three discriminatory acts the required filing of form and her employee evaluation,her required participation in an ffd evaluation,and her termination.the defendants concede,for purposes of argument,thomas satisfies the first two elements of her prima facie case.
thomas first claims the required filing of form and the subsequent mention on her employee evaluation of the form subject matter constitute adverse employment actions.such an assertion lacks merit.an adverse employment action is a tangible change in working conditions that produces a material employment disadvantage.wedow city of.city,cir quotation omitted.a negative performance review is not in itself an adverse employment action and it is actionable only if the employer subsequently uses that review to alter the terms or conditions of employment to the detriment of the employee.burchett target,cir.although thomas was required to fill out a form twice as a result of falling asleep and being tardy to work,and both of these incidents appeared on her employee evaluation on which thomas received a satisfactory suffered no disciplinary action or material change in her working conditions as a result.furthermore,evaluations do not become part of the kcpd employee permanent personnel file,and there is no indication the defendants used thomas evaluation as a basis to alter detrimentally the terms or conditions of thomas employment.see spears.dep t of corr.and human,cir.
additionally,thomas fails to show kcpd requirement for her to undergo an ffd evaluation was related to her age.thomas points to no evidence indicating younger employees were treated more favorably than she.further,even assuming thomas could establish a prima facie case of age discrimination with regard to the ffd evaluation,we conclude the defendants proffered legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons for their actions,and thomas fails to demonstrate the defendants proffered reasons were a mere pretext for discrimination.
finally,thomas puts forth a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge under the adea because she is at least forty years of age,was terminated by kcpd,was meeting kcpd legitimate performance expectations,and was replaced by a younger employee.see haas,at.thus,the burden shifts to the defendants to articulate a legitimate,nondiscrimina
