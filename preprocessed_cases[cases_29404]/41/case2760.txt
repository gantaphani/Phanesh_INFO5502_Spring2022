plaintiffs appeal from the district court dismissal of their civil rico claim against rite aid of alabama,in which plaintiffs argued that rite aid had implemented a scheme to defraud its uninsured consumers of prescription medication by charging them higher prices for medication than it charged its insured customers,and failing to disclose this fact.plaintiffs contend that this differential pricing policy violated federal statutes prohibiting mail and wire fraud,and that violations of those statutes constitute predicate offenses giving rise to civil rico liability.the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim,finding that appellees had no affirmative duty to disclose their pricing practices,and that silence in the absence of a duty to speak could not constitute fraud.the district court relied almost exclusively upon the common law of alabama to come to its conclusion.we find that the district court exclusive focus on state law in evaluating the scope of the federal mail and wire fraud statutes was unduly narrow.nonetheless,the district court ultimate conclusion in this case was aid was not subject to a duty to reveal its differential pricing policy,and its failure to disclose its retail pricing structure was not fraudulent.we therefore affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
a delaware corporation,is a large retail pharmacy chain,with over employees in more than store locations.the corporation does business in over states both directly and through its wholly owned subsidiaries.rite aid of alabama is a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent corporation,and handles retail operations throughout the state.
the plaintiffs are residents of madison county,alabama,and were regular customers of a local rite aid pharmacy.at some point s between july of and october of,each of the plaintiffs lacked medical insurance that would reimburse them for the cost of prescription medication.they therefore personally bore the costs of their prescription drug purchases from rite aid during the periods that they were uninsured.
on september,plaintiffs initiated this action in the district court,alleging that rite aid maintained an elaborate scheme to defraud uninsured customers by increasing the prices of prescription drugs for customers lacking insurance.plaintiffs claimed that rite aid maintained a policy of charging the uninsured higher prices for prescription medication,and failed to disclose this fact to its uninsured consumers.rite aid allegedly implemented this policy in three ways a through an online computer network that would automatically increase the price of prescription drugs once the operator noted that the customer was uninsured,b through managerial and staff training policies that ensured that employees would know to increase the retail price for uninsured consumers,and c through rite aid intensive monitoring of the extent to which its individual pharmacies participated in up charging individual consumers through the online computer system.plaintiffs charged that this pricing policy and its implementation were little more than fraudulent attempts to prey upon the vulnerabilities of uninsured consumers,and because implementing the pricing policy involved the use of interstate wires and mails,rite aid actions constituted mail and wire fraud in violation of and.as such,plaintiffs alleged that mail and wire fraud were the relevant predicate offenses for a civil rico action,and sought relief pursuant to a d the civil rico act.plaintiffs also sought relief on several state law claims arising out of the transactions,and asked the court to certify as a class all uninsured consumers of prescription drugs that had patronized rite aid pharmacies over the past five years.on october,plaintiffs amended their complaint,adding a new named plaintiff and amplifying their civil rico charges.
rite aid responded to the charge by filing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the gist of rite aid motion was that plaintiffs failed to allege a predicate offense as required by the provisions of the rico act,because the conduct ascribed to rite aid in the complaint,even if true,could not constitute mail or wire fraud under the terms of the relevant federal statutes.rite aid argued that retailers have no affirmative duty to disclose their pricing schemes to consumers as such,their failure to disclose the pricing scheme could not legally be fraudulent.
the district court granted rite aid rule b motion.the court focused its attention on the narrow question of whether the federal mail and wire fraud statutes imposed a duty of disclosure upon rite aid in this case.relying heavily upon alabama common law,the court determined that rite aid owed no such duty of disclosure to plaintiffs.with plaintiff rico claim thereby dismissed,the court had no jurisdictional foundation to review plaintiff separate state law claims,and declined to hear them.plaintiffs filed this appeal in a timely fashion.
discussion 
plaintiffs essentially make two arguments on appeal.first,they contend that the district court erred in relying upon state law to ascertain whether rite aid owed plaintiffs a duty to disclose their pricing policies pursuant to and.plaintiffs contend that questions involving the interpretation of the mail and wire fraud statutes are matters of federal law and federal law alone.secondly,plaintiffs contend that rite aid owed its uninsured consumers a duty to disclose its pricing structure,and that the failure to do so subjects rite aid to liability under the mail and wire fraud statutes.
we apply de novo review to a district court dismissal of an action for failure to state a claim.see harper blockbuster entertainment,cir.a court may dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim only if it is clear that the plaintiff alleged no facts which could lead to any judicial relief.see hishon king spalding,d stephens,cir delong equipment washington mills abrasive,cir.
the provisions of et the rico act provide civil and criminal liability for persons engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity.see.persons injured by reasons of a rico violation have a civil cause of action under the terms of the act.see.the four elements of civil rico liability are conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.see durham business management,cir internal quotation marks omitted.plaintiffs in such an action must identify and prove a pattern of racketeering activity,defined as two predicate acts of racketeering activity within a year period.see.the phrase racketeering activity is defined as including any act which is indictable under a lengthy list of criminal offenses,including the federal statutes prohibiting mail and wire fraud.plaintiffs in this action seek to show that rite aid violated the federal mail and wire fraud statutes,and thus committed the requisite predicate acts for civil rico liability.
a plaintiff must prove the following elements to establish liability under the federal mail and wire fraud statutes that defendants knowingly devised or participated in a scheme to defraud plaintiffs,that they did so willingly with an intent to defraud,and that the defendants used the mails or the interstate wires for the purpose of executing the scheme.see neder united states,d united states,cir.intent to defraud need not be shown through active omissions can be fraudulent if they are intended to create a false impression.see beck prupis,cir,at.plaintiffs in the instant case charge that rite aid suppressed the fact that it was charging uninsured consumers a premium price for prescription medication,and that this omission was enough to show a fraudulent intent by rite aid.
the district court found that no liability could attach under the mail and wire fraud statutes unless rite aid was found to have violated a duty to disclose the pricing information to the plaintiffs.there has been some dispute at the circuit level concerning when a duty to disclose can arise for the purposes of the federal mail and wire fraud statutes.plaintiffs contend that a duty need not be formally imposed by statute or
