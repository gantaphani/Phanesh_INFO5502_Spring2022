charlene wisbey appeals the district court dismissal on summary judgment of her lawsuit alleging violations of the americans with disabilities act ada,and the family medical leave act fmla.for the reasons explained below,we affirm.
as this appeal is from a grant of summary judgment,we review the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see reed city of charles,cir.beginning in,wisbey worked as an emergency dispatcher ii for the city of lincoln,nebraska the city.the position required wisbey to receiv e calls for emergency service and dispatch emergency service units on a regular basis.because of the potentially aspect of her position,the city expected wisbey to function accurately while working under considerable pressure and to think and act quickly and calmly in emergency situations.id.at.prior to,wisbey was never disciplined for missing work or for any inability to perform the tasks of her position.in fact,her performance evaluations reflected positive remarks.
from january through february,wisbey utilized a significant amount of sick leave due to an upper respiratory infection.wisbey was not compensated for this leave because she had previously exhausted her allotted sick leave.the city provided wisbey a written warning for taking excessive leave and recommended that she apply for intermittent leave under the fmla wisbey complied with the request and on february,she applied for intermittent fmla leave on the basis of depression and anxiety,claiming on the application that she had a serious health condition that render ed her unable to perform the essential functions of her job.id.at.attached to the fmla application,wisbey submitted a medical certification from her physician,pothuloori,stating that wisbey suffer ed from recurring cycle depression,anxiety which interferes with her sleep,energy level,motivation,and concentration id.at.pothuloori certification also indicated that,although wisbey was able to perform any one or more of the essential functions of her job,she would need to take time off work intermittently over the next months or longer.id.pothuloori left the blank labeled anticipated return to work date empty.id.
because the medical certification from pothuloori indicated that wisbey concentration and motivation could be affected,julie righter,the communications manager of the city emergency services,began to question whether wisbey was still able to adequately perform her job as an emergency dispatcher.righter shared her concerns with don taute,the city personnel director,who suggested further evaluation of wisbey.righter asked william kostner,a risk manager,to schedule an appointment for wisbey to undergo a exam.
kostner scheduled an appointment for wisbey with eli chesen,a psychiatrist,requesting that chesen perform a exam to determine,in his professional medical opinion,if wisbey was qualified to continue her work as an emergency dispatcher id.at.to aid in his assessment,the city provided chesen with information regarding the duties and job description of wisbey emergency dispatcher position.her position required that she possess the ability to act quickly and calmly in emergency situations and the a bility to obtain accurate and complete information from callers who may be frantic and incoherent due to emergency conditions.id.at.
during her appointment with chesen,wisbey described her lengthy battle with depression and insomnia and stated that the emergency nature of her job exacerbated those conditions.for example,wisbey described how she often witnessed deadly events over the radio.after the examination,chesen submitted a report on his findings.the report stated that wisbey suffered from chronic relapsing depression unipolar depression which intermittently interferes with her ability to function at full capacity at work tiredness and that she was not fit for duty as described in her job description,especially as related to tiredness,her ability to concentrate and her ongoing propensity to likely miss work.id.at.
after receiving this report on march,the city expressed to wisbey its concern that she could not perform her job,and placed wisbey on administrative leave with pay.on the afternoon of may,righter received an undated letter,authored by pothuloori,which disagreed with chesen conclusion that wisbey was unfit for duty.on may,wisbey testified at a hearing before the city personnel board that she stayed home from work when she felt tired,stating,
a t times my depression arises,and it makes me very tired where i can sleep straight hours.and that where it interferes.being tired at work was not ever a problem.but going on a string of six,seven straight days,i can get very tired due to the medication i on or due to the fact that i just get tired.
id.at.wisbey also stated that she would never endanger anybody on the street by going to work tired or unprepared mentally.id.at.
on april,the city met with wisbey and provided her with a letter explaining that she was being terminated based on chesen determination that she was unfit for duty.the letter stated,for your own safety it is important that you not continue in your present position.id.at.the letter also encouraged wisbey to avail herself of city long term disability benefits.id.wisbey filed suit in nebraska state court,claiming that the city violated her rights under the ada and the fmla.the city removed the case to federal court.wisbey and the city filed cross motions for summary judgment.
the district court granted the city motion for summary judgment and denied summary judgment to wisbey,dismissing the case.as to wisbey ada claim,the district court found that wisbey failed to show that the city perceived her as disabled as that term is defined under the ada no discriminatory evidence existed as to the city decision to terminate wisbey wisbey could not show that the city failed to reasonably accommodate her because her claim was premised on a right to recovery solely on the basis of perceived disability and even if the city was required to provide a reasonable accommodation,wisbey failed to present any evidence of a feasible accommodation.order.as for wisbey fmla claim,the district court found that in requesting indefinite,intermittent,leave,wisbey did not show a right to leave protected by the fmla wisbey failed to show that her employment termination was caused by the fact that she requested leave and wisbey was acceptably terminated based on medical information that she was unable to adequately perform her job and not because she requested family medical leave.id.at.
on appeal,wisbey argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the city,because the requirement that she submit to a exam was a violation of the ada and the fmla and that there is,at a minimum,a question of fact as to whether she could perform the essential functions of her job,but was terminated due to the city perception of her as disabled.appellant br.summary judgment is proper if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,demonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.thomas union pac,cir.however,summary judgment should be used sparingly in employment discrimination cases.arnold nursing rehab.ctr.at good shepherd,cir.indeed,we are particularly deferential to the nonmovant in employment discrimination cases because the cases often lack direct evidence and are decided on mere inferences.see land washington county,cir.notwithstanding this point,summary judgment is proper here because wisbey has failed to establish a factual dispute regarding any essential element of her case.see arnold,at 
from wisbey convoluted argument we gather she challenges the district court finding that no ada violation occurred,insisting that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the city regarded her as disabled she could perform the essential functions of her job and the city failed to provide her a reasonable accommodation.we are unpersuaded by wisbey attempt to improperly stretch ada principles.
the purpose of the ada is to eliminate discrimination against qualified
