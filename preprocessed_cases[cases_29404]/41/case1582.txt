tammy hulsey appeals the judgment of the district upholding the social security commissioner decision to deny her application for supplemental security income ssi benefits under title xvi of the social security act ssa.we affirm.
as of her most recent administrative hearing,hulsey was years old.her education ended after attending the eighth or ninth grade.she has not worked since,the year in which she claims that she became disabled due to an assortment of maladies.before the onset of her alleged disability,hulsey was employed in several jobs,including most recently as a cleaner for a business that had been damaged by a fire.the administrative record shows that hulsey has a history of treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome,hypertension,headaches,depression,anxiety,and borderline intellectual functioning.
hulsey pursuit of ssi benefits has been ongoing for nearly two decades.in april,hulsey filed the application for ssi benefits at issue in this case hulsey claimed in the application that she was disabled due to carpal tunnel syndrome and hypertension.hulsey requested and received a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.the alj ruled that hulsey did not qualify as disabled under the ssa,and thus that she was not entitled to ssi benefits.the appeals council vacated the alj decision and remanded the case for evaluation of newly submitted medical records that contained diagnoses of a somatoform disorder and borderline intellectual functioning 
in february,the alj convened a second hearing,after which the alj again ruled that hulsey was not disabled under the ssa.after the appeals council denied hulsey request for review,hulsey sought review of the denial of benefits in the district court.the district court remanded the case for further consideration of hulsey residual functional capacity.
after an august hearing,the alj ruled that hulsey was not disabled.the alj evaluated hulsey claim using the evaluation process found in the social security regulations.at steps one and two,the alj found that hulsey had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the onset of her claimed disability,and that hulsey ailments constituted severe impairments that impacted her ability to perform basic work activities.at step three,the alj determined that hulsey impairments did not meet or equal an impairment listed in the regulations.the alj concluded at step four that hulsey could return to her past relevant work as a cleaner,binding machine operator,or cashier.in finding that hulsey could return to past relevant work,the alj relied upon a vocational expert testimony in response to a hypothetical posed by the alj that precluded work with frequent bilateral grasping and fingering.because hulsey could return to past relevant work,according to the alj,she was not disabled under the ssa.id.f.the appeals council denied hulsey subsequent request for review,and hulsey sought review in the district court.
in a february decision,the district court found that the vocational expert testimony that hulsey could return to her past work as a cleaner,binding machine operator,or cashier was inconsistent with the physical limitations described in the alj hypothetical,which specifically precluded jobs that involved frequent bilateral grasping or bilateral fingering.the court cited the dictionary of occupational titles dot,which stated that each of hulsey three prior positions involved either frequent fingering or handling.as a result,the court concluded that hulsey satisfied her burden at step four of the evaluation process to prove that she could not return to past relevant work.the court remanded the case to the agency for evaluation under step five,which places the burden on the commissioner to show that the claimant could perform other jobs available in the national economy.id.g.
in july,the alj held a fourth administrative hearing.the alj again concluded that hulsey impairments did not preclude her from returning to past relevant work,and thus that hulsey was not disabled.the appeals council remanded,because the district court ruling required the alj to evaluate hulsey case under step five of the evaluation process.
the alj held a fifth administrative hearing in april.at the hearing,the alj provided the vocational expert with the following hypothetical.
i want you to assume that you dealing with an individual who is the same age as hulsey,w ith the same educational background and past work experience.further assume that the individual is limited to light work with the following additional limitations.they sic could do any jobs that would require a constant level of repetitive handling.no repetitive bending and stooping.no overhead work.it would have to be work of an unskilled nature involving only superficial interpersonal contact.
in response to the hypothetical,the vocational expert testified that the individual described would be able to perform cashier or housekeeping work available in the national economy.the vocational expert did not specify the dot classification numbers for the occupations that she identified.on the basis of the vocational expert testimony,the alj concluded that the commissioner met its burden to show that hulsey retained the capacity to perform jobs that exist in the national economy,and that hulsey was not disabled under the ssa.
the alj written opinion discussed the medical evidence in the administrative record,including the evidence of hulsey borderline intellectual functioning.the alj noted that gerald fowler and george deroeck,who examined hulsey in and,respectively,each diagnosed hulsey with borderline intellectual functioning.fowler opined that only a blood relative or close family friend could tolerate hulsey borderline intellectual functioning and her preoccupation and fear of pain due to her somatoform disorder.the alj discounted fowler opinion,finding that it was inconsistent with fowler own clinical notes and was based largely on hulsey subjective complaints.deroeck,on the other hand,concluded that hulsey ability to function in a work setting was adequate with respect to relatively straightforward tasks that require limited social interaction.
after hulsey filed written exceptions to the alj decision,the appeals council assumed jurisdiction over the case.see b.the appeals council adopted the alj discussion of the medical evidence.based on that medical evidence,the appeals council concluded that hulsey has borderline intellectual functioning which might restrict her from performing detailed or complex work.the appeals council disregarded the alj finding that hulsey could work as a cashier,because the grasping and fingering limitations that precluded her from returning to a cashier position on step four of the evaluation process also precluded her from performing other cashier work on step five.but hulsey impairments,according to the appeals council,did not prevent her from performing housekeeping work.the appeals council therefore ruled that the commissioner met its burden on step five,and that hulsey was not disabled.
on appeal to the district court,hulsey contended that the alj hypothetical question to the vocational expert did not adequately account for hulsey borderline intellectual functioning and understated the effects of her other mental impairments.as the district court stated,hulsey d id not raise any claim in her appeal related to the appeals council analysis of her physical impairments.the court affirmed the denial of benefits,ruling that the alj appropriately accounted for hulsey impairments by posing a hypothetical to the vocational expert based on a person with the residual functional capacity to perform unskilled work where interpersonal contact is superficial.
we review de novo the district court decision upholding the denial of social security benefits.we will affirm if the commissioner decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.mcnamara astrue,cir.substantial evidence means less than a preponderance,but sufficient evidence that a reasonable person would find adequate to support the decision.
a vocational expert testimony constitutes substantial evidence when it is based on a hypot
