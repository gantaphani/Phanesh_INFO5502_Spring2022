five hospitals contend that the secretary of health and human services improperly implemented a statutory provision in a way that over the years has progressively reduced medicare payments for inpatient services.in particular,they challenge rules governing reimbursements for the and fiscal years.because the secretary failed to provide a reasoned response to the hospitals comments regarding those rules,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment in the secretary favor and remand for further proceedings in light of the guidance set forth in this opinion.
established in,medicare provides federally funded health insurance for the elderly and disabled.methodist hosp.of sacramento shalala.the secretary administers the program through the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms.originally,medicare reimbursed hospitals based on the reasonable costs they incurred in providing services to medicare patients.id.at quoting b.concerned that this system created inadequate incentives for hospitals to control costs,congress in required the secretary to implement a prospective payment system under which hospitals would receive a fixed payment for inpatient services.id.since hospitals receive the same payment under this system regardless of their actual costs,congress believed that it would encourage efficiency by rewarding cost effective hospital practices.id.quoting,at,reprinted in.
in calculating prospective payment rates,cms begins with a figure called the standardized amount,which roughly reflects the average cost incurred by hospitals nationwide for each patient they treat and then discharge.see d changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems and fiscal year rates,hereinafter final rule.central to the issue before us,cms does not calculate the standardized amount from scratch each year.instead,following congress directive,it calculated the standardized amount for a base year and has since carried that figure forward,updating it annually for inflation.see b b i,d,d a iv ii c d final rule.at see also prospective payments for medicare inpatient hospital services,explaining how the health care financing administration,cms predecessor,developed cost data at the inception of the inpatient prospective payment system.
to account for the fact that labor costs vary across the country,cms determines the proportion of the standardized amount attributable to wages and costs and then multiplies that proportion by a wage index that reflects the relation between the local average of hospital wages and the national average of hospital wages.appellee br.see also d h,d e se.med.ctr.sebelius.unlike the standardized amount,wage indexes are calculated anew each year instead of being carried forward from one year to the next.
the standardized amount is also modified to account for the fact that the costs of treating patients vary based on the patients diagnoses.medicare patients are classified into different groups based on their diagnoses,and each of these groups is assigned a particular weight representing the relationship between the cost of treating patients within that group and the average cost of treating all medicare patients.see d.
putting all these components together,cms determines how much a hospital should be paid for treating a medicare patient by performing the following calculation where sa standardized amount labor the proportion of the standardized amount attributable to wages and costs the proportion of the standardized amount not attributable to costs wi wage index and drg weight the weight assigned to a particular group 
sa sa labor wi drg weight payment 
in,congress determined that a n anomaly that exists with the way area wage indexes are applied has resulted in some urban hospitals being paid less than the average rural hospital in their states,at.to correct this problem,congress provided in the balanced budget act of bba that the wage index assigned to a hospital in an urban area must be at least as great as the wage index assigned to rural hospitals within the same state,a,stat,reprinted at note t he area wage index applicable under d e to any hospital which is not located in a rural area may not be less than the area wage index applicable under such section to hospitals located in rural areas in the state in which the hospital is located.this provision is commonly referred to as the rural floor.
potentially,the rural floor could affect the total amount of money medicare pays hospitals each year.for example,if cms increased the wage indexes of urban hospitals to bring them in line with the wage indexes of rural hospitals in the same state,payments to those urban hospitals would increase.all other things being equal,the aggregate amount of medicare payments would increase as well.but congress required the secretary to take steps to ensure that all other things would not be equal.it mandated that the rural floor be budget neutral.in other words,it required the secretary to implement the rural floor in a manner that would have no effect on the annual total of medicare payments made to all hospitals throughout the country for inpatient services.cape cod hosp.sebelius,d.congress accomplished this through bba section b,which provides the secretary shall adjust the area wage index in a manner which assures that aggregate payments in a fiscal year for the operating costs of inpatient hospital services are not greater or less than those which would have been made in the year if the rural floor did not apply.
the five hospitals that are appellants herein challenge how the secretary has implemented this provision.rather than adjusting area wage indexes to achieve budget neutrality,as the hospitals argue the statute requires,the secretary adjusted the standardized amount.thus,if the rural floor threatened to increase aggregate payments in a particular year,she applied a downward adjustment to the standardized amount to offset the effect of the rural floor.see final rule.at.the secretary then carried forward the adjusted standardized amount from year to year,purportedly making further adjustments only as necessary to account for incremental changes in each new year.see id.explaining that cms would apply the budget neutrality adjustment factor to the standardized amount without removing the effect of the prior year budget neutrality adjustment.the parties contrast this cumulative approach of carrying forward prior adjustments and making incremental annual changes with a noncumulative approach under which the secretary would calculate the full amount of the requisite adjustment anew each year.since the cumulative and noncumulative approaches are simply different methods of making the same arithmetic computation,they should produce identical results if performed correctly.the problem,the hospitals contend,is that the secretary botched the math,mixing the cumulative and noncumulative methods in a way that gradually decreased medicare payments for inpatient services over time.
to understand the error the hospitals accuse the secretary of making,consider the following hypothetical taken from the hospitals briefs.imagine an employee normally earns per hour.his employer decides to give him a company car,the value of which equates to compensation of per hour.to avoid an increase in the employee overall,to achieve budget neutrality the employer reduces the employee wage to per hour.now imagine that next year,the employee receives a nicer car worth per hour.to calculate what the employee wage should then be to keep his overall compensation at per hour,the employer could use either a cumulative or noncumulative approach.under the cumulative method,the employer would subtract the incremental increase in the value of the car from the employee current wage of to arrive at a new,wage of.under the noncumulative approach,the employer would simply subtract the full value of the car from the desired total compensation to arrive at the same wage of per hour.but it would make no sense for the employer to subtract the full value of the new car from the employee current wage and thus pay him only per hour.doing so would not be budget neutral it would reduce the employee total compensation by per hour.yet this is essentially what the hospitals accuse cms of doing in calculating the annual adjustment to account for the rural floor.specifically,the hospitals argue that cms has duplicated prior adjustments by each year calculating the full amount of the adjustment necessary to counteract the effect of the rural floor and then applying that adjustment to a figure that includes adjustments carried over from previous years.
according to the hospitals,this error first came to light in a may email exchange in which a cms employee informed a consultant working with the hospitals that cms calculated the factor necessary to account for the rural floor by comparing projected aggregate payments for the coming fiscal year with the rural floor applied with the aggregate payments that would have been made in the current fiscal year without the rural floor.cms then reduced the standardized amount to account for the full difference between these two figures,even though the standardized amount being carried over already included reductions from prior years rural floor adjustments.appellants opening br.this email exchange,the hospitals argue,indicates that cms illogically combined the cumulative and noncumulative methods for calculating adjustments.each year,cms calculated the entire payment effect of the rural floor but applied the corresponding adjustment to a figure that already incorporated previous years rural floor adjustments,thereby duplicating prior adjustments in a manner that progressively reduced aggregate payments over time.id.at.
when cms failed to respond to an email pointing out this apparent error,the hospital consultant again attempted to bring the error to cms attention in a comment letter regarding the agency proposed rules for the inpatient prospective payment system.cms notice of proposed rulemaking nprm required comments to be submitted by june.proposed changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems and fiscal year rates,hereinafter proposed rule.although the notice indicated that comments could be hand delivered to cms baltimore office,it also stated,if you intend to deliver your comments to the baltimore address,please call telephone number in advance to schedule your arrival with one of our staff members.id.the consultant hand delivered his comment to the baltimore office without first calling this number.in a sworn declaration,the consultant stated that he called an individual he knew who worked in cms division of acute care,the part of the agency responsible for inpatient prospective payment issues.giovanis decl.the cms employee met the consultant in the lobby of the baltimore office,accepted the comment letter,and signed a delivery receipt confirming that the comment was submitted on june,three days before the end of the comment period.see id.the record contains no evidence of what the employee did with the letter after receiving it.but what is clear is that cms failed to respond to the consultant comment in its final rule.see final rule.
following the rulemaking,cms reevaluated its rural floor adjustment methodology.cape cod,d at.specifically,in may,it published a proposed rule for fiscal year that would offset the rural floor by adjusting area wage indexes rather than by adjusting the standardized amount as cms had done in the past.see also proposed changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems and fiscal year rates,fed reg,may,hereinafter proposed rule.cms also proposed a special rural floor adjustment that would slightly increase the standardized amount.proposed rule.at.nowhere in the nprm,however,did it explain the purpose of this adjustment.
after requesting and being denied additional information regarding cms proposed rule,the hospitals submitted comments that noted,among other things,that the agency proposals appeared inadequate to reverse the cumulative reduction in aggregate payments caused by cms apparent errors in calculating adjustments for prior years.many other hospitals and trade associations submitted similar comments.
in its final rule,cms adopted its proposal and applied the adjustment to area wage indexes rather than to the standardized amount.see changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems and fiscal year rates,hereinafter final rule.cms pointed out that although its previous adjustments to the standardized amount had been cumulative,its adjustment of wage indexes would be noncumulative.id.at.responding to commenters requests for more information regarding the special rural floor adjustment to the standardized amount,cms explained that it was a adjustment meant to address the transition from a cumulative budget neutrality adjustment to a noncumulative adjustment.id.at.the agency made clear that the adjustment removed only the effect of the adjustment to the standardized amount,thus leaving in place all adjustments made before.id.the rural floor adjustment removes the effect of the budget neutrality adjustment applied in fiscal year to the standardized amount for application of the rural floor.in response to commenters concerns that the changes cms proposed were insufficient to remedy the effects of previous miscalculations,the agency stated that the calculation of budget neutrality in past fiscal years was not within the scope of its rulemaking.id.at.without admitting that it made computational errors in prior years,cms declared that even if such errors were made,it would not make an adjustment to make up for those errors when setting rates for fiscal year.id.f inality,cms explained,is critical to a prospective payment system.id.as a result,it concluded that the need to establish final prospective rates outweighs the greater accuracy it might gain if it retroactively recomputed rates whenever an error is discovered.id.
all five hospitals that are parties to this appeal filed timely petitions challenging the final rule with the department of health and human services provider reimbursement review board.see.two hospitals also challenged the final rule.after the review board determined it lacked authority to resolve the legal questions presented by the hospitals,they filed a complaint against the secretary in the district court for the district of columbia.see id.f permitting medical providers to file suit in federal district court following a review board determination that it lacks authority to decide the legal question presented.the parties submitted for summary judgment.the secretary also filed a motion to strike,arguing that the consultant email exchange and comment letter,which the hospitals had submitted to the district court,were not properly part of the rulemaking record.without those documents,the secretary asserted,the hospitals were unable to overcome her contention that they had waived their objection to the rule by failing to raise it during the rulemaking process.
although the district court granted the secretary motion to strike with respect to the email exchange,it ruled that the secretary had improperly excluded the consultant comment letter from the rulemaking record.cape cod,d at.in particular,the district court determined that the cms employee acceptance of the letter indicated that the consultant submission was acceptable despite the consultant failure to call the telephone number listed in the nprm.id.at.on the merits,the district court largely rejected the hospitals challenges to the and rules and entered summary judgment in the secretary favor.according to the court,the secretary reasonably interpreted bba section b as imposing upon her no obligation to reconsider adjustments calculated in prior years.id.at.the court also concluded that the secretary sufficiently responded to comments regarding the proposed rule.id.at.although acknowledging that the secretary failed to respond to the hospital consultant comment letter regarding the rule,id.at,the court determined that by making an upward adjustment to the standardized amount in to reverse the effect of the adjustment,cms moot ed the hospitals challenge to the rule,id.at.the secretary does not defend this ruling on appeal,and we agree with the hospitals that since the rule in no way compensated for any underpayments that might have been made in,a live controversy remains regarding the hospitals objection to the rule.
the hospitals argue that cms and rules were arbitrary and capricious and violated bba section b,the provision.see a requiring a court to hold unlawful and set aside a final agency action found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.in response,the secretary contends that she acted within the scope of the discretion congress afforded her in achieving budget neutrality.furthermore,she argues,the district court erred in supplementing the rulemaking record with the consultant june comment letter and should instead have ruled that the hospitals waived their objection to the rule by failing to follow the proper procedures in submitting the letter.we review the district court decision to supplement the rulemaking record for abuse of discretion.see james madison,by hecht ludwig.our review of the hospitals contention that cms and rules were arbitrary and capricious and violated bba section b is plenary.see methodist,at.
the rulemaking 
the hospitals contend that in,as in previous years,the secretary improperly calculated a adjustment that compensated for the full effect of the rural floor,rather than the incremental annual change,and then applied this adjustment to the adjusted standardized amount,which already included similar adjustments from prior years.according to the hospitals,this incoherent admixture of cumulative and noncumulative methodologies produced aggregate payments that were less than the amount that would have been paid in if the rural floor had not been applied,thus violating section b requirement.appellants opening br.
for her part,the secretary argues that the hospitals waived their objection to the rule by failing to follow the secretary clear and express procedures for commenting on the proposed rule.appellee br.in particular,the secretary emphasizes that the consultant failed to abide by the nprm request that individuals planning to hand deliver their comments to cms baltimore office first call a particular telephone number to schedule the delivery.see proposed rule.at.according to the secretary,the consultant failure to call this number hampered the agency ability to ensure that staff members responsible for the rulemaking received the comment in a timely manner and had the ability to consider it before issuing the final rule.as a result,the secretary contends,the consultant letter was properly excluded from the rulemaking record,thus depriving the hospitals of a basis for pursuing their challenge to the rule.
where,as here,an agency has issued a rule under the administrative procedure act provisions,see,courts ordinarily refuse to consider objections not submitted in accordance with agency procedures during the rulemaking process.see appalachian power epa,f d.s imple fairness to those who are engaged in the tasks of administration requires as a general rule that courts should not topple over administrative decisions unless the administrative body not only has erred but has erred against objection made at the time appropriate under its practice.united states tucker truck lines.under the unique circumstances of this case,however,barring the hospitals challenge to the rule would be patently unfair.through their consultant,the hospitals submitted a comment letter outlining their objection to the rule to a cms employee who worked in the very division responsible for inpatient prospective payment issues.giovanis decl.see also cerne decl.true,the consultant failed to call the telephone number listed in the nprm before delivering the letter.but the cms employee nonetheless accepted the letter without even hinting that the consultant submission was in any way improper.although the employee now asserts that she was unaware that the document was a comment regarding a proposed rule,see cerne decl,she signed a receipt expressly stating that the document was a comment letter to the centers for medicare and medicaid services on the proposed fiscal year inpatient prospective payment system changes.furthermore,since the employee admits that she has some familiarity with the annual rulemaking process,she has no basis for plausibly claiming either that she failed to understand what the document she accepted was or that she failed to appreciate the importance of ensuring that it was forwarded to the staff members responsible for the rulemaking.id.given these facts,we agree with the district court that the consultant was entitled to presume that his submission was acceptable.cape cod,d at.
in reaching this conclusion,we in no way suggest that agencies lack authority to impose and enforce submission requirements of the kind at issue here.to the contrary,we have little doubt that the cms employee to whom the hospital consultant tendered his comment letter could have refused to accept it based on the consultant failure to call the prescribed telephone number.but since the cms employee accepted the letter without objection,the agency may not now complain about the consultant failure to call the number listed in the nprm.the district court thus did not abuse its discretion in supplementing the rulemaking record with the consultant letter.see james madison,at noting that courts may supplement the official administrative record compiled by an agency when the agency has deliberately or negligently excluded documents that may have been adverse to its decision see also kent.levy court epa,supplementing the administrative record with internal epa documents that the agency negligently failed to consider during the rulemaking process.and because cms failed to address the consultant letter when issuing its final rule,we shall remand for cms to provide a reasoned response to this relevant and significant public comment.pub.citizen,faa,the requirement that agency action not be arbitrary or capricious includes a requirement that the agency adequately explain its result and respond to relevant and significant public comments.internal citation and quotation marks omitted see also fox television stations,fcc,cir,modified on reh g.
in so doing,we have no need to decide whether,as the hospitals argue,bba section b express reference to area wage index es required cms to offset the effect of the rural floor by adjusting area wage indexes rather than the standardized amount.perhaps,as the hospitals contend,adjusting wage indexes would have averted the computational errors alleged in this litigation.but even assuming that section b requires cms to achieve budget neutrality only through adjustments to wage issue,we reiterate,we are not hospitals concede that cms departure from the statutory language would have had no practical effect had the agency correctly implemented its chosen methodology of cumulatively adjusting the standardized amount.appellants opening br.because courts must overlook harmless agency errors,pdk labs.dea,see also requiring courts reviewing agency action to take due account of the rule of prejudicial error,we understand the primary issue with respect to the rule to be whether cms overly deflated aggregate payments by incorrectly calculating adjustments to the standardized amount,not whether the agency has committed some free floating statutory error that may have no practical effect.
the rulemaking 
as explained above,in the secretary switched from making cumulative adjustments to the standardized amount to making noncumulative adjustments to the wage index.in connection with this change,the secretary made a small,adjustment that reversed the effect of the adjustment.see final rule.at.the hospitals argue that in transitioning from a cumulative to a noncumulative methodology,the secretary should have increased the standardized amount sufficiently to reverse the effects of all prior adjustments,not just the one made in.the secretary failure to do so,the hospitals contend,resulted in aggregate payments in that were less than those which would have been made had the rural floor never been enacted,thus violating bba
