factual and procedural background 
factual and statutory background 
the supreme court has summarized that 
congress created the medicaid program in by adding title xix to the social security act.the program authorizes federal financial assistance to states that choose to reimburse certain costs of medical treatment for needy persons.in order to participate in the medicaid program,a state must have a plan for medical assistance approved by the secretary of health and human services secretary.b.a state plan defines the categories of individuals eligible for benefits and the specific kinds of medical services that are covered.a.the plan must provide coverage for the categorically needy and,at the state option,may also cover the medically needy.
pharm.research and mfrs.of am.walsh,internal footnotes omitted.the court explained that categorically needy groups include individuals eligible for cash benefits under the aid to families with dependent children afdc program,the aged,blind,or disabled individuals who qualify for supplemental security income ssi benefits,and other groups such as pregnant women and children entitled to coverage.a a i.id.at.the term medically needy refers to individuals who meet the nonfinancial eligibility requirements for inclusion in one of the groups covered under medicaid,but whose income or resources exceed the financial eligibility requirements for categorically needy eligibility.a c.id.at.
when a population is covered under a state medicaid plan,federal law sets limits on the amount and type of cost sharing that a state can require participants to contribute to their health care.as we explained in spry.thompson,provides that subsection a permits a state plan to impose nominal premiums and cost sharing on mandatory populations.subsection b permits a state plan to impose premiums and nominal cost sharing on populations who are medicaid eligible,optional,medically needy populations,cir.
in addition to state medicaid plans,the secretary can authorize states to operate demonstration projects pursuant to.in the case of any experimental,pilot,or demonstration project which,in the judgment of the secretary,is likely to assist in promoting the objectives of the act the secretary may waive compliance with certain medicaid rules,including restrictions.a.section also authorizes the secretary to approve regard ing demonstration project costs as expenditures under the state plan.a a.when demonstration project costs are regarded as expenditures under the state plan,the federal government can reimburse the state for some of those costs.see spry,at.patients who are eligible for services by way of the secretary waiver are know as expansion populations.phx.mem l hosp.sebelius,cir see also spry,at a demonstration project may cover people who would not be eligible for medicaid without a waiver from the secretary.the agencies call these people expansion populations.
states can also exceed the normal limitations on medicaid cost sharing through f and.subsection f of provides 
no deduction,cost sharing,or similar charge may be imposed under any waiver authority of the secretary,except as provided in sections a and b of this section and section of this title,unless such waiver is for a demonstration project which the secretary finds will test a unique and previously untested use of copayments,is limited to a period of not more than two years,will provide benefits to recipients of medical assistance which can reasonably be expected to be equivalent to the risks to the recipients,is based on a reasonable hypothesis which the demonstration is designed to test in a methodologically sound manner,including the use of control groups of similar recipients of medical assistance in the area,and is voluntary,or makes provision for assumption of liability for preventable damage to the health of recipients of medical assistance resulting from involuntary participation.
f.congress later added,which further relaxes the normal restrictions.
arizona has a state plan that only covers mandatory medicaid populations,the categorically needy.arizona state plan has never included the optional medically needy population.until,however,arizona medicaid agency,the arizona health care cost containment system ahcccs,also operated an entirely program under which people who could be medically needy obtained coverage.see phx.mem l,at during the relevant time period,the medically needy populations were part of the program.this entirely program was called medical expense deduction med.
in october,ahcccs and the united states department of health and human services hhs corresponded about arizona application for a waiver.ahcccs stated that c urrently arizona provides health care coverage with state funds to five specific groups,including the medically needy.ahcccs explained to hhs the above groups will be subsumed by this eligibility expansion.arizona will not be operating a parallel program for these same populations and will convert all existing populations into the proposed eligibility expansion.
in november,the citizens of arizona passed proposition,which expanded ahcccs coverage to childless,adults with incomes up to of the federal poverty level.the secretary approved arizona waiver application in january.under this system,ahcccs imposed nominal and copayments on needy participants,which included former med participants and proposition populations.
in may,ahcccs requested another waiver from the secretary.among other reforms,the request sought permission to increase and expand copayments for certain categories,including childless adults with incomes up to of the federal poverty level and former med participants.ahcccs may request did not specify the reason arizona sought to make these changes.ahcccs later stated that the catalyst for the waiver request was the arizona legislature direct ing it to submit a cost sharing report to the joint legislative budget committee in response to a deficit approaching billion.
in june,hhs informed ahcccs that,with respect to arizona proposal to increase cost sharing for groups that are not eligible for medicaid except through section demonstration authority,there are no legal restrictions on cost sharing.therefore,hhs advised that s uch cost sharing does not involve waivers,since the affected groups are not eligible under the state plan.
on october,ahcccs implemented a new rule that increased copayments on needy participants and made those copayments mandatory.the plaintiff class challenging the new rule in this case consists of two groups childless adults with incomes up to of the federal poverty level,and former med participants.the med participants are not categorically needy under the medicaid act,but they incur medical expenses such that their income is reduced to of the federal poverty level.in addition,some people in the med population meet the nonfinancial eligibility requirements for inclusion in one of the groups covered under medicaid.walsh,at.
in september,ahccs began sending notices to members of the plaintiff class notifying them that their copayments were going to be increased.the district court record contains three such notices that were proffered by the plaintiffs.
hhs approved arizona new rule on february,applying retroactively to october.hhs stated w e believe that the approved demonstration project will continue to serve the purposes of title xix medicaid because the demonstration project will continue to ensure wider health benefit coverage for populations.
procedural background 
plaintiffs filed this law suit in december.the complaint alleges four claims for relief defendant secretary action authorizing arizona to implement copayments exceeded his limited authority,as set forth in and,and was arbitrary and capricious defendant secretary action failed to comport with the human participants protections required by,and was arbitrary and capricious defendant director imposition of copayments violates the medicaid act,and defendant director written notice of the health care changes violates the due process clause and the medicaid act,a.plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief.
the district court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification on march.the class members are defined as all arizona health care cost containment system eligible persons in arizona who have been or will be charged copayments pursuant to arizona administrative code amended rule e.
on april,the district court granted plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction,which enjoined the director from imposing the mandatory copayments and from allowing providers to deny certain medical services because of a participant inability to pay the heightened copayments.thereafter,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.
on march,the district court granted defendant secretary motion to stay the court summary judgment ruling pending this court decision in spry thompson,cir.our court filed the spry opinion on may,and the district court lifted the stay on december.the parties cross motions for summary judgment.
on march,the district court denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted defendants motion for summary judgment.the district court determined that the secretary invoked expenditure authority under a in allowing arizona to offer the expanded coverage.plaintiffs are not eligible for medicaid under a state plan so there was no need for a waiver.thus,s ections and do not apply to plaintiffs.defendants did not act in violation of these sections.the court also concluded that plaintiffs could not be considered medically needy within the meaning of medicaid unless arizona covers this optional category in its state plan.because arizona state plan does not cover the medically needy,persons who might otherwise be in this category are instead an expansion population,just as persons who could neither be categorically needy nor medically needy under a state plan are an expansion population.
the district court then turned to whether the administrative record demonstrated that the secretary sufficiently considered factors before permitting arizona to implement its demonstration project.the district court concluded that w hether is a reasonable means of providing care to certain expansion populations during a state fiscal shortage appears consistent with the meaning of.the district court also concluded that the secretary decision was consistent with the objectives of the medicaid act because as a result of the demonstration project,plaintiffs and others within the expansion populations are provided an opportunity for health care coverage where coverage might not otherwise be provided.thus,the secretary waiver was not contrary to law or arbitrary and capricious.
with respect to the human participants claim,the district court concluded that there was no violation of because p eople in the expansion population are not made worse off by inclusion in a demonstration project less favorable to them than to the categorically and medically needy because,without the demonstration project,they would not be eligible for medicaid at all.quoting spry,at.
finally,the district court addressed plaintiffs inadequate notice claim.it concluded that a s plaintiffs are not eligible for medicaid under arizona state plan,any notice requirement under the medicaid regulations would appear not to apply.and,in the alternative,the district court concluded that the notices overall were sufficient for purposes of due process.

the administrative procedure act apa,provides for judicial review of federal agencies actions.we may reverse an agency action only if it is contrary to law or arbitrary and capricious in that 
the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.

discussion 
medicaid cost sharing restrictions do not apply to persons who could be covered by a state plan as medically needy,but are instead covered by a state demonstration project.
plaintiffs argue that defendants can not label persons described in the medicaid act as expansion populations and thereby avoid the medicaid act cost sharing protections.that is,for purposes of restrictions,the persons whom arizona has the option of covering under its state plan as medically needy do not become expansion populations because arizona has chosen not to cover them under the state plan.plaintiffs argue that the district court order should be reversed for those class members who are medically needy.
defendants argue that restrictions apply only to persons who are both statutorily eligible for medicaid coverage and identified in the state medicaid plan.in the absence of a state plan identifying and covering medically needy persons,these persons can be treated like an expansion population in a demonstration project.
neither plaintiffs nor defendants cite a provision in the medicaid act in which congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.phx.mem l,at.that is,congress has not unambiguously answered the following question are medically needy people entitled to the protections in if a state covers them pursuant to a demonstration project,and not under the state plan w hen congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue,we will defer to the secretary regulation so long as it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.christopher,at citing auer,at chevron,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
here,the secretary argues that restrictions apply only to persons who are both statutorily eligible for medicaid coverage and identified in the state medicaid plan.she argues that u nder the existing state plan,plaintiffs are not eligible for medicaid and are,instead,an expansion population to which the cost restrictions do not apply.the secretary regulations are consistent with this interpretation of the statute.
in et,the secretary specifies the option for coverage of medically needy individuals.section states that t he state plan must specify the income standard for the covered medically needy groups.in,
