billie anderson was indicted on one count of medicaid fraud.after the government presented its case in chief,anderson moved to dismiss the indictment as duplicitous and,alternatively,requested specific jury instructions to cure the alleged duplicity.the district court denied the motion and refused to charge the jury with the requested instructions.after the jury found anderson guilty,the court sentenced her to months of imprisonment.she then filed a motion to dismiss the indictment,alleging that it failed to state an offense,but this motion was also denied by the court.anderson now appeals the denial of both motions.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
the government charge revolved around the absence of a medical director at anderson healthcare,ahc,a healthcare facility located in gray,tennessee,between march and january.anderson was accused of fraudulently concealing this absence,thereby allowing ahc to continue receiving medicaid payments to which it was not entitled.
ahc participated in medicaid,a program through which healthcare providers are reimbursed with federal funds for providing certain services to the indigent.tenncare,a division of the tennessee department of health,is responsible for processing eligible claims for services provided by healthcare facilities in tennessee and paying reimbursements with a combination of state and federal funds.
a facility ongoing participation in medicaid is conditioned on its compliance with various federal,state,and local regulations,b,including the requirement that a healthcare facility designate a physician to serve as medical director,i.a medical director is responsible for coordinating medical care within the facility and implementing policies.id.i.
at all relevant times,billie anderson was an owner and the administrator of ahc.in these positions,anderson hired and fired ahc employees,made all of the financial decisions,and was responsible for paying the medical director.
glenna taylor,a registered nurse who worked at ahc from until either or,testified that for the entire time she was employed there,the facility had a medical director.for the last years of taylor employment,daniel david served in that position.david was a faculty member at east tennessee state university etsu,and the etsu physicians group had a contract with ahc,providing that david would be the facility medical director.but on january,etsu sent a letter to anderson stating that its physicians group intended to terminate the contract with ahc effective march.
in september,the tennessee department of health conducted its annual survey of ahc.annual surveys are designed to determine a facility compliance with federal and state regulations regarding patient care.during the survey,an employee at ahc was given a disclosure of ownership and control interest statement form,which was signed by anderson and given to the state team by the end of the survey.one of the questions on the form asked has there been a change in administrator,director of nursing or medical director within the last year the form was checked no in response to this question and was dated september.above the signature line was a bolded statement warning that the making of a false statement on the form could result in prosecution under federal or state laws,and that knowingly and willfully failing to fully and accurately disclose the information requested may result in denial of a request to participate or,where the entity already participates,a termination of its agreement or contract with the state agency or the secretary of health and human services.
ahc september survey revealed numerous immediate jeopardies,meaning that there were serious and immediate threats to the residents safety and health.the tennessee department of health therefore conducted an extended survey,also in september,to on the immediate jeopardies.as part of this more detailed survey,the department prepared a list of items it would need from ahc,including the medical director license to practice medicine,the contract,and all other contracts that the facility had in place.the survey team was initially told that the medical director was david,but later was told that frank johnson was the medical director.on september,ahc could not produce the medical license for either physician.one day later,however,ahc faxed the survey team a copy of johnson license.
rebecca riddle became the office manager at ahc in either december or january.she recalled overhearing a heated conversation between anderson and david in january about the doctor resignation.riddle testified that anderson thus knew that david was leaving as the medical director.sometime later,riddle typed up a proposed contract for johnson,which she then sent to him.riddle was aware that johnson had turned down the contract because he sent the contract back in the mail unsigned and with a sticky note on it.she further testified that anderson did not hire anyone else as medial director after johnson turned down the job,and that ahc did not have a medical director during the september surveys.
riddle told anderson during the extended survey that the tennessee department of health wanted to see the contract.anderson,according to riddle,said t hey close me down when riddle pointed out that the facility did not have a medical director.this prompted anderson to have riddle retrieve johnson contract that he had sent back unsigned,to say l et try this,and to give riddle the unexecuted contract for the latter to hand the survey team.when a member of the survey team told another ahc staff member that the team needed a signed version,anderson took the contract back,signed it herself on behalf of ahc,and told riddle to sign johnson name,which riddle did.johnson had not authorized riddle to sign for him,and riddle eventually told state investigators in february of about this incident.
following the extended survey,tenncare notified anderson that,based on the deficiencies found during the surveys,it would recommend that her medicaid provider agreement be terminated.because ahc had furnished a medical license and a signed contract for johnson,it was not cited for the absence of a medical director.anderson subsequently submitted a plan of correction,which specifically mentioned the involvement of the medical director in implementing changes.she was thereafter notified that as of october,ahc was in compliance with the relevant regulations,so its contract would not be terminated.
in response to the extended survey,anderson hired nursing consultant debra verna in late fall or early winter to help keep ahc in compliance with federal and state regulations.verna met johnson while working at ahc and said she understood that he was the medical director.johnson immediately stated that he was not the medical director,that verna needed to inform anderson of that,and that he had not signed any contract.when verna informed anderson the next day about this conversation,anderson stated that she did not know why johnson would say that,causing verna to suggest that anderson follow up with him.after verna stopped working at ahc in approximately january,she filed an anonymous complaint with the tennessee department of health regarding the facility lack of a medical director.
robert chapman lee entered into a written contract with ahc on january,to become its medical director,and he began his employment on that date.because there were things going on that he did feel comforable with,however,lee sent anderson a certified letter on february,notifying her that he was resigning as the medical director.
in response to complaints about ahc,the tennessee department of health began an investigation in february to determine whether there was a medical director at the facility.the board of nursing home administrators suspended anderson administrator license in march because it found that from on or around march,to on or around january,anderson operated anderson healthcare,without a medical director.before this investigation,neither federal nor state officials knew that ahc was without a medical director during the period of time in question.at trial,the prosecution presented proof that tenncare had paid ahc over million as a result of reimbursement claims filed and signed by anderson each month from july through january.
procedural history 
anderson was originally indicted in june on eight counts of medicaid fraud.in august,the government moved to dismiss all but one count.the remaining count,brought pursuant to a,read as follows 
i n or about march until in or about january,in the eastern district of tennessee,billie faye anderson,having knowledge of an event that affected her continued right to receive payments from a federal health care program,that is,medicaid,that event being the absence of a medical director at anderson healthcare,as required by law,concealed and failed to disclose that event with the intent fraudulently to secure medicaid payments when none were authorized,by submitting claims for payments to medicaid knowing she was not entitled to receive such payments.
anderson jury trial began in september and lasted four days.at the close of the government proof,anderson moved to dismiss the indictment as duplicitous,arguing that the government should have brought separate counts for each month during the period that ahc allegedly did not have a medical director,but was still submitting monthly reimbursement claims.she contended that without such a breakout,neither the parties nor the court would be able to tell if the jury unanimously determined when the offense occurred during the relevant months.anderson thus claimed that her sixth amendment right to a unanimous jury verdict would be violated by the incorporation of ten specific offenses into one count.in response,the government argued that it was not charging anderson with submitting false offense that could have been committed with each monthly request for with the continuing failure to disclose the absence of a medical director at ahc.
the district court noted that anderson motion to dismiss should have been raised pretrial.it nevertheless proceeded to the merits of the motion by ruling that the indictment was not duplicitous because the filing of monthly reimbursement claims was not an element of the offense.the court thus concluded that the indictment charged a single violation that was continuous in nature.
after the court denied anderson motion,she requested the following jury instruction to cure the alleged duplicity of the indictment 
before you can find the defendant guilty of the charge in this indictment,you must unanimously agree that the government has proved the following three elements beyond a reasonable doubt,and those are the three elements that the government and the court and the defendant have agreed to,beyond a reasonable doubt for each of the months charged in the indictment that if there is even one month within the period where the government has failed to carry its burden as to these three elements,then you must acquit the defendant.
anderson later requested a second instruction regarding the in or about language in the indictment 
the indictment charges that the crime commenced and ended i n or about various dates.the government does not have to prove that the crime began and ended on any exact date but the government must prove that the crime continued from the starting date that you find until the ending date that you find.
finally,anderson sought special findings of fact from the jury regarding the dates for the commencement and termination of the crime.the government objected to each of these proposals,and the district court ultimately refused to include them.
after less than two hours of deliberation,the jury found anderson guilty.following several sentencing continuances and an unsuccessful motion for a new trial filed by anderson,the district court sentenced anderson in september to months of imprisonment,three years of supervised release,a assessment,and a fine.she subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for failure to state an offense pursuant to rule b b of the federal rules of criminal procedure,which the district court denied.anderson has timely appealed the district court denial of her motions to dismiss the indictment as duplicitous and to dismiss the indictment for failure to state an offense.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo the sufficiency of an indictment.united states ahmed,cir.similarly,we employ de novo review to determine if an indictment is duplicitous.united states kakos,cir.but we review a district court denial of a requested jury instruction for abuse of discretion.united states gray,cir.an abuse of discretion will not be found if the jury instructions as a whole adequately informed the jury of the relevant considerations and provided a basis in law for aiding the jury in reaching its decision.united states frederick,cir.
failure to state an offense 
anderson first challenges the district court denial of her motion to dismiss the indictment for failure to state an offense.a party may raise an allegation that the indictment does not state an offense at any time,including or on appeal.united states gatewood,cir allowing a defendant to challenge the sufficiency of the indictment for the first time on appeal.a n indictment is sufficient if it,first,contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge against which he must defend,and,second,enables him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.hamling united states.
anderson was charged under a,which provides that 
w hoever,having knowledge of the occurrence of any event affecting his initial or continued right to any benefit or payment under medicaid,conceals or fails to disclose such event with an intent fraudulently to secure such benefit or payment either in a greater amount or quantity than is due or when no such benefit or payment is authorized,shall be guilty of a felony.
anderson indictment clearly tracked the language of the statute and thus contained the elements of the offense.specifically,it charged that anderson had knowledge of an event affecting her right to receive medicaid payments,she concealed the event,and in concealing the event,she acted knowingly and willfully with the intent to fraudulently secure medicaid payments.see united states collis,cir holding that an indictment was sufficient because t he charged offense fully tracks the relevant language of the statute.given these specific allegations,anderson was fairly informed of the charge against which she had to defend.this satisfies the first prong of hamling.we recognize that both the statute and the indictment refer to an individual right to receive medicaid payments.here,the payments went to ahc,not to anderson individually.but neither party has raised this potential discrepancy,so we decline to address it.
the indictment also included the relevant time period and the specific event that triggered the charge against absence of a medical director.anderson would accordingly be able to adequately plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of any future prosecutions arising from the same offense.the second requirement of hamling is thus met.indeed,anderson does not dispute that the hamling test is satisfied in the instant case.she instead argues on appeal that the indictment is insufficient because there is allegedly no statute or regulation that would put anderson on notice that her facility participation in medicaid would automatically disintegrate or immediately terminate with the instance of the loss of the medical director.
but this argument misses the point.anderson is not so much contending that the indictment fails to state an offense,but rather that she could not be guilty under the statute because the absence of a medical director is not an event automatically terminating her facility right to receive medicaid payments.this is an issue that anderson was free to argue at trial,that one element of the statute was not satisfied because the absence of a medical director purportedly does not affect ahc right to medicaid payments under federal and state rules.but the government was also free to i
