under the controlled substances act csa,it is unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to distribute or dispense a controlled substance.a.although the csa makes exceptions to this prohibition for certain individuals who are registered practitioners under the act,such as physicians and pharmacists,see,the supreme court has held that these practitioners are still subject to criminal prosecution when their activities fall outside the usual course of professional practice.united states moore,d see also providing that a practitioner shall be subject to the penalties relating to controlled substances unless the prescriptions he writes are issued for a legitimate medical purpose and he is acting in the usual course of his professional practice.thus,a physician remains criminally liable when he ceases to distribute or dispense controlled substances as a medical professional,and acts instead as a pusher.moore,at.
jeffrey feingold,a naturopathic physician licensed by the state of arizona,was convicted on counts of illegally distributing controlled substances,in violation of a.he contends that his conviction is constitutionally infirm due to improperly admitted testimony and erroneous jury instructions.the thrust of both of these objections is that the district court permitted the jury to convict him upon finding that he was merely an incompetent doctor,rather than upon the necessary finding that his conduct was so egregious as to render him criminally liable.he also argues that his sentence is invalid because the district court improperly relied on facts not found by the jury and because the district court denied his request for a reduction in his offense level.
although we hold that feingold arguments are without merit,we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing pursuant to united states,cir.
feingold graduated in from the national college of naturopathic medicine and,after completing an internship and residency,began his career in philadelphia.in,he moved to arizona,where he later opened his own practice.in,the state of arizona granted naturopathic physicians authority to prescribe schedule ii,iii,iv,and v controlled substances.in august of,arizona curtailed this authority,prohibiting naturopathic physicians from prescribing schedule ii drugs,with the exception of morphine.feingold obtained from the drug enforcement agency dea the necessary certification to prescribe controlled substances.the prescriptions written by him pursuant to this certification became the basis for a indictment.the government alleged that feingold abused his status as a licensed practitioner to distribute controlled substances outside the course of his professional practice.
at trial,the government presented evidence from several of feingold patients.their testimony against him overwhelmingly demonstrated his disregard for proper prescribing practices.for example,several patients testified that they received prescriptions from feingold even though he had never physically examined them and even though he never recorded the medical basis for prescribing these controlled substances in his patients medical charts.other patients testified that he had given them controlled substances even though he knew that they were recovering drug addicts.others testified that they received prescriptions even though feingold had never met with them.feingold provided pills to one patient in exchange for having the patient paint his house,even though the prescriptions had ostensibly been issued for the patient back pain.the record also indicates that feingold continued to prescribe schedule ii narcotics even after arizona had revoked the authority of naturopathic physicians like him to prescribe them.
further,feingold prescribed these substances in excess of the maximum dosages he recommended.in one case,in a single month he provided prescriptions to one patient,each for total of more than oxycodone and oxycontin pills.in another case,he prescribed as many as pills in a single month,despite the fact that the recommended maximum dosage would have allowed the consumption of only,to a patient who testified that he resold the pills to others.he liberally provided prescriptions for hydrocodone,percocet,vicodin,valium,oxycontin,oxycodone,and morphine,sometimes refilling these prescriptions at intervals of only two days,or even daily.feingold also charged his patients by the number of prescriptions he wrote.
the evidence presented by feingold patients also included the testimony of two undercover dea agents who had obtained prescriptions for controlled substances both for themselves and for each other.feingold issued prescriptions to one of these agents without examining her,and on one occasion,before he had even met her.at least one of these prescriptions was written for a schedule ii drug after arizona had made it illegal for naturopathic physicians to dispense them.finally,these agents testified that feingold had advised them to refill their prescriptions at a particular pharmacy because certain other pharmacists had refused to fill his prescriptions.
in addition to this evidence,the government presented two expert naturopathic doctor named thomas kruzel,and a medical doctor named michael ferrante.both experts testified about the standard of care with which medical professionals generally must comply,and both of them indicated that feingold conduct fell far short of applicable professional standards.for instance,kruzel testified that many of the prescriptions written by feingold were medically unnecessary and that feingold practice of prescribing narcotic drugs without conducting adequate physical examinations or taking his patients medical history was highly unusual and outside the usual course of naturopathic medicine.likewise,ferrante testified that feingold prescription practices had failed to comply with generally observed professional guidelines,that feingold had kept inadequate records,and that feingold had prescribed unusually high and frequent doses of narcotic drugs.in addition,both experts consistently and unambiguously testified that feingold conduct was outside the course of usual professional practice and that there was no legitimate medical purpose for the prescriptions identified in the indictment.
in his defense,feingold presented as an expert witness a naturopathic doctor named michael cronin.this expert initially indicated that he believed a legitimate medical purpose existed for all of feingold prescriptions and that feingold had issued all of his prescriptions in the belief that his patients needed them.he explained that the prescription of high levels of opioid medications was not atypical in treating pain.on,however,the expert retracted much of his testimony and admitted that the volume and frequency of most of the prescriptions was probably excessive and outside the usual course of professional practice and without a legitimate medical reason.
finally,feingold testified in his own defense.he admitted writing all of the prescriptions identified in the indictment.he also admitted that,in retrospect,the prescriptions he issued were not used for a valid medical purpose,that he was practicing as an incompetent doctor,and that his method of prescribing controlled substances would be considered outside the usual course of professional practice.he explained,however,that the reason for these excessive prescriptions was that he lacked training in opioid medication management and that he was trained to recognize opioid seekers.he claimed that he had always issued prescriptions in the genuine belief that they were necessary to treat his patients legitimate and serious medical conditions.feingold insisted that he had been prescribing the drugs in good faith to help his patients manage their pain and that he had naively believed them when they told him they needed more pills.
the district court instructed the jury that it had to find three elements in order to convict feingold under a as a licensed practitioner 
first,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant distributed a controlled substance 
second,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant distributed the controlled substance knowingly and intentionally 
third,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant prescribed or distributed the controlled substance other than for a legitimate medical purpose and not in the usual course of professional practice.
in addition,the district court provided the following supplemental instructions 
a practitioner may not be convicted of unlawful distribution of controlled substances when he distributes controlled substances in good faith to patients in the regular course of professional practice.only the lawful acts of a practitioner,however,are exempted from prosecution under the law.a controlled substance is distributed by a practitioner in the usual course of his professional practice if the substance is distributed by him in good faith in medically treating a patient.good faith is not merely a practitioner sincere intention towards the people who come to see him,but,rather,it involves his sincerity in attempting to conduct himself in accordance with a standard of medical practice generally recognized and accepted in the country.thus,good faith in this context means an honest effort to prescribe for a patient condition in accordance with the standard of medical practice generally recognized and accepted in the country.however,practitioners who act outside the usual course of professional practice and prescribe or distribute controlled substances for no legitimate medical purpose may be guilty of unlawful distribution of controlled substances.
after deliberation,the jury convicted feingold on all counts.the district court calculated the offense level under the sentencing guidelines as,based on the quantity of drugs illegally prescribed by feingold,as well as on its finding that feingold had abused a position of public trust.the district court sentenced feingold to months for those counts that were subject to a statutory maximum,and to months for the counts that were governed by the sentencing guidelines,with all sentences to run concurrently.feingold now appeals his conviction and his sentence.
feingold claims that the district court improperly allowed expert witnesses to testify about the standard of care applicable to the distribution of opioid and other drugs.he argues that their testimony not only misled the jury by claiming a consensus among medical professionals in a field where none exists,but also was irrelevant and prejudicial because it prompted the jury to convict him of criminal offenses where at most he was a negligent doctor.
we review a district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.see,united states alvarez,cir.here,we conclude that the testimony about the applicable standard of care was relevant and therefore admissible.we agree with feingold observation that a violation of the standard of care alone is insufficient to support the criminal conviction of a licensed practitioner under a.but we do not agree that evidence of the governing standard of care is irrelevant or prejudicial.to the contrary,only after assessing the standards to which medical professionals generally hold themselves is it possible to evaluate whether a practitioner conduct has deviated so far from the usual course of professional practice that his actions become criminal.moore,at.
both the supreme court and this court have allowed juries to assess the prevailing standards of care among medical professionals in cases involving the criminal prosecution of licensed practitioners.see id.at.noting the practitioner concession that he did not observe generally accepted medical practices united states boettjer,cir noting that the standard for criminal liability itself imports considerations of medical legitimacy and accepted medical standards.as we explained in boettjer,evidence regarding the applicable standard of care is not offered to establish malpractice,but rather to support the absence of any legitimate medical purpose in the practitioner prescription of controlled substances.at.knowing how doctors generally ought to act is essential for a jury to determine whether a practitioner has acted not as a doctor,or even as a bad doctor,but as a pusher whose conduct is without a legitimate medical justification.the district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence relating to the standard of care 
feingold raises two objections to the jury instructions.although we review the precise formulation of jury instructions only for abuse of discretion,we review such instructions de novo to determine whether they misstate the elements of a crime.see united states shipsey,cir.here,the thrust of feingold arguments is that the district court effectively misrepresented the elements of the crime.we therefore review the jury instructions de novo.
feingold first argues that the instructions permitted the jury to convict him without an adequate determination of his mens rea.he argues that,to convict a licensed practitioner under a,a jury must look into his subjective state of mind and determine that he intended to act outside the course of his professional practice.he contends that his conviction is invalid because the jury instructions did not require the jury to do so in his case.see,united states nguyen,cir reversing a conviction where the jury instructions failed to require a finding of intent.
we agree with feingold contention that a practitioner who acts outside the usual course of professional practice may be convicted under a only if he does so intentionally.if a practitioner distribution of controlled substances becomes illegal only by virtue of the fact that his actions are outside the usual course of professional practice,moore,at,it follows that the practitioner must have deliberately acted in this fashion in order for him to be convicted of a crime.see morissette united states.the contention that an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted by intention is no provincial or transient notion.it is as universal and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedom of the human will and a consequent ability and duty of the normal individual to choose between good and evil.as we emphasized in united states rosenberg,cir,the jury must look into a practitioner mind to determine whether he prescribed the pills for what he thought was a medical purpose or whether he was passing out the pills to anyone who asked for them.id.at.
simply put,to convict a practitioner under a,the government must prove that the practitioner distributed controlled substances,that the distribution of those controlled substances was outside the usual course of professional practice and without a legitimate medical purpose,and that the practitioner acted with intent to distribute the drugs and with intent to distribute them outside the course of professional practice.in other words,the jury must make a finding of intent not merely with respect to distribution,but also with respect to the doctor intent to act as a pusher rather than a medical professional.here,feingold contends that the district court instructions relieved the jury of its burden to make this additional finding of intent.
contrary to feingold assertion,however,we are satisfied that the district court instructions did require the jury to find that he intentionally acted outside the usual course of professional practice.although the district court did not explicitly use the word intent in instructing the jury on this aspect of the the defendant prescribed or distributed the controlled substance other than for a legitimate medical purpose and not in the usual course of professional practice the instructions as a whole made clear that the jury had to make a finding about feingold state of mind.see united states dixon,cir a single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation,but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.
in its supplemental instructions,the district court informed the jury that a practitioner may not be convicted of unlawful distribution of controlled substances when he distributes controlled substances in good faith to patients in the regular course of professional practice.these supplemental instructions further stated that a controlled substance is distributed by a practitioner in the usual course of his professional practice if the substance is distributed by him in good faith in medically treating a patient.the district court explained that good faith involves his sincerity in attempting to conduct himself in accordance with a standard of medical practice generally recognized and accepted in the country.finally,the district court instructed that good faith in this context means an honest effort to prescribe for a patient condition.the supplemental instructions made no fewer than four references to feingold state of mind,all of them in connection with instructions regarding the professional competence of a licensed practitioner.admittedly,the instructions would have been clearer if they had stated that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally prescribed or distributed the controlled substance other than for a legitimate medical purpose and not in the usual course of professional practice.nonetheless,viewed in their entirety,the instructions compelled the jury to consider whether feingold intended to distribute the controlled substances for a legitimate medical purpose and whether he intended to act within the usual course of professional practice.the verdict represents the jury conclusion that he did not.we therefore find no error in the jury instructions regarding feingold criminal intent.
feingold also claims that the jury instructions were erroneous because they misrepresented the standard for criminal liability.specifically,he argues that the instructions conflated the higher standard for criminal liability under a whether a practitioner actions fall outside the usual course of professional practice,moore,at.the standard for civil malpractice.as noted above,the district court instructed the jury that feingold had to make an honest effort to prescribe for a patient condition in accordance with the standard of medical practice generally recognized and accepted in the country.similarly,the court instructed that good faith involves feingold sincerity in attempting to conduct himself in accordance with a standard of medical practice generally recognized and accepted in the country.feingold argues that,by using the professional standard of care as a benchmark in the jury instructions,the district court allowed the jury to convict simply upon finding that he had been a negligent doctor.
initially,we reiterate that the district court instructions required a finding of intent,not merely a finding of malpractice.thus,while it is true that the district court instructions referred to a national standard of care,at a minimum the instructions required the jury to find that feingold had intentionally violated that standard.feingold appeal thus presents the question of whether a practitioner conviction under a is valid if it rests only on a finding of intentional malpractice,or whether a jury must find that the doctor intentionally engaged in even more egregious conduct.similarly stated can a defendant who intentionally exceeds a generally recognized standard of medical practice still be engaged in the usual course of professional practice,moore,at,such that he could escape criminal liability the question is a difficult and important one,and it implicates the conduct of any health care professional whose judgment about the appropriate standard of medical care may conflict with what a jury determines to be the generally accepted standard.the threat,feingold argues,is that doctors could be prosecuted and perhaps convicted as criminals whenever the attorney general disapproves of a course of treatment,or whenever they step outside of conventional medical protocols in order to provide some sort of special treatment for uniquely needy patients.
significantly,both the supreme court and this circuit have previously approved jury instructions that refer to a national standard of care.in moore,for example,the supreme court implicitly approved instructions that had required the jury to find that the practitioner had prescribed controlled substances other than in good faith for detoxification in the usual course of a professional practice and in accordance with a standard of medical practice generally recognized and accepted in the united states.at.in boettjer,we upheld a conviction where the district court had required the jury to find that the practitioner had acted other than in good faith for a legitimate medical purpose and in accordance with the medical standards generally recognized and accepted in the medical profession.at.and in united states hayes,cir,we upheld a conviction obtained after the district court had instructed the jury to find that the defendant had acted in good faith,which it defined,as did the district court in this case,to mean that the practitioner had made an honest effort to prescribe for a patient condition in accordance with the standard of medical practice generally recognized and accepted in the country.id.at.these cases thus suggest that it is proper to instruct a jury that it may compare the defendant conduct to an applicable standard of care.
yet these cases have also cautioned that a district court may impermissibly lower the standard for criminal liability by instructing the jury to determine whether a has complied,or attempted to comply,with the standard of care.indeed,a careful reading of these cases reveals that we have previously expressed concern about instructions related to the standard of care.in hayes,we observed that the district court reference to the standard of medical care was potentially confusing and that more precise language could have been used.id.at.we nonetheless affirmed the practitioner conviction because,after viewing the jury instructions in their entirety,we fail ed to see how the jury could have interpret ed the instructions as permitting a finding of guilt based on mere negligence.id.likewise,in boettjer,we observed that the jury instructions were subject to several possible interpretations.we noted that one plausible interpretation of the instructions would have permitted conviction merely upon a showing of malpractice,and we held that to the extent the given instruction countenanced this result,it was deficient.at.we stated in boettjer that we would not hold forth the charge given in this case as a model for emulation,nor would we encourage its verbatim proliferation.id.at.finally,the supreme court in moore was careful to emphasize that the defendant in that case had so wantonly ignored the basic protocols of the medical profession that he acted as a pusher not as a physician.at.the court further described a as prohibiting the significantly greater offense of acting as a drug pusher.id.at.these statements suggest that the moore court based its decision not merely on the fact that the doctor had committed malpractice,or even intentional malpractice,but rather on the fact that his actions completely betrayed any semblance of legitimate medical treatment.
we hold that an instruction is improper if it allows a jury to convict a licensed practitioner under a solely on a finding that he has committed malpractice,intentional or otherwise.rather,the district court must ensure that the benchmark for criminal liability is the higher showing that the practitioner intentionally has distributed controlled substances for no legitimate medical purpose and outside the usual course of professional practice.
our holding is supported by the supreme court decision in moore,which implicitly approved an instruction that required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that a physician,who knowingly or intentionally,did dispense or distribute methadone by prescription,did so other than in good faith for detoxification in the usual course of a professional practice and in accordance with a standard of medical practice generally recognized and accepted in the united states.moore,at.alterations in original.the district court instruction in moore indicates that the jury could convict under a if the gov
