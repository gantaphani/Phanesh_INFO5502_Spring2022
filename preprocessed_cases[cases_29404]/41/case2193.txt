iii.statement of facts 
gina worked for bayer pharmaceuticals for thirteen years as a pharmaceutical sales representative.bayer job description states that her job was to p romote and sell bayer pharmaceutical division products to targeted offices and,physicians,including specialists.bayer gave a roster of doctors and hospitals in her area and a list of bayer products for which she was responsible.job was to communicate information about her bayer products to her roster of doctors and seek their commitment to write prescriptions for those products.she was also responsible for communicating with hospitals in her territory to influence them to add the bayer products for which she was responsible to their formularies.
bayer refers to its psrs as a sales force and individual psrs as salespersons bayer also trains its psrs in what it calls sales skills.specifically,bayer trained in a consultative selling method of engaging doctors in a dialogue about the products in order to influence their prescribing behavior.was trained on a message and had to adhere closely to the information provided by bayer about its products.otherwise,she had the freedom to develop her own strategy for communicating with and influencing doctors.learned to customize her sales presentations based upon physician style,time constraints,prescribing habits,and managed care status.also received training in how to handle questions from doctors about the different products for which she was responsible.was responsible for planning speaking events and could choose the speakers from the list provided by bayer.
bayer compensated psrs in part based on their success in increasing sales of bayer products in their areas.bayer tracked prescriptions written and filled for list of products by the doctors in territory.was rewarded when sales figures exceeded certain quotas.according to bayer,earned between and per year during the period at issue here.
although bayer describes and other psrs as a sales force,psrs do not complete sales transactions with doctors.psrs do not receive any payment from doctors for bayer products,nor do they sign binding contracts for sales with doctors.doctors do not place orders for bayer products with psrs.rather,psrs are limited to influencing doctors to increase the number of prescriptions they write for each drug.also solicited hospitals to include bayer pharmaceuticals on their formularies,and on occasion signed contracts with hospitals to do so.the hospitals,however,would buy the pharmaceutical products from a wholesaler,not from or bayer.
as a psr,had flexibility regarding how she spent her day.she developed her own schedule for meeting with the doctors on her list.she received little or no daily supervision,and saw her manager once every six to eight weeks.could take care of personal obligations during the day,although bayer expected her to make eight to ten calls per day on doctors in the field.routinely worked more than eight hours a day and more than forty hours a week.she also often worked weekends.in addition,her job required that she frequently have lunch and dinner with doctors.during the course of her employment,she regularly had working lunches with doctors at least three times a week.
during the course of her employment at bayer,was treated as an exempt employee.she did not receive any additional overtime compensation or meal breaks,but she was also not required to keep or maintain set hours.
in,left bayer after bayer reduced its.in,she brought this lawsuit in california state court on behalf of herself and others similarly situated,claiming she had been wrongly classified as an exempt employee and was entitled to back pay and damages under california wage and hour laws.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of bayer,finding that was exempt under california outside sales exemption and declining to reach the question whether was exempt under california administrative exemption.timely appealed 
iv.explanation of our request 
the question whether psrs are exempt under california outside salesperson and administrative exemptions is the central issue in multiple class action lawsuits in the ninth circuit as well as in other circuits.in addition to the three cases pending before the ninth circuit,at least four other class action suits have been filed in federal court in the central district of california.see yacoubian,delgado,rivera schering,brody astrazeneca,lp,cal.june.in addition,a arising under california law has been filed in federal court in the southern district of new york.see in re novartis wage hour,wl.
in light of the scope of the pending litigation regarding the classification of psrs under california labor code section,we respectfully submit that the questions we pose are worthy of a decision by the california supreme court.see cal.rules of court a.the answers given by the california supreme court will dispose of the three pending appeals currently before the ninth circuit,as well as guide the decisions in the other federal cases applying california law.
in order to assist the california supreme court in evaluating our request,we briefly explain why we believe there is no controlling precedent or clear state court guidance on the question whether psrs are exempt under the outside salesperson exemption.
section of the california labor code requires employers to compensate employees for overtime work.see cal.labor code a.however,section of the california labor code exempts an employee who is employed as an outside salesman from that requirement.see cal.labor code.the iwc wage orders and define outside salesperson as someone whose job involve
