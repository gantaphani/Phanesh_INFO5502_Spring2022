phyllis appeals from a final decision of the merit systems protection board mspb sustaining the denial of her application for disability retirement benefits by the office of personnel management opm.office of pers.because opm applied an erroneous legal standard in its assessment of evidence offered to support application,and the mspb repeated that error,we vacate and remand.
background 
has been an employee of the veterans administration va for nearly thirty years.in the several years prior to february,she experienced increasing discomfort and difficulties at her workplace and particularly with her immediate supervisor,barry emerson.on february,emersoninstructed her to switch offices to one near his.this prompted her to immediately apply for voluntary early retirement.emerson informed her the next day,february,that he was recommending her application be denied.she did not return to work the next day,and she has been absent from work ever since.the va formally denied her early retirement application on march.on june,she filed the application for disability retirement at issue in this appeal.opm denied that application on january.after permitting to submit additional evidence,opm reconsidered and sustained its decision on may.appealed to the mspb,and the administrative judge aj sustained opm reconsideration decision.office of pers,no,aj decision.the mspb denied petition for rehearing on may,thereby making the aj decision its final decision,which then timely appealed to this court.
claims complete disability due to several alleged psychological disorders,including major depression and anxiety disorder.the evidence she submitted to opm to support her claim consisted of her own statements in addition to several letters,medical reports,and related documentation from her treating psychologist,nichols,and treating psychiatrist,rummler.before the mspb,additionally submitted testimony from herself and her husband,as well as testimony from nichols.opm offered no medical evidence countering nichols and rummler documents or testimony.
in her statements to opm,alleged that the stresses of her job in the months leading up to january resulted in,among other things,severe anxiety and panic attacks,vomiting,and nausea.at.she also indicated that,by january,she could no longer manage to drive her self to work,and that she would experience sheer panic when forced to leave the house.id.she further indicated that,after her meeting with her superior on february,she suffered a total mental meltdown.id.at.she also described the symptoms she has experienced since she stopped attending her job,such as chest pains,heart palpitations,nausea,irritability,inability to drive,deep depressive moods,difficulty with simple basic hygiene and routine household chores like laundry or cooking,and general and severe fear and anxiety in dealings with people places at all connected or related to the.id.at.
her testimony before the mspb was consistent with her statements to opm she testified that the act of being driven to work by her husband would cause nausea and vomiting,that leaving her house would trigger panic attacks,that she suffered from depression,and that she had been prescribed multiple medications for her mental conditions.id.at.her husband,james ryals,also testified before the mspb,corroborating his wife testimony on her symptoms.id.at.
nichols submitted a number of letters and medical reports dated from may,to february.she also submitted progress notes dated from as early as march.in these documents,she consistently diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder,panic attack disorder without agoraphobia,and major depression,all axis i psychological disorders id.at.she described in detail the symptoms reported by and her husband as well as those she herself observed during treatment.id.at.she indicated her opinion that is a reliable reporter of her situation.id.at.she described particular aspects of condition that reflected specifically on her capability to accomplish the tasks of her position for example,nichols wrote on february,that is unable to drive or be driven north or to set foot in the va building and that merely receiving correspondence from the va rendered her extremely anxious and depressed and unable to leave the couch for days.id.at.nichols also opined on prognosis,reporting that aside from small improvements in personal hygiene and like tasks,her date of recovery,if she has to return to work,is far in the future,if ever.id.at.in,nichols did indicate,without specifying,that p rognosis is good and that is making progress in therapy,but emphasized that she remained unfit to return to work.id.at.and nichols final report in february indicated that most likely will be unable to return to work at all and that nichols does not believe an accommodation is feasible.id.at.
nichols also gave oral testimony before the mspb.she testified that she did see that had anxiety and depression,and that she directly observed signs of mental illness such as having a flat affect and being very fidgety.id.at.she described particular episodes and manifestations of panic attacks and depression,and discussed the limited progress achieved by treatment,such as an improved ability to maintain personal hygiene.id.at.nichols testified several times that she at no time felt that was fit for work,and that will not ever be able to return to the va and likely will never be able to return to any work,full time.id.at.she also testified that the standard diagnostic tool in the mental health field is,and that she had used to diagnose.id.at.
rummler,whom nichols indicated was prescribing xanax and other psychiatric medication,id.at,provided a brief letter dated march,indicating that he had been treating since april and that he had diagnosed her with major depression and anxiety disorder.id.at.he further indicated his opinion that d ue to the intensity of symptoms attributable to work related stress,it can also be stated with reasonable medical certainty that will be unable to return to her previous work at any time in the future.id.he also submitted notes of his treatment of from april through june.id.at.
both opm and the mspb gave no weight at all to medical evidence and then found that she had failed to prove her disability.the mspb also held that she had not definitively exhausted the possibility that the agency could accommodate her alleged disability.aj decision at.this holding was largely based on the mspb rejection of her medical evidence and its view that she had failed to prove any disability beyond an inability to work with her particular supervisor the record shows that was offered temporary duty away from work area and supervisor,which she turned down due to her medical condition.id.at.however,the record also indicates that the va determined reassignment is not possible.there are no vacant positions at this agency,at the same grade or pay level and tenure within the same commuting area,for which the employee meets minimum qualification standards.id.at.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
as a threshold issue,we first address whether this court has jurisdiction to hear appeal due to.while we have exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from a final decision of the mspb under a,the scope of review available regarding opm disability determinations is restricted by and by the supreme court decision in lindahl office of pers,d.under that statute as interpreted in lindahl,factual determinations on questions of disability and dependency are unreviewable by this or any other court.see lindahl,at.anthony office of pers.
the court made clear,however,that issues of law regarding decisions on disability applications are reviewable judicial review is available to determine whether there has been a substantial departure from important procedural rights,a misconstruction of the governing legislation,or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination.lindahl,at.quoting scroggins united states,internal quotations omitted.thus we may only address the critical legal errors,if any,committed by the mspb in reviewing opm decision.contends that both the mspb and opm committed an error of law by entirely rejecting all of her medical evidence simply due to the absence of objective medical evidence,arguing that such a requirement is unlawful and not supported by any statute,regulation,or precedent.the government argues that no such requirement was imposed and that the mspb and opm simply found the medical evidence insufficient to establish disability as a factual matter.
we conclude,however,that the mspb decision was indeed predicated on its view that objective medical evidence is required to prove disability and that had failed to meet this requirement,affirming and expressly approving of opm holding to this effect.this is evident upon close examination of all three written decisions in this case.in opm initial decision of january,the agency criticized the evidence submitted by because a part from subjective narrative,no other objective medical documentation was provided supporting a history that may have contributed to her sudden mental demise.app.to resp.br.at emphasis added.opm then elaborated,criticizing the lack of documentation such as emergency room reports showing incidents of panic attack and relevant psychiatric studies or test results.id.
in its later may,reconsideration decision,opm further expressed its view that the critical defect in evidence was the lack of objective medical documentation.opm indicated it was giving no weight to nichols several reports because she provided no details concerning any mental status evaluation,and she does not provide copies of any formal cognitive testing.at.opm later repeated that the case file contains no evidence of any formal cognitive or neuropsychological testing,and also cited the lack of any comprehensive physical examinations and any current comprehensive mental status evaluations.id.at.
the mspb in turn enforced opm objective medical evidence requirement.in his opinion,the aj pointed to opm finding that had provided little objective medical evidence to demonstrate that she is disabled.aj decision at emphasis added.he further noted that opm also points out that the bulk of the evidence presented by is nichol sic reports of what told her.id.this latter point was relied on by the aj in his own analysis,and he remarked that the evidence presented by nichols is only as good as the information given to her by.id.thus the aj also concluded that nichols reports were necessarily immaterial since they were subjective in that they were primarily based on nichols assessment of own account of her symptoms and experiences.the aj made this apparent when he declared that t he only evidence which supports claim of disability is her protracted absence form sic work,and emphasized that the necessity of the absences is based on purely subjective medical evidence,which are not supported by an sic objective medical evidence.id.at emphases added.clearly,the aj totally discounted any probative value that medical evidence might have to support her claim of disability since the only evidence he credited was her attendance record which he then also rejected for being based on purely subjective medical evidence.his treatment of the medical evidence was thus tantamount to exclusion he considered nichols and rummler evidence but only so far as deciding to disregard it as not at all probative as to her disability 
the supreme court in lindahl,by expressly rejecting that the mspb and opm are not subject to any judicial review on any issue,indicated that the courts have a limited but important role to play.both to guard against the substantial errors of law and resulting miscarriage of justice described in scroggins,and to properly respect our jurisdictional limitations on truly factual determinations,we must be discerning and can not be satisfied by opinions that invoke the trappings of factual,by vaguely describing broad swaths of evidence as insufficient or as failing to carry the claimant burden,or simply asserting that all record evidence was considered,all of which the aj and opm did,when read closely and carefully,reveal that absolutely no weight was given to certain evidence solely because it can generally be classified as subjective and not because of any specific identifiable defect.giving little weight to specific evidence because of its individual failings,such as the lack of qualifications of the author of a particular medical report,is a factual analysis over which we have no jurisdiction to review.disqualification of evidence because of its type is an imposition of a legal standard because it inherently imposes a categorical requirement.when the use of such a standard is dispositive of disability retirement claims,they go to the heart of the administrative determination,and we are charged with resolving whether the imposed standard and its inherent evidentiary requirement are lawful.
therefore,we hold that our jurisdiction is established as to the issue of whether the imposition of an objective medical evidence requirement by the mspb or opm in disability retirement cases is lawful or a substantial departure from important procedural rights,a misconstruction of the governing legislation,or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination.scroggins,at.we now turn to this issue of law,which we review de novo,keeping in mind that the mspb decision sustaining opm actions may only be reversed if it is arbitrary or capricious,or if it is contrary to law see c.
objective medical evidence requirement 
it is telling that no authority whatsoever is cited by the mspb or opm,in any of the three written decisions in this case,for the proposition that objective medical evidence is required to prove disability.no statute or applicable regulation of which we are aware imposes such a requirement.in fact,applicable law suggests the opposite rule.opm regulations define the type of medical documentation required to establish disability.such evidence must come from a licensed physician or other appropriate practitioner,it must be justified according to established diagnostic criteria,and it must not be inconsistent with generally accepted professional standards.see requiring medical evidence submitted to support an application for disability retirement to conform to the requirements of.there is no hint of any distinction,and the regulation clearly indicates that any evidence subjective or established diagnostic criteria and consistent with generally accepted professional standards is eligible for consideration.
moreover,the mspb has even precedentially ruled squarely against an objective evidence requirement.chavez office of pers,mspb,the aj erred in assuming that appellant claim for disability retirement benefits could not be granted if it was not proven by objective medical evidence.while we are not bound by the mspb precedent,we agree with and accept the chavez holding on this issue.opm must consider all of an applicant competent medical evidence,and an applicant may prevail based on medical evidence that,as here,consists of a medical professional conclusive diagnosis,even if based primarily on analysis of the applicant own descriptions of symptoms and other indicia of disability.see id.at objective medical evidence,then,is but one of the elements of proof to be considered,along with expert opinion evidence and subjective evidence of pain and inability to work.
for example,in craig office of pers,the mspb held that the applicant satisfied her burden of proving her disability solely with medical evidence from a psychiatric social worker along with her own testimony.the social worker,a licensed mental health specialist,diagnosed her patient with multiple mental disorders,including stress disorder and panic disorder.id.at.much like in the instant case,the social worker reports were solely based on information she heard or observed during therapy sessions after the applicant had already left the job that had precipitated her conditions.see id.also like nichols,the social worker in craig based her diagnosis on the guidelines in.id.at.there is no mention of any objective tests in craig rather,the medical evidence there deemed highly probative was very similar to the medical evidence petitioner
