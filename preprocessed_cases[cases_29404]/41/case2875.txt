acting pursuant to a provision of the public health service act that requires the secretary of health and human services to publish a list of substances known or reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens,the secretary upgraded the chemical dioxin from the reasonably anticipated to the known category.a manufacturer of products that release dioxin when incinerated,together with others allegedly affected by the upgrade,argues that the secretary,in violation of hhs regulations,acted without sufficient epidemiological evidence that dioxin is a known human carcinogen.although we reject the secretary arguments that the manufacturer lacks standing and that the upgrade decision is unreviewable,we agree with the district court that,given the deference owed an agency interpretation of its own regulations,the secretary acted neither arbitrarily nor capriciously.
in,congress amended the public health service act to require the secretary of health,education and welfare,now health and human services,to publish a list of known and suspected carcinogens.see biomedical research and research training amendments,tit.ii,stat,amending.entitled report on carcinogens,the list is prepared biennially by the department national toxicology program ntp.although hhs does not regulate substances based upon their inclusion in the report,a in some instances an trigger obligations under other agency regulations.for example,osha hazard communication standard requires manufacturers to label as a carcinogen every substance listed in the report.d i.see also id.e viii requiring laboratories to adopt special procedures for substances listed in the report as known human carcinogens defining some hazardous chemicals in part by reference to the report and requiring department of mine operators to identify hazardous chemicals produced or brought on to mine property.a listing can also trigger obligations under state regulations.see synthetic organic chem.mfrs.ass sec y,dep t of health and human,listing triggered state regulatory provisions.
before the secretary may list or delist a substance,the substance undergoes a review process.see hhs eighth report on carcinogens,app.acting on recommendations from the scientific community,the ntp begins by publishing in the federal register a list of substances that the agency believes merit consideration.at about the same time,an ntp committee,the report on carcinogens review committee,reviews the scientific literature and prepares a background document discussing the literature and recommending substances for listing.these recommendations,together with the background document and any public comments received in response to the federal register notice,are sent to two peer review committees the ntp interagency working group a committee composed of scientists from several federal agencies and a subcommittee of the ntp board of scientific counselors a chartered advisory committee.the subcommittee holds public hearings and receives written comments.then,the subcommittee and the working group make formal recommendations to the ntp executive committee,which in turn makes a recommendation to the ntp director.after independently evaluating the executive committee recommendation,the director submits a final draft of the report to the secretary.if the secretary approves the report,a notice is published in the federal register identifying all newly listed or delisted substances,classifying them as either known or reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens,and announcing the availability of the latest report.of significance to this case,the secretary may not move substances from one category to the other without going through the same formal review process.see eighth report describing review process.
the secretary has issued criteria for classifying substances as known or reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens.as originally issued in,the criteria provided 
known to be carcinogens 
there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans which indicates a causal relationship between the agent and human cancer.
reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen 
a.there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans,which indicates that casual interpretation is credible,but that the alternative explanations,such as chance,bias or confounding,could not adequately be excluded,or 
b.there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in experimental animals which indicates that there is an increased incidence of malignant tumors a in multiple species or strains,or b in multiple experiments preferably with different routes of administration or using different dose levels,or c to an unusual degree with regard to incidence,site or type of tumor,or age at onset.additional evidence may be provided by data concerning effects,as well as information on mutagenicity or chemical structure.
eighth report.
the parties agree that under these criteria only epidemiological studies were considered when placing a substance in the first category.many in the scientific community,however,began to urge revision of the criteria to provide for broader consideration of mechanistic is,evidence of the actual biochemical processes by which a substance causes cancer.in response,the secretary published revised criteria in.because the differences between these criteria and the version are central to this case,we quote the new version in full 
known to be a human carcinogen 
there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans which indicates a causal relationship between exposure to the agent,substance or mixture and human cancer.
reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen 
there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans,which indicates that causal interpretation is credible,but that alternative explanations,such as chance,bias or confounding,could not adequately be excluded or 
there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in experimental animals which indicates that there is an increased incidence of malignant combined benign and malignant tumors a in multiple species or at multiple tissue sites,or b by multiple routes of exposure,or c to an unusual degree with regard to incidence,site or type of tumor,or age at onset or 
there is less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans or laboratory animals however,the agent belongs to a well defined class of substances whose members are listed in a previous annual or biennial report on carcinogens as either known to be human carcinogen,or reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogen or there is convincing relevant information that the agent acts through mechanisms indicating it would likely cause cancer in humans.
conclusions regarding carcinogenicity in humans or experimental animals are based on scientific judgment,with consideration given to all relevant information.relevant information includes but is not limited to dose response,route of exposure,chemical structure,metabolism,pharmacokinetics,sensitive sub populations,genetic effects,or other data relating to mechanism of action or factors that may be unique to a given substance.for example,there may be substances for which there is evidence of carcinogenicity in laboratory animals but there are compelling data indicating that the agent acts through mechanisms which do not operate in humans and would therefore not reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer in humans.
eighth report.
the precise question before us is whether the final,unindented paragraph modifies both categories as the secretary interprets it or only the reasonably anticipated category as appellants claim.
this case involves the secretary decision to upgrade dioxin from the reasonably anticipated to the known category.a colorless,chemical not commercially produced,dioxin is released as a of paper and pulp bleaching.see hhs ninth report on carcinogens,addendum.dioxin is also emitted during incineration of materials,such as polyvinyl chloride pvc plastic.incineration of hospital waste,which usually contains pvc plastic,produces large quantities of dioxin.id.
chemically stable,dioxin persists in the environment for long periods of time.because dioxin settles into soil and water,it ends up in animal fatty tissue and eventually meat and dairy products.according to the ninth report,human exposure occurs in several ways 
food is the major source of human exposure to dioxin other pathways of exposure include inhalation of dioxin from municipal,medical,and industrial waste incinerators and other incineration and combustion processes and ingestion of drinking water of the daily intake.
id.most people have some level of dioxin in their tissues.id.
the secretary originally listed dioxin in the reasonably anticipated category.see ninth report supra.in,however,the international agency for research on cancer iarc,a division of the world health organization that has its own carcinogen classification scheme,upgraded dioxin to its highest category based on limited epidemiological evidence and strong evidence that dioxin acts through a relevant mechanism of carcinogenicity.id.in response,the ntp proposed upgrading dioxin to the known category.after approval by the report on carcinogens review committee,the proposed listing was forwarded to the working group and the subcommittee of the board of scientific counselors.the working group approved the upgrade,and after notice and public comment,so did the board.the draft background document relied on both epidemiological and mechanistic evidence 
dioxin is known to be a human carcinogen based on several types of evidence 
human studies have found an association between dioxin exposure and cancer mortality with respect to all cancers combined,lymphoma,and lung cancer 
studies in experimental animals have shown that dioxin induces benign and malignant neoplasms at multiple issue sic sites in multiple species 
a compelling body of evidence indicates a basic similarity in the mechanism of induction of animal and human tissue biochemical and toxicological responses to dioxin at comparable doses and tissue levels.
draft rc background document.
following the board approval,jim tozzi,a regulatory consultant and an appellant in this case,sent a letter to the ntp director stating that the secretary may not list substances in the known category without sufficient evidence from epidemiological studies.tozzi also complained that t oo much was crammed into too little time and that the ntp failed to provide certain key documents to the public.responding to tozzi letter and conceding that review had been inadequate,the ntp director announced a of dioxin includ ing another open,public review by the ntp board subcommittee.at the same time,the director emphasized his belief that the criteria had been appropriately applied.after the additional round of notice and comment,the board of scientific counselors voted against the upgrade,but both the ntp executive committee and the ntp director approved it.concurring with the director,the secretary listed dioxin in the ninth report as a known carcinogen.
tozzi,together with brevet industries,a manufacturer of disposable plastic connectors used during open heart surgery,the empire state restaurant tavern association,and greenbaum gilhooleys,a new york restaurant,then filed suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia pursuant to the administrative procedure act,claiming that the secretary acted arbitrarily and capriciously by upgrading dioxin without sufficient epidemiological evidence that it causes cancer in humans.finding the secretary interpretation of the criteria eminently reasonable,the district court granted summary judgment for the department.see tozzi united states dep t of health and human.tozzi,brevet,and the culinary plaintiffs now appeal.our review is de novo.russell principi,
we begin with two threshold issues.the department argues that none of the appellants has standing to challenge the dioxin upgrade and that,in any case,listing decisions are unreviewable.we consider each argument in turn.
to have article iii standing,a plaintiff must demonstrate an actual or immediate that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct and likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal quotations marks omitted.the plaintiff allegations must not be purely ultimate label for injuries too implausible to support standing.advanced mgmt,faa,internal quotation marks omitted.applying this standard,the district court found that brevet had standing.
the department first argues that brevet has failed to show actual or immediate injury.we disagree.according to an affidavit submitted by brevet president,over percent of the company sales depend on the continued use of pvc plastic by the medical establishment.brewer aff.the president also states that healthcare companies,pressured by environmental groups,have expressed concern over the dioxin hazards associated with incineration of pvc medical supplies that some municipalities have adopted resolutions calling for the phasing out of all,or nearly all,pvc containing products,including medical supplies and that brevet profits,reputation and goodwill would be adversely affected if an authoritative government agency issue d and widely disseminate d a report implying that brevet products are responsible for introducing a known human carcinogen into the environment.id.
record evidence supports brevet claims.three california francisco,oakland and resolutions forcefully calling for healthcare institutions to eliminate their use of pvc plastic.see city and county of san francisco resolution,oakland city council resolution,berkeley resolution.elsewhere,state and local agencies from hartford,connecticut,to charlotte,north carolina,to seattle,washington,have held hearings on pvc plastic use.see center for health,environment and justice,dioxin public event update.supporting brevet claim that environmental groups are pressuring healthcare providers to reduce or eliminate the use of pvc plastic,record evidence demonstrates that tenet healthcare corporation,which annually purchases over three billion dollars worth of medical supplies,has announced that it will seek to purchase products.see press release,healthcare without harm,tenet prefers medical products,other brevet customers actual and potential,including baxter international,universal health services,kaiser permanente and catholic healthcare west,have announced similar moves.id.we thus think it not at all speculative,advanced,at,to expect that brevet,a company whose revenues depend almost entirely on the continued use of pvc plastic in the medical industry,will experience reduced profits.see directv,fcc,s tanding may be established by reference to lost profits.
the department next argues that even if brevet profits were to decline,that injury would not be fairly traceable to the dioxin upgrade.lujan,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the department points out that the movement predates the listing process.it also claims that pressure on government agencies to regulate dioxin and on healthcare companies to reduce the use of pvc products will continue whether or not dioxin remains listed as a known human carcinogen.
even if the department claims were true,we disagree that brevet has failed to show that its injury is fairly traceable to the dioxin upgrade.as we pointed out in block meese,we have never applied a tort standard of causation to the question of traceability.where,as here,the alleged injury flows not directly from the challenged agency action,but rather from independent actions of third parties,we have required only a showing that the agency action is at least a substantial factor motivating the third parties actions.cmty.for creative pierce.for example,we have allowed plaintiffs claiming that regulatory changes have caused competitive injury,defined only as exposure to competition,to sue the regulating agencies,even though the harm resulted most directly from independent purchasing decisions of third parties.squibb shalala,liquid carbonic indus.ferc,citing cases.
applying this standard to the facts of this case,we have little doubt that the dioxin upgrade will represent a substantial factor in the decisions of state and local agencies to
