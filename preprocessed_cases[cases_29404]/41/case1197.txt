in this action under the employee retirement income security act erisa,plaintiff mona evans claims that her disability ltd benefits were wrongfully terminated by defendant unumprovident corporation unumprovident.the parties filed for judgment on the administrative record.determining that defendant decision to terminate plaintiff ltd benefits was arbitrary and capricious,the district court granted plaintiff motion for judgment on the administrative record and denied defendant motion.the district court ordered defendant to reinstate plaintiff as a participant and beneficiary under its ltd and life insurance policies and to pay to her past due benefits,plus accrued interest.the district court also awarded plaintiff reasonable attorney fees.unumprovident timely appeal followed.we affirm.
the present case arises from a complaint originally filed by plaintiff on february,in the district court against her employer,sunbridge healthcare,sunbridge and her disability insurer,defendant unumprovident seeking damages resulting from the termination of her ltd benefits and reinstatement of those benefits.
the policy defines disability,with regard to the class of employees that includes plaintiff,as follows 
you are disabled when unum determines that 
you are limited from performing the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation due to your sickness or injury and 
you have a or more loss in your indexed monthly earnings due to the same sickness or injury and 
during the elimination period,you are unable to perform any of the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation.
the ltd policy further states that disability benefits will cease upon the occurrence of certain events,including when you are able to work in your regular occupation on a basis but choose not to finally,certain disabilities have a limited pay period under the policy.for example,d isabilities,due to sickness or injury,which are primarily based on systems,and disabilities due to mental illness have a limited pay period up to months.
plaintiff is a single mother who suffers from complex intractable seizures,a form of epilepsy.according to her affidavit filed in conjunction with the administrative appeal,plaintiff worked as a nursing home administrator at various facilities in alabama and tennessee before beginning her work in with sunbridge in greeneville,tennessee,as a nursing home administrator.as the senior administrator,plaintiff traveled between three nursing homes in greeneville and kingsport on a daily basis in order to oversee their operations.her managerial and administrative duties included on resident care,financial,budgetary,and personnel issues.
in,plaintiff family began noticing that she exhibited periods of unresponsiveness and,in january,she suffered a grand mal seizure.in august,john dengler,a neurologist,diagnosed plaintiff as suffering from complex partial epilepsy and began medicating her.the seizure medication was ineffective,however,and plaintiff condition deteriorated.her seizure episodes began interfering with her work for sunbridge.plaintiff seizures became more frequent,typically lasting three to five minutes,and unexpectedly occurred during and after work.plaintiff suffered seizures during staff meetings and employee conferences,and a particularly severe seizure during an awards ceremony presentation required that plaintiff recuperate at home for more than two days.from february forward,plaintiff relied on friends,employees,and family to drive her back and forth to the nursing homes each workday.even as a passenger,she continued to suffer seizures during her commute.
dengler referred plaintiff to bassel,a vanderbilt university medical center neurologist and director of the university epilepsy laboratory.in february,hospitalized plaintiff and monitored her for seizure activities.a total of six seizures were recorded by video and electroencephalograph eeg during the hospitalization.plaintiff was diagnosed as suffering from partial epilepsy with the epileptogenic focus in the left temporal region of her brain.surgery was not considered to be an option.
despite new medications,plaintiff seizures continued to increase in number and severity.plaintiff suffered seizures that were debilitating.after each seizure,she was unable to remember what had happened in the recent past and could not recall what she had to do in the near future.by june,dengler and advised plaintiff that she should take an extended medical leave of absence.both physicians opined that the stress associated with her administrative duties was responsible for the severity and frequency of the seizure episodes.plaintiff applied for and received disability benefits from september through february.she then applied for ltd benefits under the group ltd policy provided by sunbridge.
in support of her claim for benefits,plaintiff submitted attending physician statements from dengler and and the report from based on his hospitalization study.dengler opined that plaintiff was unable to drive or work in stressful situations and that her prognosis for recovery was fair.indicated that plaintiff had frequent seizures with altered awareness which impaired her ability to work.he restricted plaintiff from activities such as using the stove or oven,driving,and operating heavy machinery.opined that plaintiff had not reached maximum medical improvement and that he expected it to be more than six months before there would be any fundamental changes in her medical condition.
defendant determined that plaintiff met the definition of disability under the ltd policy and approved her receipt of benefits from march through may.because plaintiff employee welfare benefit plan also provided a waiver of her group life insurance premium if she was disabled,she also received defendant life insurance benefit with a waiver of premium guarantee.plaintiff was awarded,and continues to draw,social security disability benefits.
defendant thereafter continued to monitor plaintiff medical condition with periodic updates.the following information was collected as part of defendant monitoring process and is included in the administrative record considered by the district court.
an office note dated october,from indicated that plaintiff had not suffered any complex partial seizures since her last visit on july,although she still experienced auras indications of the onset of a seizure and difficulty with her memory.an examination revealed that she had no nystagmus,no tremor,no dysmetria,and no ataxia.was pleased with her seizure control.
a form completed by on january,indicated that plaintiff should not work in any situation where seizures could cause harm to herself or others,and she should not drive,handle hot items,operate moving machinery,or be in high,unprotected places.in an office note dated april,reported that plaintiff had not experienced any seizures since her visit in october,and,in light of her excellent seizure control,he would not need to see her again for a year.
on april,defendant disability consultant,rick yi,recommended that defendant conduct a vocational review and obtain further information from regarding his restrictions and how they would apply to plaintiff occupation.on may,lilia rascon,a certified rehabilitation consultant,reviewed plaintiff file and determined that her light duty occupation as an administrator of a health care facility fit well within restrictions thus,according to rascon,plaintiff should be able to perform the material requirements of her position.
on august,defendant sent a letter to advising him that it believed plaintiff could perform her occupation within the restrictions and limitations he had provided.was asked whether or not he agreed with this assessment.he responded as follows 
increased levels of stress can be a precipitant to seizure activity.since evans has been away from her work environment,the seizures have improved tremendously.the position of nursing home administrator requires an enormous amount of responsibility along with very important skills.the stress level is very high.during and after a seizure,evans is unaware of her surroundings,and is unable to make any rational decisions.it would be in evans best interest not to return to work at this time.
on august,at a roundtable discussion of plaintiff case,michael randall,a staff physician for defendant,who is in preventive medicine with a in occupational and environmental medicine,concluded that it was unreasonable to speculate that plaintiff return to work would exacerbate her condition.
on september,defendant had randall review plaintiff medical records.he concluded that plaintiff medical records did not support opinion that her seizures were likely to be induced by workplace stress.randall believed that was exaggerating the evidence to keep plaintiff totally disabled and further opined that comment regarding stress as a precipitant was clearly prophylactic and without documentation to support it.randall concluded that plaintiff current medications adequately controlled her condition,and,in his judgment,she could return to her regular occupation with reasonable restrictions and limitations as stated by in january.
in an office visit to on september,plaintiff reported experiencing ten auras and estimated that she had experienced ten complex partial seizures.she also thought she might be having additional seizures while asleep.adjusted the dosage of her medication and again referenced stress as a probable factor causing the seizures.following an office visit on october,his impression was recurrent seizures,perhaps brought on by stress.
on march,defendant had plaintiff records reviewed by lance lee,a staff neurological consultant in psychiatry and neurology.lee agreed with randall that the stress avoidance restriction was prophylactic but agreed with other prescribed restrictions and limitations.
on march,plaintiff had an office visit with and reported that she had experienced six seizures that month.he again adjusted her medication.then,on her september,visit,indicated that her seizures were apparently completely controlled,but that in the past month,plaintiff had been under increased stress and had been waking up in the morning with a postictal feeling,indicating possible seizures at night.noted that it seems the seizures have recurred due to stress at that time,although it is hard to confirm the seizure occurrence and the number of seizures.in fact,such nighttime seizures were virtually impossible to confirm because plaintiff lived alone with her daughter.plaintiff also complained of difficulties with memory and tremors.
on november,defendant sent a letter to plaintiff requesting an updated certification of her disability.defendant enclosed a form to be completed by plaintiff and her attending physician,as well as an estimated functional abilities form to be completed by the physician.plaintiff replied that her seizures were continuing,accompanied by memory loss,tremors,and a lack of awareness of her surroundings.she noted that her medications made her drowsy,and she slept for three or four hours each afternoon.in his corresponding report dated december,responded that plaintiff continued to have seizures related to stress and suffered from sleepiness,constipation,memory loss,and an altered awareness with each seizure.although he noted that patient appears to be unable to tolerate any stress without increasing the frequency of her seizures,indicated that plaintiff functional ability was not impaired until she had a seizure.he reiterated that plaintiff should not drive,operate heavy moving machinery,or be in high unprotected places.
on january,defendant senior customer care specialist,kellie downey,initiated a surveillance request for the purpose of determining whether plaintiff daily activities were consistent with her reported level of activities and the prescribed limitations.downey also requested the status of plaintiff driver license and learned that plaintiff still had a valid driver license with no restrictions.on january and,defendant investigator videotaped plaintiff driving her car near her home in elizabethton,with her daughter as a passenger.
on january,defendant requested another medical review of plaintiff records by lee.after reviewing the medical information,he reported that plaintiff seizure frequency was uncertain.noting that it is true sometimes partial seizures are difficult to treat and requires hospitalization to localize lesion in brain with help of monitoring,he found no such record and no emergency room visits or prolonged hospitalization records to support the severe intractable nature of the partial seizure lee concluded that plaintiff current restrictions and limitations were reasonable,except for the opinion that plaintiff could not tolerate stress,which lee found to be very prophylactic.
on february,downey sent a letter to,advising him of the definition of disability under the policy.the letter also advised that defendant medical department had concluded that the driving restriction was reasonable,but the restriction of stress avoidance was very prophylactic that defendant vocational department had concluded that driving was not a material and substantial duty of plaintiff occupation that plaintiff had been observed driving through surveillance in disregard of his stated restrictions and,that plaintiff driver license was not restricted in any way.therefore,it was defendant opinion that plaintiff was able to perform her occupation as nursing home administrator.was asked whether he agreed that plaintiff could return to work and,if not,why.
on march,responded by letter,stating that,although it appeared from defendant investigation that plaintiff was driving,which she should not do,your surveillance report does not change anything in my report.noting that plaintiff position as nursing home administrator entailed an enormous amount of responsibility and was accompanied by significant stress,opined that t he fact is that mona evans has complex partial seizures and the frequency of her seizures increases when she is under stress,as it does for many patients with epilepsy therefore,i still feel it is in her best interest that she not return to work at this time.
reply was reviewed by lee,who responded by that his previous opinion was unchanged and t he fact that claimant is driving despite medical and state recommendation tells that claimant is not a prudent person.
on may,downey telephoned plaintiff to advise her that her ltd benefits were being terminated.following the phone call,plaintiff suffered a seizure requiring medical attention by paramedics called to her home.a letter sent by downey to plaintiff on the same date advised her that her condition no longer met the policy definition of disability and,consequently,her ltd and life insurance benefits were being discontinued.the letter informed plaintiff that 
defendant medical department had determined that although the driving restriction was reasonable and supported,a restriction and limitation of stress avoidance was prophylactic 
there were no records of monitoring,emergency room visits,or prolonged hospitalization in plaintiff file to support the intractable nature of the complex partial seizures 
had noted that it was hard to confirm the seizure occurrence and the number of seizures 
the documented seizural activity and daytime sleepiness were largely 
plaintiff had been observed driving in january,despite medical recommendations and state requirements,indicating that plaintiff was not a prudent person 
the vocational department classified plaintiff occupation as light work which did not require her to drive therefore she could perform her occupation within the restrictions indicated by and 
in light of the determination that plaintiff could perform her occupation,her waiver of premium life insurance policy benefit was also cancelled.
on june,plaintiff had an office visit with.he noted that she continued to have memory problems and suffered from hand tremors.the seizures were apparently completely controlled but,in the past month there had been increased stress,and she had been waking up every morning with a postictal feeling.he noted that she had experienced two seizures in october one seizure in november one in december none in january or february of one in march none in april one longer seizure in may,followed by two minor ones the next day and one on june the day her father suffered a heart attack.
on june,wrote a detailed letter to downey,advising her as follows 
the seizures of evans have been documented beyond any doubt,by recording them during a hospital admission in the epilepsy monitoring unit in.i am attaching a copy of the epilepsy laboratory report,dated february.her seizures started without any warning.she was usually not aware that she had a seizure.when she now reports that she wakes up with a postictal feeling,i consider this evidence that she is having seizures.even if she is not aware of any seizure,there is the possibility that seizures are occurring that she is not aware of.studies show that once seizures have been resistant to two drugs they have less than a chance of becoming fully controlled with a new drug or a combination of drugs kwan and brodie,new england journal of medicine,february.the odds are low that her seizures will come under complete control for a prolonged period of time.
evans typical seizures recorded in involved prolonged postictal aphasia.i doubt that evans can do a good job as a nursing home administrator with any recurrent seizures.as a nursing home administrator she needs her full mental capacity to make potentially important decisions.in my opinion,having episodes of prolonged postictal aphasia is not compatible with optimal performance as a nursing home administrator.her job description requires,among other things,that she maintain a liaison with families,residents,the governing board,and medical staff,that she represent her facility at top level meetings,that she counsel,discipline or terminate personnel as necessary,that she meet with department directors and conduct classes and training programs.having intermittent seizures and the subsequent postictal impairment would make it impossible to perform these duties properly.
the issue of stress provoking seizures is a real one.stress is probably the most important factor in all patients,and not just evans.the position of nursing home administrator carries an enormous amount of responsibility.since evans has been away from her work environment,her seizures have improved.i agree that it is hard to eliminate stress from life.nevertheless,if seizures are not fully controlled without stress,they will not be controlled in the presence of stress.
regarding the issue of driving,she is not supposed to drive until for months.however,her driving against medical advice has no relevance to her disability.
on june,plaintiff sent defendant a letter constituting an appeal from its determination to discontinue her ltd benefits.in support of her appeal,plaintiff submitted her own affidavit reciting her history of seizures and additional exhibits,including the paramedics report regarding the visit to plaintiff home after plaintiff suffered her may,seizure,additional copies of hospitalization and monitoring records,and current medical notes.
on october,defendant had plaintiff medical file reviewed by its and medical director,alan neuren.neuren,who is board certified in psychiatry and neurology,concluded that the impact of stress upon plaintiff seizures was entirely and had not been corroborated by medical studies.he found no indication that her employment caused worsening of her seizures and noted that once plaintiff began taking medication,there were extended periods of time during which she was seizure free.neuren concluded that medication adjustments,not plaintiff absence from employment,caused the reduction in the frequency of her seizures.neuren noted that no subsequent studies had been performed that documented the presence of breakthrough seizures while on.
on october,defendant notified plaintiff that it had considered her appeal but adhered to its prior determination that she could perform her usual occupation and was no longer disabled under the terms of the ltd policy.defendant thus upheld its decision terminating her ltd and insurance benefits.
plaintiff subsequently filed the present lawsuit.the parties filed cross motions for judgment on the administrative record.on december,the district court issued a comprehensive memorandum opinion and order granting plaintiff motion for judgment on the administrative record and denying defendant motion.the court ordered the reinstatement of plaintiff ltd and life insurance benefits and the payment of past due benefits,as well as accrued interest and reasonable attorney fees.
on january,defendant filed this timely notice of appeal.
