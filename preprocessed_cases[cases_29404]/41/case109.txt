facts and background 
in gorelik applied for and was accepted to a residency program in psychiatry at dartmouth hitchcock medical center dhmc scheduled to begin in july of that year.in june,in connection with that program,gorelik applied for a resident training license to practice medicine in new hampshire through the new hampshire state board of medicine the board.following that application,on july,the board issued gorelik a temporary training license through an order of conditional approval order pending completion of her appeal of her dismissal from a previous training program in the state of new york.after several extensions,her temporary license expired on april.on june,gorelik request to renew that license was denied by the board.
meanwhile,in august,a newsletter published by the board listed the order granting gorelik her temporary license under the heading disciplinary actions.among the final disciplinary actions listed in the newsletter was gorelik order of conditional training license granted during appeal of dismissal from a prior training program.this newsletter was available on the board website.some time in,gorelik became aware of the newsletter and its availability on the board website.
gorelik asserts that the newsletter continued to be available on the board website through the filing of this action,and that it continued to list the order as a disciplinary action.gorelik argues that the listing of the order under the heading of disciplinary actions was a mischaracterization.she further contends that an internet search of her name will generate hits referring to the mischaracterization and that because t his mischaracterization improperly implies wrongdoing on her part it is harmful to her professional reputation.finally,gorelik argues that had she known that the order would be published as a disciplinary action,she would not have accepted the temporary license from the board.
on february,gorelik petitioned the board for a hearing to have the information pertaining to the order removed from the board website and to change the characterization of the temporary license as a disciplinary action.on june,the board issued an order in response to gorelik petition.the order granted gorelik request to remove any characterization of the order issuing her temporary license as a disciplinary action from its records,including from the newsletter posted on the board website.the order also granted gorelik request to withhold from publication the board response to her petition in the board newsletter or on its website so as to avoid further harm to gorelik reputation.however,the board denied gorelik request to remove all references to the order issuing her temporary license from its website and further determined that the june,order itself would be a public record,though the board would not affirmatively publicize it.finally,the order provided that it would become final within thirty days unless gorelik requested in writing that the board hold a hearing.the record is silent as to whether any such request was made,though gorelik states in an affidavit that a hearing was scheduled for april.
though gorelik argues otherwise,the district court found that in the board did indeed change the language of the internet version of the newsletter to reflect that the issuance of gorelik temporary license was a board action and not a disciplinary action.
gorelik also claims that on or about march,at a prehearing conference her counsel was advised by the board presiding officer and attorney,judy dickinson,that if gorelik continued to pursue the petition,it would necessarily require dickinson to disclose to the board information pertaining to gorelik dhmc residency and the denial of her application to renew her temporary license.gorelik counsel then advised her that further pursuit of a hearing would likely lead the board to post information about the denial of gorelik renewal application to its website.thereafter,gorelik,in april,withdrew her petition in order to avoid further disclosure.her complaint was filed on february,almost three years later.
to reiterate,in counts i through iv,gorelik alleged violations under and the fourteenth amendment,arguing that the defendant violated her due process and equal protection rights by failing to provide notice that the temporary license as issued would be characterized as a disciplinary action and posted on the board website as such characterizing the issuance of her temporary license as a disciplinary action although it is not generally characterized as such for others failing to provide notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to treating the license as a disciplinary action and failing to provide notice and an opportunity to refuse acceptance of the temporary license because of the mischaracterization of it as a disciplinary action.in count v,she asserted that the defendant violated her first and fourteenth amendment rights by threatening to retaliate against her in the form of public disclosure for petitioning the board for relief.gorelik sought declaratory and injunctive relief,attorney fees,and costs.
the defendant filed a motion to dismiss under.b arguing,inter alia,that the applicable statute of limitations had expired and that gorelik failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted.the district court dismissed the claims solely on the grounds that counts i through iv were and count v was too speculative and also noted that the parties should not infer that other grounds for dismissal were without merit.
on this appeal,gorelik raises two issues.first,she argues that under the continuing violation doctrine,counts i through iv should not have been dismissed as,and second,that count v should not have been dismissed because it was properly pled.
ii.discussion 
we consider first her claim that,as to counts i through iv of her complaint,the continuing violation doctrine was sufficient to bring those counts within the applicable limitations period.
