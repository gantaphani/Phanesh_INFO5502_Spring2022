after anthony lee hills was arrested and charged with burglary,a kentucky court ordered him transferred to the kentucky correctional psychiatric center kcpc for observation,assessment,and treatment because of questions regarding his competency to stand trial and his mental state at the time of the alleged crime.during the course of his treatment,hills was forcibly administered an antipsychotic drug as authorized by the state court.the charges against him were ultimately dropped.
hills subsequently sued the kcpc and several of its professionals,including nasiruddin siddiqui,alleging various constitutional violations arising out of his being forcibly medicated.siddiqui filed a motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.after the district court denied the motion,siddiqui filed this interlocutory appeal.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
in april of,hills was arrested and charged with burglary under kentucky law.approximately one week after his arrest,a state trial court ordered that hills undergo a psychiatric examination at the kcpc to determine whether he was competent to stand trial pursuant to the standard set forth in,and whether he met the definition of insanity set forth in.
hills was examined at the kcpc by robert sivley,who authored a psychological evaluation in may of.the report concluded that hills suffered from the delusion that god revealed to him in a dream that the burglary victim was his soulmate and that her child was his biological son,but that further inpatient assessment was necessary to confirm the degree to which he suffers from a circumscribed delusion relating to the alleged victim and her son or has any other symptoms.sivley reiterated this conclusion at the end of his report i t will be necessary to observe him on a more intensive and basis,in order to assess whether he has other psychotic symptoms which would be relevant to the criminal responsibility issue.as for the question of his competency to stand trial,sivley determined that hills had a good understanding of basic legal procedures,terminology,and his own situation,but noted in passing that hills delusions may impede his ability to participate rationally in his own defense,especially if he is unwilling to accept empirical evidence that the child in question is not his son,paternity testing and chooses instead to believe his view of god revealing that the child is actually his.
presumably based on sivley recommendation,the state trial court issued a second order on june.this order stated that the case had c ome on for hearing this is the only indication in the record that a hearing actually took place and that there is reason to believe that hills is not mentally capable of understanding the charges against him or aiding his counsel in the trial of said case,but there is a substantial probability that the defendant will attain competency in the foreseeable future.invoking.a provision dealing with commitment for treatment of defendants incompetent to stand trial but with a substantial probability of becoming competent,and.the code section providing for the mental examination of defendants wishing to introduce evidence of their insanity at the time of the offense,the order went on to state 
it is hereby ordered pursuant to krs that anthony lee hills be taken to kentucky correctional psychiatric center kcpc for treatment and examination,including forced medication and any restraint which may be necessary to effect such treatment,and to determine whether the patient meets criteria for criminal responsibility.
ten days later hills was sent back to the kcpc for further examination and treatment.he remained a patient at the kcpc from late june through late september of.throughout this period,hills was interviewed and evaluated by several individuals,including timothy allen a kcpc psychiatrist and steven simon,a kcpc psychologist,both of whom were originally defendants in this action,but who have previously been dismissed.
the administration of forced medication that forms the basis of this suit occurred in august and september of.by august,hills had been at the kcpc for approximately seven weeks.the staff had concluded that hills could benefit from a regimen of antipsychotic medication,but hills persistently refused the recommended treatment.such continuous refusals finally prompted simon to have a telephone conversation with rebecca gibson,the public defender assigned to represent hills.the following day,august,simon sent a letter to gibson reflecting the substance of their conversation.in the letter,simon stated that the kcpc staff had concluded that the administration of antipsychotic medication could benefit hills,but several weeks would be needed for the medication to take effect.gibson,according to the letter,related that she agreed with this and would relay this on to the court.
the next day,hills treating psychiatrist,siddiqui,prescribed a course of mg of zyprexa,an antipsychotic drug,to be administered at bedtime.over a period,no therapeutic benefit was achieved from the drug,but hills became increasingly angry.the dosage was then increased to mg,but this increase did not produce a corresponding change in behavior.finally the trial of zyprexa was discontinued on september.hills was transferred back to the county jail two weeks later.according to hills,the burglary charge against him was eventually dismissed.he stated that after eight months in jail on a case with no witness or no evidence i was released.
procedural background 
hills filed a pro se complaint,handwriting relevant information on a form typically used by pro se prisoners bringing civil rights complaints.attached to this form was a typed letter in which hills described his experiences while incarcerated and undergoing evaluation and treatment at kcpc.demanding in damages,he alleged violations of his first amendment right to the free exercise of religion,his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial,and his fourteenth amendment right to the due process of law.several defendants were named in the complaint,including the county jail,the sheriff department,hills public defender,the kcpc,and allen,siddiqui,and simon.
the defendants filed answers that included several affirmative defenses to hills complaint.citing e and mcgore wrigglesworth,cir,the district court screened the complaint and dismissed all of the claims except those alleging fourteenth amendment violations against allen,siddiqui,and simon in their individual capacities on the basis of the forced medication of hills.the three doctors then filed a motion for summary judgment,to which hills did not respond.
siddiqui was the psychiatrist who actually prescribed the course of zyprexa and increased its dosage.the district court concluded that siddiqui was not entitled to qualified immunity because,despite the existence of the june,court order and the consent of hills attorney on august,it was unreasonable to believe that his actions were lawful.two reasons were given in support of this conclusion according to the court,the kcpc did not rely on the june court order,allegedly evidenced by the fact that simon felt it necessary to contact gibson to ask whether hills could be medicated against his will,and siddiqui could not have believed that his actions were lawful in light of the existence of a kentucky statute setting forth detailed procedures that must be followed before forcibly medicating a patient.
on the other hand,the district court dismissed allen and simon from the action,to which hills did not file a.siddiqui then filed an interlocutory appeal from the denial of qualified immunity.hills,still proceeding pro se,filed a brief in response,which consisted of a letter.
ii.analysis 
first amendment claim 
in hills letter brief,he argues that the district court improperly dismissed his first amendment claim.the claim was based on the allegation that he was forcibly medicated because of his religious convictions rather than for any violent tendencies or other reason.after hills
