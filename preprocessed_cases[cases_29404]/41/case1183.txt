background 
jennifer smith worked as a loan office branch manager for countrywide for more than eight years prior to filing her claim for short term disability benefits.she was treated for multiple medical problems,beginning in through the date of her alleged disability in february.her documented medical problems include migraine headaches,back pain,fibromyalgia,thyroid dysfunction,hearing loss,degenerative disc disease,sleep disorder,and depression.she has undergone multiple pain management procedures,including lumbar facet block injections and lumbar facet rhizotomies smith ongoing treatment includes multiple prescription medications,including thyroid replacement,medication,and narcotic and pain medications.
on january,smith informed her employer that she could no longer work and filed a telephonic application for disability benefits.ccc contacted van bussum office,smith primary care doctor,and requested information relating to smith disability claim.van bussum disability specialist filled out a form,indicating that smith had degenerative disc disease and fibromyalgia,and that smith had undergone facet rhizotomy.her estimated date was listed as never.initially,ccc accepted the disability claim,and a note was made in smith file that the claim would be paid.however,ccc did not pay the claim and instead the request.ccc contacted smith on march,to discuss her medical condition.she reported that she had undergone eight nerve blocks over a three month period,and had undergone facet rhizotomies on both the left and right side in an attempt to treat her degenerative disc disease.she was scheduled for repeat rhizotomies in april and may of.the fibromyalgia required her to rest twice per day and participate in water therapy and mobility exercises,as well as take an and medication for nerve pain.her husband had taken a leave of absence to care for her.
ccc also requested the medical records from van bussum and dubal,smith pain specialist,for the period of january,through march.following review of the records by registered nurse linda krasa,ccc denied the disability benefits.the april,denial letter stated that 
although we agree you may have a condition,the medical information provided does not support or illustrate a functional impairment that would prevent you from performing the material and substantial duties of your occupation as a branch manager for countrywide credit industries.based on the information received and reviewed,we are unable to honor your claim for disability benefits.
ja.the letter outlined smith right of appeal.
following the denial,van bussum drafted a letter on june,detailing his treatment of smith,and the severity of her medical problems.in the letter,van bussum stated 
smith has been a patient of mine since.over the past six years i have seen her become increasingly incapacitated by her medical problems.i have sought consultation from neurologists,rheumatologists,physical therapists,pain medicine specialists,and neurosurgeons.i have ordered multiple,ct scans,and mri scans in an attempt to better define and explain her medical problems.reports are readily available regarding the above.
unfortunately smith has now become unable to work.her problem list includes lumbar and cervical spondylosis with facet arthropathy,degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine with spinal canal stenosis,degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine,fibromyalgia,migraine headaches and cluster headache syndrome.this constellation of problems have continued to progressively worsen causing a great deal of pain and suffering for smith.in my professional opinion,she is permanently and totally disabled and unfortunately i have little to offer her in regards to treatment pain relief.
on july,smith appealed the denial,and forwarded pages of medical records detailing the course of her medical problems spanning a period of ten years.after reviewing the records,ccc noted in smith file on july,that medical shows history of similar complaints from to present.medical info does not show an inability to perform duties of occupation.on july,a notation in smith file states that a copy of her job description was received,and on july,a copy of smith pharmacy records were received.ccc then forwarded the file for peer review to kaplan,a rheumatologist employed by a medical review company.along with the medical records,ccc sent a file summary note dated august,from nurse krasa that stated,inter alia 
the file documents several chronic conditions that the claimant has worked with and has been treated for and continues to be treated for by the same doctors and with the same medications with no change in the prior treatment plans or referral to any other treating sources.it is of note that the claimant does not relate her medication usage prescribed by leung to the other treating sources,specifically the lortabs and fiorcet both that are purchased monthly.at the same time the claimant is purchasing oxycontin monthly from another pharmacy.see pharmacy list enclosed.
on august,kaplan issued his peer review opinion letter to nurse krasa.after reviewing pages of records,he opined that smith did suffer from degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease in her spine,but that the pain could be controlled through medications and injections.he found that there was no documentation of any clinical findings of impairment that would prohibit her from performing her job.kaplan further opined that pain is a subjective complaint and often times is out of proportion to physical findings and the medical records do not support more than mild musculoskeletal impairment.ja.
although ccc specifically requested kaplan to conduct a telephone interview with van bussum as part of the peer review,kaplan stated in his letter that he called van bussum office,but that van bussum secretary reported that smith file had not been transferred to their new office,so they did not have the information to give to him.kaplan submitted his peer review findings to ccc without conducting the requested interview.however,he noted in his letter that he would send an addendum after speaking to vanbussum.the interview was never conducted.
ccc received kaplan review on august,and noted in smith file that kaplan review was in agreement with the medical review conducted by the nurse case manager at ccc,and the medical record did not support smith inability to perform the substantial and material duties of her occupation as a branch manager.on this same date,a disability specialist from ccc issued a letter to smith attorney,stating that ccc had 
received and reviewed the additional medical information that was submitted by your office and it does not alter our decision.the complete file,including the newly submitted medical information,was sent for an independent review by a board certified rheumatologist.
the report of the independent review concluded that the medical evidence did not support the presence of a functional loss that would preclude smith from performing the substantial and material duties of her occupation as a branch manager.
as indicated in the letter dated that was sent to jennifer smith it remains our position that the decision to deny benefits was correct and your file has been forwarded to appeals for a formal review.
on september,ccc issued its denial following the appeal.while the letter essentially restates the contents of the initial denial on april,it also states 
the office notes indicate vanbussen sic saw your client on january,with complaints of upper back pain.we are aware that your client recently returned to work because of prior symptoms.although vanbussen sic has sent statements indicating your client is completely disabled,there were no findings included that explain how that conclusion was rendered.
ja.although the letter stated that ccc was aware that smith had returned to work,smith had not returned to work at any time following january.
after smith received this letter,she contacted ccc and asked them to consider the impact of her many medications on her ability to perform the essential functions of her position.van bussum sent a letter on october,advising ccc that smith was taking synthroid,prozac,neurontin,oxycontin,lortab,fioricet,zanaflex,trazadone,vivelle,vioxx,toradol,and pycnogenol.in the letter,van bussum stated in my medical opinion,it would be very difficult to function under any circumstances while under the influence of these medications.ja.ccc responded to this letter,stating that they had already considered the medications that smith had been taking,and that this information did not change their decision.ja.the letter was not forwarded to kaplan.
at this point,smith had exhausted her administrative remedies.she filed suit in the eastern district of kentucky on february.in a subsequent discovery motion,smith asked the district court to allow additional,limited discovery in order to determine whether the defendant artificially truncated their review of the medical record in order to engage in willful ignorance of smith disability.in response,the court issued an order noting that it is well established that,in the sixth circuit,a district court reviewing an erisa plan administrator decision is limited solely to the record that was before the administrator at the time of the decision.ja.the court stated that extrinsic evidence is allowed only when there is a procedural challenge to the administrator decision.id.at.
finding that smith challenge was of a procedural nature,the district court authorized limited discovery in order to determine 
the defendant protocol regarding physician review,including requests for supplemental amendments the defendant protocol regarding independent medical examinations imes the defendant relationship with reviewing physicians and their impact on the report submitted the scope of information provided to reviewing physicians by the defendant the manner in which physician reviews are conducted,including depositions of physicians who reviewed the plaintiff claim.
ja.as a result of the discovery order,smith deposed kristi kuhn,linda krasa,and donna gatling,the ccc employees most closely associated with the administrative review process.
thereafter,the parties filed for summary judgment.on december,the district court granted ccc motion,and denied smith motion.the district court found that there was substantial evidence in the record to uphold the plan administrator decision.the court ruled that even if not all of the documents were provided to kaplan,a review of all of the documents in the administrative record supports a finding that continental decision to deny benefits was not arbitrary and capricious.smith cont l cas,at,hereinafter slip op.further,the court found that although kaplan never spoke directly with van bussum,smith offered no evidence that van bussum had additional evidence outside of the record that would have impacted the determination.the court also found that the appeals committee did not err in deciding that smith medication regimen did not affect their denial.finally,the court found that smith contention that ccc had an extreme conflict of interest because they were acting as both plan administrator and insurer was without merit,because this consideration only applies when there is significant evidence that the insurer was motivated by.smith,slip op.at.
smith then filed a motion to alter,amend,or vacate the ruling of the district court.on march,the district court denied smith motion,and this timely appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court exercised subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to a b erisa.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to,because the district court entered a final order when it granted defendant motion for judgment in its favor,which order remained in effect after plaintiff motion to alter,amend,or vacate the ruling was denied.
this court reviews a district court decision concerning an erisa denial of benefits de novo.the plan administrator decision to deny benefits to a plan recipient is subject to de novo review,unless the plan provides the administrator with discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.wilkins baptist healthcare system,cir.when the plan administrator has discretionary authority to determine benefits,as is the case here,the court reviews a denial of benefits under the highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review.yeager reliance standard life ins,cir.
the arbitrary and capricious standard is the least demanding form of judicial review of administrative action.when applying the arbitrary and capricious standard,the courts must decide whether the plan administrator decision was rational in light of the plan provisions.stated differently,when it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation,based on the evidence,for a particular outcome,that outcome is not arbitrary and capricious.williams int l paper,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.although review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is highly deferential,it is not no review,and deference need not be abject.mcdonald life ins,cir internal citation and quotation omitted.
iii.analysis 
in order to be eligible for benefits under the ccc group disability plan,the claimant must meet the following definition of disability 
disability means that injury or sickness causes physical or mental impairment to such a degree of severity that you are 
continuously unable to perform the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation and 
not working for wages in any occupation for which you are or become qualified by education,training or experience.
ccc group disability plan,ja emphasis in original.
according to the plan,the denial of a disability claim may be appealed by writing the insurance company within days of the denial,and requesting a review.the company will perform a full and fair review,and notify the claimant of its decision within days.id.at.
smith claims that the administrator decision to deny her disability benefits was arbitrary and capricious,because she is not able to perform the material and substantial duties of her regular occupation.smith argues that the district court erred in affirming the administrator.she brings five issues on appeal the district court utilized the wrong standard of review,due to appellee obvious conflict of interest the district court failed to take into consideration ccc false assertion that smith had returned to work in denying her claim ccc manipulation of the medical records,failure to interview van bussum,failure to conduct an evaluation,and failure to obtain a full job description negated a full and fair review of smith disability claim the district court and ccc erred when they did not consider the impact of smith many medications and the district court erred in disallowing smith to continue to conduct discovery into ccc alleged manipulation of her medical records.we consider each claim in turn.
standard of review and conflict of interest 
smith asserts that the district court applied the wrong standard of review when it did not consider the inherent conflict of interest because of ccc acting as both administrator of the disability plan and the claims payor.in support of her position,smith quotes calvert firstar finance,
although we must review liberty denial of benefits to calvert under the highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard,we must take into consideration the fact that liberty is acting under a potential conflict of interest because it is both the,determining which claims are covered,and also the payor of those claims.
cir citing marks newcourt credit group,cir.the court further clarified the inquiry,stating that the possible conflict should be taken into account when deciding whether the plan administrator decision is arbitrary and capricious.id.however,the standard of review is not altered to a less deferential standard when the benefits administrator is operating under a conflict of interest.id.at.instead,as noted,the standard remains unchanged and the conflict of interest is to be considered in applying that standard.id.emphasis in original accord kalish liberty mut.liberty life assur.of boston,cir.
the district court properly recognized that ccc conflict of interest was only a factor to consider in its review,and did not alter the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.smith,slip op.at.in considering such a conflict,there must be significant evidence in the record that the insurer was motivated by,and the plaintiff bears the burden to show that a significant conflict was present.id.at.smith did not develop the record to show that the conflict of interest contributed to an arbitrary and capricious determination by ccc.therefore,this claim of error is without merit.
smith alleged return to work 
smith claims that ccc inappropriately relied upon its belief that smith had returned to work prior to the issuance of the september,denial letter following her appeal.the letter states w e are aware that your client recently returned to work because of prior symptoms.ja.the record is completely devoid of any evidence that smith returned to work at any time following her departure on january.if it is true,as smith asserts,that ccc relied upon this belief in making its disability determination,the decision would not be rational in light of the plan provision as required to survive arbitrary and capricious review.yeager,at.
the district court failed to address the return to work statement.neither did ccc offer any explanation in its brief as to the meaning of this sentence in the denial letter.this lack of any reasonable explanation supports a finding that smith disability determination was not rational in view of the plan language.at a minimum,ccc should have offered some logical explanation concerning the meaning of this important assertion in the denial letter,and the district court did commit error when it failed to consider this issue 
ccc actions negated a full and fair review 
smith brings four claims of error concerning ccc process in conducting the disability determination.
manipulation of the medical records 
smith claims that ccc artificially truncated the records that it sent to kaplan for peer review of her disability claim.according to smith,she provided pages of medical records for review,and ccc provided a total of pages to kaplan,of which were record documents.kaplan report records pages of materials that were sent for review.during her deposition testimony,nurse krasa stated that ccc sent pages of medical records from van bussum for peer review.however,kaplan review only identifies pages.krasa was unable to articulate why there was a discrepancy in the number of van bussum medical records sent,and the number of records reviewed by kaplan likewise,ccc employee kristi kuhn was unable to explain the discrepancy in the overall number of pages of smith job description reviewed by kaplan and the number sent.
in response to smith claim,ccc states that nurse krasa documented in smith file that pages of the records submitted were duplicates.however neither krasa or kuhn could identify with certainty which records were actually reviewed by kaplan.ja 
the district court found that even if not all of the documents were provided to kaplan,a review of all of the documents in the administrative record supports a finding that continental decision to deny benefits was not arbitrary and capricious.smith,slip op.at.the district court found that there was no evidence that continental wrongfully truncated the record,or hand picked the documents to be submitted to kaplan.id.at.
yet,there is clear evidence that there are discrepancies in the overall number of medical records that were provided to ccc for review,and the number that were in fact reviewed by kaplan.without knowing why there are these discrepancies,it is impossible to say that ccc did not artificially alter the record for kaplan review.if ccc did hand pick the records,then smith right to a full and fair review of her disability denial was abridged.see ccc policy,ja.
kaplan failure to interview van bussum 
smith claims that her right to full and fair review was hampered by kaplan failure to converse with her primary doctor,van bussum.ccc specifically requested kaplan to perform a telephonic interview with van bussum.in kaplan review letter,he stated that he called van bussum office,and was told that the office was in the process of moving,and smith file was not available.kaplan stated that the office had no information to give to him,but that he would file an addendum to his review after speaking with van bussum.kaplan never spoke to van bussum,never filed an addendum,and later copies of the letter lacked the addendum language completely.compare ja with ja.the record shows that kaplan was paid for a teleconference,yet there is no evidence in the record that he spoke to van bussum.
ccc argues that when kaplan attempted to discuss the matter with van bussum,he was rebuffed the fact that van bussum refused to discuss appellant case with kaplan renders his conclusions suspicious at best.br.of appellee at.however,the record does not support the assertion that van bussum rebuffed kaplan attempt to speak to him.it merely supports the assertion that van bussum office was moving,and that smith file was not present at the time kaplan called.there is no evidence in the record that kaplan tried at a later date to contact van bussum.
the district court found that there was no evidence that a telephone conference with van bussum would have resulted in kaplan issuing a different report.smith,slip op.at.further,the plaintiff does not offer evidence that van bussum had any additional information beyond this report to offer kaplan had they spoken on the telephone.id.the district court failed to consider the fact that kaplan had completely reviewed van bussum records,and there was no way of knowing which records kaplan did review.under the circumstances,kaplan could have learned additional information from this conference.kaplan failure to conduct the requested interview and ccc issuance of the denial notwithstanding kaplan failure to do so supports the contention that its determination was arbitrary and capricious.
while van bussum opinion as smiths treating physician does not have to be afforded special deference by an erisa plan administrator pursuant to the supreme court holding in black decker disability plan nord,neither can ccc arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant reliable evidence,including the opinions of a treating physician,d.here,kaplan did not review all of van bussum records,nor did he conduct the requested teleconference.although kaplan acknowledged that van bussum had opined that smith was disabled,he did not discuss van bussum opinion any further in his peer review letter to ccc.the extent of kaplan review of van bussum treatment of smith is simply not known because of the discrepancy in the medical records.because kaplan peer review provides the basis of ccc ultimate denial,it can not be said with certainty that smith had the full and fair review she was entitled to under the plan.
ccc argues that the assumption that the opinions of a treating physician warrant greater credit than the opinions of plan consultants may make scant sense when,for example,a specialist engaged by the plan has e
