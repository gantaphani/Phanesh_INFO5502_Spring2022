we must decide,among other questions,whether a hospital violates the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala if it fails to diagnose the cause of a patient emergency condition,but treats the symptoms identified,and concludes that the patient has been stabilized.
this appeal arises out of robert jackson jackson visits to the redbud community hospital redbud emergency room on april,and,in clearlake,california.redbud entered into an association agreement regarding the affiliation of redbud health care district with adventist health the association agreement which became effective on july.this agreement stated that the parties anticipated a future affiliation,and that adventist health adventist would provide redbud with administrative and financial services.on july,adventist and redbud entered into an agreement for purchase and sale of assets the purchase agreement.adventist currently operates redbud.
on april,jackson visited the lake county mental health department lake county to see a psychiatrist.jackson previously had been diagnosed with psychotic disorder,borderline intellectual functioning,and pedophilia.the lake county staff instructed jackson to go to the redbud emergency room to receive a medical clearance before returning to lake county.at redbud,a nurse took jackson medical history,vital signs,current medications and drug allergies.half an hour later,wolfgang schug,a redbud emergency room doctor,examined jackson and ordered blood tests.schug noted that jackson was reporting hallucination,dizziness,and unsteadiness,and that he was taking anafranil and ativan schug then diagnosed jackson as suffering from acute psychosis neither he,nor any other redbud physician or employee,diagnosed jackson as suffering from an emergency medical as opposed to a psychological or psychiatric condition.
redbud did not offer psychiatric care to its patients,and the unwritten policy of the redbud emergency room was that when a patient presented to the emergency room with psychiatric complaints,the patient would be examined to determine if there were any medical components to his problem.if a medical problem was found,it would take precedence over the psychiatric complaints.if no medical problem was found,the patient would be referred to a psychiatrist or to a mental health facility for an appropriate psychiatric.schug arranged for lake county which provides psychiatric care to see jackson upon his release,where he was evaluated by dennis skinner,a lake county employee.
on april,jackson returned to the redbud emergency room.a triage nurse took jackson medical history,vital signs,and current medications.an hour later,miguel ollada,a redbud emergency room doctor,took a separate medical history and evaluated jackson,who complained of a sore throat,chest pain while breathing,and dry heaves.ollada also observed jackson talking to himself.ollada performed a complete physical exam,and ordered a battery of tests including an electrocardiogram,a urine screening,and a blood gas test.the urine analysis indicated the presence of a tricyclic antidepressant,such as the anafranil jackson was known to be taking.ollada diagnosed jackson as having chest contusions,hypertension,and psychosis,but not drug toxicity.ollada gave jackson medications,and ordered a mental health consultation,to be conducted at lake county.lake county refused to evaluate jackson,however,because he had been recently seen by its staff,who found him to be.believing jackson to be,and his condition to have stabilized,ollada released jackson from redbud,and he instructed jackson to return to lake county the next morning.
at on april,jackson returned to the redbud emergency room after his wife found him wandering in the road in the middle of the night.a nurse performed an initial medical evaluation,and ollada performed another examination at ollada observed that jackson was very agitated,but he also observed that jackson had a regular heartbeat,and that he presented no other physical symptoms.barbara jackson told ollada that she believed that her husband was suicidal,because she found him in the middle of the road,waving his hands.ollada determined that jackson was suffering from a psychological disorder which caused his agitation,but that he was not suffering from any physical disorders.ollada prescribed and administered haldol and benadryl in an effort to sedate jackson and to stabilize his condition ollada ordered that lake county be contacted regarding jackson condition.
later in the morning of april,susan smith,a lake county crisis worker,evaluated jackson.smith found that jackson condition met the criteria for involuntary psychiatric commitment,and she concluded that he suffered from a psychological disorder,anxiety,and a dependent personality.smith then asked ollada to clear jackson for a transfer to east bay hospital east bay,which functioned almost exclusively as a psychiatric hospital.ollada found that jackson condition had stabilized he was no longer agitated,and was sleeping,that he was not suffering from a condition,and that a transfer to east bay hospital did not pose a risk to jackson condition.
at,redbud transferred jackson to east bay,where he was seen by spencer steele,a psychiatrist who performed a psychiatric,but not a physical,examination of jackson.at the time of the transfer,ollada believed that jackson condition had been stabilized.steele prescribed more haldol for jackson.shortly before,the east bay medical staff concluded that jackson was so unable to control his own movements that he posed a danger to himself and others.at,jackson went into cardiac arrest.east bay staff began to perform cpr,and they ordered an ambulance to transfer jackson to brookside hospital brookside.jackson arrived at brookside emergency room at approximately jackson received emergency care at brookside,but he was pronounced dead at.an autopsy determined that jackson died from sudden cardiac arrhythmia,caused by acute psychotic delirium,which was in turn caused by clomipramine anafranil toxicity.none of the doctors or nurses who saw jackson at redbud diagnosed him as suffering from anafranil or other drug toxicity.
barbara jackson and sandra jackson,jackson wife and daughter jackson survivors or the survivors filed suit against the physicians who treated jackson,east bay hospital,redbud,and adventist in the northern district of california.their complaint asserted claims under emtala,california health and safety code,and california state tort law.
in a may,order,the district court granted summary judgment to redbud and adventist on jackson survivors emtala and claims.the district court also held,as a matter of law,that the agreement between redbud and adventist did not make adventist liable to jackson as redbud joint tortfeasor or joint venturer.in an october,order,the district court declined to retain supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.the district court dismissed those claims pursuant to c,and it tolled the statute of limitations for these claims to permit jackson survivors to file a new action in state court.they in state court,where their case is still pending the district court entered judgment dismissing jackson survivors complaint in its entirety,and they filed this timely appeal.
congress enacted emtala,commonly known as the patient act,in response to the growing concern about the provision of adequate medical services to individuals,particularly the indigent and the uninsured,who seek care from hospital emergency rooms.congress was concerned that hospitals were dumping patients who were unable to pay for care,either by refusing to provide emergency treatment to these patients,or by transferring the patients to other hospitals before the patients conditions stabilized.see,part i,at,reprinted in cong.admin.news,the committee is greatly concerned about the increasing number of reports that hospital emergency rooms are refusing to treat patients with emergency conditions if the patient does not have medical insurance.
emtala imposes a series of obligations on a hospital emergency department.first,the hospital must provide an appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital emergency department.a.this examination must determine whether or not an emergency medical condition exists.id.an emergency medical condition is one manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity including severe pain such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in i the placing of the health of the individual in serious jeopardy,ii serious impairment to bodily functions,or iii serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part b a.if the hospital detects an emergency medical condition,the hospital must provide either a within the staff and facilities available at the hospital,for such medical examination and such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition,or b for the transfer of the individual to another medical facility b.if an individual at a hospital has an emergency medical condition which has not been stabilized the hospital may not transfer the individual unless a physician has signed a certification that based upon the information available at the time of transfer,the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment at another medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual c.as the text of the statute clearly states,the hospital duty to stabilize the patient does not arise until the hospital first detects an emergency medical condition.eberhardt city of los angeles,cir.similarly,the transfer restrictions apply only when an individual comes to the emergency room,and after an appropriate medical screening examination,the hospital determines that the individual has an emergency medical condition.james sunrise,cir.
jackson survivors argue that redbud violated emtala screening requirements by providing medically inadequate screening examinations and by failing to order additional tests on april,when,they allege,it was obvious that jackson was suffering from a physical disorder,and not a psychological one the survivors also argue that the examinations performed by redbud doctors and nurses were so wanting as to be inappropriate medical screening examinations.acknowledging the weight of authority supporting the district court conclusion that an examination does not have to be medically adequate to satisfy emtala requirements,they ask us to overrule those precedents.in addition,they argue,without evidentiary support,that there is a material possibility that the doctors acted in bad faith because their diagnoses were inherently implausible.we reject all of these arguments,and hold that redbud satisfied its emtala screening obligations.
the statutory language of the emtala clearly declines to impose on hospitals a national standard of care in screening patients.eberhardt,at.instead,the touchstone is whether,as dictates,the procedure is designed to identify an emergency medical condition,that is manifested by acute and severe symptoms.id.seven of our sister circuits have held that to comply with this requirement,a hospital only must provide a screening examination that is comparable to that offered to other patients with similar symptoms.see correa hosp.san francisco,cir f aulty screening,in a particular case,as opposed to disparate screening or refusing to screen at all,does not contravene the statute.baber hosp.of,cir w hile emtala requires a hospital emergency department to apply its standard screening examination uniformly,it does not guarantee that the emergency personnel will correctly diagnose a patient condition as a result of this screening.marshall carroll parish hosp,cir a treating physician failure to appreciate the extent of the patient injury or illness may constitute negligence or malpractice,but can not support an emtala claim for inappropriate screening it is the plaintiff burden to show that the hospital treated her differently from other patients cleland bronson health care group,cir if the hospital acts in the same manner as it would have for the usual paying patient,then the screening provided is appropriate within the meaning of the statute.summers baptist med.ctr.arkadelphia,cir en banc w e hold that instances of dumping or improper screening of patients for a discriminatory reason,or failure to screen at all,or screening a patient differently from other patients perceived to have the same condition,all are actionable under emtala.but instances of negligence in the screening or diagnostic process,or of mere faulty screening,are not.holcomb monahan,cir as long as a hospital applies the same screening procedures to indigent patients which it applies to paying patients,the hospital does not violate this section of the act.gatewood.healthcare,a hospital fulfills the appropriate medical screening requirement when it conforms in its treatment of a particular patient to its standard screening procedures.
in eberhardt,we did not explicitly adopt this comparative test as the standard for compliance with a,but we did cite baber,cleland,and gatewood,and we noted that the appellants in that case did not allege that the challenged screening differed from the examination provided to comparable patients.at.we now adopt this comparative test.we hold that a hospital satisfies emtala appropriate medical screening requirement if it provides a patient with an examination comparable to the one offered to other patients presenting similar symptoms,unless the examination is so cursory that it is not designed to identify acute and severe symptoms that alert the physician of the need for immediate medical attention to prevent serious bodily injury.eberhardt,at.this standard is consistent with congress purpose in enacting emtala,which was to limit the ability of hospitals to avoid treating poor or uninsured patients.see at.
the district court concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact that jackson received initial screening examinations which satisfied redbud emtala obligations.the court noted that the redbud doctors and nurses performed these screenings according to redbud guidelines,and that jackson was triaged by a nurse and examined by a doctor during each of his visits to the redbud emergency room.during these visits,the physicians performed several physical examinations and ordered multiple laboratory tests.the district court also concluded that jackson survivors failed to create a genuine issue of material fact that these examinations were so substandard or of such low quality as to violate emtala,and that the jackson survivors expert witnesses established nothing more than a failure to properly diagnose jackson symptoms,an error which might result in state tort liability,but not in emtala liability.the district court also rejected as groundless the argument that jackson was treated differently from other patients because he exhibited psychiatric,and not just physical,symptoms.it also rejected the argument that the redbud physicians departed from their own procedures when they consulted with a lake county crisis worker.
the district court properly concluded that redbud complied with emtala screening requirements.jackson survivors own expert witnesses testified that they had no reasons to believe that jackson was treated differently than other patients presenting similar symptoms to the redbud emergency department.nor did the survivors present evidence to support the conclusion that the screening examinations were so lacking as to support a conclusion that the examinations were not designed to identify acute and severe symptoms.
jackson survivors also argue that redbud failed to stabilize jackson emergency medical condition prior to his transfer to east bay,in violation of b.as we have previously explained,a hospital duty to stabilize the patient does not arise until the hospital first detects an emergency medical condition.eberhardt,at.in eberhardt,the plaintiff claimed that the hospital violated emtala stabilization requirements by failing to treat his son suicidal tendency,and that this failure led to his son death.we rejected this argument,and held that the hospital had no obligation to stabilize the son suicidal tendency,because the hospital never detected it.id.this actual detection rule comports with the law of five other circuits,which requires a showing of actual knowledge of the emergency medical condition by the hospital as a condition precedent to the stabilization requirement.see summers,at cir.u nder the express wording of the statute,this portion of emtala applies only if the hospital determines that the individual has an emergency medical condition here,the hospital believed the patient was suffering from muscle spasms,not an emergency medical condition.the duty to stabilize therefore never arose.citing vickers nash,cir urban king,cir cleland,at cir.gatewood,at.here,no such emergency condition was diagnosed,and the statute stabilization and transfer requirements are therefore inapplicable.this standard also applies to emtala claims brought in california state courts.see barris county of los angeles,cal th,d,t he elements of a civil claim for failure to stabilize include the following the hospital had actual knowledge that a patient was suffering from an emergency medical condition.
the district court rejected the contention that redbud failed to stabilize jackson condition.instead,it found that the expert witnesses agreed that redbud stabilized the only emergency condition its doctors detected agitation which posed a risk of jackson injuring himself.the district court noted that these experts concluded that jackson physical symptoms,which consisted of altered vital signs,increased respiratory rate,hypertension,and chest contusions,did not,by themselves,constitute a medical emergency.the district court also rejected the argument that redbud had an obligation to stabilize jackson anafranil toxicity,concluding that redbud did not have to stabilize this condition,which was not diagnosed as the cause of jackson symptoms.
the parties agree that ollada believed that he had stabilized jackson condition at the time of his transfer to east bay,and that he believed that jackson was no longer agitated at that time.the parties disagreement concerns medical conditions which remained undetected by the redbud medical staff.redbud failure to diagnose the true cause of jackson symptoms can not serve as the basis for a violation of emtala stabilization requirements.eberhardt,at.the district court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact that redbud stabilized the only emergency condition it detected,and the court correctly held that redbud did not violate emtala stabilization requirements.
the survivors also contend that redbud violated emtala certification requirements because ollada did not sign a certification that based upon the information available at the time of transfer,the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment outweigh the risks to the individual.c a ii.such a certification shall include a summary of the risks and benefits upon which the certification is based.c.the survivors argue that the certification form signed by ollada was deficient because the form did not contain specific written descriptions of each of those risks and benefits.we conclude,however,that emtala certification requirement does not apply in the circumstances of this case.the certification provision applies only when a hospital has detected an emergency medical condition and thereafter elects to transfer the patient,rather than to stabilize the condition.see b,c.the obvious purpose of this provision is to require the treating physician to certify that the expected benefit from the transfer outweighs the risk of transfer when a detected emergency medical condition has not been stabilized.in this case,as we have noted above,redbud stabilized the only emergency medical condition that it detected.as far as redbud knew,jackson did not have a detected but unstabilized emergency medical condition.the certification requirement does not apply under the facts of this case.
california heath and safety code is california version of.brooker desert hospital,cir.it imposes on california hospitals an obligation to tend to all patients requesting emergency care 
emergency services and care shall be provided to any person requesting the services or care,or for whom services or care is requested,for any condition in which the person is in danger of loss of life,or serious injury or illness,at any health facility licensed under this chapter that maintains and operates an emergency department to provide emergency services to the public when the facility has appropriate facilities and qualified personnel available to provide the services or care.
cal.health safety code a west.the statute defines emergency services and care as medical screening,examination,and evaluation by a physician to determine if an emergency medical condition or active labor exists and,if it does,the care,treatment,and surgery by a physician necessary to relieve or eliminate the emergency medical condition,within the capability of the facility.cal.health safety code a.
section also provides a safe harbor for hospitals and doctors who refuse to render care,provided that their refusal is based on a determination that the person is not suffering from an emergency condition or that they can not treat the emergency condition afflicting the patient 
neither the health facility,its employees,nor any physician and surgeon shall be liable in any action arising out of a refusal to render emergency services or care if the refusal is based on the determination,exercising reasonable care,that the person is not suffering from an emergency condition,or that the health facility does not have the appropriate facilities or qualified personnel available to render those services.
cal.health safety code c.
the district court granted redbud summary judgment on the claim for the same reasons it granted it summary judgment on the emtala claim.the district court found that the redbud doctors provided medical screenings,examinations,and evaluations designed to determine whether jackson had an emergency condition,and the court found that redbud provided the care and treatment required to eliminate the emergency condition ollada identified jackson agitation.the district court also noted that a precludes liability for the failure to provide a particular service if the hospital does not have the appropriate facilities and personnel to provide that service.the district court concluded that this provision made redbud not liable for its transfer of jackson to east bay,because the redbud physicians determined that jackson had a psychological condition,which redbud was not staffed or equipped to treat.
the survivors argue that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment to redbud on their claim,because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to the reasonableness of redbud care.they contend that the provision in c precluding liability if a refusal to render emergency services or care is based on the determination,using reasonable care,that the person is not suffering from an emergency condition establishes a reasonable care standard for liability under a.they further argue that the opinions provided by their medical experts constitute material evidence supporting the conclusion that redbud doctors did not act reasonably when they determined that jackson was suffering from a psychological,and not a physical,condition.
we have considered only once,and the california supreme court has never addressed a claim in brooker we referred to the exercise of reasonable care,but that case involved a hospital decision not to perform a procedure.therefore,brooker implicated c,and its reasonable care standard.brooker was admitted to the desert hospital emergency room,complaining of chest pains.the physician who treated her determined that the best course of action was immediate bypass surgery,but the hospital cardiac surgeon was unavailable to perform the surgery due to a prior teaching commitment.the physician performed an angioplasty to keep brooker aorta clear,and then recommended that she consent to a transfer to another hospital,where a cardiac surgeon would be able to perform the bypass.brooker con
