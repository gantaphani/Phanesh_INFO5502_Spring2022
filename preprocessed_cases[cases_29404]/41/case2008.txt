nna alpha onuoha appeals the district court order authorizing the bureau of prisons bop to forcibly medicate him to restore his competency to stand trial.onuoha was charged under e and a for allegedly making phone calls to authorities at the los angeles international airport lax instructing them to evacuate the airport.he was found unfit to stand trial,and the district court ordered him to be forcibly medicated pursuant to sell united states,d.we have jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals of sell orders under the collateral order doctrine.sell,at.we hold that the district court clearly erred in finding that the proposed course of treatment was in onuoha best medical interests.we vacate the order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
onuoha served in the national guard from to,including a stint with a peacekeeping force in kosovo.after returning from kosovo,onuoha worked as a transportation security administration tsa screener at lax from to september.except for the charges in this case,he has no criminal history.
in the summer of,onuoha was suspended from his job with tsa for comments made to a female passenger.on september,onuoha went to lax on his day off and passed through security screening at several terminals.he then went to tsa headquarters at lax and resigned from his job.hours later,he returned to tsa headquarters and left an envelope for a former supervisor involved with his suspension.the government alleges that onuoha then called a tsa checkpoint and said that lax should be evacuated.during the phone call,onuoha mentioned the package he left for his former supervisor,indicated that it should be read immediately,and said that he would be watching to see if lax was evacuated.onuoha then called the lax police department and his tsa supervisor,telling them to evacuate the airport because he was going to deliver a message to america and the world.the recipients of these calls believed that onuoha was threatening to set off bombs or open fire at the airport.the envelope onuoha left for his supervisor was discovered to contain religious writings,and did not include any explosives.authorities decided not to evacuate the airport,but they did evacuate tsa headquarters.
law enforcement officials went to onuoha apartment to apprehend him.they found that he had cleared out all of his belongings and left only a large note reading there will be fire fear fear fear this message led police to believe that onuoha was an active shooter seeking to evacuate the airport so that he could target and kill people as they fled.information about onuoha military background and potential access to firearms fed these concerns.it was later discovered that onuoha had posted to his personal website an open letter to lax passengers with religious comments.this letter stated that the news media have probably come to the conclusion that i a terrorist,but also stated i did not call for any threat.
later that same day,onuoha called lax police to say that he heard law enforcement was looking for him.he told police he was at a church in riverside,california,and described the car he was driving.he also told police that he did not intend to make a bomb threat,only to deliver a message.onuoha waited at the church until law enforcement arrived and arrested him.when he was interviewed by police,he reiterated that he did not intend to make a threat,stating that k illing was not on my mind.
on september,the day after onuoha was arrested,the government filed a complaint against onuoha and requested detention.onuoha was later indicted on three counts in violation of a false information and hoaxes and three counts in violation of e making telephonic threats.at the detention hearing,the government moved for a competency evaluation,which onuoha defense counsel opposed.the motion was denied,and defense counsel indicated that onuoha intended to proceed to trial.in february,the defense gave notice that it would raise a defense and submitted a report that onuoha suffered from paranoid schizophrenia.the government again filed a motion for a competency evaluation,which this time was granted by the district court.
the evaluation was performed by bureau of prisons bop medical personnel.the evaluation revealed that onuoha believed that he received revelations from god and had a message to preach,and that these beliefs rose to the level of delusions.the evaluation concluded that onuoha was not competent to stand trial.the district court found onuoha incompetent to stand trial and committed him to bop custody to determine whether he could be restored to competency.
bop psychologist angela alden weaver and bop psychiatrist robert lucking evaluated onuoha for several months.they submitted their evaluation to the district court in november.they agreed with the finding that onuoha was incompetent to stand trial and diagnosed him with schizophrenia.they also found that onuoha was not a danger to himself or others.they further determined that medication would likely restore onuoha to competency,and recommended a course of haldol haloperidol decanoate,including specific dosages and a timetable.the recommended treatment included an initial test dose of milligrams of haldol,followed by hours of observation for adverse side effects.the treatment plan then recommended three milligram doses of haldol at intervals to obtain a therapeutic blood level.after gaining this blood level,the treatment plan recommended to milligrams of haldol every four weeks.lucking predicted that this treatment would take around four months to restore onuoha to competency.
the government filed a motion for an order to involuntarily medicate onuoha with the goal of restoring him to competency,relying on sell united states,d.onuoha attorneys opposed the motion.the district court held several hearings that included taking testimony from government witnesses lucking and bryan herbel,a second bop psychiatrist.after the hearings,the district court granted the government motion and ordered onuoha to be involuntarily medicated in accordance with lucking recommendations as articulated in his and weaver evaluation.onuoha filed a timely interlocutory appeal,and the district court stayed its order pending our decision.
in sell united states,the supreme court recognized that the government may involuntarily medicate a defendant charged with a serious crime to restore that defendant to competency to stand trial.at.the supreme court held that a court may not grant a sell motion unless the government proves four factors 
that important governmental interests are at stake in prosecuting the defendant for the charged offense that involuntary medication will significantly further those concomitant state interests,it is substantially likely to restore the defendant to competency and substantially unlikely to cause side effects that would impair significantly his ability to assist in his defense at trial that involuntary medication is necessary to further those interests,there are no less intrusive treatments that are likely to achieve substantially the same results and that administration of the drugs is medically appropriate,in the patient best medical interest in light of his medical condition.
united states ruiz gaxiola,cir quoting sell,at emphasis in sell.each of these factors must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.id.at.orders based on sell authorizing involuntary medication are disfavored.united states rivera guerrero,cir.
the district court found that all four sell factors were satisfied.on this appeal onuoha challenges only the district court conclusions on the first and fourth factors,and so we limit our discussion,first,to whether important government interests are at stake in prosecuting onuoha and,second,to whether administration of the prescribed drugs is medically appropriate,in the patient best medical interests in light of his medical condition.we conclude that the first factor is met but that the fourth factor is not there is an important governmental interest in prosecuting onuoha,but the proposed treatment is not in his best medical interests.
under sell we first address whether important governmental interests support prosecuting onuoha.we review this factor de novo.ruiz gaxiola,at.the sell court recognized that t he government interest in bringing to trial an individual accused of a serious crime is important,but it also noted that s pecial circumstances may lessen the importance of that interest.sell,at.the court mentioned several examples of special circumstances that diminish the government interest in prosecution,including the potential for civil commitment,the length of time needed to restore a defendant to competency,the effect of the potential delay on the government interest in timely prosecution,the length of time the defendant has already been confined,and constitutional requirements of a fair trial.id.
our analysis of the first sell factor proceeds as a inquiry.in our first step,we consider whether the alleged crime is sufficiently serious to establish an important governmental interest.see united states gillenwater,cir ruiz gaxiola,at.if an important governmental interest is established,we evaluate in the second step of this analysis whether any special circumstances lessen that interest.gillenwater,at ruiz gaxiola,at.this second step requires measuring any mitigating circumstances against the established government interest.see,united states brooks,cir explaining that courts must consider whether a potential sentence is outweighed by the likelihood of civil commitment and the length of time a defendant has already served.
onuoha argues that the district court erroneously treated the first sell factor as a test.we agree that a totality test is inappropriate in the context of the first sell factor.a relatively weak governmental interest could not properly prevail in scenarios without mitigating circumstances,because the sell court held that important governmental interests must be implicated to justify forcible medication.sell,at emphasis in the original.our approach helps to ensure that the interests at stake are important.if the government can not demonstrate at the outset that its interest in prosecution meets a significant threshold,the inquiry ends there.
we next address the facts here.we must consider whether onuoha charged crimes are sufficiently serious to indicate an important governmental interest.we have previously held that the sentencing guidelines range is the appropriate starting point because it is the best available predictor of the length of a defendant incarceration.united states hernandez vasquez,cir.both parties agree that the sentencing guidelines range for onuoha alleged crimes is to months.this range is lower than any range we have previously held to be indicative of a serious crime under the first sell factor.see,gillenwater,at range of to months ruiz gaxiola,at range of to months hernandez vasquez,at range of to months.
but the guidelines range is only the starting point in determining whether the government has an important interest in prosecution.brooks,at.in sell,the supreme court stated that courts also must consider the facts of the individual case in evaluating the government interest in prosecution.at.although our analysis begins with the guidelines range,it is not the only factor that should be considered because it does not reflect the full universe of relevant circumstances.hernandez vasquez,at.
in addition to the guidelines range,we have previously considered the specific facts of the alleged crime as well as the defendant criminal history.in gillenwater,for example,we determined that the defendant threats to choke,rape,and kill government officials and employees was sufficiently serious criminal conduct to satisfy the first sell factor despite the low guidelines range of to months.at.and in both ruiz gaxiola and hernandez vasquez,we considered the defendants extensive criminal history in concluding that the crimes at issue were sufficiently serious.ruiz gaxiola,at hernandez vasquez,at.
onuoha has no criminal history and his guidelines range is low.but even so,when we look at the substance of onuoha conduct,the stress he placed upon the airport security systems,and the nature of the crimes charged,we conclude that onuoha criminal conduct is without doubt sufficiently serious to support a strong governmental interest.it is not just that he is the subject of prosecution as the fourth circuit notes,this is a truism applicable to any case where the government seeks forcible medication without a prosecution,there would be no case.united states white,cir emphasis in the original.rather,onuoha alleged conduct threatened the basic human need for security to such an extent that it weighs heavily in favor of an interest in prosecution.sell,at.onuoha is accused of making phone calls to lax officials on the eve of the anniversary of the september attacks,urging evacuation of the airport.these phone calls were reasonably perceived as terrorism threats,and they considerably disrupted airport activities and diverted law enforcement resources.the government did not merely have an interest in incarcerating onuoha for a time for this conduct.it had an interest in gaining a trial conviction to show others that such conduct will result predictably in conviction and a serious penalty of incarceration.
onuoha argues that his alleged criminal conduct is not sufficiently serious because his statements were cryptic and not specifically violent in nature.he has also continually maintained that he did not intend to threaten anyone,only to deliver a message.we conclude that these arguments are unavailing.onuoha knew or reasonably should have known that the recipients of his phone calls would assume he was threatening terrorism.terrorism,whether real or perceived,threatens our need for security.we agree with the district court assessment that t hreats of terrorism,whether genuine or fraudulent,are of grave severity,particularly when they involve a highly populated public venue such as an airport.
the district court also considered onuoha potential for future violence as strengthening the need for prosecution.this consideration was wholly unnecessary to justify involuntary medication for the purpose of permitting trial and conviction.and reliance on onuoha dangerousness was potentially an error.whether a defendant should be involuntarily medicated because they pose a danger to themselves or others is governed by a separate test,articulated in washington harper,d.courts should remain mindful of the supreme court distinction between the purposes and requirements of involuntary medication to restore competency and involuntary medication to reduce dangerousness.it should take care to separate the sell inquiry from the harper dangerousness inquiry and not allow the inquiries to collapse into each other.hernandez vasquez,at.additionally,the record contains no firm evidence that onuoha is an actual danger to himself or others,or that he will become a danger in the future.lucking and weaver specifically noted in their evaluation that onuoha did not pose a threat to himself or others and would not qualify for involuntary medication under the harper analysis.
because the alleged crime is sufficiently serious to support a governmental interest in prosecution,we proceed to the second step of the first sell factor and consider any s pecial circumstances that may lessen the importance of that interest.sell,at.onuoha argues that the time he has already spent in custody constitutes a special circumstance and diminishes the government interest in incapacitating him.sell suggests that length of time a defendant has already spent in confinement is a mitigating factor,although it does not totally undermine the need for prosecution.id.onuoha has been incarcerated since september and has already served more time than the minimum guidelines range of months.possibly,if onuoha is ultimately restored to competency and convicted,he may conceivably be sentenced to time served.however,a sentence might also include a period of supervised release,which would help ensure that onuoha does not return to making threats when released into the public.gillenwater,at.additionally,there is an important distinction between incarceration it
