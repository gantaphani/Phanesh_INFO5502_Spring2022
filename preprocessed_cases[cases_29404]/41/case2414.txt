jeffrey benton,on behalf of his deceased wife lynn benton benton,appeals the district court affirmance of the commissioner denial of her claim for social security disability insurance benefits.an administrative law judge alj found that benton was not mentally disabled.in doing so,he refused to credit the opinion of benton psychiatrist as her treating physician.the alj instead relied upon the opinion of a psychiatrist who examined benton once at the behest of the state of california.according to a testifying vocational expert,the absence or presence of mental disability was the difference,between benton being able to perform her past relevant work or not.because we conclude that the alj misapplied,the regulation that addresses the definition of treating source,we reverse the district court,vacate the ruling of the commissioner and remand.
background 
procedural timeline 
benton pursued her claim for disability through the administrative process,appealing the denial to the district court on december.benton died from the effects of a nasopharyngeal carcinoma on july,this condition was unrelated to her disability claims.her husband has continued to pursue her appeal on her behalf,timely appealing denial of her claim.
benton was born on july.she obtained a high school education.she injured her leg while performing high school gymnastics in.as a result,she required psychological treatment and underwent the first of seven knee surgeries the others were performed annually from to and again in.subsequent to her accident she worked as a waitress,a receptionist,a telephone customer service representative,and an administrative assistant in a hotel.
vocational history and level of functioning at daily activities 
benton stopped work on august,due to arthrosis in her left knee and pain in her back,hips,and feet.in the disability report she filed when she applied for benefits,she reported being unable to sit,stand,or walk for extended periods.she used a cane to walk the claims representative noted her grimacing and needing to stand up occasionally.a later disability report indicated increasing difficulty entering and leaving the bathtub and shower,fixing her hair,writing,and engaging in handcrafts.in a daily activities questionnaire and later testimony at a hearing,she reported depression and sleep deprivation due to chronic pain,and decrements in memory and concentration.she shopped using a mobility cart or a wheelchair pushed by her husband.benton did do light housework during this period she cooked one meal three to five days of the week,washed dishes,made the bed,dusted,and did laundry with her husband help.but she found this work laborious she reported having to sit down for ten minutes after three to five minutes of washing dishes.
regarding her ability to work,benton reported that if she sat for more than minutes,she would have spasms and her left foot would go numb.after ten to twenty minutes of sitting in an office chair,she would have to get up and move for five to ten minutes before sitting down.she could only stand in one place for three to five minutes,and could walk only about a half block with her cane.she had to elevate her left knee for relief,could not carry more than eight pounds,and lost her balance easily.
benton was a patient of kaiser,a nonprofit,health maintenance organization hmo.benton was referred to orthopedic surgeon donald fithian in may.he recommended delaying a total knee replacement for ten years,given her young age,in the hope that the combination of cortisone injections and abstaining from work would prove satisfactory until then.but the injections did not prove efficacious for long,and benton showed progressive degenerative arthritis.she began feeling pain in her left shoulder,low back and hip,which fithian hypothesized was due to her limp.on july,fithian opined that she was permanently disabled due to pain in her lower left extremity.her seventh surgery led to initial improvement in her knee pain,but not her hip.after she experienced a fall in april,the pain management therapy became less effective,affecting her mood.at this time,fithian recommended a knee replacement.
other doctors employed by the state of california health and welfare agency and the social security administration acknowledged the impairment of her knee and restrictions that it imposed but disagreed that it was disabling.
in november,benton saw zwiefach,a psychiatrist with kaiser,who diagnosed chronic pain and dysthemia.in treating her,he prescribed first elavil and then paxil,increasing the dose when she reported no effect.zwiefach continued managing her psychiatric medications and consulted regularly with her treating therapists.when asked to evaluate benton for mental disorders,he observed that she had difficulty with concentration and reported psychomotor retardation,feelings of guilt and worthlessness.he diagnosed her with major depression,an unspecified personality disorder,and chronic pain.he assigned her a global assessment of functioning rating of,representing moderate symptoms or moderate difficulty in,inter alia,occupational functioning.
at the request of the state agency,benton was examined in september by engelhorn,a psychiatrist who noted functional disability due to her chronic left knee pain.he noted onset of depression in late.he reported that benton was fully capable of taking care of her basic personal needs and was involved in a full variety of light household chores.he found no cognitive impairment or evidence of significant depression or anxiety.he diagnosed perhaps a mild adjustment type of reaction with low levels of depression perhaps beginning at the end of,which appears to be an adjustment type of depression relating to her physical disabilities and great pain that totally relates to problems pertaining to her left knee.state agency psychiatrist skopec reviewed the medical records and opined that benton had no severe mental impairment.
in january,zwiefach completed a mental residual functional capacity assessment mental rfc assessment on benton,finding marked limitations in of categories.he assigned her a prognosis of very poor.
benton hearing before the alj 
at her hearing before the alj,benton testified that fithian was her orthopedist and zwiefach was the psychiatrist overseeing her case,although she had met with him only once.she testified that her right hip,left knee,and both feet bothered her most,and that she could sit comfortably for minutes,stand for minutes,and walk block.she normally used a cane and still did light housekeeping,cooking,and crafts other than quilting.
the alj applied the sequential process presented in a f that is used to determine whether a claimant is disabled under the social security act.this process is presented in full elsewhere,tackett apfel.we summarize it as follows if a claimant can not meet the burden of showing she is currently not working,at step one,the process ends if she establishes that she meets the severely impaired criteria,at step two,she is disabled and entitled to benefits.however,when she has not met the step two criteria,if she can show at step three that her impairment satisfies certain specific criteria listed in the regulations,she is disabled.if she can show at step four that she is unable to perform work she has done in the past,she is entitled to a step five review.at step five,the government has the burden of showing that she can do other work available in significant numbers in the national economy if it does not meet this burden,the claimant is deemed disabled.
the alj found that benton met step one she had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since august,and that although she had severe left knee degenerative joint disease and arthritis,chronic pain,and an affective disorder,she did not meet step two.a vocational expert testified that a hypothetical person with benton physical residual function capacity could perform her past work as a receptionist,but could not sustain any competitive employment based upon either the mental assessment of zwiefach or benton testimony at the hearing as to her physical condition.the alj did not credit zwiefach opinion as a treating doctor,and found benton claims of disabling pain and limitations not credible.he found that benton was able to perform sedentary work,and denied her benefits at step four of the sequential evaluation process,finding that she could return to her past relevant work as a receptionist.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to review the final decision of the commissioner of social security pursuant to g.we have jurisdiction to review the district court final decision under.
standard of review 
the district court decision affirming the alj is reviewed de novo.the commissioner denial of disability benefits may be set aside only when the alj findings are based on legal error or not supported by substantial evidence in the record.if the evidence can support either outcome,the commissioner decision must be upheld.flaten sec y of health human,cir.
issues regarding zwiefach 
benton disputes the alj rejection of zwiefach mental rfc assessment.
does zwiefach qualify as benton treating physician 
the alj found that there is no evidence that zwiefach qualifies as benton treating physician.the applicable regulation,defines a treating source as follows 
treating source means your own physician,psychologist,or other acceptable medical source who provides you,or has provided you,with medical treatment or evaluation and who has,or has had,an ongoing treatment relationship with you.generally,we will consider that you have an ongoing treatment relationship with an acceptable medical source when the medical evidence establishes that you see,or have seen,the source with a frequency consistent with accepted medical practice for the type of treatment evaluation required for your medical condition s.we may consider an acceptable medical source who has treated or evaluated you only a few times or only after long intervals,twice a year to be your treating source if the nature and frequency of the treatment or evaluation is typical for your condition s.we will not consider an acceptable medical source to be your treating source if your relationship with the source is not based on your medical need for treatment or evaluation,but solely on your need to obtain a report in support of your claim for disability.in such a case,we will consider the acceptable medical source to be a nontreating source.
the wording of the definition of treating source has remained constant since the provision of medical treatment,particularly for psychological dysfunction and particularly within hmos,has not.hmos achieve cost savings in part by shifting the provision of services to less costly providers,psychologists and counselors who provide services under the supervision of a psychiatrist.this is notably true in the domain of psychological dysfunction because,while provision of drugs such as the benton took has increased substantially,in california only physicians have prescription privileges.a psychiatrist may therefore manage the provision of psychiatric medication,receiving reports from the medical sources providing treatment,without seeing the patient with any regularity.this was precisely zwiefach role in benton treatment.
section neither explicitly forbids nor requires crediting a physician treating status whose patient contact is thus limited.its language suggests that a few times or contact as little as twice a year would suffice,but it does not state that this frequency of patient contact represents a floor.rather,the standard it applies is that the claimant must have seen the source with a frequency consistent with accepted medical practice for the type of treatment evaluation required for your medical condition s.
the opinions of treating physicians are given greater weight than those of examining but physicians or physicians who only review the record 
as a general rule,more weight should be given to the opinion of a treating source than to the opinion of doctors who do not treat the claimant.at least where the treating doctor opinion is not contradicted by another doctor,it may be rejected only for clear and convincing reasons.we have also held that clear and convincing reasons are required to reject the treating doctor ultimate conclusions.even if the treating doctor opinion is contradicted by another doctor,the commissioner may not reject this opinion without providing specific and legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record for so doing.
lester chater,cir citations omitted.
the commissioner argues that the rationale for according greater weight to a treating doctor opinion depends on the existence of an ongoing treating relationship,which affords a greater opportunity to know and observe the patient,and that that opportunity was not present here.see smolen chater,cir.benton argues that zwiefach reported her symptoms as the leader of a treatment team that had an extensive ongoing treating relationship with her.
obviously,one or more other members of that treatment team other than zwiefach had sufficient contact with benton to qualify unequivocally as a treating source.zwiefach completed the mental assessment of benton based on his assessment of information provided by those on the treatment team with more direct patient contact the qualifications of those providing direct treatment,and the quality of their communications with zwiefach,were either already present in the record or readily ascertainable by the alj.the question,then,is whether precludes the supervising physician from being considered a treating source in such circumstances.
this is an issue of first impression for our court.outside of our circuit the meaning of treating source in has been construed at the federal appellate level in only one published opinion.an alj found that a nurse practitioner,flaherty,who filled out an rfc assessment was not to be given treating source weight 
first,it appears that the form was completed after flaherty had seen the claimant only one time.second,flaherty is not an acceptable medical source as defined in,a d.finally,the degree of impairment indicated on the form is not supported by the treatment records.
shontos barnhart,cir.the eighth circuit accepted the alj finding that nurse flaherty was not an acceptable medical source,as nurse practitioners are not listed in cfr a,but found that she qualified as an other medical source under d and that her opinion could also be counted as a medical opinion per.
the shontos court does not address whether seeing a patient one time was not enough.it does,however,find that the use of a team approach by medical providers is analytically significant 
s ubstantial evidence on the record as a whole reveals that shontos sought mental health care frequently at gannon center which provided a team approach to mental health care.shontos was treated by therapists burn and bookmeyer.she was evaluated intermittently by flaherty for the purpose of prescribing psychiatric medication.in addition,shontos was seen twice a week by a social worker from gannon center.the opinions offered by burn,bookmeyer,and flaherty reflected clinical judgments of professionals who had interacted with and observed shontos over time.their opinions and evaluations were based on a longitudinal perspective of shontos.the opinions of these three treating mental health care providers were consistent.
although it does not address,the district court and the commissioner in our case cite to matney on behalf of matney sullivan,cir for the precedent that someone who has only seen a patient once is not a treating physician.as a redesignated but not rewritten unpublished opinion,matney is sparing with the facts.the sentence of interest is the alj determined that the opinion of cookson was entitled to little weight because he examined matney only one time and produced a brief report.id.at.other than noting matney claim that cookson was his treating physician,the opinion gives no indication of the doctor specialty,if any,and what role he played in matney treatment.
matney is distinguishable from the instant case in numerous ways.first,although zwiefach had seen benton only once,he continued to oversee her care.beyond
