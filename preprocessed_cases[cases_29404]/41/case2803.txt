creekstone farms premium beef,llc creekstone raises and slaughters for sale black angus cattle.in december,many countries began to ban or severely limit importation of beef because bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse mad cow disease had been found in one cow in washington state.see dep t of,publ no,an economic chronology of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in north america economic chronology.to counter the fears of beef importers as well as domestic consumers,creekstone developed a plan to test for bse each of the approximately cattle it slaughters each year.declaration of john stewart july,stewart decl.the united states department of agriculture usda,however,asserting authority under the act,vsta or act,denied creekstone request to purchase or use a bse test kit.creekstone challenged the usda action in the district court,alleging that two of usda regulations are ultra vires under vsta and that,even assuming the regulations are valid,they do not authorize usda restriction on the of the bse test kit.creekstone also challenged usda interpretation of another regulation.both parties moved for summary judgment and the district court granted partial summary judgment to each party.d.for the reasons explained below,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
the congress enacted vsta in following reports that farmers were being sold ineffective cholera serum.see agriculture appropriation bill hearings before the senate comm.on,cong.testimony of farrington,chief,bureau of animal,usda.the act makes it unlawful to prepare,sell,barter,or exchange or to ship or deliver for shipment any worthless,contaminated,dangerous,or harmful virus,serum,toxin,or analogous product intended for use in the treatment of domestic animals.emphasis added.to this end,vsta requires that any virus,serum,toxin,or analogous product manufactured within the united states and intended for use in the treatment of domestic animals be prepared,under and in compliance with regulations prescribed by the secretary of agriculture,at an establishment holding a license issued by the secretary of agriculture secretary.id.emphasis added.in addition,vsta makes it illegal to import any virus,serum,toxin,or analogous product for use in the treatment of domestic animals without a permit from the secretary.id.to implement the act,the secretary is authorized to make and promulgate from time to time such rules and regulations as may be necessary to prevent the preparation,sale,barter,exchange,or shipment of any worthless,contaminated,dangerous,or harmful virus,serum,toxin,or analogous product for use in the treatment of domestic animals,or otherwise to carry out vsta.id.emphasis added 
usda has promulgated several regulations implementing vsta.one regulation under review provides that w here the administrator of usda animal and plant health inspection service aphis determines that the protection of domestic animals or the public health,interest,or safety,or both,necessitates restrictions on the use of a biological product,the product shall be subject to restrictions as prescribed on the license.d the second regulation under review provides that n o biological product shall be brought into the united states unless a permit has been issued for such product by the aphis administrator.a.biological products include all viruses,serums,toxins,or analogous products which are intended for use in the treatment of animals and which act primarily through the direct stimulation,supplementation,enhancement,or modulation of the immune system or immune response.emphasis added.analogous products are defined,in relevant part,as s ubstances which are intended for use in the treatment of animals through the detection or measurement of antigens,antibodies,nucleic acids,or immunity.id.ii emphasis added.treatment is defined as the prevention,diagnosis,management,or cure of diseases of animals.id.emphasis added.
bovine spongiform encephalopathy 
bse is an invariably fatal neurological disease that causes degeneration of the cow central nervous system.see bovine spongiform encephalopathy.bse is believed to be caused by a type of protein called a prion.declaration of lisa ferguson,ferguson decl.prions exist naturally in the nerve cells of many animals and are believed to help maintain normal cell function however,the protein also exists in an abnormal form which causes bse.stanley prusiner,detecting mad cow disease,scientific american,july,at creekstone mot.summ.ex.bse occurs when healthy cattle are fed the remains of an animal ruminant infected with abnormally formed prions.ferguson decl.as abnormal prions accumulate within the brain cells,they cause the cells to rupture,resulting in a loss of coordination and ultimately the death of the animal.see,at ferguson decl.prions that cause bse in cattle can cause a similar disease in humans known as variant disease vcjd.ferguson decl.since,approximately of whom resided in the united died as a result of confirmed cases of vcjd.id.it is believed that humans can contract vcjd by consuming beef or beef products.id.
bse was first diagnosed in the united kingdom in.id.since then,more than confirmed cases of bse in cattle worldwide have been reported.id.while almost all of the cases have occurred in the united kingdom,bse has been found in cattle raised in at least other countries.id.in,usda banned the importation of ruminant products from countries with known cattle.see,ferguson decl.in,aphis began a surveillance program to determine the existence vel non of bse in the nation cattle and to evaluate the effectiveness of its import restriction in preventing the spread of the disease.ferguson decl.in,the united states food and drug administration fda banned the use of all ruminant feed for cattle.see substances prohibited from use in animal food or feed animal proteins prohibited in ruminant feed,june,codified at.despite these efforts,however,three cows have been found in the united states.the first was reported in december in a cow in washington state.economic chronology.in june aphis initiated a enhanced bse surveillance program under which aphis tested over cattle for bse.ferguson decl.d at.two more cattle were in texas in june and one in alabama in march.economic chronology.in july,usda announced that in light of the extremely low prevalence of the disease in the,it intended to reduce the number of cattle tested to approximately per of the total number of cattle slaughtered in the united states.usda press release july,declaration of paul brown.
there are several types of bse tests available the most the one at issue the immunoassay,or rapid,bse test see,at.the rapid bse test,however,has limitations.it can detect abnormal prions only if they exist in a relatively high concentration,id.at,and abnormal prions typically reach detectable concentrations only two to three months before an animal exhibits observable symptoms.see declaration of byron rippke.the incubation period for bse,from infection to observable symptoms is two to eight average being five cattle younger than thirty months are rarely symptomatic.ferguson decl.because most cattle for slaughter in the united states go to market before they are months old,it is unlikely that the rapid bse test will detect the disease.id.in light of the rapid bse test limited efficacy,usda believes that the routine use of the test on clinically normal young cattle is not practical,offers no food safety value,is likely to produce false negative results and is meaningful and reliable when used for surveillance purposes on animals exhibiting some type of clinical abnormality that could be consistent with bse,cattle that can not stand or walk,show signs of neurological disorders or die from an unknown cause.ferguson decl.
following the discovery of the first cow in washington state,several major beef importing countries,including japan,south korea and mexico at the time three of the four largest importers,banned the importation of beef.economic chronology.some countries have since resumed importing beef however,japan and south korea have done so only intermittently and subject to restrictions.see supplemental declaration of john stewart.
creekstone response to market loss 
creekstone claims to have suffered per day in lost revenue as a result of the diminished export market.stewart decl.moreover,in markets where beef is available,creekstone contends that consumer fears about bse have diminished its sales.see id,discussing market surveys in japan and.to allay the concerns of consumers and importers,in creekstone made a business decision to perform the rapid bse test on each cow it slaughters.compl.creekstone sought to purchase rapid bse test kits from laboratories,informed creekstone,however,that it could not sell creekstone the kits without usda authorization.on february,and in several later communications,creekstone requested usda permission to purchase the test kits.id.usda denied creekstone requests.on march,usda center for veterinary biologics issued notice,ordering that the s ale and use of all bse test kits be restricted to laboratories only.see usda,ctr.for veterinary biologics notice.the notice also declared that the distribution and use of all bse test kits was to be under the supervision or control of usda.id accordingly,import permit authorizes it to sell bse test kits to laboratories only.veterinary prod.permit,at.usda memorialized its decision to deny creekstone permission to purchase rapid bse test kits from in a june,letter,concluding that allowing a company to use a bse test in a private marketing program is inconsistent with usda mandate to ensure effective,scientifically sound testing for significant animal diseases and maintain domestic and international confidence in cattle and beef products.letter from bill hawkes,usda,to john stewart,creekstone farms june,
on march,creekstone filed a complaint in the district court.count i claimed,inter alia,that because vsta provides no authorization at all for restrictions on the use of products,usda regulation purporting to regulate the use of biological products is ultra vires.compl.emphasis added.count i also claimed that usda definition of treatment contained in regulation section goes beyond the scope of the rulemaking authority granted to usda in the vsta.id.count ii challenged usda regulation of bse testing because it is not used in the treatment of domestic animals and do es not act primarily through the direct stimulation,supplementation,enhancement or modulation of the immune system or immune response,as required by.compl.finally,count iii alleged that usda denial of creekstone request to perform bse testing is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the administrative procedure act,a.compl.
the parties filed for summary judgment on counts i and ii of creekstone complaint.on march,the district court granted summary judgment to usda on count i and to creekstone on count ii.the court first rejected creekstone argument that usda lacked the authority to regulate the use of products under section of the act.d at creekstone contends that usda use regulation exceeds its authority to regulate preparation,sale,barter,exchange,or shipment,but creekstone reading of the statute is too narrow.the court also upheld usda broad interpretation of treatment in sections of the act.id.at.on count ii,however,the court concluded that usda can not regulate bse testing because it can not be used in the treatment of domestic animals.id.at.the court reasoned that,because there is no known cure for bse and because testing can be done only,rapid bse test kits are not used for treatment as that term is defined in.id.at.neither party moved for summary judgment on count iii.see d at both parties timely appealed.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.mining ass kempthorne.we affirm a grant of summary judgment only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in making this determination,we view the material facts in the light most favorable to the party.johnson district of columbia,citing saucier katz,d.
usda use regulations 
we first address the question whether usda can regulate the use of biological products under vsta.vsta authorizes usda to promulgate regulations under two circumstances set forth in.first,section authorizes usda to promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary to prevent the preparation,sale,barter,exchange,or shipment of any worthless,contaminated,dangerous,or harmful virus,serum,toxin,or analogous product for use in the treatment of domestic animals.this language authorizes regulations directed at discrete,sale,barter,exchange and discrete,serums,toxins or analogous products but this language is also limited to products that are worthless,contaminated,dangerous,or harmful and plainly the rapid bse test kit can not be so described.section further provides that usda may promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary otherwise to carry out this chapter.id.usda contends that under chevron,natural res.def.council,d,this broad language authorizes it to regulate the use of biological products.we conclude instead that the applicable standard of review is that set out in skidmore swift.
ordinarily,we review an agency interpretation of a statute that it administers under chevron.we first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if so,that is the end of the matter and we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.however,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,we move to the second step and must defer to the agency interpretation as long as it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.in this case,however,we agree with creekstone that chevron does not apply to the otherwise to carry out language because that language was not added to the statute until,see food security act of,b,stat,almost ten years after usda promulgated the predecessor of section d.see deletion of special licenses.usda may not reasonably rely on statutory language that did not exist when it first adopted its regulation.see pub.citizen,dep t of health human,applying skidmore deference to regulation promulgated before amendment of statute.as the district court correctly noted,however,even without chevron deference,usda use regulations nonetheless remain entitled to a degree of deference under skidmore swift.d at quoting pub.citizen,at.
under skidmore,t he weight accorded to an administrative judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.united states mead,d quoting skidmore,at.second alteration in mead see am.fed of gov t employees veneman,under skidmore usda view constitutes a body of experience and informed judgment to which we may properly resort for guidance quoting skidmore,at.usda promulgation of section d satisfies skidmore standard.
as previously noted,section d provides that,once the aphis administrator determines that the protection of domestic animals or the public health,interest,or safety,or both,necessitates restrictions on the use of a product,the product shall be subject to such additional restrictions as are prescribed on the license,including limits on the distribution of the product.d emphases added.we believe regulation d,which permits restrictions on the use of biological products,reflects considered agency deliberation,has been consistently applied since and is reasonably related to the purposes of vsta,namely,to ensure the safety and efficacy of any product that is intended to be used in treating domestic animals.see,making it illegal to prepare,sell,barter,exchange,or ship any virus,serum,toxin,or analogous product manufactured within the united states and intended for use in the treatment of domestic animals,unless it shall have been prepared,under and in compliance with regulations prescribed by the secretary emphases added,requiring usda permit to import any virus,serum,toxin,or analogous product for use in the treatment of domestic animals emphases added,authorizing secretary to inspect all viruses,serums,toxins,and analogous products,for use in the treatment of domestic animals,which are being imported or offered for importation into the united states emphases added,authorizing secretary to issue permits for the importation into the united states of viruses,serums,toxins,and analogous products,for use in the treatment of domestic animals,which are not worthless,contaminated,dangerous or harmful emphasis added see fed.express holowecki,d according skidmore deference to agency interpretive position that was reasonable,consistent with the statutory framework and consistently applied for years.accordingly,we find section d is authorized and is entitled to skidmore deference.
creekstone also challenges usda interpretation of section.section provides that n o biological product shall be brought into the united states unless a permit has been issued for such product by the administrator.id.although section does not expressly provide that the administrator can deny an import permit based on the product intended use in this case,sales to creekstone,usda so interprets the regulation.we believe usda interpretation of section is not inconsistent with the regulation and therefore entitled to deference.see,thomas jefferson shalala,d we must give substantial deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulations unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.quotation omitted gardebring jenkins,d.
we are not persuaded by creekstone arguments to the contrary.creekstone first invokes the expressio unius est exclusio alterius canon of statutory construction to assert that the omission of use from vsta provisions precludes usda from promulgating a use regulation.with a statute like vsta,however,which contains broad language authorizing the agency to promulgate regulations necessary to carry out the statute,we believe the doctrine has minimal,if any,application.see cheney icc,whatever its general force,we think expressio unius an especially feeble helper in an administrative setting,where congress is presumed to have left to reasonable agency discretion questions that it has not directly resolved.rural legal aid,legal servs,whatever its usefulness in other circumstances this canon has little force in the administrative setting.see also nlrb beverly,cir ragsdale wolverine world wide,d,dissenting arguing that expressio unius ought to have somewhat reduced force in th e context of statute authorizing agency to prescribe such regulations as are necessary to carry out the act quoting.
nevertheless,creekstone argues that section otherwise to carry out language can not support the use regulations because,as previously noted,the otherwise to carry out language was not added to section until almost ten years after usda first asserted the authority to regulate the use of biological products.as the district court correctly noted,however,the argument cuts both ways.d at.because section d was already in effect when the congress amended vsta in,it had the opportunity to alter the regulation but did not do so.see doris day animal league veneman,w hen congress revisits a statute giving rise to a longstanding administrative interpretation without pertinent change,the congressional failure to revise or repeal the agency interpretation is persuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one intended by congress.quoting commodity futures trading comm schor,d quotation omitted.but creekstone asserts that the amendment does not satisfy the requirements of the legislative reenactment doctrine because the application of the legislative reenacement doctrine requires a showing of both congressional awareness and express congressional approval of an administrative interpretation if it is to be viewed as statutorily mandated.am.transp.icc,quotation omitted.even assuming the amendment does not satisfy the legislative reenactment doctrine,however,the congress decision to leave section d undisturbed is persuasive evidence that it is consistent with congressional intent.see nlrb bell aerospace.div.of textron,d a court may accord great weight to the longstanding interpretation placed on a statute by an agency charged with its administration footnote omitted 
creekstone also argues that vsta legislative history demonstrates that the congress intended to regulate manufacturers and importers of biological products,not users like creekstone.creekstone cites the testimony of farrington,assistant chief of the bureau of animal industry,before the house committee on agriculture,to the effect that vsta was meant to allow usda to regulate the preparation and marketing of biological products.see agriculture appropriation bill hearings before the senate comm.on,cong.testimony of farrington,chief,bureau of animal,usda.we are not persuaded.the legislative history of vsta is extremely sparse,animal health inst.usda,and the history that does exist does not conclusively support either interpretation.see,at vsta is intended to control use by preventing the interstate shipment of dangerous drugs.emphasis added.in any event,whether a use regulation was contemplated by the congress in,we believe the congress subsequently endorsed the same in.
finally,creekstone argues that the agricultural bioterrorism protection act of abpa supports its claim that vsta does not authorize a use regulation.abpa gives the secretary authority to regulate each biological agent and each toxin that he determines has the potential to pose a severe threat to animal or plant health.a a.the house conference report accompanying abpa noted that the legislation was needed,in part,because of the inadequacy of the penalty provisions of vsta enacted in and under which usda currently regulates these dangerous well as the lack of authority for the secretary of agriculture to regulate possession of biological agents and toxins that pose a severe threat to plant or animal health,at,cong.emphasis added.according to creekstone,the report shows the congress did not believe that vsta gives usda the authority to regulate the use of biological products.we disagree.first,abpa governs only those substances that pose a severe threat to plant or animal health.vsta,by contrast,encompasses all biological products intended for use in the treatment of domestic animals.further,the congress effectively refuted creekstone interpretation by specifically exempting from abpa products already regulated under vsta.see g c.
usda regulation of diagnostic testing 
in count i creekstone also argues that usda lacks the authority to regulate diagnostic testing in general because it is not used in the treatment of domestic animals as treatment was defined in.see compl.d at.according to creekstone,in,treat was defined,inter alia,as t o care for medicinally or surgically to manage in the use of remedies or appliances as,to treat a disease,a wound,or a patient.creekstone br.citing webster revised unabridged dictionary ed.usda regulation,however,defines treatment as the prevention,diagnosis,management,or cure of diseases of animals.emphasis added.we see no reason to disturb usda definition as set forth in section.indeed,creekstone acknowledges that t he word treatment does not have a precise meaning and is not a legal term of art.creekstone br.and we owe usda a considerable degree of deference in its interpretation of the term,bearing,as it does,on usda charge to administer our federal meat and poultry inspection laws.am.fed of gov t employees,at applying skidmore see troy browner,w e review scientific judgments of the agency not as the chemist,biologist,or statistician,but as a reviewing court exercising our narrowly defined duty of holding agencies to certain minimal standards of rationality.quoting ethyl epa.given the degree of deference we owe usda,we uphold its definition of treatment as including diagnosis and therefore its authority to regulate bse testing for the purpose of diagnosis.
in count ii,creekstone challenges usda regulation of the rapid bse test kit because,again,it is not used in the treatment of domestic animals.compl.the district court agreed,reasoning that e ven if usda is correct that diagnosis in general
