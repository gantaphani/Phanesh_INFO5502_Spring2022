this case requires us to address the scope of congressional power under section of the fourteenth amendment to abrogate the immunity of the states from suit in federal court which the states would otherwise enjoy under the eleventh amendment and supreme court precedent.at issue is whether the creation of a private cause of action against a state for money damages under the personal medical leave provision of the family and medical leave act,a d,validly abrogates that immunity as an exercise of congress section powers.
following the analytic framework suggested by two recent supreme court decisions,kimel florida board of regents,d,and board of trustees of the university of alabama garrett,d,we hold that the fmla personal medical leave provision,a d affording leave for serious personal health conditions,insofar as it authorizes private suits against states,does not validly abrogate the states immunity every circuit court which has addressed the personal medical leave provision of the fmla in this context has held that that provision does not abrogate the immunity of the state as employer in the face of the eleventh amendment.our holding is narrow the present legislative record does not demonstrate that the personal medical leave provision of the fmla is an appropriate response necessary to remedy or prevent unconstitutional gender discrimination practiced by the states as employers.
stephen laro was employed by the state of new hampshire as a computer specialist for the new hampshire retirement system.in early,he had heart bypass surgery.because of his medical condition,following his surgery he requested and received leave under the fmla,which leave began on march.laro physician provided the state with a certification which said that laro condition required him to be out of work for at least eight weeks,or until at least may.apparently his employer understood that to mean he requested leave only until that day.when he did not return to work as of may,his employer inquired,and laro explained that his physician had not yet cleared him to return to work.on may,the state wrote to laro,informing him that his fmla leave would expire as of may.laro replied that he would not need any more time than that,and on may,he provided his employer with a letter from his physician authorizing his immediate return to work.laro employer then told him that before returning to work he had to meet with his supervisors,and asked him to schedule an appointment.at this time,laro expected to return to work on thursday,may,before the expiration of the twelve week fmla period.instead,he was given a termination letter,dated may,and setting an effective termination date of may.the termination letter stated that laro had exhausted his accumulated leave balances and that he was unable to meet the new hampshire retirement system attendance requirements.other than that statement there is no explanation in the record for new hampshire on laro ability to return to work.
laro sued for monetary damages in federal court,claiming that the state had violated by terminating his employment before the expiration of the twelve week period of unpaid leave guaranteed under the fmla.the state moved to dismiss,asserting its immunity under the eleventh amendment.the district court agreed,and dismissed the action.laro now appeals,joined by the united states as intervenor.
the eleventh amendment provides that t he judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.const.amend.xi.though limited by its express terms,the amendment has been construed broadly by the supreme court,such that its ultimate guarantee is that nonconsenting states may not be sued by private individuals in federal court.garrett.at.
congress may abrogate this eleventh amendment immunity when it both unequivocally intends to do so and act s pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority.id.citing kimel,at.here,the state properly concedes that congress did intend to abrogate the states immunity.see a extending private right of action for damages to employees against any employer including a public agency a iii defining employer to include any public agency and x defining public agency to include the government of a state or political subdivision thereof.the question,then,is whether congress,in subjecting the states to suit in federal court for money damages under the personal medical leave provision of the fmla,acted appropriately pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority.
the supreme court has held that congress may not properly base its abrogation of eleventh amendment immunity upon the powers enumerated in article garrett.at kimel,at.seminole tribe of florida,d.where congress acts pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under section of the fourteenth amendment,however,it may subject nonconsenting states to suit in federal court.garrett.at t he eleventh amendment,and the principle of state sovereignty which it embodies,are necessarily limited by the enforcement provisions of of the fourteenth amendment.quoting fitzpatrick bitzer,d seminole tribe,at.t hrough the fourteenth amendment,federal power extended to intrude upon the province of the eleventh amendment and therefore of the fourteenth amendment allowed congress to abrogate the immunity from suit guaranteed by that amendment.that is so because the fourteenth amendment expressly empowers congress to enforce its provisions against the states.see seminole tribe,at.t he fourteenth amendment,by expanding federal power at the expense of state autonomy,fundamentally altered the balance of state and federal power struck by the constitution.ex parte virginia.the prohibitions of the fourteenth amendment are directed to the states,and they are to a degree restrictions of state power.it is these which congress is empowered to enforce,and to enforce against state action such enforcement is no invasion of state sovereignty.no law can be,which the people of the states have,by the constitution of the united states,empowered congress to enact.
section of the fourteenth amendment provides,in relevant part 
no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
const.amend.xiv.section of the fourteenth amendment grants congress the power to enforce the substantive guarantees contained in section by enacting appropriate legislation.id.this provision embodies an affirmative grant of power to congress.see city of boerne flores,d all must acknowledge that is a positive grant of legislative power to congress.quoting katzenbach morgan,d.
section of the fourteenth amendment,then,affords congress a broad remedial and prophylactic power to enact legislation restricting state action,so long as the legislation reflects a rational means,under the standard of mcculloch maryland,wheat,to realize the end of enforcing the fourteenth amendment substantive prohibitions.see city of boerne,at.whatever legislation is appropriate,that is,adapted to carry out the objects the amendments have in view,whatever tends to enforce submission to the prohibitions they contain,and to secure to all persons the enjoyment of perfect equality of civil rights and the equal protection of the laws against state denial or invasion,if not prohibited,is brought within the domain of congressional power.quoting ex parte virginia,at katzenbach morgan,at.by including the draftsmen sought to grant to congress,by a specific provision applicable to the fourteenth amendment,the same broad powers expressed in the necessary and proper clause,art.i,cl.id.at.t he mcculloch maryland standard is the measure of what constitutes appropriate legislation under of the fourteenth amendment.see also south carolina katzenbach,d holding that under the enforcement clause of the fifteenth amendment,congress may employ any rational means to effectuate its constitutional prohibitions,and citing the standard of mcculloch maryland as t he basic test to be applied in a case involving of the fifteenth amendment james everard breweries day.legislation under the enforcement clause of the eighteenth amendment assessed under the standard of mcculloch maryland.indeed,by its express terms,the necessary and proper clause applies to enumerated powers added to the constitution after its adoption.see const.art.i,cl.granting congress the power t o make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers,and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states,or in any department or officer thereof emphasis added.
the scope of section of the fourteenth amendment enables congress to do more than simply prohibit what the amendment itself already prohibits congress may enact legislation which is rationally tailored to prevent or deter the incidence of violations of the amendment.see,garrett.at congress is not limited to mere legislative repetition of this court constitutional jurisprudence.kimel,at.congress power is not confined to the enactment of legislation that merely parrots the precise wording of the fourteenth amendment.rather,congress power to enforce the amendment includes the authority both to remedy and to deter violation of rights guaranteed thereunder by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct,including that which is not itself forbidden by the amendment text.city of boerne,at.legislation which deters or remedies constitutional violations can fall within the sweep of congress enforcement power even if in the process it prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional and intrudes into legislative spheres of autonomy previously reserved to the states.quoting fitzpatrick,at.
indeed,the enforcement clause delegates to congress in the first instance the responsibility to determine what prophylactic measures are necessary to enforce most effectively the amendment substantive provisions.see,city of boerne,at.it is for congress in the first instance to determin e whether and what legislation is needed to secure the guarantees of the fourteenth amendment,and its conclusions are entitled to much deference.quoting katzenbach morgan,at.katzenbach morgan,at.it is the power of congress which has been enlarged.congress is authorized to enforce the prohibitions by appropriate legislation.some legislation is contemplated to make the amendments fully effective.quoting ex parte virginia,at see also south carolina katzenbach,at.enforcement clause of the fifteenth amendment indicates that congress was to be chiefly responsible for implementing the rights created in the amendment.
because the fourteenth amendment affords this role to congress,courts consider congressional conclusions with considerable deference.see,katzenbach morgan,at.it was for congress to assess and weigh the various conflicting considerations it is not for us to review the congressional resolution of these factors.it is enough that we be able to perceive a basis upon which the congress might resolve the conflict as it did.james everard breweries,at.in enacting enforcement legislation,congress has affirmed its validity.that determination must be given great weight this court by an unbroken line of decisions having steadily adhered to the rule that every possible presumption is in favor of the validity of an act of congress until overcome beyond rational doubt.internal quotation marks omitted.
nevertheless,this congressional power is not without limits congressional power under section is but a limited authority extending only to a single class of cases,though within those limits it is complete.ex parte virginia,at see also city of boerne,at.a s broad as the congressional enforcement power is,it is not unlimited.quoting oregon mitchell,d opinion of black.the limits are those prescribed in the constitution itself.see gibbons ogden,wheat.that is,the ends of appropriate enforcement legislation under section must be the enforcement of the substantive guarantees of the fourteenth amendment.see kimel,at.the language of section limits congressional power to enacting that legislation appropriate to enforce the provisions of the amendment accord city of boerne,at.
consequently,despite congress initial responsibility to gauge appropriate enforcement legislation,federal courts retain the power to review that legislation to ensure that it pursues appropriate ends.see city of boerne,at.t he courts retain the power to determine if congress has exceeded its authority under the constitution.see also james everard breweries,at.what the court may consider is whether that which has been done by congress has gone beyond the constitutional limits upon its legislative discretion.the unconstitutional exercise of enforcement powers occurs where congress attacks evils not comprehended by the amendments.see south carolina katzenbach,at.
two recent supreme court cases present a framework for assessing whether legislation enacted under section falls within appropriate bounds in the face of a claim of eleventh amendment immunity.see garrett,d kimel,d.the first step of this eleventh amendment analysis requires the court to identify the precise scope of the constitutional right at issue,including as it is reflected in the degree of judicial scrutiny afforded the state statute or action.see,garrett.at the first step in applying these now familiar principles is to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue.whether the legislation is prophylactic or remedial,the court must then examine whether the legislative means adopted by congress have a congruence and proportionality to the constitutional injury to be prevented or remedied see,kimel,at.r ecognizing that congress must have wide latitude in determining where the line between measures that remedy or prevent unconstitutional actions and measures that make a substantive change in governing law lies,we have held that t here must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.quoting city of boerne,at.we turn to applying this framework to the fmla.
the family and medical leave act of,et,entitles eligible employees to twelve workweeks of unpaid leave per year in four specified situations the birth of a child,the adoption of a child or placement of a foster child,the need to care for a parent,child,or spouse with a serious health condition,and the inability to work due to the employee own serious health condition.a the only issue before us in this case concerns the availability of private damages actions against states under the final provision,a d,which affords an employee the right to unpaid leave for inability to work due to his or her own serious health condition 
the first step in assessing the validity of this personal medical leave provision as appropriate enforcement legislation under section in the face of eleventh amendment immunity is to determine the substantive guarantee of the fourteenth amendment it is designed to protect.the fmla was explicitly enacted in part pursuant to congressional power under section of the fourteenth amendment to address discrimination as well as discrimination,in addition to congress article i,section powers under the commerce clause.
the findings section of the statute provides,in pertinent part 
due to the nature of the roles of men and women in our society,the primary responsibility for family caretaking often falls on women,and such responsibility affects the working lives of women more than it affects the working lives of men and 
employment standards that apply to one gender only have serious potential for encouraging employers to discriminate against employees and applicants for employment who are of that gender.
a.therefore,the statute provides that it is the purpose of the act 
to accomplish the statutory goals in a manner that,consistent with the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,minimizes the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring generally that leave is available for eligible medical reasons including disability and for compelling family reasons,on a basis and 
to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for women and men,pursuant to such clause.
the question,then,is whether the personal medical leave provision of the fmla appropriately enforces the fourteenth amendment guarantee against discrimination by the states.the scope of constitutional protection against discrimination under the fourteenth amendment is broader than that against mere arbitrary classifications.where discrimination is at issue,a state must justify its discrimination by a showing of considerably more than mere rationality.see,united states morrison,d.discrimination violates equal protection unless it serves important governmental objectives and the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.united states virginia,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the personal medical leave provision of the fmla at issue does not directly address gender discrimination on its face,but may serve a prophylactic function to prevent or deter unconstitutional state actions.hundertmark florida dep t of,cir equal pay act facially targets gender discrimination and therefore validly abrogates the states eleventh amendment immunity under section.the issue,then,for eleventh amendment purposes,is whether there is congruence and proportionality between the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex by a state and the fmla provision of leave to employees because of their own personal health problems.we look only to the discrimination concerns of congress 
the supreme court has not recently addressed the issue of congressional power to override a state eleventh amendment immunity through legislation designed to prevent unconstitutional discrimination in employment but see fitzpatrick bitzer,d.rather,the two employment statutes it has considered in this context address categories of discrimination in kimel and disability discrimination in the courts impose a lesser burden on a state to justify discriminatory practices.see kimel,at.garrett.at.even with the heightened standard of review for discrimination,however,we do not find that the legislative history sufficiently ties the fmla personal medical leave provision to the prevention of discrimination by the states to survive eleventh amendment scrutiny.in the absence of such history,we must affirm.
defending the personal medical leave provision within the context of the entire act,laro and the intervenor united states argue that the fmla as a whole was motivated to prevent gender discrimination against both men and women,relying upon the following rationale.first,they say,the act prevents discrimination against men without the act protection,men might be deprived of leave opportunities and thereby denied the opportunity to take equal responsibility for their families.in turn,the absence of leave opportunities for men,they say,serves to reinforce general stereotypes that women are the proper caregivers,both for children and for other family members,and thereby forces women back into those stereotypical roles.such stereotypes,so reinforced,deter employers from hiring women or promoting them to positions of equal responsibility men.the existence of such a reinforcing dynamic was demonstrated,they say,by experience with respect to state law maternity provisions when maternity leave for women was mandated by state law,employers reacted by refusing to hire or promote women.thus,legislation that solely protected women in an effort to eliminate discrimination perversely gave employers an economic incentive to discriminate against women.for these reasons,they say,the fmla insists on leave provisions.for present purposes we accept all of that to be true.
in defending the personal medical leave provision of the fmla as validly abrogating the states eleventh amendment immunity on this rationale,however,laro and the united states must demonstrate how this particular provision contributes to the broader purposes they attribute to the act as a whole.in doing so,the problems for laro and the united states are.first,in order for this particular provision to validly abrogate a state eleventh amendment immunity,it must be linked through some nexus not just to such problems in society at large,but specifically to unconstitutional gender discrimination by states in their capacity as employers.second,establishing this connection is particularly difficult for the personal medical leave provision at issue,which,on its face,only bears on these concerns indirectly likely this is why the plaintiff sought to tie his case to the other provisions of the fmla.the argument that this provision validly abrogates new hampshire eleventh amendment immunity founders on this lack of congruence between the personal medical leave provision at issue here and the prevention of discrimination by states as employers,because congress has not found the states to have engaged in the specific discriminatory practices this provision was designed to prevent.
one rationale advanced to defend the they serve to counteract gender stereotyping on family misplaced as to the personal medical leave provision at issue in this case.the argument is not without sense.it proceeds as follows employers perceive that the primary responsibility for caretaking of family members in our society tends to fall on women therefore,they presume women will inevitably need to take leave for such caretaking,and hence will either be less likely to hire women,or else will afford such leave to women but not to men,thus reinforcing gender roles.therefore,the argument concludes,congress might reasonably seek to break the cycle of stereotyping and discrimination by requiring leave policies for family care.this may all be true,but this argument does not go to the need for a personal medical leave provision.rather,it provides a rationale for the parental and leave provisions found in the first three subsections of the fmla,which are not at issue in this case.
attention to the legislative history reveals that congress primary motivation for including the personal medical leave provision contained in subsection d was to protect families from the economic dislocation caused by a family member losing his or her job due to a serious medical problem.see,at,reprinted in,the fundamental rationale for a personal medical leave policy is that it is unfair for an employee to be terminated when he or she is struck with a serious illness and is not capable of working.job loss because of illness has a particularly devastating effect on workers who support themselves and on families where two incomes are necessary to make ends meet or where a single parent heads the household.id.at example of frances wright see also.i,at the temporary medical leave requirement is intended to provide basic,humane protection to the family unit when it is most in need of help.it will also help reduce the societal cost born by government and private charity.this concern clearly goes to congress power under the commerce clause and not section.
a secondary motivation that appears in the legislative history is a concern to protect workers who were temporarily disabled by serious health problems from discrimination on account of their medical condition.see,at citing testimony of barbara hoffman,vice president of the national coalition for cancer survivorship,stating that a quarter of all cancer survivors face some form of employment discrimination and that such discrimination against qualified employees costs society millions of dollars in lost wages,lost productivity and needless disabilities payments i,at a worker who has lost a job due to a serious health condition often faces future discrimination in finding a job which has even more devastating consequences for the worker and his or her family.see also kazmier widmann,cir.garrett has effectively disposed of that disability rationale as sufficient basis to overcome eleventh amendment immunity.
nevertheless,the united states and laro contend that the prevention of discrimination also motivated congress in enacting the personal medical leave provision of the fmla,and hence that provision does validly abrogate the states eleventh amendment immunity.they suggest that the provision counters discrimination in two respects first,it prevents discrimination directly on the basis of pregnancy and,second,it undermines incentives to discriminate against women indirectly on the basis of stereotypes about women due to pregnancy these claims are not irrational.nonetheless,where the connection between the provision at issue and discrimination is indirect at best,it is incumbent on congress either to establish a clear link to the prevention of unconstitutional gender discrimination or to identify problematic state practices to which the provision responds.here there is no indication that congress found such a problem on the part of states as employers.
the united states and laro advance the following argument,attempting to connect the personal medical leave provision to the need to combat gender discrimination on the part of state employers.employers might assume that women will require greater accommodation at work as a result of disability,and therefore be more reluctant to hire women or place them in positions of equal responsibility.the personal medical leave provision,they say,by affording medical leave for any serious health condition,mitigates this incentive to discriminate because it places men and women on equal footing with respect to medical leave.see,at because the bill treats all employees who are temporarily unable to work due to serious health conditions in the same fashion,it does not create the risk of discrimination against pregnant women posed by legislation which provides job protection only for pregnancy related disability.there is no showing,however,that establishes any nexus between medical leave for one own health conditions and the prevention of discrimination on the basis of gender on the part of states as employers.
we understand the problem in these terms.in,the supreme court held that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy was not discrimination within the meaning of title vii.see general gilbert,d congress reacted to this decision,amending the definition section of title vii such that its prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex encompassed pregnancy discrimination.see pregnancy discrimination act,stat,k see also newport news shipbuilding and dry dock eeoc,d.congress conclusion that gender and pregnancy were sufficiently related that barring pregnancy discrimination served the end of preventing discrimination was quite rational indeed,as the supreme court recently suggested,the potential for pregnancy is one immutable characteristic which distinguishes men from women and consequently has definite real life consequences.see nguyen ins,d.in enacting the pda,congress was expressly concerned with the issues of discrimination now advanced in defense of subsection d of the fmla.see,at,code cong.admin.news at,t he consequences of discriminatory employment policies on pregnant women and women in general has historically had a persistent and harmful effect upon their careers.women are still subject to the stereotype that all women are marginal workers.until a woman passes the age,she is viewed by employers as potentially pregnant.therefore,the elimination of discrimination based on pregnancy in these employment practices in addition to disability and medical benefits will go a long way toward providing equal employment opportunities for women.
the pda affected gender discrimination law in two respects women can no longer be treated differently in employment because of pregnancy,childbirth,or related medical conditions or stereotypes about the same and if an employer chooses to offer benefit programs,then those programs must cover pregnancy,childbirth,and related medical conditions.medical insurance and leave policies,if offered to employees,have to cover pregnancy.thus the pda itself operates to accomplish much of what is now offered as the rationale for subsection d of the fmla,since it mandates equivalent treatment of all temporarily disabled workers,including those disabled because of conditions.indeed,to the extent that states provide leave to male employees for temporary medical conditions that render them incapable of working,but do not provide similar leave to women who are pregnant or vice versa,title vii as amended by the pda affords a federal right to relief.
the pda did leave a gap in its coverage those employers who did not offer benefit packages for leave at all.the fmla closes this gap in coverage by requiring medical leave for pregnancy but there is nothing in the legislative history which indicates the states posed this gap problem.indeed,the only direct evidence regarding the actual leave policies of public sector employees in the legislative record suggests that state employers did not fall into the gap left by the pda.see the family and medical leave act of hearings on before the subcomm.on relations of the comm.of educ.and labor,cong,testimony of gerald mcentee,president of the american federation of state,county,and municipal employees,stating that the union had successfully negotiated leave policies for a vast number of its members with public sector employers.
the argument for subsection d is that,at least in theory,these two requirements created a new problem while the issue of discrimination against pregnant women was solved by mandatory pregnancy leave,this solution had the effect of imposing the costs of these leaves on employers this led to the concern that these costs would induce employers to respond by not hiring women who had the potential to be pregnant.this new problem,the argument goes,would be solved by requiring medical leave for all employees with serious medical problems,as subsection d of the fmla does.the larger concept that special treatment of one gender can lead to discrimination is reflected in the testimony before the senate that legislation which provides job protection only for pregnancy related discrimination created the risk of discrimination against pregnant women.see,at.the argument is made that employers,despite the pda and despite the nondiscrimination in hiring provisions of title vii,would not hire women who could become pregnant and take leave because they could be more costly as to assessing whether the states as employers posed such risks even in light of the requirements of the pda and title vii,we think the eleventh amendment requires greater information from congress as to whether such a risk is real.
only two references in the legislative history are relied on to link such discrimination to actual state practices.the first concerns a general statement made twice at a congressional hearing asserting that public sector leave policies do not vary much from private sector policies.see the parental and medical leave act of hearings on before the subcomm.on relations and the subcomm.on labor standards of the comm.on educ.and labor,cong.id.at.perhaps this is so,but it is insufficiently informative as to what the flaws were in the states practices for eleventh amendment purposes.the second piece of information relied upon is an attachment to a house committee report,which simply indicates that of the states had not enacted state laws requiring family and medical leaves in the private sector.see.i,attachment b.this tells us little,if anything,about whether the states themselves had not hired women because of the risk of having the costs of pregnancy leave imposed on them,thus indicating a need for personal medical leave for all under the fmla subsection d in order to avoid creating disincentives to hire women.it may be that such a problem exists,but congress did not find that to be so.if it had,we would have a different case before us.
in order to validly abrogate the states eleventh amendment immunity,enforcement legislation must have a congruence to the constitutional evil to be prevented.here,there is no identified link between this particular provision and any pattern of discriminatory stereotyping on the part of states as employers.on this record,the personal medical leave provision of the fmla does not exhibit a sufficient congruence to the prevention of unconstitutional state discrimination to validly abrogate the states eleventh amendment immunity.without more,then,these legislative responses are out of proportion to the preventive objective as to states as employers and can not be understood to be designed to prevent unconstitutional behavior city of boerne,at.requiring congruence and proportionality.but see kazmier widmann,cir dennis,dissenting garrett university of.bd.of trustees,cir subsequent history omitted cook,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
to summarize,the personal medical leave provision of the fmla,a d,on its face has no direct connection to preventing unconstitutional gender discrimination by state employers.hundertmark,at.the arguments advanced to connect that particular provision to preventing gender discrimination by states as employers are too attenuated,in the absence of a stronger legislative record,to allow congress to abrogate a state eleventh amendment immunity under the auspices of section.accordingly,we affirm the dismissal of laro complaint.the result we reach is consistent with that of every circuit that has addressed the issue with regard to a d of the fmla.see lizzi alexander,cir chittister department of cmty.and econ,cir townsel missouri,cir kazmier,at sims university of cincinnati,cir hale mann,cir garrett university of.bd.of trustees,at.
while we hold that the personal medical leave provision of the fmla does not validly abrogate the eleventh amendment immunity of the states as employers from private damages actions,other remedies remain.as was the case in garrett,see.at,the united states may choose to pursue its own actions against new hampshire or other states violating the provisions to enforce the fmla and recover damages.see b empowering the secretary of labor to bring civil actions to recover damages for violations of the fmla.private parties may also enforce the substantive requirements of the provision against states through injunctive actions against state officials rather than through suits for money damages.see,garrett.at.similarly,new hampshire may voluntarily choose to provide for state employees the same privately enforceable right to fmla personal medical leave enjoyed by most private sector employees and many state employees,under state law,either by consenting to suit in federal court or providing an enforceable state remedy.but on this legislative record,congress does not have the power to empower a federal court to force new hampshire to pay damages to an employee for failing to provide such leave through a private enforcement action if the state has not consented or waived its immunity.
affirmed.each party to bear its own costs.
the majority opinion is a carefully reasoned and narrowly drawn analysis of the eleventh amendment issue raised by the application in this case of the personal medical leave provision of the fmla,a d.it reflects the view that the legislative record invoked by laro and the intervenor united states in support of that provision is an inadequate basis for the abrogation of state sovereign immunity in light of the supreme court decisions in kimel.bd.of regents,d,and bd.of trustees of the of garrett,d.it notes correctly that the other circuits addressing similar cases have found the states immune from suits for damages under the fmla.i recognize the weight of these precedents.nevertheless,i must respectfully dissent.
in kimel and garrett,where the supreme court invalidated congressional abrogation of state sovereign immunity in the adea and ada,respectively,the court reviewed legislation requiring states to alter age and practices that,under rational basis review,would not be adjudged constitutional violations under section of the fourteenth amendment.state actions involving gender discrimination are subject to heightened scrutiny,not rational basis review.in applying the congruence and proportionality test to the fmla prophylactic scheme,and the legislative record supporting it,we should recognize that the heightened scrutiny standard,and the supreme court precedent applying it to claims of gender discrimination,require greater deference to congressional action addressing gender discrimination.relatedly,i think it is inappropriate to evaluate in isolation a personal medical leave provision that supplements the caretaking provisions of the fmla with an important protection for women against gender discrimination in employment.i would vacate the district court decision dismissing laro action for damages against the state of new hampshire.
in city of boerne flores,d,the supreme court set forth the congruence and proportionality test applicable to remedial and prophylactic measures enacted by congress pursuant to section of the fourteenth amendment.the test first requires a congruence between the means used and the ends to be achieved.id.at.additionally,the legislation may not be so out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preventive object that it can not be understood as a response to,or designed to prevent,unconstitutional behavior.id.at.as this language suggests,the congruence and proportionality test is malleable.the appropriateness of remedial measures must be considered in light of the evil presented.strong measures appropriate to address one harm may be an unwarranted response to another,lesser one.id.at.citations omitted.
the legislation at issue in boerne,the religious freedom restoration act rfra,prohibited the federal,state and local governments from substantially burdening a person exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability,unless the government could demonstrate both that the burden was in furtherance of a compelling government interest and that the rule was the least restrictive means of achieving that interest.id.at.the court found the scope of the rfra to be so broad as to ensure its intrusion at every level of government,displacing laws and prohibiting actions of almost every description and regardless of subject matter.id.at.because the rfra was so sweeping in its impact,the court concluded that t he stringent test rfra demands of state laws reflects a lack of proportionality or congruence between the means adopted and the legitimate end to be achieved.id.at.
in kimel,where age discrimination was the basis for congressional abrogation of state sovereign immunity,the supreme court found a lack of congruence because the substantive requirements the adea imposes on the state and local governments are disproportionate to any unconstitutional conduct that conceivably could be targeted by the act.at.similarly,in garrett,where disability was the basis for abrogation,the court concluded that e ven were it possible to squeeze out of these examples from the legislative record a pattern of unconstitutional discrimination by the states,the rights and remedies created by the ada against the states would raise the same sort of concerns as to congruence and proportionality as were found in city of boerne.at.
in cases involving age and disability,the exercise of congressional section power must be congruent and proportional to behavior that a court would hold unconstitutional under rational basis review.robert post reva siegel,equal protection by law federal antidiscrimination legislation after morrison and kimel,yale.however,as the court made clear in kimel,the judicial inquiry in these state immunity cases does not end with a judgment on the congruence of the legislation 
that the adea prohibits very little conduct likely to be held unconstitutional,while significant,does not alone provide the answer to our inquiry.difficult and intractable problems often require powerful remedies,and we have never held that precludes congress from enacting reasonably prophylactic legislation.our task is to determine whether the adea is in fact just such an appropriate remedy or,instead,merely an attempt to substantively redefine the states legal obligations with respect to age discrimination.one means by which we have made such a determination in the past is by examining the legislative record containing the reasons for congress action.
in kimel and again in garrett,the court found the legislative record inadequate.regarding the adea,the court ruled that congress never identified any pattern of age discrimination by the states,much less any discrimination whatsoever that rose to the level of constitutional violation.the evidence compiled by petitioners to demonstrate such attention by congress to age discrimination by the states falls well short of the mark.kimel,at.in garrett,t he legislative record of the ada simply fails to show that congress did in fact identify a pattern of irrational state discrimination in employment against the disabled.at.the court noted further that under review,where a group possesses distinguishing characteristics relevant to interests the state has the authority to implement,a state decision to act on the basis of those differences does not give rise to a constitutional violation.id.at quotations omitted.
the supreme court has not yet applied the congruence and proportionality test to a legislative record supporting prophylactic measures aimed at gender discrimination.in kimel,the court noted an important difference between age classifications and gender classifications 
age classifications,unlike governmental conduct based on race or gender,can not be characterized as so seldom relevant to the achievement of any legitimate state interest that laws grounded in such considerations are deemed to reflect prejudice and antipathy.older persons,again,unlike those who suffer discrimination on the basis of race or gender,have not been subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment.
at.citations omitted emphasis added.when gender classifications are being considered,rational basis review gives way to heightened scrutiny,whereby legislation involving classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.craig boren,d see also mississippi for women hogan,d.
the application of heightened scrutiny to governmental classifications based on gender has important implications for the application of the congruence and proportionality test to prophylactic legislation enacted pursuant to section of the fourteenth amendment.the universe of constitutional governmental conduct based on age and disability is large,given the applicability of rational basis review.the universe of constitutional governmental conduct based on gender is small,given the applicability of heightened scrutiny.therefore,heightened scrutiny creates more room for congress to act under section because the universe of potential unconstitutional actions by the states is much larger.brian ray,note,out the window prospects for the epa and the fla after kimel florida board of regents,ohio.put another way,legislation designed to prevent gender discrimination presumptively captures a wider range of unconstitutional conduct than legislation aimed at age or disability discrimination.in this sense,legislation has a better chance of passing muster as reasonably prophylactic.importantly,the supreme court has stated emphatically that it has never held that precludes congress from enacting reasonably prophylactic legislation.kimel,at.in my view,the personal medical leave provision of the fmla is reasonably prophylactic in the sense that it is an important component of a legislative scheme designed,in part,to prevent gender discrimination against women by employers,including state employers.
the fmla leave provisions entitle an eligible employee to twelve weeks of unpaid leave during any period for one or more of the following 
a because of the birth of a son or daughter of the employee and in order to care for such son or daughter b because of the placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care c in order to care for the spouse,or a son,daughter,or parent of the employee,if such spouse,son,daughter,or parent has a serious health condition d because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.
provisions a,b and c in this scheme all involve unpaid leave for the purpose of caring for another family member.only provision d provides unpaid leave because of the personal medical condition of the employee.some history emphasizes why leave programs limited to the need of an employee to care for another family member can disadvantage women.
before there was no federally required parity in the allowance for pregnancy and sick leave,a circumstance which prevented many women from entering and advancing in the workforce altogether.even if sick leave were available,pregnancy was often excluded from this benefit,making the policy one that favored men and left women who wanted to have children out of a job.the pregnancy discrimination act pda,stat,sought to rectify this inequity by affording some entitlement to leave.employers who provided sick leave for other conditions were required to offer the same level of benefits for maternity leave.k.while this change surely gave women some increased opportunity to enter the workplace,it left unaddressed the presumption that women of age would take more leave and were thus less desirable employees in the first place.as a result,employers might find it to discriminate against married women of age,since these women would end up costing a firm more than they contribute to its worth,at testimony of economist deborah walker.the protections that the pda was intended to provide ultimately had some negative impact on women workplace opportunities.
against this background,congress enacted an fmla scheme which included the personal medical leave provision.the act states congress finds that employment standards that apply to one gender only have serious potential for encouraging employers to discriminate against employees and applicants for employment who are of that gender.a.the act seeks to achieve its purposes in a manner that,consistent with the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,minimizes the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring generally that leave is available for eligible medical reasons including disability and for compelling family reasons,on a basis and to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for women and men.b.
in reports preceding enactment of the fmla,there was close attention to the need for a personal medical leave provision in the fmla.the senate committee on labor and human resources reported 
a significant benefit of the temporary medical leave provided by the legislation is the form of protection it offers women workers who bear children.because the bill treats all employees who are temporarily unable to work due to serious health conditions in the same fashion,it does not create the risk of discrimination against pregnant women posed by legislation which provides job protection only for pregnancy related disability.legislation solely protecting pregnant women gives employers an economic incentive to discriminate against women in hiring policies legislation helping all workers equally does not have this effect.
the house committee on education and labor made the same point in its report on the legislation 
the fmla addresses the basic leave needs of all employees.it covers not only women of childbearing age,but all employees,young and old,male and female,who suffer from a serious health condition,or who have a family member with such a condition.a law providing special protection to women or any defined group,in addition to being inequitable,runs the risk of causing discriminatory treatment.this legislation,by addressing the needs of all workers,avoids such a risk.
if congress had drawn a line at leave for caring for other family members,there is greater likelihood that the fmla would have been perceived as further reason to avoid granting employment opportunities to women.heretofore,women have provided most of the child and elder care,and legislation that focused on these duties could have had a deleterious impact because of the prevalent notion that women take more advantage of such leave policies.the inclusion of personal medical leave in the scheme,unrelated to any need to care for another person,undermines the assumption that women are the only ones taking leave because men,presumably,are as likely as women to get sick.to be sure,the caretaking provisions of the act,prongs a through c,protect men and women from gender discrimination by giving men the opportunity to assume equal responsibilities for the care of their families and by shielding women from the stereotype that assigns such roles to women.these provisions serve important goals independently of prong d,the personal medical leave provision.for the reason stated,however,the inclusion of the personal medical leave provision in the fmla is also particularly important to women in protecting them against gender discrimination.
interestingly,there is some early evidence that the fmla is working as the drafters had hoped.under the fmla,percent of all are men,with men invoking the fmla for parental leave purposes in comparable numbers to women.commission on family and medical leave,a workable balance report to congress on family and medical leave policies.a study of both private and public sector employers following fmla implementation found that differences in usage rates by industry were not related to the percent of the workforce that was female e arly indications are that both genders are making use of the act.holly tompson and jon werner,the family and medical leave act assessing the costs and benefits of use,employee rts.employment pol y.it is possible,if not probable,that the inclusion of the personal medical leave provision has helped account for the increase in men such as stephen laro accessing leave.
the history that led to the inclusion of the personal medical leave provision in the fmla,and the evidence of its effectiveness,highlight the congruence between this prophylactic measure and potentially discriminatory conduct by state employers.under the lens of heightened scrutiny,such employers would be acting unconstitutionally if they denied women equal employment opportunities because of stereotypical views that women are the primary caregivers,and hence the greater employment risks.the fmla attempts to blunt the force of such stereotypes and such discriminatory conduct by increasing the odds that men and women will invoke leave provisions in equal numbers.unlike the adea provision under review in kimel,which prohibit ed very little conduct likely to be held unconstitutional,kimel,at,the personal medical leave provision of the fmla attempts to prevent conduct by a state employer that would be unconstitutional.although this congruence does not dispense with the need for congress to justify its invocation of section of the fourteenth amendment to abrogate the immunity of the states,this congruence does mean that the burden of justification should be less than that applied by the court in kimel and garrett.
the legislative record includes substantial material drawn from the private sector about the need for the fmla generally,and the need for a personal medical leave provision specifically.indeed,the legislative record is replete with evidence from the private sector that because women generally had greater access to maternity and parental leave,some employers were reluctant to hire them.see samuel issacharoff elyse rosenblum,women and the workplace accommodating the demands of pregnancy,colum,quoting testimony from the united states chamber of commerce explaining faced with mandated parental leave,a business owner choosing between two qualified male and one be tempted to select the male.one hearing statement from concluded the lack of uniform parental and medical leave policies in the work place has created an environment where discrimination is rampant.the parental and medical leave act of,hearings before the subcomm.of the senate comm.on labor and human resources,part,cong.comments of peggy montes,mayor commission on women affairs,city of chicago hereinafter hearings on leave act of.
there was evidence before congress that some of this discrimination is caused by stereotypes about women which assume that women are mothers first,and workers second,parental and medical leave act of,joint hearings before the subcomm.on relationship and the subcomm.on labor standards for the comm.on education and labor,cong.hereinafter hearings leave act of,and that women are untrustworthy workers because of their tendency to become pregnant and leave the labor market,id.at.the legislative record memorializes congress understanding that the provisions of the fmla would serve to rectify some of this gender discrimination.for example,one of the senate reports stated because the bill treats all employees who are temporarily unable to work due to serious health conditions in the same fashion,it does not create the risk of discrimination against pregnant women posed by legislation which provides job protection only for pregnancy related disability,at.the inclusion of the personal medical leave provision in the fmla would deter employers from acting on the assumption that women are much more likely to invoke leave provisions related only to childcare or care of seriously ill family members.
congress also had reason to conclude that gender discrimination caused by differing leave policies was a significant problem in state employment as well as in the private sector.as the house report noted private sector practices and government policies have failed to adequately respond to recent economic and social changes that have intensified the tensions between work and family,pt,at.during the hearings in,congress heard testimony that p ublic sector leaves do vary very much from private sector leaves.hearings leave act of,at see also id.at noting that discriminatory treatment occurs in both the public and private sectors.data showed that,like private employers,many states made different allowances for leave between male and female employees,reflecting a similarity in employment practices and leave policies across sectors.see hearings on leave act of at family and medical leave act of hearings on before the subcomm.on relations,cong.indeed,the legislative record describes state provisions prescribing inequitable access to leave depending upon gender.see,pt,at attachment b.these policies raised legitimate concerns that discriminatory presumptions about women practices could influence private and public hiring decisions,including those by state employers.
in my view,this legislative record justifies congress abrogation of state immunity in the fmla pursuant to its section authority.although kimel and garrett reject the notion that congress may infer discrimination by the states from findings of discrimination,that rejection does not necessarily apply in a case such as this.neither kimel nor garrett involved legislation designed to remedy discrimination against a class of persons who receive heightened scrutiny under the equal protection clause.against a backdrop of extensive evidence of employment discrimination in the private sector based on leave policies,the more limited evidence of similar practices by state government serves to confirm the logical inference that state employment practices are similar to private sector practices.as the dissent observed in kazmier widmann,cir 
e vidence of private discrimination based on age has no probative value with respect to unconstitutional discrimination based on age by the states because it is so unlikely that the discrimination engaged in by private employers would be considered unconstitutional if engaged in by the states.with respect to race and gender,however,because of the significant likelihood that any discrimination by the states on those bases would be unconstitutional,evidence that such discrimination is widespread through the private sector may be sufficient.
