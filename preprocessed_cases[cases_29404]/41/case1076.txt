on a sunday morning in january of,amy lynn ford,a recovering alcoholic who also suffers from epilepsy,was arrested on a probation violation and taken to the grand traverse county jail in traverse city,michigan.that afternoon,ford had a seizure,fell from the top bunk of a bed in her cell,and sustained significant injuries to her right hip and right clavicle.ford subsequently brought suit against a number of jail officials and the county of grand traverse collectively referred to as the defendants.she claimed that the officials had exhibited deliberate indifference to her serious medical needs in violation of her constitutional rights under the eighth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution.ford also contended that the county policy or custom regarding the provision of medical care at the jail on weekends reflected deliberate indifference to her serious medical needs and had caused her injuries.
her case proceeded to trial.the jury found that none of the jail officials were deliberately indifferent to ford serious medical needs,but determined that the county policy regarding weekend medical care exhibited deliberate indifference to and was the proximate cause of ford injuries.it awarded her in damages.after the verdict was returned,the county brought two motions for judgment as a matter of law.the district court denied both motions.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
on the morning of sunday,january,ford was arrested for violating the terms of her probation for a prior offense and was transported to the grand traverse county jail.ford had been prescribed an medication,dilantin,to control her epilepsy,and had been advised by her physician not to drink alcohol while taking the drug.because she had been drinking on january and january,ford acknowledged that she had not taken her dilantin on the morning of her arrest.the defendants,moreover,introduced proof based on ford lack of memory,her physician testimony,and pharmacy records that she had not taken dilantin since at least the preceding week.
two nurses and a doctor are employed by the county to provide medical care for the inmates at the jail.one of the nurses is on duty full time during regular business hours on weekdays,and the nurse is on duty hours per week but makes her own schedule.the nurse is not required to be present at the jail on weekends or to notify the jail officials whether or not she will be at the jail on any particular day.one of the nurses,however,is either or at all times.
the county written policy states that if a new inmate claim s a need for regular medications,a member of the medical staff must be contacted for approval.jail officials are trained to contact medical personnel when a new inmate claims a need for medication,and the doctor and both nurses are authorized to consider and approve such a request.
during ford intake booking,deputy sheriff luke lansbach asked ford about her medical needs and completed a medical screening questionnaire.he noted on the form that ford had epilepsy,that she took dilantin,and that on that day she had not taken her medication.lansbach testified that he placed the form in the nurse inbox,but that he did not contact the nurse or the doctor because ford had not expressed an urgent need for the dilantin and because he believed that one of the nurses was coming to the jail that day.neither nurse,however,came to the jail on that sunday.
county sheriff robert hall,the jail administrator,testified at trial that although he was not the author of the county written jail policy,he had the authority to develop and change the policy as necessary.hall further stated that,in his opinion,lansbach decision to put ford medical screening questionnaire into the nurse inbox as opposed to promptly calling the nurse did not constitute a violation of the county written policy requiring that a member of the medical staff be contacted when an inmate claims a need for medication.
deputy sheriff sophia delonghi helped ford change from street clothes into jail attire and escorted ford to her cell.ford told delonghi that she was an epileptic and that she had not taken her medication.delonghi testified that on the way to ford cell,delonghi stopped and told the supervisor on duty,sergeant robert smith,that ford had not taken her medication that morning.when ford and delonghi arrived at the cell,ford again informed delonghi that she had not taken her seizure medication and also said that she needed a bottom bunk.
a bottom bunk was not available at that time.delonghi testified that she ordered another inmate to move and told ford to take the newly available bottom bunk.ford and one of her cellmates,however,did not recall delonghi making such an order.to the contrary,ford testified that an inmate had offered her a bottom bunk,but that she said n o,i fine,and proceeded to go to sleep in the top bunk.
deputy delonghi also said that when she left ford cell,she told sergeant smith and deputy michael johnson that ford had again asked for her meds and that both men indicated that they were aware of ford medical situation.but smith and johnson both denied any recollection of such a conversation.none of the jail officials in fact called the nurse or took other steps to procure dilantin for ford.later that afternoon,ford suffered a seizure and fell from the top bunk,severely injuring her right hip and right clavicle.
david wilcox,the jail physician,was the only expert to testify as to whether administering dilantin to ford on the morning of january,would have prevented her seizure that afternoon.the content and significance of his testimony have therefore been a source of much disagreement both at trial and now on appeal.ford attorney asked wilcox on direct examination if someone came in with absolutely no dilantin in their blood system and you gave them two caplets,would you not agree with me that in one to four hours they would have enough to inhibit seizures wilcox responded by saying that t hey would have enough to start inhibiting seizures emphasis added.
at that point,ford attorney confronted wilcox with his prior deposition testimony 
question by ford attorney at wilcox deposition how long generally does it take for dilantin to become effective to do its job and numb the brain 
answer if a patient does have any dilantin in their bloodstream it can take one to four hours to get it high enough.
question and after dilantin circulates through the body one to four hours,i take it there enough in the blood system to inhibit these seizures,correct 
answer there should be,yes.
question so it safe for me to assume that two pills for amy ford is effective for hours 
answer yes.
question and assuming there no dilantin in her system,it would take one to four hours to actually become effective.
rather than reading the answer that wilcox had given to the last question,ford attorney asked wilcox a question and your answer to the last quoted question was yes,is that right wilcox responded by saying my answer was yes and that was an error.
on by the county,wilcox testified that if a person with epilepsy had not had dilantin in their system for several days,the window that he had discussed might not be sufficient to inhibit seizures.wilcox also stated that,given the low level of dilantin in ford blood at the hospital after the seizure,he could not say to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that giving ford dilantin in the morning would have prevented her seizure that afternoon.
procedural background 
ford brought suit against delonghi,johnson,lansbach,smith,and the county.she claimed,pursuant to,that the jail officials had violated her eighth and fourteenth amendment rights to medical treatment by failing to ensure that she was given dilantin or to otherwise protect her from injuries due to her epilepsy.ford further alleged that the county policy and custom regarding the provision of weekend medical care at the jail had caused her injuries.
the case went to trial in may of.at the close of the second day of trial,before ford had rested her case but after all of her evidence had been proffered,the attorney for the defendants moved for a directed verdict pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.in,rule was amended to substitute the uniform term judgment as a matter of law in place of judgment notwithstanding the verdict and directed verdict.both the district court and the parties,however,have consistently employed the outdated term directed verdict.we will therefore do the same for the sake of convenience and clarity.
the defendants attorney asserted that ford had fail ed to make out a prima facie case against the county on a theory of deliberate indifference.in particular,he contended that ford had not shown a causal link between the county policy and the alleged constitutional deprivation,or a pattern of misconduct of which the county was aware.he also argued that each of the individual jail officials was entitled to qualified immunity and that,in any case,ford had failed to establish that any of the officials possessed a sufficiently culpable state of mind under the standard.the district court denied the motion,concluding that there is enough in plaintiff case to allow this to go to the jury.
at the close of ford case,the defendants attorney again moved for a directed verdict on the basis that ford had failed to show that receiving dilantin would have prevented her seizure,or that a seizure had been the cause of her fall.the district court denied this motion as well,reasoning that wilcox deposition testimony and the testimony of inmates who had observed ford fall was sufficient to permit a jury to find for ford on the causation issues raised.
at the close of all the evidence,the attorney for the defendants did not renew his motion for a directed verdict.the case instead proceeded with closing arguments and jury instructions,with the jury being given a verdict form that the defendants attorney had proposed and upon which the attorneys for the parties had agreed.that form asked a series of questions.the first question read was grand traverse county deliberately indifferent to the medical needs of the plaintiff through its policy or custom regarding weekend medical care if the jury answered that question affirmatively,it was instructed to determine whether the subject policy or custom was a proximate cause of the plaintiff injury.subsequent questions addressed whether each of the individual jail officials had been deliberately indifferent to ford medical needs and,if so,whether that official actions were a proximate cause of her injuries.finally,the jury was directed to assess actual and punitive damages,but only if it had answered y es to any of the above sets of questions relating to deliberate indifference and causation.
the jury found that although none of the individual jail officials had been deliberately indifferent to ford medical needs,the county policy exhibited deliberate indifference and was a proximate cause of her injuries.ford was then awarded in compensatory damages by the jury.after the verdict was read in the courtroom,the district court instructed ford to submit a judgment consistent with the jury verdict.
the county then intervened by filing two motions for judgment as a matter of law.it claimed that there was no evidence to support the jury finding that the county policy had caused ford injury,and the county could not be held liable in the absence of a finding that one of its jail officials had violated ford constitutional rights.
the district court denied both motions.with respect to the causation issue,the court concluded that wilcox deposition testimony was sufficient to support the jury finding that ford seizure would have been prevented if a nurse had been promptly contacted that day.the court also rejected the contention that liability could not attach to the county in the absence of a finding that any of the individual jail officials had committed a constitutional violation.in particular,the court noted that municipal liability could be premised either on the actions of unnamed parties,or the acts of several employees acting pursuant to a government policy or custom even where no individual action violates a plaintiff constitutional rights.the court explained that its denial of the county motion rest ed on these possibilities because the county had failed to specifically raise this legal theory in its motion for a directed verdict.furthermore,the court noted that the county had submitted the form,which allowed for a verdict against the county,regardless of the findings made as to the individual defendants.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
scope of the issues reviewable on appeal 
the county has raised two issues on appeal.first,it contends that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law,which motion was based on the theory that the county can not be held liable under in the absence of a constitutional violation by any of the individual jail officials.second,it claims that there was insufficient evidence to establish a causal link between the county policy or custom and ford injuries.
ford,in turn,argues that the issues raised by the county in this appeal are not properly before us.first,she claims that the county waived its right to bring either of its motions for judgment as a matter of law by failing to renew its motion for a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence.she also contends that the county waived its argument that municipal liability is improper as a matter of law by failing to specifically raise the claim in its motion for a directed verdict,and submitting the form that allowed for a finding of county liability irrespective of the liability of the individual jail officials,thus inviting the alleged error about which the county now complains.
the question of waiver is a mixed question of law and fact.we review any determination of underlying facts under the clearly erroneous standard of review,and make a de novo determination of whether those facts constitute legal waiver.karam sagemark consulting,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the county failure to renew its rule a motion at the close of all the evidence 
the amendment to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure dispensed with the requirement that a party must renew its rule a motion at the close of all the evidence in order to preserve the ability to bring a motion for judgment as a matter of law.but those amendments were not in effect at the time of trial in ford case.thus,as a technical matter,the county was still required to renew its motion after the close of all the evidence.see a homecare,medshares mgmt.group,cir a court can consider a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict only if the moving party has previously made a motion for a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence.emphasis in original internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court in the present case,however,did not rest its denial of the county motions on this ground.to the contrary,the court orders filed on december and december,quote the amended language of rule b and explicitly state that a motion for judgment as a matter of law can only be made as a renewal of a motion made before the case was submitted to the jury.citing.a b emphasis added.a review of ford responses to the county motions,moreover,shows that ford did not raise this particular waiver argument in the district court.ford contention on this point,therefore,is itself subject to waiver.see united states universal mgmt,cir because the issue was not raised in the district court below,appellants have waived their right to argue the point on appeal.see also marshall columbia lea reg l,cir concluding that the plaintiff had waived the ability to challenge the adequacy of the defendant rule a motion by failing to raise the issue until oral argument on appeal.for these reasons,we will excuse the county failure to renew its motion at the close of all the evidence.
the county waived its argument that the exoneration of individual jail officials bars a finding of municipal liability 
ford next two arguments regarding the appropriate scope of this appeal relate to the county claim that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the jury found that no individual jail official had acted with deliberate indifference to ford serious medical needs.we will consider each argument in turn.
submission of the verdict form 
ford relies on harvis roadway express,cir,to support her contention that because the county proposed the form that allowed for a finding of municipal liability in the absence of individual liability,any claimed error after the fact was invited by the county.in harvis,this court explained that 
t he doctrine of invited error is a branch of the doctrine of waiver by which courts prevent a party from inducing an erroneous ruling and later seeking to profit from the legal consequences of having the ruling set aside having induced the court to rely on a particular erroneous proposition of law or fact,a party in the normal case may not at a later stage of the case use the error to set aside the immediate consequences of the error.
the county responds by arguing that the doctrine is inapplicable because the form used in the present case did not constitute an error in and of itself.rather,the county contends that it was a perfectly acceptable form,but that a fter a finding by the jury that the individual officers conduct did not amount to deliberate indifference,the court should have determined as a matter of law that the county was not liable.the error,according to the county,was not in the jury factual findings,but in the district court failure to enter judgment for the county as a matter of law based on those findings.
we agree with ford light of the county current position,that municipal liability must always be premised on a constitutional violation by an individual official the verdict form should not have been structured in a way that permitted the jury to make findings relating to the liability of the municipality before,and entirely independent of,the findings regarding the individual officials.but we decline to conclude that the county necessarily invited the error complained of as a result of this inartful drafting and therefore waived its argument relating to the lack of individual liability because,even if we were to accept ford argument,we would nevertheless be free to consider whether the judgment that resulted from the form constituted a plain error.see reynolds green,cir explaining that although s ilence after instructions,including instructions on the form of the verdict to be returned by the jury,typically constitutes a waiver of any objections,this court has made an exception to the principle of in cases of plain error internal quotation marks omitted see also fryman fed.crop ins,cir explaining that because the doctrine of invited error is a branch of the doctrine of waiver,appellate courts have discretion to deviate from the rule when application of the rule would result in a manifest injustice.in any event,our disposition of ford second waiver argument discussed below renders a resolution of this claim unnecessary.
b.the county failed to present its legal theory in its rule a motion 
ford alternative contention is that the county failed to preserve its argument that municipal liability must be premised on an individual employee liability by failing to specifically raise the argument in its rule a motion.her argument is based on the proposition that a motion for judgment as a matter of law is not available at anyone request on an issue not brought before the court prior to submission of the case to the jury.am.foreign ins.bolt,cir see also.b permitting a party to renew an earlier request for judgment as a matter of law.the advisory committee note to the amendment to rule reiterates this requirement and explains the reasons for it 
because the rule b motion is only a renewal of the preverdict motion,it can be granted only on grounds advanced in the preverdict motion.the earlier motion informs the opposing party of the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence and affords a clear opportunity to provide additional evidence that may be available.the earlier motion also alerts the court to the opportunity to simplify the trial by resolving some issues,or even all issues,without submission to the jury.
limiting the availability of a judgment as a matter of law also ensures that the plaintiff seventh amendment right to a jury trial is adequately protected by requiring that parties raise important issues before the case is submitted to the jury.am.foreign ins,at emphasis in original see also marshall columbia lea reg l,cir noting that one of the purposes of rule is to protect the seventh amendment right to trial by jury alteration and internal quotation marks omitted ins.of,cir explaining that a party failing to timely file a motion for a directed verdict is foreclosed from bringing a motion because i t is too late to complain of the submission of an issue to the jury after a litigant has taken a chance on what the jury will do and after the jury has resolved the issue against him internal quotation marks omitted.
relying on these legal authorities,ford argues that the county should be barred from claiming that municipal liability can not attach because at no point before the case was submitted to the jury did the county ever argue that its own liability was contingent on a constitutional violation by an individual jail official.the county responds by contending that its motion for a directed verdict was specific enough to preserve the objection raised in its motion for judgment as a matter of law.on this score the county relies on this court decision in kusens pascal,cir,where the court acknowledged that although a motion for judgment may not advance additional grounds that were not raised in the motion,a party is not required to state the grounds for judgment with technical precision.
in kusens,the employer made an oral motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the proof,arguing that the employee claim should be dismissed because the employee had failed to argue or even reference the claim during the trial.id.at.the district court denied the motion,but subsequently granted the employer motion in which the employer argued more specifically that the employee claim under ohio law must fail because he had failed to plead or prove one of the necessary elements of the claim,that he was an employee.id.at.
on appeal,this court rejected the employee contention that the employer had failed to raise the issue of employment in its motion.id.at.the court called the issue a close question,but explained that 
a lthough rule a requires a motion for judgment as a matter of law to state the specific grounds,the rule does not define how specific the grounds must be.because the requirement that a rule a motion must precede a rule b motion is harsh in any circumstance,a rule a motion should not be reviewed narrowly but rather in light of the purpose of the rules to secure a just,speedy,and inexpensive determination of the case.accordingly,where rule a,providing notice to the court and opposing counsel of any deficiencies in the opposing party case prior to sending it to the been met,courts usually take a liberal view of what constitutes a motion sufficient to support a motion.
id.at citations omitted.
the kusens court analogized the case before it to the ruling in rockport pharmacy,digital simplistics,cir,where the eighth circuit concluded,in a tort action,that a defendant generalized argument in a preverdict motion to exclude the use of a contractual breach to establish a duty of care was sufficient to preserve its argument in a motion that state law prohibited tort liability for purely economic losses.in both cases,reasoned the kusens court,the motions elaborated more specifically on essential element s of the claims that had been raised in the preverdict motions.kusens,at.
the county contends that the rationale of kusens defeats ford waiver argument.according to the county,the argument that it can not be held liable because there was no constitutional violation by the individual jail officials is simply a more specific version of its general argument made in its motion for a directed verdict that there was insufficient evidence to establish deliberate indifference on behalf of the county.l ike the defendant in kusens,defendant in this case simply restate d the identical argument raised in its motion in more precise terms.quoting kusens,at alterations in original.
we are not persuaded by the county analogy.true enough,the county argument should have been adequate to provid e notice to the court and opposing counsel of any deficiencies in ford case with respect to the standard.but unlike kusens and rockport,where the issues discussed in the motions related back to the same legal theory raised in the preverdict motions,the only similarity between the two motions in the present case was that,broadly speaking,both challenged the liability of the county.see conseco fin.servicing am.mortgage,cir concluding that the defendant had failed to preserve an argument related to a damages award flowing from a claim raised only in a rule b motion because such a motion could not be used as a vehicle to introduce a legal theory not distinctly articulated in its motion for a directed verdict internal quotation marks omitted.were we to conclude that the county preverdict motion in this case constitutes the requisite specific grounds for the issue raised in its motion,that requirement would as a practical matter cease to provide any limitation at all.
moreover,the trial transcript contains no mention of this legal argument whatsoever,despite the county present contention that the legal theory advanced in its motion is inextricably intertwined with the argument raised at trial.not only did the county never engage in a colloquy with the district court or opposing counsel on this point,but it also never requested that the jury be instructed that municipal liability was dependent upon a finding that the individual jail officials committed a constitutional violation.see conseco fin.servicing,at concluding that the defendant had developed the legal theory raised in its rule b motion only after the jury verdict because it failed to object to the form,offered no jury instructions explaining the legal theory advanced in its motion,and made no substantive objection to the relevant jury instruction.for these reasons,we conclude that the county has waived this argument and we therefore decline to address its merits.
standard of review 
our review is thus limited to the county claim that the district court should have granted its motion for judgment as a matter of law on the basis that the evidence was insufficient to show a direct causal link between the county policy or custom of providing limited weekend medical care and ford injuries.ford,in turn,contends that the county is impermissibly attempting to raise new issues on appeal because the only issue presented to the district court in its motion for judgment as a matter of law challenged the admission of wilcox deposition testimony as substantive evidence.she also argues that this was the only aspect of the county motion addressed by the district court.
a review of the record,however,reveals that the county clearly challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a finding that the county custom or policy had caused ford injuries in both its preverdict and motions.in its second motion for a directed verdict at the close of ford case,the defendants attorney argued that ford had failed to establish a prima facie case on causation.ford correctly notes that the county challenged the admission of wilcox deposition testimony as substantive evidence in its motion,but it also argued more generally that the evidence at trial failed to support plaintiff theory of causation.indeed,the county brief in support of its motion is almost identical to the causation section of the brief that it filed with this court.ford also correctly points out that the district court characterized the county motion as raising only the admissibility question,but the district court apparently misconstrued the county motion in this regard.
because the county properly preserved this issue in its preverdict and motions,we review the county claim de novo.see radvansky city of olmsted falls,cir we review a district court denial of a rule b motion de novo,applying the same deferential standard as the district court.a motion for judgment as a matter of law may be granted only if in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,there is no genuine issue of material fact for the jury,and reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion,in favor of the moving party.sharpe cureton,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,t he motion may not be granted unless reasonable minds could not differ as to the conclusions to be drawn from the evidence.an appeals court is not to weigh the evidence,pass on the credibility of witnesses,or substitute its judgment for that of the jury.bowman corr.of,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
municipal liability under 
section provides a civil enforcement mechanism for all inmates who suffer constitutional injuries at the hands of a ny person acting under color of state law.ford legal theory was that both the jail officials and the county were deliberately indifferent to her serious medical needs,in violation of the eighth and fourteenth amendments.deliberate indifference by prison officials to an inmate serious medical needs constitutes unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain in violation of the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.miller calhoun county,cir quoting estelle gamble,d.the eighth amendment,by its terms,applies only to inmates.id.pretrial detainees,however,are guaranteed the equivalent right to adequate medical treatment by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,and are subject to the same standard of care.id.
mere negligence or malpractice is insufficient to establish an eighth amendment violation.bowman,at citing estelle,at.instead,a prison official can not be found liable for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,and he must also draw the inference.farmer brennan,d.
the objective component of the standard requires that the inmate have a sufficiently serious medical need such that she is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm.blackmore kalamazoo county,cir quoting farmer,at.in addition,the inmate must show that the prison official possessed a sufficiently culpable state of mind deliberate indifference requires a degree of culpability greater than mere negligence,but less than acts or omissions for the very purpose of causing harm or with knowledge that harm will result.miller,at quoting farmer,at.
the jury in the present case determined that none of the individual officers had met this standard of deliberate indifference.that determination is not before us on appeal.the standard to which individual officers are held,however,is relevant to the ultimate determination of whether a municipality can be held liable under.see bd.of county comm rs brown,d explaining,in the context of a claim,that i n any suit,the plaintiff must establish the state of mind required to prove the underlying violation.
a body politic is a person within the meaning of.miller,at citing monell dep t of soc,d.but a municipality is not subject to liability pursuant to on a theory of respondeat superior.monell,at.instead,it is when execution of a government policy or custom,whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy,inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under.id.at.a plaintiff bringing a claim against a municipality must therefore identify the policy or custom that caused her injury 
locating a policy ensures that a municipality is held liable only for those deprivations resulting from the decisions of its duly constituted legislative body or of those officials whose acts may fairly be said to be those of the municipality.si
