james ripley appeals the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of on his due process claim.are former or current administrators or board members of wyoming medical center,along with wyoming medical center itself,and are hereinafter collectively referred to as wyoming medical center.wyoming medical center denial of ripley membership to the medical staff was the genesis of ripley claim we have jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm.
ripley is a dentist,with additional training in anesthesiology and as an oral and maxillofacial surgeon.he does not hold an or degree,and is licensed through the wyoming board of dentistry.ripley moved to wyoming and began practicing with two other oral surgeons.prior to moving to wyoming,ripley practiced the specialty of oral and maxillofacial surgery and received admitting privileges in many areas of the united states.
wyoming medical center medical staff bylaws have qualification requirements for membership,which state that only physicians may be members of the medical staff.a physician is defined as a person holding an or degree.wyoming medical center bylaws also state that only members of the medical staff may have admitting privileges.as a result,allied health professionals are not permitted by the bylaws to independently admit patients or perform histories and physicals although they can receive clinical privileges at the hospital.the bylaws also provide that,unlike a member of the medical staff,an allied health professional clinical privileges may be terminated at any point by the chief of staff,the executive committee,or the administration of the hospital without a hearing.allied health professionals can not be a member of committees of the medical staff or participate in quality of care or peer review issues.
wyoming medical center allowed ripley to apply for clinical privileges as an allied health professional.on his application for privileges,ripley wrote in longhand that he was applying for admission h p history and physical privileges.at.ripley was granted surgical privileges by wyoming medical center,and his application was approved as requested.id.at.it is disputed whether ripley was given full admitting and history and physical privileges with his grant of clinical privileges.for several months after ripley was granted surgical privileges,however,he admitted his own patients and performed his own histories and physicals.
about a year after ripley was granted privileges,macguire,the chief of surgery at wyoming medical center,wrote to ripley and informed him that he did not have admitting privileges because he was not a member of the medical staff.a subsequent meeting of the trauma committee involved a discussion of ripley privileges,and a vote that only general surgeons and family practitioners should be allowed to admit trauma patients.ripley believed macguire had wrongfully canceled his privileges,and he began to seek changes to the bylaws to allow him membership and privileges equivalent to those of physicians.shortly thereafter,ripley was informed that the medical staff was not interested in pursuing changes to the bylaws.
ripley spent periods of the next year and a half lobbying for changes to the bylaws.different committees within wyoming medical center considered ripley proposed bylaws changes,but ultimately recommended no change,based on the belief that it would be better for patient care to have physician oversight for oral surgeons.wyoming medical center informed ripley that if he needed to admit a patient and have someone sign off on a history and physical,wyoming medical center had hour physician coverage for that purpose.through this process,a medical doctor would be present to address any medical problems associated with ripley patients,which may extend beyond jaw or maxillofacial problems.ripley ultimately brought the present action,asserting in part that wyoming statute gave him a property right in membership to the medical staff of the wyoming medical center and that the wyoming medical center had deprived him of that property right without due process.

ripley contends that wyoming statute gives him a property interest in membership to the medical staff of wyoming medical center.section states,in its entirety 
any hospital owned by the state,or any hospital district,county or city thereof,and any hospital whose support,either in whole or in part,is derived from public funds,shall be open for practice to doctors of medicine,doctors of osteopathy,doctors of chiropractic,doctors of dentistry and podiatrists,who are licensed to practice medicine or surgery,chiropractic,dentistry or podiatry in this state.
provided,however,that these hospitals by appropriate bylaws shall promulgate reasonable and uniform rules and regulations covering staff admissions and staff privileges.
admission shall not be predicated solely upon the type of degree of the applicant and the governing body shall consider the competency and character of each applicant.
there is no question that wyoming medical center is a hospital whose support is derived from public funds,and that section is broadly applicable the parties dispute centers on the statute further interpretation.ripley contends that as a doctor of dentistry,section requires that wyoming medical center be open for practice without solely relying on his type of degree,and that wyoming medical center must instead consider the competency and character of each applicant.ripley then argues that two cases clearly establish that he has a property interest in membership to the medical staff of wyoming medical center,citing paravecchio mem l hosp.of laramie county,overruled in part on other grounds by torres wyoming,and garrison bd.of trs.of mem l hosp.of laramie county.aplt.br.at.
ripley is correct that the wyoming supreme court has addressed similar issues that bear upon the same subject matter addressed by section.the specific holdings of these cases,however,do not support ripley claim.in paravecchio,the wyoming supreme court held that,although the right to practice medicine was a property right,it was a conditional property right,and under rational basis review,the state had a legitimate interest in regulating the healthcare profession.at.paravecchi
