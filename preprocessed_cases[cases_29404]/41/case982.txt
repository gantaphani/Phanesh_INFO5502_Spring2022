patel,filed suit in district court against midland memorial hospital and several of its doctors collectively the defendants for claims arising out of the hospital summary suspension of all of his clinical privileges in january specifically,patel alleged that the defendants,by participating in the suspension of his privileges denied him due process in violation of engaged in racial discrimination in violation of engaged in an illegal monopoly and attempted to monopolize in violation of and.bus.ann.vernon and engaged in conduct that constituted breach of contract,defamation,and interference with contractual relationships.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on all of patel claims.patel now appeals on the ground that genuine issues of material fact exist with respect to all of his claims.the defendants arguing that under the health care quality improvement act of hcqia,they are immune from all of patel claims,except for his civil rights claims,and are entitled to reasonable attorneys fees.
patel is a cardiologist who specializes in invasive and interventional cardiology he joined the staff of midland memorial hospital midland,a public hospital,in.while at midland,he continuously expanded his practice by obtaining new clinical privileges and increasing the volume of procedures he performed.by the,he performed one of the highest numbers of cardiac interventions of the hospital staff.patel also expanded his practice outside of midland by maintaining a practice at odessa medical center and opening his own cardiac cath labs and primary care clinics,at times competing with midland and members of its staff.for fifteen years,patel appears to have practiced successfully without any significant problems.
two incidents in and,however,drew the attention of midland medical executive committee mec to patel practice.in november,the mec investigated an altercation between patel and a nurse in front of a patient just before a procedure.questions were raised as to whether patel properly secured the patient consent to continue with the procedure and whether he waited for a new nurse to arrive before beginning the procedure.the mec ultimately suspended patel clinical privileges for fourteen days and ordered him to undergo a behavioral evaluation.
six months later,the mec received its second complaint regarding patel practice.the chairman of midland department of radiology reported to the mec that patel had an inordinate number of catastrophic outcomes among his recent cases of noncardiac peripheral vascular interventions.the mec directed an ad hoc committee of eight cardiology,vascular surgery,and radiology physicians to review patel problematic cases.after reviewing three cases handled by patel in the preceding eight months,the committee reported several concerns to the mec.specifically,the committee cited concerns regarding patel technical performance of procedures,his decisionmaking,and the accuracy of his documentation.the mec then met to discuss the cases and the committee report,and voted unanimously to revoke patel noncardiac peripheral privileges.while a hearing was pending,the mec sought independent review of three of patel cases by two outside experts.both confirmed that the revocation was appropriate 
at the same meeting during which it revoked patel peripheral privileges,the mec charged the cardiovascular committee with reviewing patel diagnostic and interventional cardiac procedures to ensure that a similar pattern is not emerging.in response,stephen brown,chair of the cardiology committee,reviewed the last six fatalities in cases handled by patel.in a report made to john foster,chairman of the mec brown noted several concerns with each of the cases and concluded that patel management of them warranted further investigation.he recommended sending the cases for outside review to avoid any issues of bias on the part of patel competitors.as a result,foster sent ten of patel cardiology cases to richard lange,director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at the university of texas southwestern medical center at dallas,for outside review.
while lange conducted his outside review,the cardiovascular committee continued its inside review.at its meeting to review the cases of cardiologists at the hospital,the committee reviewed patel recent cases and noted a high concentration of severe complications.the committee then forwarded a report to foster stating that patel was not operating in a safe fashion while performing certain coronary procedures and that the situation was very dangerous.the report again recommended outside review by an unbiased third party,and potentially a reevaluation of patel privileges depending on the outcome of that report.
foster then requested that the medical control committee mcc review the cardiovascular committee reports regarding patel cardiology cases.the mcc met to discuss the cases,but decided to wait for the results of lange review,which were expected within the week,before acting.one week later,lange reported to foster that six of the ten patients whose cases he reviewed died as a direct result of an interventional procedure that was performed by patel a without clear indication,b with poor technical skills,or c in coronary vessels poorly suited for the procedure.lange also found problems in the cases that suggested poor medical judgment.two days later,the mcc reviewed lange report and voted to recommend the suspension of all of patel privileges.upon the mcc request,the mec met to consider the evidence and the recommendation for suspension.after deliberation,the mec unanimously approved the mcc recommendation that patel privileges be summarily suspended 
patel was notified of his suspension by letter.the mec then informed him that he had a right to a hearing under midland fair hearing plan.patel immediately requested a full due process hearing and the hospital offered to provide one two weeks later.thereafter,an ad hoc hearing committee hearing committee held ten meetings in which patel and the hospital submitted documentary evidence and testified regarding the events leading up to the suspension and the hospital continued concerns about the quality of patel practice.after hearing testimony from eight physicians and reviewing over exhibits,the hearing committee ultimately concluded that patel was not a danger to his patients.instead,the hearing committee faulted patel inadequate his failure to note on patients records major complications that occurred during the questionable appearance of his cases.as a result,the hearing committee recommended that patel clinical privileges be restored,but that he be placed on probation for six months to ensure that he prepare timely and accurate medical records for each of his patients at midland.although the hearing committee recommended restoration of his privileges,it also held that there were reasonable grounds for the action taken by the various doctors and hospital committees reviewing patel cases prior to the suspension.in addition,the hearing committee held that the participating doctors acted in reasonable belief that such action was in furtherance of quality health care,and in reasonable belief that action was warranted by the facts known after a reasonable effort to obtain the facts.finally,the hearing committee held that brown,miller,and authors of three of the reports reviewing patel cases acted at all times without malice,without fraudulent or wrongful intent,and without any ulterior or improper motive.
after his privileges were restored,patel filed suit against midland,four of the eleven members of the mec who voted to suspend him,the three cardiologists reviewing his cases on behalf of the cardiovascular committee,the permian cardiology group,and memorial heart and vascular institute specifically,patel alleged that,by contributing to his suspension,the defendants denied him due process in violation of engaged in racial discrimination in violation of engaged in an illegal monopoly and attempted to monopolize in violation of and.bus.ann.and engaged in conduct that constituted breach of contract,defamation,and interference with contractual relationships.the district court dismissed all of patel claims on summary judgment,but failed to reach the defendants claim for immunity and attorneys fees under hcqia.both sides now appeal.

on appeal,patel contends that he has presented sufficient evidence to create genuine issues of material of fact with respect to all of his claims.after reviewing the evidence in the record and the relevant law,we disagree.we address each claim separately below.
patel first contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on his procedural due process claim specifically,he argues that,as a matter of law,due process required that he receive notice and some opportunity to be heard on the allegations against him before his clinical privileges could be suspended because midland and the doctors deprived him of such process prior to his january suspension,he argues that he is entitled to relief under 
patel is correct that due process generally requires notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the deprivation of a protected property interest.see,cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d.it is well settled,however,that p rocedural due process is a flexible concept whose contours are shaped by the nature of the individual and the state interests in a particular deprivation.caine hardy,cir en banc gilbert,at.in some cases,where a state must act quickly,or where it would be impractical to provide predeprivation process,postdeprivation process is enough to satisfy the requirements of due process.gilbert,at.
we have previously considered en banc the process due a physician where patient safety was considered to be at risk.in caine hardy,an anesthesiologist at a public hospital was suspended after an investigation of the death of one of his patients revealed serious deficiencies in his performance.caine,at.believing that caine posed a danger to his patients,the hospital suspended him without first affording him a formal hearing.we held that,under such exigent circumstances,where the safety of the public is at risk,an adequate remedy satisfies the requirements of due process.caine,at.
in the case before us,the mec had ample reason to believe that patel methods posed a danger to patient safety.as an initial matter,concern for patel cardiology interventions developed in connection with an investigation of deficiencies in his peripheral intervention practice and a suspension of those privileges.the mec then initiated an investigation of patel cardiology practice to protect against similar dangers.at the time the mec voted to suspend patel privileges,it had before it a report from brown asserting serious concerns with patel performance a report from the cardiovascular committee finding a high concentration of severe complications in patel recent cases an outside review from lange concluding that six of the ten patients whose cases he reviewed died as a direct result of an interventional procedure performed by patel and the recommendation of the mcc,after independently reviewing the cases discussed in the cardiovascular committee report,that patel privileges be suspended immediately.in light of the consistent findings before the mec,the mec reasonably concluded that it had no choice but to act quickly to protect patient safety because process was not practical under these circumstances,patel due process rights were not violated.
patel contends that caine does not resolve the question of whether he received adequate process in this case for two reasons.first,he argues that the summary judgment record includes substantial evidence that he did not pose an imminent danger to patients at the time of his suspension.specifically,he notes that he did not have a significant malpractice record,that his overall rate for cardiology intervention was the lowest at midland in and,and that five experts defended his technical skills and past performance at his hearing.he also notes that the hearing committee unanimously recommended that his privileges be reinstated.at the very least,patel contends,this evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact for summary judgment purposes.
although we acknowledge the evidence presented by patel that he was not actually dangerous at the time of his suspension,we believe patel focuses on the wrong issue.when determining the amount of process constitutionally due patel prior to the january suspension of his privileges,the key question is not whether patel was actually a danger,but whether the mec had reasonable grounds for suspending him as a danger.gilbert,at.stating that the purpose of process,assuming it is even required,is to assure that there are reasonable grounds to support the suspension.we have already determined that,based on the evidence before it,the mec had such grounds.the fact that patel was later able to produce evidence to rebut the reports before the mec does not call into question the reasonableness of the mec conclusion at the time it voted to suspend him.as a result,patel attempt to create a fact issue with respect to whether he was actually dangerous fails.
second,patel argues that even if we find that he was a danger at the time of his suspension,caine requires more process than he was actually afforded.specifically,he notes that the physician in caine had some notice of the investigation against him and that he was able to attend two informal meetings relating to the charges prior to his suspension.patel contends that,according to the rule set forth in caine,he was entitled to similar treatment before his suspension.
we disagree with patel reading of caine.although patel is correct that the doctor in caine happened to receive some notice of the charges against him prior to his suspension,caine did not create a process requirement where patient safety is at risk.on the contrary,caine makes clear that n ot even an informal hearing must precede a deprivation undertaken to protect the public safety.caine,at.
because,under the particular circumstances of this case,prompt action was necessary to secure patient safety,we conclude that patel received all the process he was constitutionally due.as a result,the district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants on this issue 
in his second point on appeal,patel argues that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment to the defendants on his race discrimination claim.specifically,patel argues that genuine issues of material fact exist as to the real reason for his suspension.according to patel,the defendants did not suspend him because he was dangerous,but rather because he was indian.as a result,he argues that he is entitled to relief under 
the test for discrimination claims under and is the same as the test for discrimination claims under title vii.pratt city of houston,cir.to survive a summary judgment motion,the plaintiff must first present a prima facie case of discrimination.see id.at.if established,a prima facie case raises an inference of discrimination,and the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse decision.id.at.if the defendant presents such a reason,then the inference disappears,and the plaintiff must offer evidence that the proffered reason is a pretext for racial discrimination.id.
assuming arguendo that patel has presented a prima facie case of discrimination,midland and its doctors have proffered a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for his suspension.specifically,they contend that his privileges were suspended because of concerns for patient safety.thus,in order to survive summary judgment,patel must proffer sufficient evidence of pretext to create a question of fact for the jury that race,rather than patient safety,was the real reason for his suspension.id.
patel first attempts to show pretext by presenting evidence of what he alleges is a pattern of discrimination against him by midland and its doctors.according to patel,his january suspension was only the latest example of the aggressive and unfair competition waged against him from the time he joined midland.in the early,he notes an incident during which the hospital declined his offer to open a cardiac cath lab.according to patel,the hospital former ceo stated that he would never do it with a foreign doctor.the hospital later opened a cath lab with a white doctor.throughout the,patel contends that midland repeatedly took steps to expand its operations to directly compete with,and impede the development of,his practice 
these instances of competition do not create a question of fact regarding pretext in this case.as an initial matter,patel fails to offer any evidence linking his suspension to these earlier events.more importantly,even if patel could connect these events to his suspension,he still fails to create a question of fact for the jury that race motivated his suspension.see price fed.exp,cir requiring evidence of pretext supporting an inference that racial discrimination was the real reason for the employment decision pratt,at after a discrimination case reaches the pretext stage,the question for summary judgment is whether a rational fact finder could find that the employer discriminated against the plaintiffs on the basis of race.emphasis added.with only one exception,patel fails to present any evidence connecting any of midland competitive moves to racial animus.the only instance cited by patel that might provide evidence of racial the former ceo of midland declined to open a cath lab with a foreign doctor took place more than a decade before his suspension.the former ceo who allegedly made the statement is not a party to this case and does not appear from the record to have had any involvement in patel suspension.based on this evidence,no rational factfinder could conclude that patel was suspended on account of his race 
patel also attempts to show pretext three racist comments made by members of midland staff during the late.first,in either or,patel alleges that miller referred to him twice as a sand nigger and stated that he was probably parking his camel.miller then scheduled one of his patients ahead of one of patel patients for a procedure.miller later wrote the cardiovascular committee report criticizing patel handling of cases and describing him as very dangerous.second,in or,patel alleges that another person at midland who was probably a cardiologist made the following statement patel is nothing but a god damn indian quack and i want him out of here.i want his ass out of here.finally,soon after the second comment was made,an administrator allegedly stated,after hearing a complaint about the room conditions of one of patel patients,that he did care about that.
these statements also fail to create a fact issue regarding the reason for patel suspension.specifically,patel has not shown that these statements are more than stray remarks.see wallace methodist hosp,cir applying stray remarks doctrine where evidence of pretext was weak.we recently explained the stray remarks doctrine in rubinstein adm rs of the tulane educ.fund 
i n order for comments in the workplace to provide sufficient evidence of discrimination,they must be related to the protected class of persons of which the plaintiff is a member proximate in time to the adverse employment decision made by an individual with authority over the employment decision at issue and related to the employment decision at issue.
cir quoting brown csc logic,cir.the comments cited by patel fail to meet these criteria for several reasons.
first,we note that miller alleged statements were made two or more years before patel was suspended.although they are directed at patel indian descent,they do not relate to any plans to investigate his practice or suspend his privileges.see brown,at comments that are vague and remote in time are insufficient to establish discrimination.internal quotations and citations omitted.moreover,miller had no authority over the decision to suspend patel.see nichols loral vought,cir to be probative,allegedly discriminatory statements must be made by the relevant decision maker.miller role in patel suspension was limited to the report he drafted on behalf of brown and the cardiovascular committee,which recommended outside review of patel cases.miller was not a member of the body that voted to suspend was he a member of the body that recommended suspension.finally,the statements made by the unidentified speaker and the administrator can not support an inference of discrimination.they do not appear to be related to patel suspension,nor can they be linked to an individual with authority over patel suspension 
because patel has failed to present sufficient evidence of pretext from which a rational factfinder could infer racial discrimination,the district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants on this issue 
patel next argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants on his federal and state antitrust claims.see.bus.ann.specifically,he argues that his suspension was the product of a conspiracy to monopolize the midland market for the performance of interventional and invasive cardiology services.according to patel,the defendants suspended him so that they could succeed to his market share and block the further expansion of his the opening of a new hospital to compete with midland.patel contends that the defendants actions caused injuries redressable by the antitrust laws because they essentially removed him from the market for eleven months,led to higher costs and fewer options for consumers,and delayed his plans to open a competing hospital.
to support his antitrust claim,patel cites the same pattern of competition that he relied on in connection with his discrimination claim.see infra note and accompanying text.according to patel,after the defendants previous attempts to block the expansion of his practice failed,they resorted to directly attacking his clinical privileges.in addition to past examples of aggressive competition,patel once again argues that the fact that he was not a danger further illustrates that his suspension was a sham undertaken to destroy his reputation and practice.finally,patel notes that at least some of his,brown and miller,both members of the permian cardiology cardiologists at midland who directly competed with his cardiology practice.
the district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants on patel antitrust claims for three reasons.first,patel has failed to present sufficient evidence from which a rational factfinder could conclude that he was suspended for anticompetitive reasons.to begin,the mere fact that patel and midland competed in the past does not itself support a finding that his suspension was a sham.this is particularly true where,as here,the record supports the hospital reasonable belief that patel was a danger to patients at the time of his suspension moreover,patel complaint that his direct competitors participated in his investigation is of little consequence here.it is inevitable in any peer review process that a physician competitors will at some point be involved in the process.as patel himself implicitly concedes,only specialists from the same field can fairly assess a physician cases finally,we note that the defendants here took several steps to ensure that the quality of its peer review process was not tainted by competitive bias.miller and brown,though critical of patel cases,both recommended outside review before taking action against patel.the hospital followed these recommendations and sought an outside review by lange.in addition,midland procedures provided for review by doctors of various disciplines within the hospital.furthermore,patel competitors did not control the ultimate decision to suspend his privileges 
second,patel antitrust claims fail as a matter of law because he has not alleged a cognizable antitrust injury.see brunswick pueblo,d plaintiffs must prove antitrust injury,which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.patel suspension did not eliminate him as a competitor.he still continued to treat many of his patients at another facility during the time of his suspension moreover,his suspension did not permanently block his plans to open a new hospital,but at best delayed them.
third,the local government antitrust act of lgaa,and its texas counterpart,bar patel from recovering antitrust damages from midland and its doctors acting in their official capacities.see.bus.ann.g vernon supp.the lgaa provides,in relevant part 
no damages,interest on damages,costs or attorney fees may be recovered for violations of antitrust laws in any claim against a person based on any official action directed by a local government,or official or employee thereof acting in an official capacity.
a.because it is undisputed that midland is a political subdivision of the state of texas,and that the doctors in this suit were acting as agents of the hospital when investigating patel cases,they are immune from antitrust liability 
lastly,patel argues that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment to the defendants on his three state law of contract,tortious interference with contract relations,and defamation.we disagree.
first,patel argues that midland bylaws constituted a contract between midland and its doctors that was breached when he was suspended without first being afforded process.specifically,patel argues that,because he was not actually a danger,midland bylaws required that he be afforded notice and a hearing prior to the deprivation of his privileges.even assuming the existence of a contract in this case,summary judgment was still proper on this claim because midland bylaws were not violated.although patel is correct that midland bylaws generally provide for notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the deprivation of privileges,that is not the case where,as here,patient safety is deemed to be at risk.midland bylaws specifically authorize summary suspension whenever a practitioner conduct requires that immediate action be taken to prevent immediate danger to patients.
second,patel claims in vague terms that the defendants defamed him by disseminating false and defamatory per se publications to third parties.specifically,he argues that these publications falsely stated that the summary suspension was justified to protect patient safety.because we have already concluded that the mec had reasonable grounds for concluding that patel was a danger and thus that his summary suspension was justified under the circumstances,summary judgment was proper on this claim.civ.prac.ann.vernon the truth of the statement in the publication on which an action for libel is based is a defense to the action.
third,patel claims that the defendants,by illegally suspending him,interfered with his business and contractual relations with the hospital,as well as with his business relationships with other physicians,patients,and insurance carriers.this claim also fails.to begin,we have already determined that patel suspension was not illegal.moreover,we note that it is undisputed that midland,through its agents,had a duty to engage in peer review of its physicians.thus,as the district court correctly concluded,any contractual interference caused by midland exercise of this right with respect to patel was justified.see friendswood dev.mcdade,a party is justified in interfering with another contract if it exercises its own legal rights or a good faith claim to a colorable legal right,even though that claim ultimately proves to be mistaken.
finally,we note the defendants contention that they are immune to all of patel claims,except for his civil rights claims,under the health care quality improvement act and the texas peer review statutes.see hcqia,providing immunity from damages to any person participating in a professional review action when the proceeding meets certain statutory requirements texas medical practice act.ann.vernon.health safety code ann.vernon providing immunity to members and agents of medical peer review committees absent a showing of malice.in addition,the defendants argue that both the federal and the state statutes entitle them to attorneys fees 
because we agree with the district court resolution of patel claims on the merits,we need not reach the issue of whether the hcqia or the texas peer review statutes immunize the defendants in this case.as for the question of whether attorneys fees should be awarded to defendants,we remand this case to the district court for consideration of this issue.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendants on all of patel claims.we remand this case to the district court for a determination of their entitlement to attorneys fees and defense costs under the hcqia,and the texas peer review statutes.ann.c.
four associations in which patel has an patel,professional association the heart center associates of midland cardiovascular internal medicine,professional association and echo lab,also named plaintiffs in the suit.
invasive cardiology includes angiograms or studies on the coronary arteries in a cardiac catheterization laboratory.interventional cardiology includes procedures on coronary arteries in a cardiac cath lab,including the placement of a balloon or angioplasty,the placement of stents,and rotablater therapy.
the mec sent records from patel cases to richard vogelzang,professor of radiology and chief of vascular and interventional radiology at northwestern memorial hospital in chicago,illinois,and frank rivera,department of radiology imaging at baylor university medical center in dallas,texas.vogelzang stated in his report that patel lacks basic technical skill in the performance of peripheral interventions,lacks understanding of the clinical management of peripheral vascular disease,and has had an unusually and unacceptably high rate of major complications and catastrophic outcomes.vogelzang also noted significant and marked discrepancies in patel recordkeeping,including a report that a patient had returned to his home in an improved condition,when in fact he had died.rivera similarly criticized patel basic knowledge,skills,and judgment in performing peripheral interventions.with respect to patel record keeping,rivera reported because of the severity of the discrepancies,one can not help but be concerned that these are not simple errors,but in fact a blatant attempt to give false information.
although initially named as a defendant,foster has since been dismissed from this case.
although the committee included thirteen members at the time of the meeting,the only three doctors in attendance were brown,miller,and barnett,all members of the permian cardiology group and competitors of patel.barnett was initially named a defendant in this case,but has since been voluntarily dismissed.
