justice kennedy,joined by the chief justice,justice thomas,and justice alito,concluded that suits against states under the provision are barred by sovereign immunity.
a under the federal system,states,as sovereigns,are immune from damages suits,unless they waive that defense.see,kimel florida bd.of regents.congress may also abrogate the states immunity pursuant to its powers under of the fourteenth amendment,but it must make that intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute,hibbs,supra,at.it did so in the fmla.congress also must tailor legislation enacted under to remedy or prevent conduct transgressing the fourteenth amendment substantive provisions.florida prepaid postsecondary ed.expense bd.college savings bank.there must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.city of boerne flores.
b the discrimination that supported allowing subparagraph c suits against states is absent with respect to the provision.petitioner three arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.
petitioner maintains that the provision addresses sex discrimination and sex stereotyping.but the provision,standing alone,is not a valid abrogation of the states immunity from suit.at the time the fmla was enacted,there was no evidence of such discrimination or stereotyping in policies.congress was concerned about the economic burdens imposed by job loss on employees and their families and about discrimination based on illness,not sex.although the provision offers some women a benefit by allowing them to take leave for illnesses,the provision,as a remedy,is not congruent and proportional to any identified constitutional violations.when the fmla was enacted,congress had no evidence that states were excluding illnesses from their leave policies.
petitioner also argues that the provision is a necessary adjunct to the provision sustained in hibbs.but his claim that the provisions work in tandem to ensure the equal availability of total fmla leave time to women and men despite their different patterns is unconvincing and does not comply with the requirements of city of boerne.also,there are no congressional findings of,or evidence on,how the provision is necessary to the provisions or how it reduces employer discrimination against women.
finally,petitioner contends that the provision helps single parents keep their jobs when they get ill.the fact that most single parents happen to be women demonstrates,at most,that the provision was directed at remedying neutral leave restrictions that have a disparate effect on women.however,a lthough disparate impact may be relevant evidence of discrimination such evidence is insufficient to prove a constitutional violation even where the fourteenth amendment subjects state action to strict scrutiny.board of trustees of of garrett.because it is unlikely that many of the neutral leave policies affected by the provision are unconstitutional,the scope of the provision is out of proportion to its supposed remedial or preventive objectives.
justice scalia adhered to his view that the court should abandon the congruence and proportionality approach in favor of one that is properly tied to the text of,which grants congress the power to enforce,by appropriate legislation,the other provisions of the fourteenth amendment.outside the context of racial discrimination,congress power should be limited to the regulation of conduct that itself violates the fourteenth amendment and thus would not reach a state failure to grant leave to its employees.

daniel coleman,petitioner court of appeals of maryland et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit 
justice kennedy announced the judgment of the court and delivered an opinion,in which the chief justice,justice thomas,and justice alito joined.
the question in this case is whether a state employee is allowed to recover damages from the state entity that employs him by invoking one of the provisions of a federal statute that,in express terms,seeks to abrogate the states immunity from suits for damages.the statute in question is the family and medical leave act of,stat,et.the provision at issue requires employers,including state employers,to grant unpaid leave for self care for a serious medical condition,provided other statutory requisites are met,particularly requirements that the total amount of annual leave taken under all the act provisions does not exceed a stated maximum.a d.in agreement with every court of appeals to have addressed this question,this court now holds that suits against states under this provision are barred by the states immunity as sovereigns in our federal system.see case below nelson university of,miles bellfontaine habilitation center,per curiam toeller wisconsin of corrections,touvell ohio of mental retardation developmental disabilities,brockman wyoming of family,laro new hampshire.
the family and medical leave act of fmla or act entitles eligible employees to take up to work weeks of unpaid leave per year.an employee may take leave under the fmla for a the birth of a son or daughter in order to care for such son or daughter,b the adoption or placement of a child with the employee,c the care of a spouse son,daughter,or parent with a serious health condition,and d the employee own serious health condition when the condition interferes with the employee ability to perform at work.a.the act creates a private right of action to seek both equitable relief and money damages against any employer including a public agency in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction.a.as noted,subparagraph d is at issue here.
this court considered subparagraph c in nevada of human resources hibbs.subparagraph c,like a and b,grants leave for reasons related to family care,and those three provisions are referred to here as the provisions.hibbs held that congress could subject the states to suit for violations of subparagraph c,a c.that holding rested on evidence that states had policies that differentiated on the basis of sex and that states administered even neutral policies in ways that discriminated on the basis of sex.see,at.subparagraph d,the provision,was not at issue in hibbs.
petitioner daniel coleman was employed by the court of appeals of the state of maryland.when coleman requested sick leave,he was informed he would be terminated if he did not resign.coleman then sued the state court in the united states district court for the district of maryland,alleging,inter alia,that his employer violated the fmla by failing to provide him with leave.
the district court dismissed the suit on the basis that the maryland court of appeals,as an entity of a sovereign state,was immune from the suit for damages.the parties do not dispute the district court ruling that the maryland court of appeals is an entity or instrumentality of the state for purposes of sovereign immunity.the district court concluded the fmla provision did not validly abrogate the state immunity from suit.app.to pet.for cert.the court of appeals for the fourth circuit affirmed,reasoning that,unlike the provision at issue in hibbs,the provision was not directed at an identified pattern of discrimination and was not congruent and proportional to any pattern of discrimination on the part of states.certiorari was granted.
a foundational premise of the federal system is that states,as sovereigns,are immune from suits for damages,save as they elect to waive that defense.see kimel florida bd.of regents,alden maine.as an exception to this principle,congress may abrogate the states immunity from suit pursuant to its powers under of the fourteenth amendment.see,fitzpatrick bitzer.
congress must mak e its intention to abrogate unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.hibbs,at.on this point the act does express the clear purpose to abrogate the states immunity.ibid.the clarity of congress intent to abrogate the states immunity from suits for damages under the fmla is not fairly debatable congress subjected any public agency to suit under the fmla,a,and a public agency is defined to include both the government of a state or political subdivision thereof and any agency of a state,or a political subdivision of a state,x,a iii.
the question then becomes whether the provision and its attempt to abrogate the states immunity are a valid exercise of congressional power under of the fourteenth amendment.section grants congress the power to enforce the substantive guarantees of of the amendment by appropriate legislation.the power to enforce includes the authority both to remedy and to deter violation s of rights guaranteed by.see board of trustees of of garrett,quoting kimel,supra,at.to ensure congress enforcement powers under remain enforcement powers,as envisioned by the ratifiers of the amendment,rather than powers to redefine the substantive scope of,congress must tailor legislation enacted under to remedy or prevent conduct transgressing the fourteenth amendment substantive provisions.florida prepaid postsecondary ed.expense bd.college savings bank.
whether a congressional act passed under can impose monetary liability upon states requires an assessment of both the evil or wrong that congress intended to remedy,and the means congress adopted to address that evil,see city of boerne flores.legislation enacted under must be targeted at conduct transgressing the fourteenth amendment substantive provisions.florida prepaid,supra,at see kimel,supra,at city of boerne,at.and t here must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.at.
under this analysis hibbs permitted employees to recover damages from states for violations of subparagraph c.in enacting the fmla,congress relied upon evidence of a pattern of discrimination in policies.states had facially discriminatory leave policies that granted longer periods of leave to women than to men,at.states also administered facially neutral policies in ways,at.these practices reflected what congress found to be a pervasive stereotype that caring for family members is women work,at,a stereotype to which even this court had succumbed in earlier times,at.faced with the states record of unconstitutional participation in,and fostering of,discrimination in the administration of leave benefits,hibbs concluded that requiring state employers to give all employees the opportunity to take leave was narrowly targeted at the faultline between work and family precisely where overgeneralization has been and remains strongest.at.
the same can not be said for requiring the states to give all employees the opportunity to take leave.petitioner advances three arguments for allowing employees to recover damages from states that violate the fmla provision the provision standing alone addresses sex discrimination and sex stereotyping the provision is a necessary adjunct to the provision sustained in hibbs and the provision eases the burden on single parents.but what the provisions have to support them,the provision lacks,namely evidence of a pattern of state constitutional violations accompanied by a remedy drawn in narrow terms to address or prevent those violations.
standing alone,the provision is not a valid abrogation of the states immunity from suit.when the fmla was enacted,percent of state and employees were covered by paid sick leave plans and percent of such employees likewise enjoyed disability protection.brief for states of texas et as amici curiae hereinafter texas brief citing bureau of labor statistics,of labor,employee benefits in state and local governments hereinafter bls rept.the evidence did not suggest states had facially discriminatory leave policies or that they administered neutral leave policies in a discriminatory way.and there is scant evidence in the legislative history of a purported stereotype harbored by employers that women take leave more often than men.congress considered evidence that men and women are out on medical leave approximately equally.pt,hereinafter.nothing in the record shows employers formulated leave policies based on a contrary view.
without widespread evidence of sex discrimination or sex stereotyping in the administration of sick leave,it is apparent that the congressional purpose in enacting the provision is unrelated to these supposed wrongs.the legislative history of the provision reveals a concern for the economic burdens on the employee and the employee family resulting from job loss and a concern for discrimination on the basis of illness,not sex.see,at.in the findings pertinent to the provision,the statute makes no reference to any distinction on the basis of sex.see a t here is inadequate job security for employees who have serious health conditions that prevent them from working for temporary periods by contrast,with regard to family care congress invoked concerns related to gender.see a d ue to the nature of the roles of men and women in our society,the primary responsibility for family caretaking often falls on women,and such responsibility affects the working lives of women more than it affects the working lives of men 
it is true the provision offers some women a benefit by allowing them to take leave for illnesses but as a remedy,the provision is not congruent and proportional to any identified constitutional violations.at the time of the fmla enactment,percent of state employees had paid plans at work,and percent had disability protection.texas brief citing bls rept.state employees presumably could take leave for illnesses under these policies,and congress did not document any pattern of states excluding illnesses from or policies.congress said nothing about the existence or adequacy of state remedies.florida prepaid,at.it follows that abrogating the states immunity from suits for damages for failure to give leave is not a congruent and proportional remedy if the existing state leave policies would have sufficed.
as an alternative justification for the provision,it has been suggested that the provision is a necessary adjunct to the provisions.petitioner argues that employers may assume women are more likely to take leave than men and that the fmla therefore offers up to weeks of leave for family care and self care combined.according to petitioner,when the provision is coupled with the provisions,the provision could reduce the difference in the expected number of weeks of fmla leave that different employees take for different reasons.
the fact that leave could have this effect does not mean that it would.if,for example,women are expected to take days of leave per year and men to take,and women and men are each expected to take days of leave per year,the difference in the expected number of days of leave and cost to the employer remains the same regardless of the availability of leave.congress made no findings,and received no specific testimony,to suggest the availability of leave equalizes the expected amount of fmla leave men and women will take.even if women take leave more often than men,men do not take leave more often than women and there is little evidence that employers assume they do.see,at.petitioner suggests that some women will be expected to take all weeks of leave under the fmla for purposes,and therefore that any amount of leave taken by men will diminish the difference in the amount of fmla leave taken by men and women.but there is little evidence to support petitioner assumption about the magnitude of women expected fmla leave for purposes.and men are only expected to take five days of sick leave per year,see,so the provision diminishes the difference in expected leave time by a maximum of five days.and that is only to the extent women use all their available fmla leave for reasons.petitioner overly complicated argument about how the provision works in tandem with the provisions is unconvincing and in the end does not comply with the clear requirements of city of boerne.
in addition petitioner first defense of the provision contradicts his second defense of the provision.in the first defense,the court is told employers assume women take more leave than men.see tr.of oral arg.in the second defense,the court is told the provision provides an incentive to hire women that will counteract the incentives created by the provisions because employers assume women take more leave than men.but if the first defense is correct,the second defense is wrong.in other words,if employers assume women take leave more often than men the first defense,a provision will not provide an incentive to hire women.to the contrary,the provision would provide an incentive to discriminate against women.
there is little support in the record for the concerns that supposedly animated the provision.florida prepaid,supra,at.only supposition and conjecture support the contention that the provision is necessary to make the provisions effective.the evidence documented in support of the provision is,to a large degree,unrelated to sex discrimination,or to the administration of the provisions.see supra,at.congress made no findings and did not cite specific or detailed evidence to show how the provision is necessary to the provisions or how it reduces an employer incentives to discriminate against women.and congress said nothing about the existence or adequacy of state policies.florida prepaid,supra,at see garrett,at.under this court precedents,more is required to subject unconsenting states to suits for damages,particularly where,as here,it is for violations of a provision the provision that is a supposedly preventive step in aid of already preventive provisions the provisions.see florida prepaid,at t he legislative record still provides little support for the proposition that congress sought to remedy a fourteenth amendment violation in enacting the patent remedy act kimel,at one means by which we have made such a determination is by examining the legislative record containing the reasons for congress action 
the few fleeting references to how leave is inseparable from leave fall short of what is required for a valid abrogation of states immunity from suits for damages.florida prepaid,supra,at.these isolated sentences clipped from floor debates and testimony,kimel,supra,at,are stated as conclusions,unsupported by evidence or findings about how the provision interrelates to the provisions to counteract employers incentives to discriminate against women.congress must rely on more than abstract generalities to subject the states to suits for damages.otherwise,congress could choose to combat the purported effects of the provisions by allowing employees to sue states that do not permit employees to take vacation time under the fmla.there is nothing in particular about leave,as opposed to leave for any personal reason,that connects it to gender discrimination.and when the issue,as here,is whether subparagraph d can abrogate a state immunity from damages,there is no sufficient nexus,or indeed any demonstrated nexus,between leave and gender discrimination by state employers.documented discrimination against women in the general workplace is a persistent,unfortunate reality,and,we must assume,a still prevalent wrong.an explicit purpose of the congress in adopting the fmla was to improve workplace conditions for women.see b.but states may not be subject to suits for damages based on violations of a comprehensive statute unless congress has identified a specific pattern of constitutional violations by state employers.see city of boerne,at.
the petitioner last defense of the provision is that the provision helps single parents retain their jobs when they become ill.this,however,does not explain how the provision remedies or prevents constitutional violations.the fact that most single parents happen to be women,see,at,demonstrates,at most,that the provision was directed at remedying employers neutral leave restrictions which have a disparate effect on women.although disparate impact may be relevant evidence of discrimination such evidence alone is insufficient to prove a constitutional violation even where the fourteenth amendment subjects state action to strict scrutiny.garrett,supra,at see tuan anh nguyen ins,dissenting washington davis.to the extent,then,that the provision addresses neutral leave policies with a disparate impact on women,it is not directed at a pattern of constitutional violations.because,moreover,it is unlikely that many of the neutral leave policies affected by the provision are unconstitutional,the scope of the provision is out of proportion to its supposed remedial or preventive objectives.kimel,supra,at see city of boerne,supra,at.
of course,a state need not assert its eleventh amendment immunity from suits for damages.see,sossamon texas,slip,at a state may choose to waive its immunity in federal court at its pleasure discrimination against women is contrary to the public policy of the state of maryland,see,maryland fair employment practices act.state govt.code ann.lexis,and the state has conceded that the act is good social policy,see tr.of oral arg.if the state agrees with petitioner that damages liability for violations of the provision is necessary to combat discrimination against women,the state may waive its immunity or create a parallel state law cause of action.
as a consequence of our constitutional design,money damages are the exception when sovereigns are defendants.see,pennhurst state school and hospital halderman.subjecting states to suits for damages pursuant to requires more than a theory for why abrogating the states immunity aids in,or advances,a stated congressional purpose.to abrogate the states immunity from suits for damages under,congress must identify a pattern of constitutional violations and tailor a remedy congruent and proportional to the documented violations.it failed to do so when it allowed employees to sue states for violations of the fmla provision.the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.
it is so ordered.

the plurality opinion seems to me a faithful application of our congruence and proportionality jurisprudence.so does the opinion of the dissent.that is because the varying outcomes we have arrived at under the congruence and proportionality test make no sense.which in turn is because that flabby test is a standing invitation to judicial arbitrariness and decisionmaking,tennessee lane,scalia,dissenting.moreover,in the process of applying or seeming to apply the test,we must scour the legislative record in search of evidence that supports the congressional action.see ante,at post,at opinion of ginsburg.this grading of congress homework is a task we are ill suited to perform and ill advised to undertake.
i adhere to my view that we should instead adopt an approach that is properly tied to the text of,which grants congress the power to enforce,by appropriate legislation,the other provisions of the fourteenth amendment.emphasis added.as i have explained in greater detail elsewhere,see lane,supra,at,outside of the context of racial discrimination which is different for stare decisis reasons,i would limit congress power to the regulation of conduct that itself violates the fourteenth amendment.failing to grant state employees leave for the purpose of or any other purpose,for that matter does not come close.

section of the fourteenth amendment provides no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.section grants congress the power to enforce,by appropriate legislation,the provisions of this article.congress enforcement power includes the authority to remedy and deter violations of substantive guarantees by prohibiting conduct not itself forbidden by the amendment text.kimel flor ida bd.of regents.in other words,congress may enact prophylactic legislation that proscribes facially constitutional conduct,in order to prevent and deter unconstitutional conduct.nevada of human resources hibbs.

even accepting this court view of the scope of congress power under of the fourteenth amendment,i would hold that the provision,a d,validly enforces the right to be free from gender discrimination in the workplace 
section legislation must be targeted at conduct transgressing the fourteenth amendment substantive provisions,ante,at internal quotation marks omitted,a nd t here must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.ibid.quoting city of boerne flores.the first step of the boerne inquiry calls for identification of the constitutional right congress sought to enforce.see,tennessee lane.the fmla provision,maryland asserts,trains not on the right to be free from gender discrimination,but on an equal protection right to be free from irrational state employment discrimination based on a medical condition.brief for respondents.the plurality agrees,concluding that the provision reveals a concern for discrimination on the basis of illness,not sex.ante,at.in so declaring,the plurality undervalues the language,purpose,and history of the fmla,and the provision important role in the statutory scheme.as well,the plurality underplays the main theme of our decision in hibbs the fmla aims to protect the right to be free from discrimination in the workplace.at.
i begin with the text of the statute,which repeatedly emphasizes gender discrimination.one of the fmla stated purposes is to entitle employees to take reasonable leave,b,in a manner that,consistent with the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,minimizes the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring generally that leave is available for eligible medical reasons including disability and for compelling family reasons,on a basis.b.another identified aim is to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for women and men,pursuant to the equal protection clause.b.e mployment standards that apply to one gender only,congress expressly found,have serious potential for encouraging employers to discriminate against employees and applicants for employment who are of that gender.a.
the fmla purpose and legislative history reinforce the conclusion that the fmla,in its entirety,is directed at sex discrimination.indeed,the fmla was originally envisioned as a way to guarantee without singling out women or pregnancy that pregnant women would not lose their jobs when they gave birth.the provision achieves that aim.
a brief history is in order.in his congressional campaign,howard berman pledged to introduce legislation similar to the california law challenged in california fed.sav.loan guerra.wisensale,family leave policy the political economy of work and family in america hereinafter wisensale.california law,enacted in,made it unlawful for an employer to refuse to grant female employees disabled by pregnancy or childbirth up to four months unpaid,leave.see cal.stats.ch,now codified at cal.govt.code ann.a west supp.
the california law sharply divided women rights advocates.feminists asserted it violated the pregnancy discrimination act pda commitment to treating pregnancy the same as other disabilities it did so by requiring leave only for disability caused by pregnancy and childbirth,thereby treating pregnancy as sui generis.see brief for american civil liberties union et as amici curiae in california.feminists disagreed,urging that the california law was consistent with the pda because it remedied the discriminatory burden that inadequate leave policies placed on a woman right to procreate.see brief for coalition for reproductive equality in the workplace et as amici curiae in,at.see also williams,equality riddle pregnancy and the equal treatment debate,soc.change,hereinafter williams discussing disagreement.
while california fed.moved through the lower federal courts,feminists began work on a leave model,which eventually became the fmla.see ross,legal aspects of parental leave,in parental leave and child care hyde essex eds.hereinafter ross.berman met with the women legal defense fund donna lenhoff,a drafter of the first fmla bill,at,wisensale they agreed that any national bill would focus not only on pregnancy,but on equal treatment for all workers.ross.see also kazmier widmann,dennis,dissenting perceiving that enacting the pda had not achieved the intended result of preventing discrimination against either women or men in the granting of leave time in that the states felt it necessary to affirmatively grant pregnancy leave to women and not men,in congress began considering the issue of family and medical leave.
though this court,in california,eventually upheld california leave policy as not preempted by the pda,feminists continued to believe that viewing pregnancy as sui generis perpetuated widespread discrimination against women they therefore maintained their commitment to leave.see joint hearing on before the subcommittee on civil service and the subcommittee on compensation and employee benefits of the house committee on post office and civil service,hereinafter house hearing statement of eleanor holmes norton,georgetown university law center if california fed.becomes the model,employers will provide something for women affected by pregnancy that they are not required to provide for other employees.this gives fodder to those who seek to discriminate against women in employment.in the california fed.case,i would have preferred the interpretation urged by the feminists.
congress agreed.see infra,at.adhering to feminists aim,the provision,a d,prescribes comprehensive leave for women disabled during pregnancy or while recuperating from childbirth without singling out pregnancy or childbirth.see,a significant benefit of the temporary medical leave provided by this legislation is the form of protection it offers women workers who bear children.because the bill treats all employees who are temporarily unable to work due to serious health conditions in the same fashion,it does not create the risk of discrimination against pregnant women posed by legislation which provides job protection only for disability.legislation solely protecting pregnant women gives employers an economic incentive to discriminate against women in hiring policies legislation helping all workers equally does not have this effect.in view of this history,it is impossible to conclude that nothing in particular about leave connects it to gender discrimination.ante,at.
boerne next asks whether congress had evidence of a pattern of constitutional violations on the part of the states.hibbs,at.see also boerne,at.beyond question,congress had evidence of a pattern of workplace discrimination against pregnant women.section a d can therefore be understood as responsive to,or designed to prevent,unconstitutional behavior.at.
although the pda proscribed blatant discrimination on the basis of pregnancy,see k,supra,at,the act is fairly described as a necessary,but not a sufficient measure.fmla hearings conducted between and included illustrative testimony from women fired after becoming pregnant or giving birth.for example,beverly wilkenson was granted seven weeks of leave upon the birth of her child.on the eve of her return to work,a superior informed her that her job had been eliminated.he stated beverly,the best thing for you to do is stay home and take care of your baby and collect your unemployment.hearing on before the subcommittee on relations of the house committee on education and labor,hereinafter house hearing statement of beverly wilkenson.see also,hereinafter senate report describing wilkenson testimony.similarly,linda pillsbury was notified that she no longer had a job three weeks after her daughter was born three secretaries at the same workplace were also forced out of their jobs when they returned to work within weeks of giving birth.see hearings on before the subcommittee on children,family,drugs and alcoholism of the senate committee on labor and human resources,pt,hereinafter senate hearings statement of linda pillsbury.
these women experiences,congress learned,were hardly isolated incidents.a spokeswoman for the mayor commission on women affairs in chicago testified the lack of uniform parental and medical leave policies in the workplace has created an environment where discrimination is rampant.very often we are contacted by women workers who are at risk of losing their jobs or have lost them because they are pregnant,or have given birth.at statement of peggy montes.see also joint hearing on the parental and medical leave act of before the subcommittee on relations and the subcommittee on labor standards of the house committee on education and labor,hereinafter house hearing statement of women legal defense fund w omen who are temporarily unable to work due to pregnancy,and related medical conditions such as morning sickness,threatened miscarriage,or complications arising from childbirth,often lose their jobs because of the inadequacy of their employers leave policies.senate report recording that an job counseling hotline received approximately calls each year from women who were fired,harassed,or forced out of their jobs due to pregnancy or leave cong.rec.remarks of edward kennedy w omen who are pregnant are discriminated against as a general rule in our society and have difficulty retaining their jobs.as summarized by the american bar association 
historically,denial or curtailment of women employment opportunities has been traceable directly to the pervasive presumption that women are mothers first,and workers second.this prevailing ideology about women roles has in turn justified discrimination against women when they are mothers or.house hearing american bar association background report.see also hibbs,at quoting same language.
many pregnant women have been fired when their employer refused to provide an adequate leave of absence,congress had ample cause to conclude.see,pt.pregnancy,congress also found,has a marked impact on women earnings.one year after childbirth,mothers earnings fell to per hour less than those of women who had not given birth.see senate report.see also house hearing report of,national association of working women citing same study.
congress heard evidence tying this pattern of discrimination to the states.a survey by the yale bush center infant care leave project concluded that t he proportion and construction of leave policies available to public sector employees differs little from those offered private sector employees.hibbs,at,quoting house hearing statement of meryl frank.roughly of women employed in the public sector did not receive eight weeks of medical leave to recover from childbirth.see senate hearings,pt,statement of james bond,national counsel of jewish women.a south carolina state legislator testified i n south carolina,as well as in other states no unemployment compensation is paid to a woman who is necessarily absent from her place of employment because of pregnancy or maternity.see,pt,statement of irene rudnick.according to an employee of the state of georgia,if state employees took leave,it was held against them when they were considered for promotions it is common practice for my department to compare the balance sheets of workers who have and have not used leave benefits in determining who should and should not be promoted.hearing on before the subcommittee on relations of the house committee on education and labor,statement of robert dawkins.see also,at one type of leave for georgia state employees boils down to whether your supervisor wants you to come back or not.in short,congress had every reason to believe that a pattern of workplace discrimination against pregnant women existed in employment,just as it did in the private sector.
a state refusal to provide pregnancy leave to its employees,maryland responds,is not unconstitutional.brief for respondents citing geduldig aiello.aiello footnote proclaimed that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is not discrimination on the basis of sex.in my view,this case is a fit occasion to revisit that conclusion.footnote reads 
the dissenting opinion to the contrary,this case is a far cry from cases like reed reed,and frontiero richardson,involving discrimination based upon gender as such.the california insurance program does not exclude anyone from benefit eligibility because of gender but merely removes one physical condition pregnancy from the list of compensable disabilities.while it is true that only women can become pregnant,it does not follow that every legislative classification concerning pregnancy is a classification 
the lack of identity between the excluded disability and gender as such under this insurance program becomes clear upon the most cursory analysis.the program divides potential recipients into two groups pregnant women and nonpregnant persons.while the first group is exclusively female,the second includes members of both sexes.the fiscal and actuarial benefits of the program thus accrue to members of both sexes.at.

this reality is well illustrated by the facts of aiello.the california program at issue granted disability benefits for virtually any conceivable work disability,including those arising from cosmetic surgery,skiing accidents,and alcoholism.see brief for eeoc as amicus curiae in aiello.it also compensated men for disabilities caused by ailments and procedures that affected men alone for example,vasectomies,circumcision,and prostatectomies.see brief for american civil liberties union et as amici curiae in,at.only pregnancy was excluded from the definition of disability.see cal.un.ins.code ann.west aiello,at.as justice brennan insightfully concluded in dissent,a limitation is imposed upon the disabilities for which women workers may recover,while men receive full compensation for all disabilities suffered.such dissimilar treatment of men and women,on the basis of physical characteristics inextricably linked to one sex,inevitably constitutes sex discrimination.at.
second,pregnancy provided a central justification for the historic discrimination against women this court chronicled in hibbs.see,at a proper discharge of a woman maternal functions having in view not merely her own health,but the of the race justif ies legislation to protect her from the greed as well as the passion of man.quoting muller oregon,and alterations in hibbs.see also siegel,employment equality under the pregnancy discrimination act of,yale,pregnancy is a biological difference central to the definition of gender roles,one traditionally believed to render women unfit for employment.relatedly,discrimination against pregnant employees was often based not on the pregnancy itself but on predictions concerning the future behavior of the pregnant woman when her child was born or on views about what her behavior should be.williams.see also,t he assumption that women will become pregnant and leave the labor market is at the core of the sex stereotyping resulting in unfavorable disparate treatment of women in the workplace.
in sum,childbearing is not only a biological function unique to women.it is also inextricably intertwined with employers stereotypical views about women commitment to work and their value as employees.hibbs,at.because pregnancy discrimination is inevitably sex discrimination,and because discrimination against women is tightly interwoven with society beliefs about pregnancy and motherhood,i would hold that aiello was egregiously wrong to declare that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is not discrimination on the basis of sex.
boerne third step requires a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.ante,at quoting,at.section a d,i would conclude,is an appropriate response to pervasive discriminatory treatment of pregnant women.in separating leave for the physical disability following childbirth,a d,which affects only women,from leave for parenting a newborn baby,a a,for which men and women are equally suited,congress could attack gender discrimination and challenge stereotypes of women as lone childrearers.hibbs,at states extended maternity leaves,far exceeding a woman physical disability following childbirth,were attributable to the pervasive stereotype that caring for family members is women work.
it would make scant sense to provide leave for a woman to care for a newborn,but not for her recovery from delivery,a miscarriage,or the birth of a stillborn baby.and allowing states to provide no leave at all,given that only women can become pregnant,would obviously exclude far more women than men from the workplace.at.
the plurality statement that congress lacked widespread evidence of sex discrimination in the administration of sick leave,ante,at,misses the point.so too does the plurality observation that state employees likely could take leave for illnesses presumably severe morning sickness,toxemia,under paid plans,ante,at.congress heard evidence that existing plans were inadequate to ensure that women were not fired when they needed to take time out to recover their strength and stamina after childbirth.the provision responds to that evidence by requiring employers to allow leave for ongoing pregnancy,miscarriages,the need for prenatal care,childbirth,and recovery from childbirth.
that a d entitles all employees to up to weeks of unpaid,leave for a serious health condition,rather than singling out pregnancy or childbirth,does not mean that the provision lacks the requisite congruence and proportionality to the identified constitutional violations.as earlier noted,supra,at,congress made plain its rationale for the prescription broader compass congress sought to ward off the unconstitutional discrimination it believed would attend a leave requirement.under the caption equal protection and,congress explained 
the fmla addresses the basic leave needs of all employees.this is an important principle reflected in the bill.
a law providing special protection to women,in addition to being inequitable,runs the risk of causing discriminatory treatment.employers might be less inclined to hire women.for example,legislation addressing the needs of pregnant women only might encourage discriminatory hiring practices against women of child bearing age.legislation addressing the needs of all workers equally does not have this effect.by addressing the serious leave needs of all employees,the fmla avoids providing employers the temptation to discriminate against women.
the legislation is thus based not only on the commerce clause,but also on the guarantees of equal protection embodied in the fourteenth amendment.pt,hereinafter house report.
congress concern was solidly grounded in workplace realities.after this court upheld california leave policy in california,don butler,president of the merchants and manufacturers association,one of the plaintiffs in that case,told national public radio reporter nina totenberg that,as a result of the decision,many employers will be prone to discriminate against women in hiring and hire males instead.house hearing.totenberg replied,but that is illegal,too to which butler responded,well,that is illegal,but try to prove it.ibid.
finally,as in hibbs,it is important to note the moderate cast of the fmla,in particular,the considerable limitations congress placed on a a d leave requirement.see,at.fmla leave is unpaid.it is limited to employees who have worked at least one year for the employer and at least hours during the past year.a,c.employees,including state elected officials and their staffs,are not within the act compass.e c.employees must provide advance notice of foreseeable leaves.e.employers may require a doctor certification of a serious health condition.a.and,if an employer violates the fmla,the employees recoverable damages are strictly defined and measured by actual monetary losses.hibbs,at citing a a i iii.the provision,i would therefore hold,is congruent and proportional to the injury to be prevented.
but even if aiello senselessly holds sway,and impedes the conclusion that a d is an appropriate response to the states unconstitutional discrimination against pregnant women i would nevertheless conclude that the fmla is valid legislation.for it is a meet response to the states record of unconstitutional par
