plaintiff susan ziegler appeals the district court decision granting summary judgment to defendant daniel jonoshies,a police officer in the springport township police department,in this civil rights action filed under.we hold that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard in determining defendant summary judgment motion.however,because we also believe that applying the proper legal standard to the district court findings of fact will not alter the outcome of that court decision,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for defendant.
factual background 
on the night of june,plaintiff alleges that she went to foote memorial hospital to get a referral to an outpatient counselor to talk about some family problems.according to hospital records,plaintiff husband brought her to the hospital because she was depressed and became suicidal.she arrived at the hospital at about.in the first half hour,plaintiff allegedly reported that she was suicidal and planned to drive her car into a tree at,plaintiff asked to go outside with her husband.she did not return,and when hospital staff could not locate her,police were notified and sent to plaintiff home.at,plaintiff reappeared at the hospital.plaintiff had just left the hospital to smoke.the police were notified and presumably told not to go to her home.
upon plaintiff return to the hospital,she was examined by defendant desiree aukerman,a nurse in the emergency room.nurse aukerman determined that plaintiff had a medical illness that caused her to pose a risk of serious physical injury to herself or to others within the near future in her report,she quoted plaintiff as saying she was at the end of her rope and thought about driving her car into a tree.subsequently,nurse aukerman filed a mental health petition detailing her findings and gave it to donna brown,a doctor at the hospital.brown then met with plaintiff and determined that she was depressed and suicidal.she filled out a clinical certificate quoting the same end of the rope statement nurse aukerman had reported.in addition,she stated in the certificate that plaintiff expressed plans to run into a tree on the way home from work.subsequently,brown requested that plaintiff be hospitalized.
some time after brown signed the certificate,plaintiff stated that the law did not allow the hospital to hold her and she announced her intention to leave.plaintiff then left.at,nurse aukerman,acting on instructions from brown,called and asked the police to locate ziegler and transport her back to the hospital because she was suicidal.dispatcher roe,the dispatcher who handled the call,was told that there was a certificate for susan ziegler authorizing police action officer daniel jonoshies,acting on the dispatcher request,took ziegler into police custody outside her house on the walkway or driveway connected to the house and returned her to the hospital at.
upon arriving at the hospital,officer jonoshies was given the petition and clinical certificate for ziegler,and it was reiterated to him by nurse aukerman that the hospital wanted her confined there for mental health reasons.
following plaintiff confinement,ziegler filed suit in united states district court for the eastern district of michigan.her suit claims violations of,as well as various state tort laws.the defendants in her suit are foote hospital,nurse desiree aukerman,donna brown,police officers daniel jonoshies and officer doe both of the springport township police department,and a dispatcher named dispatcher roe an employee of the jackson county sheriff office.
in count i of plaintiff claim she alleges that police officers daniel jonoshies and officer doe,as well as dispatcher roe,violated her fourth amendment right against unreasonable searches of her home and seizure of her person without a warrant or probable cause.she claims that the defendants,acting under the color of state law,took her into police custody at her home and transported her against her will to a hospital for a mental health confinement.
count ii of plaintiff claim is against the county that employed the dispatcher.in that count,plaintiff claims that jackson county the dispatcher employer has a custom or policy of not having a record keeping system for mental health orders,and as a result,its operators do not have a database to verify the existence or terms of such orders before dispatching police to pick up people on mental health orders.in addition,she claims that jackson county failed to train its dispatchers on the constitutional rights of persons to be free from unlawful seizures on mental health accusations for which there is no court order authorizing police involvement.
all defendants filed answers to the complaint,and eventually filed motions for summary judgment.in addition,plaintiff filed a motion for leave to amend her complaint to add a fourteenth amendment procedural due process violation to count on november,the district court heard oral arguments on all the pending motions.on november,the district court issued a written opinion granting summary judgment for defendants jonoshies,roe,and jackson county on counts i and ii,and denying plaintiff motion for leave to file an amended complaint.plaintiff appeals only the judgment granted to defendant jonoshies,and the denial of her motion for leave to amend her complaint.
ii.standard of review 
this court conducts a de novo review of a district court grant of summary judgment.holloway brush,cir.summary judgment is proper only where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering such a motion,the court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment,an adverse party must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.e.
iii.analysis 
elements of a claim 
ziegler appeals the district court order granting defendant summary judgment motion on her claim against officer jonoshies.the district court granted defendant motion because it found that,although ziegler constitutional rights were deprived by officer jonoshies,they were not deprived without due process of law.the court stated 
to prevail on her claims under,plaintiff must demonstrate a deprivation of a right secured by the constitution or laws of the united states caused by a person acting under color of state law occurring without due process of law.city of grand rapids,cir.viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff,the record does not support a question of fact regarding the third element.
the district court went on to hold that plaintiff claims must fail because the record demonstrates as a matter of law that her involuntary stay at the hospital complied with the procedures required under michigan law.however,the district court finding is based on incorrect law.to prevail on a claim,a plaintiff need only show that he or she was deprived of a constitutional right by a state actor.there is no additional requirement that plaintiff show that the deprivation occurred without due process of law.even a cursory read of will reveal that this is true,as the phrase due process does not appear anywhere in the statute.of course,one can allege a due process violation under,and certain constitutional rights inherently raise due process concerns,but it is not required by the statute that one due process rights be violated to prevail.
the district court misstatement of the law is likely the result of the confusing and inconsistent manner in which this circuit has described the law.the district court cites this court opinion in city of grand rapids,cir,as support for the proposition that a claim requires that the deprivation at issue occur without due process of law.in this respect,the district court is correct.does state that there are three elements to a claim,and that the third element is that the deprivation occur without due process of law.this court has restated the existence of this third element in other cases as well.see rhodes mcdannel,cir nishiyama dickson county,cir.
however,this court has also ruled in another line of cases that there are only two elements to a claim,leaving out the requirement that the alleged deprivation occur without due process of law.for example,in kottmyer maas,cir,this court observed that to state a claim under a plaintiff need only establish that the conduct in controversy was committed by a person acting under color of law,and the conduct deprived the plaintiff of a federal right,either constitutional or statutory.see also harajli huron,cir berger city of mayfield heights,cir.thus,there exists an internal split within this circuit as to whether there is a due process requirement in.
the origin of this court misstatement of the elements of a claim can be traced back to the supreme court case of screws united states.in screws,the defendants,a sheriff and a police officer,were accused of beating a man to death after arresting him.id.at.they were found guilty of willfully depriving the victim of his civil rights while acting under color of the law pursuant to criminal code section,section.id.on appeal,defendants argued that section was unconstitutional because it contained no ascertainable standard of guilt in violation of the fourteenth amendment.id.at.the constitutionality of the statute turned on the level of intent that should be ascribed to the word willfully.id.at.the supreme court found that willful must be interpreted to mean more than mere bad purpose or evil intent but rather the specific intent to deprive a person of a federal right.id.at.this interpretation of willful saved the statute from being unconstitutionally vague.id.
although screws had nothing to do with,this court mistakenly cited screws in nishiyama dickson county,cir,for the proposition that required a plaintiff to prove that a deprivation of their rights occurred without due process of law.this mistake was repeated in subsequent cases,like rhodes mcdannel,cir,and city of grand rapids,cir,although these cases do not cite screws,but simply their predecessor,cited rhodes,rhodes cited nishiyama.it is not clear why this court in nishiyama confused screws,a case about a criminal statute from the,to have some meaning on the application of,but the mistake likely has been overlooked because one can claim a violation of one due process rights under,and many other constitutional rights have due process issues intertwined in them.at any rate,it should now be noted that a plaintiff need not prove that his or her rights were deprived without due process to prevail on a claim.now that the elements of the law to be applied to plaintiff case are settled,we will review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the correct interpretation of.
the seizure of plaintiff 
ziegler argues on appeal that defendant summary judgment motion should not have been granted because defendant violated her fourth amendment rights when he took her into custody at her home for a temporary health confinement.absent suspected criminal activity,a law enforcement official may not physically restrain an individual merely to assess his mental health.rather,this court has established that in the context of a mental health seizure,an officer must have probable cause to believe that the person seized poses a danger to himself or others.see monday oullette,cir.
a showing of probable cause in the mental health seizure context requires only a probability or substantial chance of dangerous behavior,not an actual showing of such behavior.id.citing illinois gates,d.just as actual innocence will not render invalid an arrest that is properly based upon probable cause that criminal activity was occurring,a mental health seizure can rest upon probable cause even when the person seized does not actually suffer from a dangerous mental condition.id.courts evaluate the existence of probable cause from the perspective of a reasonable and objective person in the position of the seizing official.id.if the circumstances,viewed objectively,support a finding of probable cause then the arresting officer actual motives are irrelevant.criss city of kent,cir.
in the instant matter,it appears that officer jonoshies did indeed have probable cause to detain ziegler.officer jonoshies took ziegler into custody and brought her back to foote hospital after he received a call from a dispatcher saying that she was suicidal and there was a clinical certificate requiring that she be returned to the hospital.plaintiff claims that a call reporting that an individual is suicidal is not enough to establish probable cause for a police seizure.she cites this court decision in fisher harden,cir,as support for her argument.
in fisher,this court found that there was no probable cause for the seizure of a man who was allegedly suicidal.id.at.the police in fisher acted on a call made by a passerby who incorrectly thought fisher had tied his feet to the railroad tracks in an attempt to commit suicide.id.at.despite clear signs that fisher was not suicidal the police officers aimed their firearms at fisher,forced him to get on the roadway,and eventually handcuffed him behind his back.id.at.this court held that based on the facts,defendants had not demonstrated that probable cause existed to believe that fisher was a danger to himself or others.id.
the facts in the instant matter are quite distinguishable from those of fisher.here,officer jonoshies did not receive a call from a passerby,but from a medical professional,nurse aukerman of foote hospital,who had been ordered to make the call by a doctor of the same hospital.in addition,the dispatcher informed officer jonoshies that there was a clinical certificate confirming what the dispatcher was telling him,that ziegler was suicidal and that the police had the authority to take her back to the hospital.furthermore,it was clear from the telephone call that ziegler had already been hospitalized,presumably for mental health reasons.in reviewing these facts together,and perhaps even separately,officer jonoshies had more than enough information to reasonably believe that there was a substantial chance that ziegler posed a dangerous risk to herself or others.
ziegler seems to think that the fact that she did not exhibit dangerous behavior when officer jonoshies took her into custody makes officer jonoshies belief that there was a substantial chance she was dangerous unreasonable.this simply is not true.a showing of probable cause in the mental health seizure context does not require an actual showing of dangerous behavior.monday oullette,cir citing illinois gates,d.it is enough that officer jonoshies had information such that a reasonable person in the officer position would believe it probable that ziegler was a danger to herself or others.
although this court in fisher did consider the officers observations of the plaintiff in deciding that the officers lacked probable cause to seize the plaintiff,that decision must be viewed in the context of all the information presented before the court.as stated previously,the only information the officers in fisher had about the mental state of the plaintiff was from a telephone call made to the sheriff office by the passerby.fisher,at.given the general level of uncertainty surrounding the veracity of such a call,it was necessary that the officers obtain other information to meet the probable cause standard.in fisher,the only other information the officers were able to obtain came from their own observations of the plaintiff.thus,their observations,by necessity,played a large role in determining whether probable cause existed.
in the present case,the information the officers received about plaintiff mental health came from a much more credible source,if not the most credible source,the hospital itself.in addition,the hospital staff stated in their call that their concern for plaintiff mental health was supported by a documented examination of plaintiff,the clinical certificate.as a reasonable officer would view this information alone as sufficient to support a showing of probable cause,the officer own observations of plaintiff are of little importance.this is especia
