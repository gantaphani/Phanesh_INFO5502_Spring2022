the neighborhood association of the back bay,nabb and the boston preservation alliance bpa collectively plaintiffs brought suit against the federal transit authority fta and massachusetts bay transportation authority mbta,asserting that planned modifications to the copley square transit station violated historical preservation statutes.the united states district court for the district of massachusetts denied preliminary and final injunctive relief.because we conclude that the plaintiffs have not established a violation of applicable federal or state statutes,we affirm.
background 
this case primarily presents questions as to whether the fta,in providing funding to the mbta to make the copley square station compliant with the americans with disabilities act ada,has violated various federal statutes designed to preserve historic properties.
under title ii of the ada,and its implementing regulations,public transit authorities receiving federal funds are required to identify key stations in their transit stations and then make those stations accessible to wheelchair users.
in the copley square station was identified by the mbta as a key station,and plans were made to modify the station to make it wheelchair accessible.to make the station wheelchair accessible would require installation of new inbound and outbound elevators to transport wheelchair users.
under,the fta provides federal funds to state entities such as the mbta to assist them in achieving compliance with the ada.however,in providing funding,the fta,like other federal agencies,must ensure that the funded projects comply with various federal statutes dealing with historic preservation,including two sections of the national historic preservation act nhpa section,and f section f.the fta must also comply with section f of the department of transportation act of dota,section f.
the problem with the planned modifications to the copley square station lies in the fact that the station is adjacent to the boston public library the library and the old south church the church,both of which are designated as national landmarks and are listed on the national register of historic places.the library and church are located within the back bay historic district,which is itself on the national register of historic places,as is the existing inbound entrance headhouse to copley station.the proposed modifications to the station would require use of part of the library steps for the inbound elevator and construction of an outbound elevator adjacent to the church.the plaintiffs contend that the proposed modifications would violate sections,and section f.understanding plaintiffs contentions requires a description of these statutes,and the process by which the fta sought to achieve compliance with their requirements.
section of the nhpa requires federal agencies,prior to the approval of the expenditure of any federal funds on the undertaking to take into account the effect a federal undertaking will have on any district,site,building,structure,or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the national register and to afford the advisory council on historic preservation a reasonable opportunity to comment with regard to such undertaking.the regulations under this section make clear that section is applicable only when the proposed action would have an adverse effect on an historic property such as the library and the church.
section f of nhpa provides that p rior to the approval of any federal undertaking which may directly and adversely affect any national historic landmark the agency shall,to the maximum extent possible,undertake such planning and actions as may be necessary to minimize harm to such landmark,and shall afford the advisory council on historic preservation a reasonable opportunity to comment on the undertaking.a precondition to the application of section f is an action that may directly and adversely affect a landmark property,such as the church or library.
section f provides that the secretary of transportation may approve a transportation project requiring the use of land of an historic site only if there is no prudent and feasible alternative to using that land and the project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the historic site c section f.the provision applies only if there is a use of an historic site.
to comply with these statutes,the fta must find that the state entity complies with each statute before disbursing federal funds for any transportation project,including an ada accessibility project.but the fta need not undertake separate reviews under each statute.b.furthermore,in determining compliance with these statutes a federal agency such as the fta can rely on state agencies such as the mbta,and on consultants.a.here,the fta,in concluding that the copley station project complied with all these statutes,relied on information,analyses and recommendations prepared by the mbta.the mbta,in turn,relied on consultants.
the mbta initially addressed the requirements of the ada in.the mbta commissioned a consultant to perform a study,the schematic design report the report,that explored options for making these key stations accessible.the report identified several options for locating elevators at the copley square station,and listed advantages and disadvantages of each.it identified four options for locating the outbound elevator option a located the elevator in front of the church,and options b,c,and d located it across the street from the church.the report noted that option a has the most serious historic adjacency issues with respect to the church,but that it created n o major impacts on streetscape elements and infrastructure,required little construction work,and was l ocate d along the main path of access.
the report identified two potential locations for the inbound elevator option e located the elevator adjacent to the existing historic wrought iron subway entrance on the library steps,and option f located it about feet away from the existing entrance without using the library steps.option e called for the construction of a matching structure on the other side of the existing entrance.the report concluded that failure to build this matching structure would seriously compromise the explicit symmetry of the historic landmark composition.it also stated that option e is problematic because it not only creates the very difficult task of imposing new structures along side the intricately detailed wrought iron headhouse,but also creates many interface problems with the boston public library.as for option f,the report noted that it had a lesser streetscape and urban impact than option e,but place d the entrance in a remote location from the main entry to the station,which raised questions of ada compliance and also posed a number of engineering difficulties.
at some point before may,the mbta settled on option e library steps,minus the matching structure,for the inbound elevator,and option a for the outbound elevator,locating the elevator in front of the church.the matching structure for the inbound elevator was rejected because it would have been positioned above the library basement,making it impractical to anchor.meetings were held with representatives of the library and the church no objection was raised to the locations of the elevators.however,on august,plaintiff nabb by letter requested various changes to the project,including the locations for both inbound and outbound elevators.the letter requested that the inbound elevator be placed feet away from the existing library entrance option f,rather than on the library steps,and that the outbound elevator be placed across the street from the church rather than directly in front of it.nabb did not then assert that the placement of the elevators violated federal statutory requirements.
the mbta first addressed the requirements of the various federal historical preservation statutes when it requested that its preservation consultant prepare a report the carolan report.though entitled section and f review,the carolan report only discussed section and did not mention section f at all.nor did the report address the requirements of section f.the report described the project,including the planned elevator locations,and explained the effects of the project.the report concluded that the primary effect of the project would be a visual one,and that the selected designs will not interfere with existing historic architectural structures.the report did not discuss the alternative locations,but concluded that the planned locations and designs for the inbound and outbound elevators would not have an adverse effect within the meaning of section.
on august,based on the carolan report,the mbta sent a letter to the fta stating that i n view of these facts,it is our opinion that the project will have no adverse effect on any historic resources.the mbta request ed a determination of no adverse effect by fta.
as the regulations require the fta by letter formally advised the massachusetts historic commission mhc of the copley station improvement on january,and requested the mhc concurrence in the fta determination that this project will have no adverse effect on historic resources.the parties appear to agree that this letter constitutes the fta finding of no adverse effect under section.the mhc concurred in the fta finding of no adverse effect on january.
as required by section f regulations,in a february,letter to the department of the interior doi,the fta addressed the requirements of section f found that the project complied with section f and requested the doi concurrence in that finding.the fta found that b ased on our review of the attached documentation including the carolan report,renderings and schematics as well as consultation with the massachusetts state historic preservation officer concurrence attached we have determined that in the language of section f there is no prudent and feasible alternative to the proposed project and that all possible measures to minimize harm have been included in the project planning.the doi concurred on may.
in connection with an environmental assessment required by the national environmental policy act nepa the fta on december,issued a finding of no significant impact fonsi as required by nepa.as part of this document the fta further explained its conclusions with regard to f.the fta acknowledged that a n element of the proposed project the inbound elevator will use land from the library,and that the alternative of placing the elevator feet away had not been presented in the mbta earlier f evaluation the carolan report.however,the report concluded that this alternative was not prudent and feasible within the meaning of section f because it would not coincide with the circulation path of the public to the maximum extent practicable,as required by the ada the alternatives for the outbound elevator were rejected for engineering and reasons.
plaintiffs nabb and bpa filed suit under the apa on june,alleging that the fta and mbta violated sections and f of nhpa,and section f of dota in approving the project.the plaintiffs also alleged that the mbta had violated massachusetts general laws chapter,section k,which required the mbta to afford parties a timely opportunity to participate in the development of major transportation projects.
following a hearing,the district court denied plaintiffs request for injunctive relief on november.on november,plaintiffs timely appealed.on december,the district court issued a memorandum and order setting forth its reasoning.
while the district court primarily treated the plaintiffs request as if it were a motion for a preliminary injunction and thus examined likelihood of success,risk of irreparable harm,the balance of the hardships and the public interest,the district court order and memorandum also denied the permanent injunction.
addressing the likelihood of success,the district court rejected the plaintiffs argument that the fta violated the procedural requirements of the section regulations by failing adequately to document its no adverse effect finding,by failing to independently review the project,or by failing to consult with the requisite consulting parties in reaching the conclusion that there would be no adverse effect.the district court also concluded that plaintiffs had not established that the no adverse effect finding was arbitrary and capricious.
next,the district court rejected plaintiffs argument that section f was violated.the court held that section f,which is triggered when an undertaking may directly and adversely affect a national historic landmark,does not apply when an agency properly determines a project has no adverse effect.
the court then rejected plaintiffs contention that section f was violated.the court first addressed the proposed inbound elevator,and held that although the inbound elevator would use a historic landmark,the plaintiffs had failed to establish prudent and feasible alternatives to that use because the proposed alternatives failed to achieve the project purpose of complying with ada requirements.as for the outbound elevator,the district court sustained the agency conclusion that the planned construction would not directly or constructively use a historic landmark,and thus section f did not apply.
finally,the court addressed the plaintiffs state law claim,and held that the mbta had not violated section k because the mbta had afforded the plaintiffs a timely opportunity to participate in the design process.
proceeding with the remaining preliminary injunction factors,the district court found that there was no risk of irreparable harm because the project would have no adverse effect on the properties that the public interest would best be served by making the stations ada accessible as soon as possible and that the balance of hardships favored the mbta and the public because further delays would be expensive and could disrupt the mbta ada accessibility plans.

discussion 
judicial review here is governed by the administrative procedure act,which requires that agency action be set aside if the action was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law or if the action failed to meet statutory,procedural,or constitutional requirements.
precision of expression is not the hallmark of either the historic preservation statutes involved here or the regulations promulgated to implement those statutes.in view of this ambiguity,we defer,where appropriate,to the various agency views as to the applicable requirements.under the chevron doctrine,an agency interpretation of a statute is entitled to weight when the statute is silent or ambiguous.see chevron,natural resources defense council,d.we also owe deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulations.see united states cleveland indians baseball,d.
here,we owe chevron deference to the statutory interpretations reflected in the regulations promulgated by the advisory council on historic preservation achp under sections and,and promulgated by dota under section.we also owe deference to the decision of the fta interpreting the dota regulations,because the fta is an agency within the dot.see cleveland indians,at.we do not owe deference to the fta interpretation of regulations promulgated by other agencies,such as the section and f regulations.nonetheless,we owe deference to the fta no adverse effect finding under sections and,since the fta has jurisdiction to make the finding,even though it does not have interpretive authority.see adams fruit,barrett,d recognizing that agency determinations within the scope of delegated authority are entitled to deference even where the agency does not have interpretive authority and thus is not entitled to chevron deference see also conservation law foundation federal highway,cir holding that administrative decisions under section f are subject to a highly deferential standard of review.
underlying deference to agency action are assumptions that the agencies are better able to articulate the pertinent policies,and to reconcile the policies of potentially conflicting statutes.an equally important assumption is that the agencies will,in fact,carefully consider the policy issues and articulate their resolution with clarity.here the goals of the historic preservation statutes potentially conflict with the mandates of the ada.as we will see,the fta,while adequately performing its assigned task,has fallen short of distinction in doing so,giving little more than the bare minimum attention to historic preservation issues.of even greater concern,the agencies achp,dota,atbcb charged with promulgating regulations interpreting the historic preservation statutes and reconciling them with the ada have issued regulations that are in some respects cryptic and confusing.while we have been able to construe those regulations in the present case so as to resolve the matter at hand,the deficiencies in the existing regulations likely invite further litigation as to future projects.
compliance with section of nhpa 
the national historic preservation act of,et,requires each federal agency to take responsibility for the impact that its activities may have upon historic resources,and establishes the advisory council on historic preservation achp to administer the act.city of grapevine dep t of.
section of the nhpa requires that the fta or any other federal agency,in funding a project,
take into account the effect of the undertaking project on any district,site,building,structure,or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the national register.the head of any such federal agency shall afford the advisory council on historic preservation established under part b of this subchapter a reasonable opportunity to comment with regard to such undertaking.
the library and church are included in the national register.under such circumstances,the achp regulations require the fta to determine whether the project will have an adverse effect on the historic properties.if the agency finds an adverse effect,then the agency must follow procedures under section designed to avoid or mitigate the adverse effects.d a,b failure to resolve adverse effects.see coordination with nepa,including early review.
section is a procedural statute that requires agency decisionmakers to stop,look,and listen,but not to reach particular outcomes.narragansett indian tribe warwick sewer authority,cir.
plaintiffs argue that for various reasons the requirements of section were not met.plaintiffs first contend that the fta committed procedural error during the process leading up to the no adverse effect finding.plaintiffs complain that the fta did not conduct an independent analysis of historical impacts of the undertaking and instead improperly relied on the determination of the carolan report and the mbta.however,the regulations expressly permit an agency to use the services of applicants,consultants,or designees to prepare information,analysis and recommendations,a see also narragansett indian tribe,at the regulations themselves explicitly contemplate the use of consultants to provide analyses for use in the process.
although the plaintiffs urge that there is no indication that the fta made the required independent determination,there is no specific requirement in the statute,the regulations or the apa that the fta provide detailed explanations for its decision or use any particular form of words signifying that it made an independent determination moreover,we are required to presume that the fta abided by the statutory requirements in the absence of any showing that it did not do so.bowen am.hosp,d motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.as the district court found here,p laintiffs offer no credible evidence indicating that the fta did not conduct an independent review,or that it rubber stamped the mbta conclusion of no adverse effects.
we also see no merit in plaintiffs contention that the documentation provided to the mhc by the fta did not adequately explain the basis of the no adverse effect finding.they rely on regulations that require that the documentation enable reviewing parties to understand the basis of the adverse effect finding as required by the regulations.a see also e requiring documentation to support an adverse effect finding.the plaintiffs primary contention is that the underlying documentation did not address alternative locations for the elevators,but there is nothing in the statute or regulations that requires the consideration of alternatives in making the no adverse effect determination.plaintiffs fallback position is that the document did not consider elevator location at all in reaching the no adverse effects finding.this is not correct.the documents,including the carolan report,described in detail the basis for the finding and considered the location of the elevators in making the finding 
turning to the merits,the plaintiffs also contend that the no adverse effect finding is not sustainable.again,we disagree.
plaintiffs argue that the regulations promulgated under section compel a finding of adverse effect.their principal contention is that locating the inbound elevator on the library steps will have an adverse effect on the library.
the section regulations,assessment of adverse effects,set forth the criteria for determining whether an action will have an adverse effect.section a provides that the agency official shall apply the criteria of adverse effect to historic properties within the area of potential adverse effects.section a criteria of adverse effect provides 
an adverse effect is found when an undertaking may alter,directly or indirectly,any of the characteristics of a historic property that qualify the property for inclusion in the national register in a manner that would diminish the integrity of the property location,design,setting,materials,workmanship,feeling or association emphasis added.
the fta relied on various documents to support its no adverse effect finding,including its implicit conclusion that the integrity of the library was not compromised.the plaintiffs argue that the report would only support a finding of no diminishment if the original option e had been adopted using matching headhouses on either side of the library and that the report did not support such a finding with respect to the final plan that eliminated the matching headhouse.plaintiffs correctly point out that the report concluded that the elimination of the matching headhouse would seriously compromise the explicit symmetry of the composition.emphasis added however,the report was not addressed to federal statutory requirements,and the fta primarily relied on the later carolan report,which was prepared after the elimination of the matching headhouse,for this purpose.the carolan report described the historic setting of copley station at length,and concluded that the selected designs will not interfere with existing historic architectural structures.this report amply supports the agency conclusion that the inbound elevator would not have an adverse effect,that it would not diminish the integrity of the historical sites or change the character of features of the library that contribute to its historical significance.the plaintiffs have failed to show that this finding,on which the fta relied,was arbitrary or capricious.
plaintiffs also urge that,even if the fta was not arbitrary and capricious in concluding that the proposed location of the inbound elevator would not diminish the integrity of the library,section a,which lists specific examples of adverse effects,compels an adverse effect finding.this section provides that 
a dverse effects on historic properties include,but are not limited to 
i physical destruction of or damage to all or part of the property 
ii alteration of a property,including restoration,rehabilitation,repair,maintenance,stabilization,hazardous material remediation,and provision of handicapped access,that is not consistent with the secretary standards for the treatment of historic properties cfr part and applicable guidelines 
plaintiffs argue that locating the inbound elevator on the library steps has an adverse effect on the library because disturbing the library steps constitutes p hysical destruction of or damage to all or part of the property under subpart i.
this interpretation is inconsistent with the structure of the regulations.under subpart ii adverse effects include a lteration of a property,including provision of handicapped access that is not consistent with the secretary of the interior standards for the treatment of historic properties part and applicable guidelines.a ii emphasis added.thus,subpart ii effectively recognizes that alterations consistent with the secretary regulations will not create an adverse effect if they are designed to secure handicapped access.in this respect the regulations are evidently designed to avoid potential conflicts with the requirements of the ada.if subpart ii is to be given its full effect,subpart i can not compel an adverse effect finding when a property is physically altered to secure handicapped access in a manner that could be said to damage the property.rather,subpart i must be read to refer only to damage that does not come within the purposes enumerated in subpart ii.in other words,alterations for the provision of handicapped access are governed exclusively by subpart ii.
we similarly reject the plaintiffs contentions that the placement of the inbound elevator could violate subsection iv c hange of the character of the property use or of physical features within the property setting that contribute to its historic significance and subsection v i ntroduction of visual,atmospheric or audible elements that diminish the integrity of the property significant historic features.again,if the project complied with subsection ii,it can not be argued that it failed to comply with subsections iv and v.
we find no merit in plaintiffs confusing contention that there was an adverse effect within the meaning of subpart ii itself.plaintiffs have not shown that the alterations to the library steps are inconsistent with the secretary of the interior standards for the treatment of historic properties set out in part.
we finally reject plaintiffs argument that the placement of the outbound elevator would have an adverse effect on old south church and that placement of both elevators would have an adverse effect on the design of the back bay region of the city,which itself appears in the national register of historic places and that the rehabilitation of the existing wrought iron entrance would constitute an adverse effect under subpart ii.the fta finding of no adverse effect encompassed the project as a whole,including both the inbound and the outbound elevator.the plaintiffs have failed to show that this finding was arbitrary or capricious.
we conclude that the agency finding of no adverse effect must be sustained.
ii.compliance with section f 
plaintiffs next argue that even if the no adverse effect finding was proper under section,section f was violated.section of the nhpa imposes more stringent procedural requirements when national historic landmarks are involved,and is involved here because both the library and the church are national historic landmarks.section f provides 
prior to the approval of any federal undertaking which may directly and adversely affect any national historic landmark,the head of the responsible federal agency shall,to the maximum extent possible,undertake such planning and actions as may be necessary to minimize harm to such landmark,and shall afford the advisory council on historic preservation a reasonable opportunity to comment on the undertaking.
the implementing regulation for section f,calls for the same procedures as section,the procedures specified in and requiring consultation with the achp,but further requires that the agency invite the secretary of the interior to participate in the consultation where there may be an adverse effect and requires that the achp report the outcome of the section process to the secretary of the interior c,d.
unfortunately,in the course of the lengthy review process,the fta did not directly address section f.on appeal the fta and mbta urge that,nonetheless,the district court decision may be affirmed because section f,like section,is only triggered when there has been an adverse effect,and that the section no adverse effect finding that we have already sustained means that section f is inapplicable.
plaintiffs disagree.they point out that the heightened planning and consultation requirements of section are triggered when an undertaking may directly and adversely affect a historic landmark.plaintiffs urge that section f is triggered whenever there is a possible adverse effect,and that a no adverse effect finding is not the same as a finding that there is no possible adverse effect.
we think the language of section f is ambiguous and that this ambiguity is not resolved by the legislative history speaking of the higher standards for compliance with section.that committee report language was not referring to a stricter standard for a section adverse effect finding,but rather to the higher standard imposed once an adverse effect finding has been made.sess,reprinted in,this section does not supercede section,but complements it by setting a higher standard for agency planning in relationship to landmarks before the agency brings the matter to the council.
the achp regulations,to which we owe chevron deference,require an adverse effect finding as a predicate to section f application.section of the regulations,which implements section f,provides that w hen commenting on undertakings that may directly and adversely affect a national landmark,the achp shall use the process set forth in through.a.this process set forth in through repeatedly assumes that an adverse effect is present.section is titled resolution of adverse effects and contains no provision for the situation where an adverse effect is absent,while section deals with failure to resolve adverse effects.in fact,during the section review process,section resolution of adverse effects and failure to resolve adverse effects are triggered only after the agency finds that there is an adverse effect under section d.logically,when the process of sections and is triggered by section f,an adverse effect must be present because that process yields no result otherwise.
plaintiffs appear to urge that these regulations unreasonably interpret the statute to require a present effect,but in fact the regulations specifically contemplate situations in which an adverse effect finding may be based on future injury.thus,for example,section a provides that a dverse effects may include reasonably foreseeable effects that may occur later in time therefore,an agency adverse effect finding would also include the situation where there may be an adverse effect in the future.construing section f to be triggered only upon a finding of adverse effect is therefore perfectly consistent with the use of the word may in section f.
because we conclude section f is not implicated when there is no adverse effect,and the fta properly concluded that the project would have no adverse effects,we reject plaintiffs argument that f was violated.
iii.compliance with section f 
next,we turn to plaintiffs claim that the fta approval of the copley station improvements violated section f 
section f,unlike sections and f,imposes a substantive mandate.c.it imposes a dual requirement,providing that the secretary of transportation may approve a project requiring the use of land of an historic site only if there is no prudent and feasible alternative to using that land and the project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the historic site resulting from the use.c.the supreme court decision in overton park requires courts reviewing agency action under the apa for compliance with f to follow the traditional approach to review of administrative action.citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d citing a,b,c,d,supp.v 
plaintiffs argue that the fta approval of the inbound and outbound elevator locations for the copley station project violates both sections f and f.
a.the inbound elevator 
plaintiffs first argue that the placement of the inbound elevator on the steps in front of the library constitutes a direct use of an historic site for which there is a prudent and feasible alternative under section f.since the defendants agree that the elevator uses the historic site,the o
