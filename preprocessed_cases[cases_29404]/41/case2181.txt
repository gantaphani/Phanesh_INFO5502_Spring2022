this story has no happy ending,and it was unhappy long before the events in question transpired.for years before she ultimately committed suicide in the washoe county jail,brenda clustka clustka struggled with alcohol abuse and serious mental health problems,including suicidal ideation.the longevity of her struggle and the persistence of her problems,however,do not absolve the defendants if they were deliberately indifferent to her serious medical need and as a result played a causal role in her death.
while transporting clustka to civil protective custody,two reno police officers witnessed her wrap a seatbelt around her neck in an apparent attempt to choke herself and then scream that they should kill her or else she would kill herself.the officers failed to report the incident to jail personnel or take her to a hospital.clustka was released from protective custody a few hours later.the next day,she was again detained on a misdemeanor charge.during this second detention,less than hours after the suicide threats,clustka hanged herself in her cell.
when an individual is taken into custody and thereby deprived of her liberty,the officials who hold her against her will are constitutionally obligated to respond if a serious medical need should arise.if,with deliberate indifference,these officials fail to respond appropriately and instead act in a manner that will foreseeably result in harm,they violate her due process rights.the same is true when a municipality,with deliberate indifference,fails to train its law enforcement officers or fails to adopt and implement policies when it is highly predictable that such inaction will result in constitutional violations.
we hold that,on the facts presented,a reasonable jury could find that the defendant police officers are liable under for their deliberate indifference to clustka serious medical need,and that their actions were a cause in fact and a proximate cause of her suicide.likewise,a jury could find the city of reno liable for its failure to train its law enforcement officers or to implement policies on suicide prevention and reporting.for these reasons,and as explained further below,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants and allow clustka surviving children to bring their claims before a jury.
background 
petitioners charla and dustin conn the conns are the surviving children of brenda clustka,who committed suicide on april,while in custody and awaiting trial at the washoe county jail.
clustka had long struggled with mental health problems and suicidal ideation.she also had a history of repeated encounters with the law she had multiple misdemeanor convictions,including for domestic violence,larceny,and driving under the influence.between and,clustka was involuntarily committed to the nevada mental health institute nmhi on three separate occasions under a legal for threatening or attempting suicide.her mental health further deteriorated in.
on march,clustka was arrested for domestic battery of her mother.officer ashton ashton,one of the defendants in this case,was present during the arrest.once in custody,clustka stated that she would make it in jail and was placed on prison suicide watch.she was detained for just over one month and released on april.
a few days later,on april,clustka relapsed into suicidal ideation.she was taken to washoe medical center where she threatened to commit suicide in the emergency room by overdosing on her medication.clustka was evaluated as suffering from acute suicidal ideation and transferred to nmhi on a legal.her nmhi intake assessment states that she was at serious risk of harm.at the next morning,however,clustka was medically evaluated and released.according to the evaluating doctor,clustka denied that she had any suicidal thoughts she said she was feeling tired but otherwise well and was assessed to be only at a low risk of harm at the time of discharge.
several hours later on april,at,ashton and his,officer robertson robertson,were dispatched in response to a call,which reported that someone,who turned out to be clustka,was passed out on the sidewalk.the officers found clustka in a grossly intoxicated state she had a difficult time walking without assistance.ashton,who had been one of the arresting officers handling the domestic battery call a month earlier,recognized clustka on sight.the officers decided to take clustka to washoe county jail on civil protective custody cpc for her own safety until she sobered up.they ran a wants and warrants check and were cautioned of clustka violent tendencies,that she was known to abuse drugs,was an alcoholic and had other mental health problems.ashton admitted that he was aware of clustka violent tendencies and mental health problems nevertheless,the defendants chose not to handcuff her because she was being detained for her own protection,not on a criminal charge.
clustka did not want to be taken to jail she became agitated and uncooperative when told where she was going.robertson then told clustka,falsely,that they would take her,instead,to her residence.robertson testified that he lied because clustka was belligerent,and because he wanted to cajole her into the paddy wagon cooperatively,which he succeeded in doing.
en route to the jail,with her hands free,clustka removed her seatbelt.she began walking around the back of the paddy wagon and tapping on the video surveillance camera to get the officers attention.according to ashton,he asked robertson if they should pull over to secure clustka in her seat,but robertson decided against it,as they were near the jail and he wanted to avoid any further confrontation.both officers believed that there was a reno police department policy and a state law requiring the wearing of seatbelts.
as they neared the jail,clustka realized where she was being taken and became angry,belligerent,and uncooperative.as ashton observed her through the surveillance camera,clustka returned to her seat and wrapped the seatbelt around her neck,in an apparent attempt to choke herself.the officers pulled over,unwrapped the seatbelt from her neck,and her.clustka was screaming as they did so.she yelled something to the effect of,you lied to me.just kill me.i kill myself then.
both ashton and robertson testified that they interpreted clustka words and actions as a mere attempt to get their attention and to manipulate the situation,and that they did not believe clustka threats to be serious.however,ashton admitted that he did not believe that wrapping the seatbelt around her neck was a joke.ashton,who had been on the police force for only seven months,remembered asking robertson,a nearly veteran,whether he should write up a report on the incident,but that robertson said no.robertson testified that he told ashton if he wanted to report it,he could report it.ashton testified that he was unaware of any written policy mandating the reporting of such incidents.
when they arrived with clustka at the jail,neither defendant notified jail personnel that clustka had tried to choke herself or that she had threatened to commit suicide.instead,ashton told jail personnel that clustka was disoriented.the defendants did not write a report nor inform their supervising sergeant about the incident that day.both asserted that it did not occur to them to report it.
upon arrival at the jail,clustka underwent a brief intake assessment,was held in cpc at the washoe county jail for nearly four hours,and was released without further inquiry around upon her release,she was served with a temporary protective order tpo,which her mother had earlier sought and obtained on account of domestic battery.the tpo ordered clustka to stay away from her mother residence,where she had been living,and to retrieve her personal belongings only in the company of police officers.there is no indication whether any other place was available where clustka would be able to sleep.
that evening,notwithstanding the tpo,clustka returned to her mother house,and her mother called to report that clustka was causing a disturbance.clustka,again grossly intoxicated,was taken to the emergency room,readmitted for observation,and released around 
the next day,on april,clustka again returned to her mother residence to collect her belongings and was arrested by two officers not defendants for violating the restraining order.she was returned to washoe county jail.
after clustka was booked,she was medically screened by the nurse on duty and recommended for assignment to the general inmate population.because clustka had been on suicide watch during her previous detention in march,she was placed in the mental health unit in a red jumper to alert staff that she was a high risk detainee.she was not,however,placed on suicide watch at this time.as a result there was a bed sheet available in her cell.
the following morning,on april,clustka was escorted to and from her video arraignment.on the way back from the arraignment,at,she became upset and started crying because she wanted to make a phone call.at,she did not respond to the roll call.a deputy went to check on her and immediately called a code clustka had committed suicide by hanging herself with the bed sheet.
the morning of clustka suicide,ashton happened to be present at the washoe county jail on an unrelated matter.he recognized clustka photograph and told a prison deputy that she tried to choke herself out in the back of the wagon on tuesday.ashton explained to another deputy that a few days earlier,he had transported clustka to that she tried to hang herself in the wagon.he stated that his more senior partner had declined to document the incident.ashton said that he would now write up a report and predicted that his sergeant will be pissed.
from january through august,six detainees in washoe county jail committed suicide.clustka suicide followed less than days after that of another detainee.
on may,less than one month after clustka suicide,the reno police department,apparently for the first time,presented a class on handling the mentally ill to better explain the legal procedures.in may,a new suicide prevention policy was implemented.at intake,the arresting officer must now answer a series of questions concerning the detainee mental health,including questions about suicide risk.this policy was not adopted until after clustka death.
after clustka committed suicide,her surviving children,the conns,filed suit in the district of nevada under.they sued officers robertson and ashton for deliberate indifference to clustka serious medical suicide,they alleged,resulted in her death.they also sued the city of reno under for,inter alia,its failure to train its law enforcement officers and to implement policies on suicide prevention and reporting.the district court found that the conns had presented insufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the officers were deliberately indifferent to a serious medical need by failing to report the choking incident and suicide threat and whether such failure to report was the proximate cause of clustka death.consequently,the district court concluded that there was no basis on which a jury could find either individual liability or municipal liability and granted the defendants motion for summary judgment.the conns appeal,and we reverse.

serious medical need 
we recognize that a prisoner has a serious medical need if the failure to treat the condition could result in further significant injury or the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.doty,at citing mcguckin,at.a heightened suicide risk or an attempted suicide is a serious medical need.see id.citing torraco maloney,cir see also colburn upper darby,cir a particular vulnerability to suicide represents a serious medical need.
the district court did not decide whether summary judgment would be appropriate on the issue of serious medical need,although it commented that the evidence suggested that clustka medical needs were not objectively serious enough to find a amendment violation.we disagree.the conns presented sufficient evidence of their mother objective,serious medical need for a reasonable jury to find in their favor.
first,the significance of clustka medical evaluations around the time of the choking incident and suicide threat is disputed and presents a question for the jury.it is true that clustka underwent several medical evaluations in the days before and after she tried to choke herself in the paddy wagon,and that only one of these evaluations found her to be at serious risk of harm.the defendants argue that,for this reason,the evaluations establish that clustka did not present a serious health risk.their interpretation,however,is not conclusive rather,the conflict in the evaluations in itself raises a genuine issue of fact for the jury to resolve.moreover,due to the police officers failure to report the choking incident and suicide threat,clustka evaluators were unaware of those events when they assessed clustka mental health,and their conclusions were drawn in the absence of significant information that would have supported the conns position.
second,clustka long and undisputed history of mental health problems,alcohol and substance abuse,and suicide threats and suicidal ideation the day before the incident in the paddy the conclusion that the threat to clustka health was objectively serious,and that if untreated,she was likely to suffer further significant injury.
third,the choking incident,accompanied by clustka threat to kill herself,constituted adequate objective evidence of a serious medical need.although ashton conceded that clustka was not joking when she wrapped the seatbelt around her neck,the defendants attempt to minimize the seriousness of clustka situation by characterizing her threats as manipulative as an attempt to catch the officers attention and to avoid going to jail.the members of the jury,however,are entrusted with the responsibility to weigh the officers interpretation of the events against other reasonable inferences more favorable to the plaintiffs.the events may appear differently to the jury than they purportedly did,in hindsight,to ashton and robertson.to the jury,that clustka attempted to choke herself with a seatbelt and screamed at the defendants that they should kill her or she would kill herself may,by itself,be sufficient to establish her serious medical need.this is particularly so since the conns presented evidence that suicide threats by detainees must always be taken seriously.
the defendants contend that,even if clustka truly intended to harm herself,there was no genuine possibility that she would have succeeded in killing herself in the paddy wagon.the defendants argue,rather callously,that the seatbelt would have slackened if and when she passed out,and that clustka was therefore at no real risk of dying.this,of course,is beside the point.whether clustka life was in danger en route to the jail does not affect the more important question whether clustka was at a heightened risk of killing herself in the near future,as she ultimately heightened risk that itself presents a serious medical need.it is not necessary,moreover,that a serious medical need imminently result in attempted suicide is sufficient.see doty,at citing torraco,at.
an objective juror could certainly conclude that in light of all the circumstances clustka actions evidenced a serious medical need.the defendants attempts to cast doubt on the gravity of clustka words and actions merely create a fact question for the jury to resolve.we conclude,therefore,that the conns have raised a genuine issue of material fact as to the question of serious medical need.
d efendant response to the need was deliberately indifferent 
to demonstrate the second must show that the officers were a subjectively aware of the serious medical need and b failed to adequately respond.farmer,at.
subjective awareness 
to be liable under the eighth amendment for denial of medical treatment to a detainee,an official must know of and disregard an excessive risk to inmate health or safety the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,and he must also draw the inference.farmer,at.in other words,the official must demonstrate a subjective awareness of the risk of harm.
ashton and robertson do not dispute that they witnessed clustka wrapping a seatbelt around her neck and yelling that she wanted to die.rather,they assert that they did not believe clustka actions to be a serious threat or attempt of suicide.put in farmer terms,they contend that they did not draw the inference,that clustka was genuinely at risk despite being aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn,id.according to the officers,clustka actions seemed to them an attempt at manipulation.once she realized that she was being transported to jail,clustka tapped repeatedly on the surveillance camera to get the officers attention but received no response.by wrapping the seatbelt around her neck,they explain,she was merely resorting to more dramatic measures to get the officers attention,stop the paddy wagon,and avoid going to jail.the officers,moreover,recall discounting the seriousness of her actions on account of her state of intoxication.they also argue that clustka could not have succeeded in killing herself because the seatbelt would have slackened around her neck once she passed out,thus her threat of suicide could not have been serious.
we may not affirm the district court grant of the defendants motion for summary judgment,however,simply on the basis of the defendants assertions as to their own state of mind.proof of subjective awareness is not limited to the purported recollections of the individuals involved.whether an official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk is a question of fact subject to demonstration in the usual ways,including inference from circumstantial evidence.farmer,at.indeed,in certain circumstances,a factfinder may conclude that an official knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was obvious.id.internal quotations omitted.here,there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to create a genuine issue of fact regarding defendants subjective awareness of clustka serious medical need.
first,the conns have presented evidence from which the jury could conclude that clustka medical need was so obvious that ashton and robertson must have been subjectively aware of it,despite their later denial of that awareness.clustka attempted to choke herself with a seat belt and screamed something to the effect of kill me or i kill myself these are warning signs that are difficult for any observer to miss.the officers,moreover,admittedly knew that clustka was mentally unstable and that she was undergoing a particularly stressful time.clustka detail the officers requested and violent tendencies,known to abuse substances,alcoholic,and other mental health problems.the report also indicated that clustka mother had obtained a restraining order against her.a reasonable jury could conclude that the officers knowledge of clustka mental and emotional instability,coupled with their observation of her dangerous behavior,in fact produced a subjective awareness that clustka was at acute risk of harm and suffered a serious medical need.
second,the conns offer circumstantial evidence to explain why the officers might have failed to report the incident even if they were subjectively aware of clustka medical need.both officers believed that failing to handcuff clustka while transporting her,and failing to fasten her into her seat belt once she unbuckled it,were violations of policy had they reported the incident,they would have had to report their own misconduct.a jury could reasonably conclude that the officers had a motive for remaining silent.
finally,ashton comments both during and after the incident in the paddy wagon establish a genuine question of fact regarding his subjective awareness of the seriousness of clustka well as his discomfort with the way in which he and robertson handled the situation.ashton recalls telling robertson at the time of the incident that clustka was trying to choke herself.the next day before clustka committed approached a senior officer expressing his discomfort with what had transpired.later,when ashton found out about clustka suicide,he told one deputy that clustka had attempted to choke herself in the paddy wagon.a second deputy reported the following conversation 
ashton stated that she looked out the back window and once she realized she was coming to parr the prison she tried to hang herself in the wagon.he stated that he was new and therefore asked his unidentified partner and senior officer if they needed to write a report regarding the suicide attempt.he stated that his partner declined the idea of documenting this occurrence,therefore he did not.
emphasis supplied.ashton went on to say that he would write a report and that his sergeant will be pissed.these contemporaneous and support a reasonable jury conclusion that ashton,at least,was subjectively aware of clustka serious medical need.that he brought his concerns to robertson attention is a factor to consider with respect to whether robertson was also subjectively aware of the problem.
we hold that,cumulatively,the above evidence is sufficient to create a material issue of fact on the question of the subjective awareness of both officers.this is particularly so because questions involving a person state of mind are generally factual issues inappropriate for resolution by summary judgment.mendocino envtl.ctr.mendocino county,cir quotation and internal alterations omitted.we,of course,may not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence.bator hawaii,cir.we must leave the question of subjective awareness to the jury.
failure to respond 
the officers did not take clustka to the medical center,nor did they report her behavior to jail personnel or to their supervising sergeant they did not even write an incident report on the day that clustka tried to choke herself.the defendants do not argue that,if we find that the officers were subjectively aware of clustka serious medical need,they nonetheless responded appropriately.the defendants are not,therefore,entitled to summary judgment on the ground that the officers responded adequately to the situation presented.
h arm caused by the indifference 
the question of causation is closer.we are satisfied,nonetheless,that the conns presented sufficient evidence of actual and proximate causation to defeat summary judgment and give rise to a jury question whether the officers omissions caused clustka eventual suicide.
cause in fact 
the officers failure to report the choking incident and suicide threat is the actual cause of the injury only if the injury would not have occurred but for that conduct.white roper,cir citing prosser keeton,the law of torts hereinafter prosser keeton,at ed.the requisite causal connection can be established not only by some kind of direct personal participation in the deprivation,but also by setting in motion a series of acts by others which the actor knows or reasonably should know would cause others to inflict the constitutional injury.johnson duffy,cir.the conns contend that had the officers responded appropriately to her attempted choking and suicide threat,clustka would not have committed suicide at the time she did and that the officers failure to respond set in motion a sequence of events in which clustka did not receive the medical treatment she urgently needed.we agree that the conns have presented sufficient material evidence on cause in fact such that a jury could reasonably find in their favor.
the conns argue that,had the officers properly responded to the choking incident and threat of suicide in either of two ways,they would have prevented her suicide less than hours later.in support of this assertion,they presented expert testimony to establish the appropriate procedures for handling detainees who threaten that were not followed here.based on this testimony,the conns assert that first,the officers could have properly taken clustka directly to the hospital under a legal procedure and reported the incident to hospital staff.second,the officers could have continued on to the jail and reported the incident to jail personnel upon their arrival.at that point,jail personnel would have either rejected clustka at the door and sent her to the hospital,since the jail can not provide medical treatment during civil protective custody or admitted her and placed her under suicide watch until she was detoxified,then evaluated her and sent her to the hospital under a legal.according to the plaintiffs,under either of these procedures clustka would have received timely suicide intervention services by trained medical personnel who had full information about her most recent suicide attempt.at this point,she would have been kept in the hospital for up to hours or would have,in some other way,received appropriate services in response to her acute risk of suicide.
defendants counter that the outcome of either of these procedures amount s to mere speculation.they point to the fact that on two occasions,including on april,clustka was evaluated at the emergency room and released soon thereafter without being transferred to a psychiatric facility.on three occasions between and when clustka was transferred to nmhi,she did not stay there longer than a day.defendants note that each time a patient is seen at the emergency room,the medical evaluation is based solely on the patient psychological state at that moment.because clustka did not physically harm herself while in cpc on april,there is reason to think that she was no longer suicidal at the moment she was released.consequently,had she been evaluated by medical staff at the prison or hospital at that time,even had the medical staff been fully informed of the choking incident and suicide threat,she may well have been released from the jail or from the emergency room without further intervention.finally,defendants argue that even if the officers had notified jail or hospital personnel of clustka actions and she had been flagged as a suicide risk,if she had been released on april from either cpc or the emergency room,the information about the choking incident and suicide threat would not have been passed along to the jail intake personnel when clustka was detained the next day on the misdemeanor charge therefore,she would not have been put on suicide watch or treated any differently than she was the jail keeps minimal documentation regarding cpc for privacy these detainees have not been charged with a crime and are merely in custody for their own protection.as a result,there is an information gap between cpc and the criminal detention facilities at the jail,and mental health information about cpc detainees will generally be inaccessible if those individuals are later detained on a criminal charge.when,after being released on april,clustka was picked up the next day on a misdemeanor charge,unless the same intake nurse was on duty as on the day before,it is likely that no one at the jail would have known that she had been flagged as a suicide risk in cpc the previous day,and her treatment would have been no different.
when presented to the jury,the defendants argument may well succeed.it is not,however,sufficient to warrant judicial determination of causation as a matter of law.the defendants argument rests on the questionable assumption that knowledge of clustka second suicide threat in two days,if reported upon her arrival at the jail or at a hospital,would not have raised an alarm for medical personnel such that clustka would have received more precautionary treatment than she otherwise did.it presupposes,moreover,that any such treatment would have been ineffective and that,regardless,the subsequent events would have occurred when they did.it makes little sense,however,to argue that the failure to provide access to suicide prevention services has no causal effect on a suicide that transpires less than hours later.if suicide intervention is expected to have no impact on whether someone attempts suicide,why would the city ever bother with the legal procedure suicide prevention services are designed to assess the patient and release her only after a determination that she is no longer at risk.in clustka case,this determination was never made by someone who had all the requisite information about her psychological instability at the time.a jury could reasonably find that the defendants failure to report critical information rendered the subsequent medical evaluations ineffectual.clustka suicide might well have been prevented by effective medical as holding her on a legal for up to that intervention would likely have occurred only if the crucial information about the choking incident and suicide threat were known by the persons making the necessary determinations.
we can not affirm the grant of a motion for summary judgment where,as here,each side has garnered substantial evidence in support of its position,and important facts,including the proper intake procedures for an intoxicated,suicidal detainee,remain in dispute.the conns have presented evidence that knowledge of clustka suicide attempt and threat of future suicide would have made a difference in her medical evaluation,treatment and supervision.we construe that evidence in the light most favorable to the conns.mcdonald,at.there need only be evidence in the record to support the inference that if medical staff had evaluated clustka,prevented her from entering the jail,and directed her to a mental hospital clustka almost certainly would have received the care s he needed,rather than face conditions that worsened her outlook.gibson,at.as the conns have met their burden,we will leave the jury to its proper function of assessing the weight and credibility of that evidence as well as that presented by the defendants.see bator,at.
proximate cause 
once it is established that the defendant conduct has in fact been one of the causes of the plaintiff injury,there remains the question whether the defendant should be legally responsible for the injury.white,at citing prosser k
