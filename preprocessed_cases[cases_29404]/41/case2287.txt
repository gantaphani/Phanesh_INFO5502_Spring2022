ii.claims are not preempted by fehba 
fehba requires that opm contract with qualified insurers so that the insurers can provide healthcare benefits for federal employees.see.fehba preemption provision,m,ensures that fehba benefits are administered uniformly.see hayes prudential ins.of,cir.the preemption provision states 
the terms of any contract under this chapter which relate to the nature,provision,or extent of coverage or benefits including payments with respect to benefits shall supersede and preempt any state or local law,or any regulation issued thereunder,which relates to health insurance or plans.
to preempt causes of action,federal law must both provide remedies that displace state law remedies displacement of remedies and conflict with state law conflict preemption.see botsford blue cross blue shield of montana,cir citing abraham norcal waste,cir discussing complete preemption in the context of the employee retirement income security act of erisa.
displacement of remedies 
by its terms,fehba administrative dispute mechanism applies to disputes between covered individuals and carriers over claims filed under the plan.a.a covered individual is defined as an enrollee or a covered family member.id.a.a claim is defined as a request for payment of a bill or provision of a service or supply.id.all claims must be submitted first to the carrier.see id.a.if the carrier denies the claim in whole or in part,the covered individual may ask the carrier for reconsideration.see id.a,b.if the carrier affirms its denial of the claim,the covered individual may ask opm to review the claim.see id.a,e.fehba implementing regulations impose an express exhaustion requirement,pursuant to which the covered individual must exhaust both the carrier and opm review processes before seeking judicial review of the denied claim.id.a,d.
this preemption mechanism was not designed for,nor available to resolve,contractual disputes between carriers and health care providers.by the express terms of fehba implementing regulations,the administrative process is confined to requests for payment of a bill or provision of a service or supply that are filed under the plan.id.a,a.a provider contractual claim against a carrier does not constitute a request for payment of a bill within the meaning of this provision.and even if it did,it would not be a claim under the plan,because it is predicated not on the plan but on the contract between the carrier and the medical services provider.
moreover,fehba implementing regulations make clear that opm has created a remedial mechanism solely for the claims of covered individuals,not for the claims of providers.a covered individual is an enrollee or a covered family member.id.the regulations provide that the covered individual may ask the carrier to reconsider its denial of a claim and that t he covered individual has months to seek reconsideration.id.a,b emphasis added.thereafter,the covered individual may ask opm to review the claim following a denial by the carrier.id.a emphasis added see also id.b the covered individual may write to opm and request that opm review the carrier decision emphasis added.finally,a covered individual may seek judicial review of opm final action on the denial of a health benefits claim.id.c emphasis added.
fehba implementing regulations do permit other individuals or entities to pursue a claim administratively if they are acting on behalf of a covered individual and have the covered individual specific written consent to pursue payment of the disputed claim.id.a.neither party contends that has specific written consent to pursue payment of a disputed claim.where,as here,a health care provider seeks to recover money on its own behalf pursuant to its contract with a carrier,it is not acting on behalf of a covered individual.thus,can not invoke the admi
