talmadge scobey appeals the district court dismissal on summary judgment of his lawsuit alleging violations of the family and medical leave act fmla,et.we affirm.
in,scobey began working at nucor steel in hickman,arkansas.from to,he worked as a ladle man at the steel mill,a dangerous and demanding position that involved the handling of thousands of pounds of molten steel.this position paid between and and allowed scobey to work on a rotating shift.
this suit arises from nucor demotion of scobey to a position in the company shipping department for having incurred four unexcused absences from april,due to drunkenness.scobey also had two prior unexcused absences in february.under nucor attendance policy,on the fourth occasion of an employee unexcused absence that employee may be terminated from the company.
on saturday,april,scobey attempted to contact his direct supervisor,kirby teeter,and left him a message asking him to return scobey call,apparently without explaining the reason for the call.although teeter attempted to return the call on april,he did not speak with scobey until april.later on april,scobey called randy blakemore,another supervisor and a friend of scobey,and disclosed that his father had passed away and asked how to arrange time off from work in order to attend the funeral.blakemore told him that he should call into work and arrange a swap with another employee.scobey then called paul seratt,a lead man at nucor,to ask if he could take wednesday,april,off from work to attend the funeral.serratt told scobey that he could attend the funeral if,while at work the next day,he arranged for a to work his shift.
on sunday,april,scobey did not come to work and called seratt while intoxicated.seratt stated that 
scobey said he was through and done with us,he was very emotional and i was very concerned over his mental state at the time.i asked him not to do anything stupid,call in for monday and come and talk to kirby teeter,or myself over what he wanted to do or what his options were.
seratt then called blakemore to express his concerns about scobey welfare.later that night,scobey called and told blakemore that he was done,through and then hung up the phone.worried about scobey state of mind,blakemore called scobey back and then met with him in person.during their conversation scobey complained to blakemore about the pressure nucor put on its employees.
on monday,april,teeter spoke with scobey concerning his call on april.scobey told teeter that he had suffered a nervous breakdown and then hung up the phone without any further explanation.teeter stated in an affidavit that scobey speech was slurred and that he had the impression that scobey was intoxicated.due to previous incidents of dishonesty,teeter did not believe scobey claim of a nervous breakdown and thought he was making excuses to avoid work because he was intoxicated.then,scobey called steve segars,a shift manager at nucor,and told him that,due to the death of his former and some personal problems,he would not be back at work for a while.next,scobey drove to seratt house and returned a ladder he had borrowed,but refused to speak with him.on april,scobey did not show up at work and did not contact anyone at nucor.
on april,scobey missed work for the fourth consecutive day.he called and left a message with kellie crain,nucor human resources manager and the person in charge of designating fmla leave,saying that he would call her the next day.on april,scobey called blakemore and told him that he could not recall the previous four days and that he wanted some help.blakemore told scobey to contact hr manager crain.however,scobey and crain were unable to reach each other until april.on april,scobey visited a physician.the physician diagnosed scobey with hypertension,but did not mention depression or alcoholism and did not state that he needed time off from work.when scobey and crain spoke on april,scobey told crain that he had an alcohol problem and that he was depressed.crain set up an appointment with the employee assistance program eap for the next day.
on april,scobey was assessed at nucor eap,which referred him to lakeside behavioral health system for inpatient treatment of alcoholism and depression.on april,lakeside discharged scobey and transferred him to outpatient care following diagnoses for alcohol dependence,alcohol withdrawal,depression,stress disorder,hypertension,and impairment.scobey terminated his outpatient care before its completion.despite this,nucor eap told crain that scobey had completed his initial treatment program.nucor did not designate scobey absences for treatment as fmla leave,but designated it as paid leave from the company.
on may,scobey met with nucor plant manager,sam commella,to determine the appropriate discipline.during the meeting,commella reminded scobey that nucor absenteeism policy permitted termination after four consecutive,unexcused absences.although he admitted to having a taste of beer a few days earlier,scobey asked for a second chance.commella agreed that scobey had made efforts to improve his behavior,and that he could continue his employment with nucor.however,commella suspended scobey for three days and demoted him to an position in nucor shipping department.this new position resulted in a percent reduction in scobey pay and required that he work the night shift.scobey now states that he interpreted his demotion as an attempt by nucor to force him to quit.nonetheless,scobey did not object at the time to his demotion and,during the first two weeks of his new position,he received a pay raise.soon thereafter and without notifying nucor of his intent to leave,scobey stopped coming to work.
scobey then sued nucor,asserting claims of interference and discriminatory retaliation under the fmla.the district court dismissed both claims on summary judgment.the court dismissed his interference claim on the ground that scobey had failed to provide notice that his four absences from april to might be leave.the court dismissed his retaliation claim on the ground that there was no genuine dispute as to whether nucor demoted scobey for absences that were not protected by the fmla.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.battle united parcel,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in reviewing the grant of summary judgment,we view the evidence in favor of the party.battle,at.
under the fmla,an eligible employee is entitled to up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave during a period b ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.rask fresenius med.care,cir quoting a d.a serious health condition is any illness,injury,impairment,or physical or mental condition that involves a inpatient care in a hospital,hospice,or residential medical care facility or b continuing treatment by a health care provider.phillips mathews,cir quoting.under our case law,
t here are two types of claims under the fmla interference or a claims in which the employee alleges that an employer denied or interfered with his substantive rights under the fmla and retaliation or a claims in which the employee alleges that the employer discriminated against him for exercising his fmla rights.
id.quotation omitted citing a.but see id.at colloton,concurring arguing that claims alleging retaliation against an employee for exercising his or her fmla rights are properly understood as interference claims under section a,not discrimination claims under section a.scobey appeals the summary dismissal of his interference and retaliation claims.
in order to state a claim for interference under the fmla,scobey must have given notice of his need for fmla leave.phillips,at.although the fmla statute does not define the type and timing of the notice required when the need for leave is unforeseeable,the department of labor dol 
regulations provide some considerable guidance,and they are generous to employees.notice must be given as soon as practicable,but the employee need not explicitly assert rights under the fmla or even mention the fmla to require the employer to determine whether leave would be covered by the fmla.
rask,at quoting a,b.although recent amendments to the dol regulations have somewhat curtailed this generosity,the regulation in place during the events giving rise to this lawsuit stated that,after notice had been given 
t he employer will be expected to obtain any additional required information through informal means.the employee or spokesperson will be expected to provide more information when it can readily be accomplished as a practical matter,taking into consideration the exigencies of the situation.
however,even before the recent amendments,we have held that an employee must do more than merely call in sick to trigger an employer duties under the fmla.although the employee need not name the statute,he must provide information to suggest that his health condition could be serious.woods daimlerchrysler,cir citation omitted.thorson gemini,cir an employee need not invoke the fmla by name in order to put an employer on notice that the act may have relevance to the employee absence from work.browning liberty mut.ins,cir under the fmla,the employer duties are triggered when the employee provides enough information to put the employer on notice that the employee may be in need of fmla leave.employees thus have an affirmative duty to indicate both the need and the reason for the leave,and must let employers know when they anticipate returning to their position.woods,at quotation omitted.the employer must be made aware that the absence is due to a serious illness so the employer can distinguish it from ordinary,or even malingering,as a type of unusual and privileged absence.rask,at.to hold otherwise would create an unreasonable burden for employers,requiring them to investigate virtually every absence to ensure that it does not qualify for fmla leave.id.
the fmla was designed to protect,in relevant part,the reasonable medical needs of employees with serious health conditions within the limits set by the employer legitimate interest in managing its business.see a,b,b woods,at.as a means of balancing the employee reasonable needs and the employer legitimate interests,an employer may,upon receiving timely and adequate notice of an employee possible incapacity,request a medical certification form stating 
the date on which the serious health condition commenced the probable duration of the condition the appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care provider regarding the condition and for purposes of leave in the instant case,a statement that the employee is unable to perform the functions of the position of the employee.
b b,b b.if it doubts the validity of the first medical certification for any reason,an employer may,at its own expense,seek a second opinion and,when there is a conflict between the first and second certifications,it may seek a third.id.c,d.
scobey contends that he provided nucor with sufficient and timely notice that he had a serious health condition requiring fmla leave during the four unexcused absences from april.having received proper notice,he argues,nucor failed to follow the fmla procedures designed to protect employers by not requesting a medical certification form from a health care provider corroborating that scobey was unable to work.scobey claims that this alleged failure requires that nucor be estopped from denying that he had a serious medical condition protected by the fmla.
scobey principal case in support of this argument is thorson gemini.in thorson,an employee missed more than three days of work and,during her absence,provided two notes from her physician stating that she was unable to work.at.without requesting a medical certification form,the employer summarily terminated her employment for violating its attendance policy.id.the employer did not request a medical evaluation until the employee filed suit several months later.id.at.in that situation,this court held that the employee submission of two doctor notes advising that she should not work put the employer on notice that she might be eligible for leave.id.at.this notice triggered the employer responsibility to count the employee absence as fmla leave or inquire further into the matter by requesting a medical certification form.id.at.having failed to make further inquiries,the employer could not use later medical evaluations to create a genuine issue of material fact as to the validity of the notes from the employee physician excusing her from work.id.at.
whether thorson applies,however,depends first and foremost on whether scobey put nucor on notice that he might be entitled to leave under the flma.only if he provided adequate notice do we need to examine whether nucor defaulted on any obligation to inquire further.having examined the record,we conclude that there is no genuine issue of material fact that scobey did not adequately put nucor on notice.
because the dol regulations state that the timeliness and adequacy of notice are standards dependent on the facts of each case,we must look at the totality of the surrounding circumstances to determine whether sufficient notice was given.see b.for instance,in spangler federal home loan bank of des moines,the employer had known for many years that the employee depression had periodically necessitated time off from work,cir.within this context,the employee statement that she would be absent from work because of her depression again put the employer on notice that she might be entitled to fmla leave.id.at.
in other circumstances we have found notice to be insufficient.in woods,we held that notice must contain an explanation of the condition rendering the employee unable to work in order to adequately apprise the employer that the condition may be protected by the fmla.at,holding that two doctor notes stating that employee was advised to remain off work were inadequate because they did not mention the nature of the illness similarly,in rask,we held that an employee who informed her employer that she had been diagnosed with depression had not given adequate notice because d epression is a condition with many variations and the employer would need additional details before being on notice that her condition rendered her unable to work.at.rask distinguished spangler on the ground that the employer had no previous knowledge of the employee depression and lacked any indication that it was so serious as to render her unable to work.id.at.
scobey argues that woods and rask impose burdens on employees in excess of the minimal notice obligations in.citing a seventh circuit case,scobey argues that probable cause is the appropriate standard for determining adequacy of notice.see aubuchon knauf fiberglass,gmbh,cir t he employee duty is merely to place the employer on notice of a probable basis for fmla leave.whether the seventh circuit uses a standard different in any significant respect from the standard used in this circuit,we need not address.we are bound by our case law,not that of one of our sister circuits.
scobey also asks us to adopt the constructive notice doctrine,which states that either an employee inability to communicate his illness to his employer or clear abnormalities in the employee behavior may constitute constructive notice of a serious health condition.stevenson hyre,cir citing byrne avon,cir.we have serious doubts about the continuing validity of constructive notice in the fmla context.the seventh circuit in byrne avon prods.relied on a previous version of a,which stated that,when leave is unforeseeable,i t is expected that an employee will give notice to the employer within no more than one or two working days of learning of the need for leave,except in extraordinary circumstances where such notice is not feasible.at adding emphasis based on this extraordinary circumstances exception,the court in byrne concluded that an employee aberrant or unusual behavior could,in some cases,be itself notice that something had gone medically wrong,or perhaps excuse notice id.at.however,the d
