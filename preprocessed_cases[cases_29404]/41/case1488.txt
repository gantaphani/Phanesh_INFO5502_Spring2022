this opinion resolves fuesting petition for rehearing and addresses the question of what relief the court of appeals has the power to award where there was prejudicial evidentiary error in the district court.our august,decision in this case found prejudicial error in the district court decision to admit fuesting expert testimony and remanded with instructions to enter judgment in favor of zimmer.see fuesting zimmer,cir.subsequently,fuesting filed a petition for rehearing.we stayed consideration of the petition because the supreme court had granted a writ of certiorari on the question of whether a court of appeals can review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a civil jury verdict where the appellant failed to renew its rule a motion after the verdict.see unitherm food systems,d.we ordered the parties to file responsive memoranda,if they so chose,within days of the supreme court decision.on january,the supreme court rendered its decision.unitherm food systems,d.the parties have submitted responses,and fuesting argues that the unitherm decision precludes this court from awarding any relief to zimmer because zimmer failed to file,after the verdict,either a rule b motion for judgment as a matter of law or a rule motion for a new trial.zimmer argues that unitherm only addresses appeals based on the sufficiency of the evidence,and does not disturb this court decision,which was based on the improper admission of testimony.we conclude that unitherm does not prevent us from granting zimmer relief from the district court error.the proper remedy,however,should have been the grant of a new trial.for reasons discussed in more detail below,we grant the petition for rehearing and vacate only the portion of our prior opinion directing the district court to enter judgment for the defendant.
background 
fuesting filed this suit against zimmer,the manufacturer of his failed prosthetic knee,alleging negligence and strict liability.our prior decision explains the factual background and discusses in detail our reasons for concluding that,pursuant to daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,the district court erred in admitting the testimony of james pugh,fuesting expert witness.see fuesting,at.in this opinion,we assume familiarity with our prior decision and will discuss only the relevant procedural history.
prior to trial,zimmer moved in limine to exclude the testimony of pugh,pursuant to federal rule of evidence.the district court denied zimmer motion in limine and the trial proceeded.pugh testified at trial,as did fuesting orthopaedic surgeon,james mckechnie.both pugh and mckechnie offered opinions on zimmer causation of fuesting injuries specifically,they testified that zimmer air sterilization method led to fuesting injuries.fuesting did not offer any other medical or expert witnesses and only introduced the deposition testimony of zimmer chief scientific officer.at the close of evidence,zimmer moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a.the district court denied the motion and submitted the case to the jury.on april,the jury returned a verdict in favor of fuesting.though the court granted zimmer motion to extend the time to file postverdict motions,zimmer never renewed its rule a motion for judgment as a matter of law and did not file any postverdict motions.zimmer subsequently filed its appeal,arguing that it was entitled to a new trial because the district court erred in admitting pugh testimony,and the jury instructions were erroneous.
we concluded that,pursuant to daubert and rule,pugh testimony was scientifically unreliable and the district court committed prejudicial error in admitting the testimony.see fuesting,at.because we deemed the remaining evidence insufficient for fuesting to establish his claims as a matter of law,we reversed and remanded to the district court with instructions to enter judgment for zimmer.
ii.analysis 
the question before us is what relief,if any,may be awarded to zimmer in light of the supreme court decision in unitherm.in that case,the plaintiff,unitherm,sued conagra seeking a declaration that a conagra patent was invalid.unitherm.at.prior to the submission of the case to the jury,conagra moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule a,arguing that the evidence was insufficient for a reasonable jury to find in unitherm favor.id.at.the district court denied the motion.id.after the jury returned a verdict for unitherm,conagra appealed without filing any postverdict motions.id.on appeal,the federal circuit found that the evidence unitherm presented was legally insufficient to support the verdict,and therefore it vacated the jury judgment and ordered a new trial.id.the supreme court concluded that,in the absence of postverdict rule or motions,the court of appeals was without the power to assess the sufficiency of the evidence and could not award a new trial or order the entry of judgment for conagra.see id.at we hold that since respondent failed to renew its preverdict motion as specified in rule b,there was no basis for review of respondent sufficiency of the evidence challenge in the court of appeals.
unitherm compels us to vacate our instructions to the district court to enter judgment for zimmer because the supreme court has now indicated that a court of appeals may not award judgment due to insufficiency of the evidence where no rule b motion was filed after the verdict.the court stated 
this court has addressed the implications of a party failure to file a postverdict motion under rule b on several occasions and in a variety of procedural contexts.this court has concluded that,i n the absence of such a motion an appellate court is without the power to direct the district court to enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand.cone west virginia pulp paper.
unitherm.at bracketed text in original parallel citations omitted.though our prior decision was not explicitly framed as a determination that the evidence was insufficient,on review we conclude that weighing the value of fuesting remaining evidence after excising pugh expert testimony crossed the line into activity proscribed by unitherm.
our conclusion exposes a subtle tension between the ability of the appellate court to engage in harmless error analysis and the court responsibility not to weigh the sufficiency of the evidence in the absence of a properly filed postverdict motion determining whether an evidentiary error is harmless necessarily requires some weighing of the sufficiency of the evidence.our prior decision in this case is a paradigmatic example of this tension,since we were required to assess the sufficiency of the remaining evidence the testimony of fuesting orthopaedic surgeon and the deposition excerpts in the absence of the testimony we deemed inappropriately admitted in order to determine whether the district court error prejudiced zimmer.see fuesting,at without pugh testimony,fuesting can not establish either defect or negligence and,save for mckechnie sparse testimony on the subject fuesting has offered no other evidence as to causation.
unitherm suggests that it will usually be inappropriate for a court of appeals to award judgment in the absence of a properly filed rule b motion because awarding judgment involves a complete examination of the sufficiency of the evidence that must take place first in the district court see unitherm.at.we thus erred in awarding judgment to zimmer.
however,unitherm does not foreclose the ability of the appellate court to order a new trial where evidence was improperly admitted.to the extent that the court held that awarding a new trial would be improper in unitherm,the court was specifically addressing the situation of a litigant seeking a new trial on the basis of the insufficiency of the evidence.see unitherm.at respondent seeks a new trial based on the legal insufficiency of the evidence emphasis in original.the court did not hold that a court of appeals may not award a new trial on the basis of an erroneous evidentiary decision.
there is some potential for confusion because unitherm includes some strong language regarding the necessity of p
