the united states court of federal claims affirmed the special master decision denying petitioner compensation under the national childhood vaccine injury act of,to vaccine act.sec y of health human servs.trial court decision.because the special master factual determinations were not arbitrary or capricious and the decision was in accordance with law,this court affirms.
petitioner alleges that an influenza vaccination he received at the age of resulted in the onset of multiple sclerosis or significantly aggravated his preexisting,but asymptomatic,multiple sclerosis.trial court decision.at.multiple sclerosis is a disorder of the central nervous system that causes clinical symptoms including weakness,loss of coordination,speech disturbances,and visual complaints.id.at.the cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown.sec y of health human servs.special master decision,wl,at.for many years,researchers have considered multiple sclerosis to be an autoimmune disease.id.the disease may begin with a breach in the barrier that allows cells from the immune system to cross into the brain.id.these immune cells may mistakenly attack the myelin sheath that coats nerve cells.id.this attack would cause inflammation and subsequent scarring of the brain,called lesions.id.
petitioner suffers from the most common type of multiple sclerosis,known as relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.id.at.patients with this type of multiple sclerosis usually have about one relapse of clinical symptoms per year.id.much of the disease process is clinically silent,meaning that a person can have active brain inflammation and develop new lesions without experiencing relapse,clinical symptoms.bruce trapp and klaus armin nave,multiple sclerosis an immune or neuodegenerative disorder,annu.neurosci.brain imaging studies in patients with multiple sclerosis indicate that inflammatory brain lesions can outnumber relapses by as much as to.id.in this context,the term clinical symptoms refers to the symptoms associated with a relapse,numbness and loss of motor function,as distinguished from brain lesions,which are also a symptom of multiple sclerosis.
medical professionals use magnetic resonance imaging mri to observe lesions in the brain of a patient diagnosed with or suspected to have multiple sclerosis.id.at.by administering a contrast agent called gadolinium before an mri,medical professionals can locate active inflammation at the site of a brain lesion.id.in active brain inflammation,a breakdown in the barrier permits gadolinium to enter the brain.id.when gadolinium enters the brain,active lesions appear on an mri as enhanced.id.after inflammation subsides,the body repairs the barrier and lesions no longer appear enhanced.id.most new lesions approximately first appear as enhanced on mri for a period of time,while older lesions do not enhance.id.the trial court dedicated considerable time to considering the length of time that new lesions appear enhanced on mri.see part iii.below.
petitioner received the influenza vaccine on december.special master decision,wl,at.before then,petitioner had no clinical symptoms of multiple sclerosis or other neurological problems.id.on december,petitioner experienced numbness in his left hand,arm,and the left side of his head and face.id.an mri performed on december,identified six scattered lesions in petitioner brain,none of which were enhanced on the gadolinium mri.id.at.the interpreting physician noted the mri in conjunction with the patient clinical history suggest multiple sclerosis as a possible etiology.id.at.
petitioner experienced another episode of numbness and loss of motor function in his left hand and arm in january.id.at.petitioner then saw a neurologist,john hannam,who suggested that petitioner might have multiple sclerosis.hannam noted that if petitioner had multiple sclerosis,i ca blame it on the flu shot.id.hannam recommended a second opinion from rifaat bashir,who specializes in multiple sclerosis.id.bashir noted that petitioner mri is certainly consistent with a demyelinating disease.he could have had a single isolated event possibly related to his vaccination which he did receive two weeks before the event.id.after two additional mris,the latter of which showed a new,enhanced lesion,bashir diagnosed petitioner with multiple sclerosis.id.at.
petitioner filed a claim for compensation under the vaccine act in june,alleging the influenza vaccine caused his multiple sclerosis or significantly aggravated his,subclinical multiple sclerosis.in support of his claim,petitioner presented an expert report and testimony by carlo tornatore,the director of the multiple sclerosis center at georgetown university hospital.id.at.tornatore opined that the influenza vaccine caused petitioner multiple sclerosis through a process called molecular mimicry.id.in this process,the immune system attacks normal proteins in the body because they are structurally similar to foreign substances,such as viral or bacterial peptides.id.at.specifically,tornatore opined that portions of the influenza vaccine mimic myelin basic protein,a component of the central nervous system that is implicated in multiple sclerosis.id.according to tornatore theory,the influenza vaccine could trigger production of immune cells called that are with myelin and therefore attack the person own nerve cells.id.
on february,the special master denied petitioner compensation under the vaccine act.id.at.the special master found petitioner had multiple sclerosis before receiving the influenza vaccine and therefore the vaccine could not have caused petitioner disease.id.further,the special master found petitioner did not establish a plausible medical theory that the influenza vaccine causes significant aggravation of multiple sclerosis.id.the court of federal claims affirmed.trial court decision.at.petitioner appeals,and this court has jurisdiction under f.
when reviewing decisions under the vaccine act,this court performs the same task as the court of federal claims and determines anew whether the special master findings were arbitrary or capricious.lampe sec y of health human.this court reviews the special master legal determinations under a not in accordance with law standard.pafford sec y of health human.
the vaccine act created the national vaccine injury compensation program,which allows certain petitioners to be compensated upon showing,among other things,that a person sustained,or had significantly aggravated a illness,disability,injury,or condition.c c.the vaccine act provides two avenues to compensation table claims and claims.althen sec y of health human.in a table claim,the petitioner benefits from a statutory presumption of causation upon showing that the injury is listed in the vaccine injury table for the vaccine received and occurred within the time period in the table.a see althen,at.if the injury is not listed in the table,the petitioner must prove actual causation by a preponderance of the evidence.c c ii,a moberly sec y of health human.multiple sclerosis is not on the vaccine injury table.see.
in this case,the petitioner must show that it is more probable than not that the vaccine caused the injury.althen,at.this level of proof does not require scientific certainty,nor epidemiologic studies such as might be needed for a theory to achieve general acceptance in the scientific or medical communities.andreau sec y of health human,internal quotations omitted.indeed,the purpose of the vaccine act preponderance standard is to allow the finding of causation in a field bereft of complete and direct proof of how vaccines affect the human body.althen,at.
nonetheless,the petitioner must do more than demonstrate a plausible or possible causal link between the vaccination and the injury he must prove his case by a preponderance of the evidence.moberly,at.specifically,a petitioner seeking to prove causation in an case must provide a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury and a showing of a proximate temporal relationship between vaccination and injury.althen,at.n either a mere showing of a proximate temporal relationship between vaccination and injury,nor a simplistic elimination of other potential causes of the injury suffices,without more,to meet the burden of showing actual causation.id.citing grant sec y of health human.
in this case,petitioner argues in the alternative that if the influenza vaccine did not cause his multiple sclerosis,then it significantly aggravated his preexisting condition.this court has not previously addressed the proof required to establish a prima facie case of significant aggravation for an claim.
in whitecotton sec y of health human,this court articulated a test to evaluate an significant aggravation claim.whitecotton requires the special master to compare the injured person condition prior to vaccination with his or her current condition to determine whether a significant aggravation occurred,and then determine whether the first symptom of aggravation occurred within the time period in the table.id.if so,the petitioner receives the statutory presumption that the vaccine caused the aggravation.
here,petitioner asserts that the vaccine act does not make a distinction between and claims of significant aggravation.pet r br.he therefore suggests that under whitecotton,he need only show that his condition worsened after administration of the vaccine,and that the aggravation occurred within a medically appropriate time frame.id.
this argument runs counter to the language of the statute.the statute distinguishes table claims from claims for both initial onset and significant aggravation cases.see c c i table claims and c c ii claims.for claims that an injury was either sustained,or significantly aggravated,a petitioner must show the vaccine caused the injury or aggravation.c c ii.as this court previously observed in the context of claims,t he statutory requirements to make out a prima facie significant aggravation claim are analogous to those required to make out a prima facie initial onset claim.whitecotton,at.thus,a petitioner in an case must show the vaccine actually caused the significant aggravation not just that,accepting petitioner medical theory as sound,the person condition worsened within a time frame.
in loving sec y of health human,the court of federal claims articulated a test for proof of significant aggravation claims.the loving test combines the first three whitecotton factors,which establish significant aggravation,with the althen factors,which establish causation.we hold that the loving case provides the correct framework for evaluating significant aggravation claims.a petitioner must prove by preponderant evidence that the vaccination caused significant aggravation by showing 
the person condition prior to administration of the vaccine,the person current condition or the condition following the vaccination if that is also pertinent,whether the person current condition constitutes a significant aggravation of the person condition prior to vaccination,a medical theory causally connecting such a significantly worsened condition to the vaccination,a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the significant aggravation,and a proximate temporal relationship between the vaccination and the significant aggravation.
in analyzing petitioner claim that the influenza vaccine caused his multiple sclerosis,the special master identified a preliminary question of whether petitioner had subclinical multiple sclerosis before the vaccination.special master decision,wl,at.because the special master found it was more likely than not that petitioner had multiple sclerosis before receiving the vaccine,he recognized the vaccine could not have caused the disease.id.at.the special master therefore denied compensation without applying the causation test set forth in althen.id.at althen,at.
the special master cited broekelschen secretary of health human services,as support for resolving a preliminary issue before conducting an althen analysis.in broekelschen,this court held the special master did not err by preliminarily determining which of two possible diagnoses was correct before determining whether the vaccine caused the condition.id.at.unlike in broekelschen,the parties in this case agree on petitioner diagnosis.because the issue is whether the vaccine caused petitioner multiple sclerosis,the special master should have expressly applied the analysis set forth in althen.
while this court disagrees with the special master suggestion that althen could be bypassed in this case,the court of federal claims correctly determined the error was harmless.see trial court decision.at.the special master finding that petitioner had multiple sclerosis before receiving the vaccine means that petitioner did not establish a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for his injury as required by prong two of althen.at.if a petitioner has a disorder before being vaccinated,the vaccine logically can not have caused the disorder.
additionally,prong three of althen requires a temporal relationship between vaccination and onset of symptoms.id.at de bazaan sec y of health human,holding a petitioner causation claim may fail because disease onset occurs too early to be attributable to the vaccine.in this case,petitioner first episode of numbness occurred eleven days after the vaccination a time period which the government expert agreed would be consistent with petitioner medical theory that the influenza vaccine triggered an disorder.however,the special master found petitioner first symptom of multiple sclerosis telltale lesions in the brain appeared before the vaccination.special master decision,wl,at.this finding implies that the disease onset did not occur within a time frame for which it is medically acceptable to infer,such that petitioner claim did not meet althen prong three.de bazaan,at.
because a petitioner must establish all three prongs of the althen test,it was not necessary for the special master to evaluate whether petitioner established a medical theory as required by althen prong one.the lack of a logical sequence of cause and effect,and the lack of a temporal relationship between the vaccination and disease onset,prevented petitioner from establishing his claim.in sum,the special master finding that petitioner had multiple sclerosis before he was vaccinated necessarily implies that petitioner could not demonstrate causation under althen.
the special master underlying factual findings that petitioner had multiple sclerosis before receiving the influenza vaccine were not arbitrary or capricious.the special master carefully evaluated the clinical record,expert testimony,and medical literature in finding it is more probable than not that at least some,if not all,of the six lesions detected on petitioner december,mri existed before the december,flu vaccination.special master decision,wl,at.
the parties dispute the implications of the december,mri that the trial court used to gauge when petitioner developed multiple sclerosis.see id.at.the december,mri showed six lesions in petitioner brain,none of which were enhanced by gadolinium.id.at.the government expert,arun venkatesan,an assistant professor in the department of neurology at john hopkins university,testified that if the vaccination caused the lesions,at least one of them should have been enhanced when the mri was done days after vaccination.id.petitioner expert,tornatore,responded that the december,mri was not useful in determining whether the lesions were present before the vaccination.id.at.
venkatesan supported his opinion with a published article studying the duration of gadolinium enhancement of lesions identified in weekly mris performed on multiple sclerosis patients.francois cotton et,mri contrast uptake in new lesions in relapsing remitting ms followed at weekly intervals,neurology cotton study.the cotton study determined the average duration of enhancement was weeks,while the median duration was weeks.id.at.importantly,because mris were performed only once per week,a lesion that appeared enhancing for week may have been enhancing for anywhere from one to
