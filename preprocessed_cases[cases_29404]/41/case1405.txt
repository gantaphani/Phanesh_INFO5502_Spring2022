brian dotson was terminated from his employment with brp brp after filing a claim for compensation under the illinois workers compensation act wca.see ilcs et.dotson absence from work exceeded the amount of time allowed by the company absenteeism policy,which tracks the time allotted by the family and medical leave act,et.fmla.dotson sued his employer under illinois law,alleging that the discharge was in retaliation for filing a workers compensation claim.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of brp after concluding that no reasonable jury could conclude that dotson discharge was due to retaliation.we affirm.
brp manufactures recreational products,including personal watercraft.dotson began working for brp in in a job called grind and trim.dotson duties entailed drilling and cutting,sometimes in cramped spaces,under boats.on january,dotson injured his back while grinding under a boat.he worked a few days on light duty status and then,at brp direction,he saw dallas lipscomb on january,lipscomb referred dotson to mcguire,a chiropractor,and kevin rutz,an orthopedic spine specialist.dotson saw rutz on february for an independent medical evaluation that had been requested by gallgher bassett services gallagher on behalf of the workers compensation carrier for brp.rutz performed surgery on dotson lower back in march,and gave him a limited duty work release at the end of june.rutz released dotson for full duty in august.from january through the august work release,dotson was unable to perform the grind and trim job due to his injury.
brp absenteeism policy tracked the minimum amount of leave mandated by the fmla.the company allowed workers up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave in any rolling period for qualifying absences.translating that into hours,brp allowed hours of absence under the fmla,and under its absenteeism policy.according to brp employee handbook,
all fmla time runs concurrent with short term disability and worker compensation or any qualifying event.when an employee has exhausted twelve weeks of fmla time during a rolling calendar year,employment with brp may be terminated.
although that passage implied that termination at the end of twelve weeks was optional,the very next sentence clarified the meaning 
an employee who is unable to work for more than twelve weeks will be considered automatically terminated at the expiration of that period,regardless of the reason for the inability to work.
in both policy and practice,brp terminated any employee who exceeded twelve weeks of fmla leave in a twelve month period.
prior to injuring his back,dotson had already used hours of fmla leave during the previous twelve months.on january,brp notified dotson by letter that he might be eligible for fmla leave due to his injury,that he had hours approximately days of fmla leave remaining after other uses,and that any fmla leave would run concurrently with workers compensation and short term disability benefits.one brp employee told dotson his fmla leave would expire on february,but a february letter from brp informed dotson that his leave would expire on february by the company calculations.dotson questioned whether he needed fmla leave at all,believing that as long as his absence was covered by workers compensation,the time did not count against his fmla total.brp told dotson that if he did not apply for fmla leave,he would be terminated immediately,and so dotson signed the paperwork,and then later tried to revoke his request.dotson collected total temporary disability payments throughout his absence for this injury.of course,as we noted above,dotson doctors performed his back surgery in march,and did not release him for full work duty until august.on february,brp sent dotson a letter purporting to terminate his employment due to excessive absenteeism.
dotson sued brp under the wca,specifying three particular acts or omissions that harmed him.first,he alleged that brp terminated his employment after he attempted to return to work with restrictions for a injury second,he complained that brp wrongfully required him to utilize fmla leave rather than affording him temporary total disability time as authorized by law.finally,he asserted that brp violated the wca by wrongfully terminating him for exercising his lawful right to claim workers compensation benefits.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of brp,finding that dotson failed to show a causal connection between his workers compensation claim and his termination.the court noted that excessive absenteeism,if not a pretext,is a valid basis for discharging an employee,even if the employee absence is due to a injury compensable under the wca.because dotson presented no evidence that brp stated reason of excessive absenteeism was pretextual,the court found that dotson could not demonstrate that the discharge was retaliatory.dotson appeals.
on appeal,dotson frames eight separate issues which boil down to a few distinct theories.according to dotson,an employer may not lawfully force an employee to take fmla leave,may not terminate an employee who is absent for a injury,and may not count leave covered by workers compensation toward the fmla total.dotson sees each of these actions by brp as evidence that brp discharged him in retaliation for exercising his rights to workers compensation.however,all of dotson arguments are premised on misconceptions about workers compensation,the fmla,and retaliatory discharge.
although some of dotson arguments allude to violations of the fmla,dotson complaint was founded entirely on the illinois tort of retaliatory discharge,and that is where we begin.to make out a claim for retaliatory discharge under illinois law,an employee must demonstrate that the employee has been discharged that the discharge was in retaliation for the employee activities and that the discharge violates a clear mandate of public policy.hartlein illinois power.the illinois supreme court determined nearly thirty years ago that a discharge in retaliation for an employee exercise of workers compensation rights violated the public policy of the state.see kelsay motorola,r etaliatory discharge is offensive to the public policy of this state as stated in the workmen compensation act.this policy can only be effectively implemented and enforced by allowing a civil remedy for damages.to make out a claim for retaliation in the workers compensation context,dotson must show that he was the defendant employee before his injury that he exercised a right granted by the workers compensation act and that he was discharged from his employment with a causal connection to his filing a workers compensation claim.mccoy maytag,cir.see also carter tennant,cir.the only element of this formulation that is under dispute is the causal link between dotson exercise of his right to workers compensation benefits and his termination.the burden is on the employee to demonstrate that the termination was motivated by an unlawful intent to retaliate against the employee for exercising a statutory right to workers compensation benefits.feldman american memorial life ins,cir.the element of causation is not met if the employer has a valid basis,which is not pretextual,for discharging the employee.hartlein,at.thus,illinois law does not require an employer to retain an employee who is medically unable to perform the job.nor is the employer obliged to reassign the employee to another position rather than terminate the employee.id.finally,and most importantly in this case,an employer may fire an employee for excess absenteeism,even if the absenteeism is caused by a compensable injury.id.
consonant with that final point,brp contends that it terminated dotson not because he sought workers compensation benefits but rather because he exceeded his allotment of leave under the company policy for excessive absenteeism.brp policy,both in writing and in practice,was to terminate any worker who exceeded twelve weeks of fmla leave.according to brp,dotson exhausted his twelve weeks by the end of february,having used more than half of the allotment for other purposes before this injury occurred.because dotson physician did not r
