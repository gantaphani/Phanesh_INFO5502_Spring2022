before the legislative session,missouri provided dme as a medicaid benefit to all recipients.under the dme program,plaintiffs received wheelchairs,wheelchair batteries and repairs,orthotics,orthopedic devices,parenteral nutrition,augmentative communication devices,hospital beds,bed rails,lifts,and other prosthetics.see.repealed august.citing budget constraints,the general assembly passed a new statute eliminating the dme program as a covered medicaid service,except for recipients who are blind,pregnant,or needy children,or for those who receive home health care services under the state plan.see.supp providing an exception for wheelchairs,prosthetics,and orthopedic devices to these individuals.under the revised statute,medicaid recipients may not receive dme as a benefit,unless they fall within one of the statutory groups.
plaintiffs have never challenged the statute elimination of the dme program.rather,plaintiffs contest a september emergency regulation,which reinstates coverage of certain dme items for all medicaid recipients,while specifically defining the dme items for the blind,pregnant,and needy children,and those receiving home health care.see regs.ann.tit,
under the regulation,the blind,pregnant,needy children,and individuals who receive home health care may receive medicaid coverage for dme items that include,but are not limited to 
prosthetics orthotics oxygen and respiratory care equipment parenteral nutrition ostomy supplies diabetic supplies and equipment decubitus care equipment wheelchairs wheelchair accessories and scooters augmentative communication devices and hospital beds.
id.all other adult medicaid recipients can not receive dme,except for 
prosthetics,excluding an artificial larynx ostomy supplies diabetic supplies and equipment oxygen and respiratory equipment,excluding cpaps,bipaps,nebulizers,ippb machines,humidification items,suction pumps and apnea monitors and wheelchairs,excluding wheelchair accessories and scooters.
the regulation further clarifies that,for all dme recipients,dme is equipment that can withstand repeated use,is primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose,generally is not useful to a person in the absence of an illness or injury,and is appropriate for use in the home.id.even if an item is classified as dme,it is not covered unless it both meets the dme definition and is reasonable and necessary for treatment of the illness or injury,or to improve the functioning of a malformed or permanently inoperative body part.id.
plaintiffs,adult medicaid recipients,have disabilities ranging from paralysis to cardiopulmonary disease.before the new regulation,they received dme from medicaid.under the new regulation,however,plaintiffs claim they are ineligible to receive dme items that are necessary for their medical care and independence which they can not afford.compared to the repealed dme program,they argue,the new regulation excludes for most recipients orthotics,parenteral nutrition,catheters,augmentative communication devices,hospital beds,bed rails,lifts,and wheelchair batteries and repair items.
rather than attack the revised statute,plaintiffs seek to enjoin the dme regulation.plaintiffs agree that missouri may lawfully provide additional benefits only to needy children and pregnant women.see a g v,p pregnant women a b,r,b needy children.plaintiffs contend that missouri may not provide additional dme benefits to blind recipients unless missouri provides those benefits to all adult recipients.plaintiffs assert violations of federal comparability and requirements that the state treat medicaid recipients equally and with reasonable,standards.see a b,a.see also.they also claim that the state regulation conflicts with these federal requirements,and is preempted by the supremacy clause.const.art.vi,cl.
in the district court,the state defended the dme regulation primarily by arguing that it had applied to the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for a waiver of the federal comparability requirement,which would permit additional benefits for the blind.see b.the state argued that the waiver application defeated plaintiffs likelihood of success on the merits.the state also claimed that plaintiffs can still obtain necessary dme if they qualify for home health care,or seek an exception for dme items through the exceptions process.due to these options,said the state,the dme regulation did not harm plaintiffs enough to justify an injunction.
the district court denied a preliminary injunction.the court focused entirely on plaintiffs comparability claim,and did not discuss the claim.specifically,the court determined that,because plaintiffs had other options to receive necessary dme,they could not establish irreparable harm.moreover,the court agreed that missouri pending waiver application precluded a likelihood of success on the merits.the court noted,however,that if the waiver were not obtained,missouri could not provide additional items of dme to the blind without providing them to all adult recipients.plaintiffs appeal 
before addressing the merits,this court must resolve the issue of jurisdictional issue raised in the state supplemental brief and at oral argument.see ali cangemi,cir en banc if an issue is moot in the article iii sense,we have no discretion and must dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction.the record has significantly changed since plaintiffs first appealed.cms has now denied missouri request for a comparability waiver.while cms recommended a number of alternatives that may allow missouri to provide additional dme services to the blind,missouri chose to submit an amended medicaid plan that deletes any reference to federal financial participation for additional services to the blind.to date,cms has not approved or rejected the amended plan negotiations are ongoing.while the revised missouri statute and dme regulation have not changed,the state contends that it provides additional dme to the blind only with state tax funds,with no federal funding.
the state argues that its decision to fund the dme program for blind recipients only with state dollars makes the amended plan comply with all medicaid rules,rendering this case moot.it is that a defendant voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.city of mesquite aladdin castle,d.see also young hayes,cir.if it did,the courts would be compelled to allow the defendant to return to its old practices without fear of reprisal.see united states grant.the defendant faces a heavy burden of showing that the challenged conduct can not reasonably be expected to start up again.friends of the earth,laidlaw envt l,d,quoting united states concentrated phosphate exp.ass n,d.
the state does not meet the heavy burden to show mootness.despite the claim of voluntary cessation,the state may reinstate a medicaid plan that uses federal funding for additional assistance to the blind.see charleston hous.auth.dep t of,cir the possibility of this recurrence is not so remote or speculative that our jurisdiction is lacking.not only has cms neither approved nor rejected the amended plan,missouri may seek further amendment at any time.see.med,reynolds,cir.moreover,as discussed below,missouri claim of voluntary cessation only addresses plaintiffs comparability claim,not their claim.as jurisdiction is proper,this court addresses the merits.
a motion for preliminary injunction requires the district court to consider four factors the probability of success on the merits,the threat of irreparable harm to the movant,the balance between the harm and the injury that granting the injunction will inflict on other interested parties,and the public interest.see dataphase c l,cir en banc.the party seeking injunctive relief bears the burden of proving these factors.see watkins,lewis,cir.no single factor is dispositive,as the district court must balance all factors to determine whether the injunction should issue.see baker,chaske,cir,citing modern banking,cir en banc,superceded by.
the district court has broad discretion when ruling on preliminary injunctions.see manion nagin,cir.this court reverses only for abuse of that discretion.see pediatric specialty care.dep t of human,cir united indus.corp clorox,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs where the district court rests its conclusion on clearly erroneous factual findings or erroneous legal conclusions.see wedow city of kansas city,cir,quoting layton elder,cir.when purely legal questions are presented,however,this court owes no special deference to the district court.see bell sellevold,cir,quoting chu drua cha noot,cir vacating denial of preliminary injunction.
the medicaid act is a federal aid program designed to help the states provide medical assistance to individuals,with the assistance of federal funding.see schweiker hogan,d hodgson bd.of county comm rs,cir.participation is voluntary,but if a state decides to participate,it must comply with all federal statutory and regulatory requirements.see schweiker gray panthers,d bowlin montanez,cir,citing kai ross,cir.to participate,a state submits a plan to the secretary of the department of health and human services that meets the requirements of a.see reynolds,at,citing wilder.hosp.ass n,d.once the plan is approved,the federal government subsidizes the state services.see alexander choate,d.
participating states must furnish medical assistance to the categorically needy,a group that includes blind,aged,and disabled individuals,pregnant women,and children.see a a.a state may also choose to provide medical assistance to the medically needy those who do not qualify under a federal program,but lack the resources to obtain adequate medical care.see id.a c gray panthers,at.missouri elects to provide medical assistance only to the categorically needy.see.
once a state decides which groups will receive medical assistance under the plan,it then determines which services it will provide.see a.to receive federal approval,the medicaid act mandates that a plan include only seven enumerated medical services.see id.a,a,including as mandatory inpatient hospital,outpatient hospital,laboratory and,nursing facility,physician,and services.
a state may also elect to provide optional medical services,such as dental services,prosthetics,and prescription drugs.see id.a a,d a listing categories of medical assistance,only seven of which are mandatory.once the state offers an optional service,it must comply with all federal statutory and regulatory mandates.see ellis patterson,cir.
dme is an optional service under the medicaid act,unless the recipient qualifies for home health care.see a d.the provision of home health care is a mandatory requirement of the state plan,if the individual is entitled to nursing facility services.see a.under the federal regulations,home health services are services provided to a medicaid recipient at his or her place of residence.a.if a recipient receives home health services,the state also must provide medical supplies,equipment,and appliances suitable for use in the home as part of the program.see id.b,a.federal law does not define these terms for purposes of medicaid.see desario thomas,cir noting the lack of federal definition,vacated sub nom.by slekis thomas,d.
missouri funds home health care to medicaid recipients who meet certain requirements.see.supp.specifically,the recipient must require intermittent nursing care or therapy,be confined to the home,have a prescription for home health services from a physician,and receive the services in the home from a qualified provider.regs.ann.tit.a recipient may be considered homebound even if occasionally leaves home for purposes,as long as these absences are infrequent,or relatively short duration,and do not indicate that the recipient has the capacity to obtain the needed care on an outpatient basis.id.if the individual qualifies for home health care under missouri regulation,prescribed items of dme are covered.see id.the state asserts that the provision of dme items under missouri home health care program is not limited to the items prescribed under the new dme regulation.compare id,with id.
in this case,no plaintiff receives home health care under the state plan.as plaintiffs are not blind,pregnant,or children,the list of dme items that missouri will reimburse is curtailed.see id.as the state points out,if a dme item is prescribed that is not covered under the dme regulation,plaintiffs have two options.first,they can seek qualification for home health care under the state plan.see id.second,they can seek an exception for items through the exceptions procedure.see id.as these options do not treat plaintiffs the same as blind recipients under the state plan,and do not afford an opportunity to obtain dme items,plaintiffs allege that the dme program does not meet federal medicaid requirements.
comparability 
the new regulation eliminates coverage of most dme items for the who are aged or disabled.the regulation maintains full dme coverage for recipients who are blind.plaintiffs claim this violates medicaid comparability requirement that states provide an equal amount,duration,and scope of medical assistance to all.see a b i a,b hogan,at.white beal,cir.as the comparability mandate prevents discrimination against or among the categorically needy,it applies equally to mandatory and optional medical services.see smith rasmussen,cir rodriguez city of new york,cir states may not provide benefits to some categorically needy individuals but not to others.
the district court found that the dme regulation complies with medicaid comparability requirement,primarily because missouri had a comparability waiver pending with cms.the record has significantly changed.cms denied the waiver.the director of social services and the missouri attorney general represent to this court that missouri has now deleted the part of its state plan that calls for federal funding of additional services to the blind.as the current state plan provides an equal amount,duration,and scope of dme services to all recipients,and missouri uses only state funding to provide additional dme services to the blind,the state contends that its program is consistent with the comparability requirement.
while a state plan must comply with all federal statutory and regulatory requirements,a state may give additional medical assistance under its own legislation,independent of federal reimbursement.see harris mcrae,d a participating state is free,if it so chooses,to include in its medicaid plan those medically necessary abortions for which federal reimbursement is unavailable townsend swank,d burger,concurring noting that the proper inquiry is whether the state has used federal funds in support of its cooperative aid program rosado wyman,d states are in no way prohibited from using only state funds to fund an independent plan,providing it does not violate the constitution.health care ass n,dunning,cir the state had no right to put this portion of its plan into effect,unless,of course,it chose to do so solely with its own funds winters lavine,cir,quoting dallas lavine,misc d.
as missouri represents to this court that it does not accept federal assistance,and uses only state funds,to provide additional dme benefits to blind medicaid recipients,this court finds that the dme regulation as currently funded does not violate the federal comparability requirement.
reasonable standards 
plaintiffs next allege that the dme regulation violates medicaid requirement that the state create reasonable standards for determining the extent of medical assistance under the plan,which are consistent with medicaid objectives.a.see.dep t of health family servs.blumer,d.while a state has considerable discretion to fashion medical assistance under its medicaid plan,this discretion is constrained by the requirement.see beal doe,d weaver reagen,cir interpreting the provision to require states to provide medically necessary treatment to comply with medicaid objectives.each service the state elects to provide must be sufficient in amount,duration,and scope to reasonably achieve its purpose.b.additionally,a state may not arbitrarily reduce the amount,duration,or scope of a required service solely because of the diagnosis,type of illness,or condition.id.c.
while optional dme programs are not explicitly subject to these requirements,cms the agency that administers medicaid maintains that the provisions apply to all forms of medical assistance,including a state provision of dme.see slekis thomas,d remanding based on september,cms letter to state medicaid directors,which advised that dme is subject to the federal requirements.see also mary hosp.of rochester leavitt,cir cmty.health ctr,cir according considerable deference to cms interpretations due to the complexity of the statute and the considerable expertise of the agency,citing.dep t of health family,at.
plaintiffs argue that the limited dme services in the missouri regulation are inconsistent with these mandatory reasonableness requirements,because they discriminate on the basis of diagnosis,do not provide a sufficient amount of dme services to meet medicaid objectives,and fail to establish a procedure for recipients to obtain dme items.citing conflicts between the missouri regulation and the federal requirements,they also contend that the state regulation is preempted under the supremacy clause.the district court did not address these arguments,focusing solely on comparability.
plaintiffs discrimination argument is very similar to their comparability claim,as it is based on the provision of additional dme services to blind recipients.specifically,they contend that the regulation is facially unreasonable,because it discriminates on the basis of a medical condition or violation of c.
like plaintiffs comparability claim,this argument is foreclosed by missouri recent amendment to its plan.because the state represents that it is independently funding the provision of additional dme services to the blind,the amended plan complies with the federal regulation.see.health care ass n,at.thus,missouri dme regulation can not be enjoined on this basis.
the state asserts that there is no individualized federal right to reasonable medicaid standards,enforceable under.see,gonzaga doe,d.the state raised this argument to the district court in a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim,which the district court denied.the state concedes that it did not raise this issue in its appellee brief,because the denial of a motion to dismiss is generally not subject to immediate appeal.see prescott little six,cir only final orders are immediately appealable.the state also appears to acknowledge that this is not a jurisdictional issue that may be raised at any time.see angela clinton,cir.see also price city of stockton,cir rodriguez debuono,cir noting that the issue is more aptly viewed as a question of whether the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
the state argues that,because this legal issue decreases the likelihood that plaintiffs will succeed on the merits of their claim,it is reviewable by this court.as this issue directly affects plaintiffs probability of critical factor in whether a preliminary injunction should the district court did not discuss this claim in denying the injunction,this court agrees.see,camden citizens in action dep t of envtl.protection,cir reversing preliminary injunction where plaintiffs had no private right of action.
for legislation enacted pursuant to congress spending power,like the medicaid act,a state typically does not create a private right of action for individual plaintiffs,but rather an action by the federal government to terminate federal matching funds.see pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d.while the supreme court has rarely found enforceable rights in spending clause legislation,it has not foreclosed the possibility that individual plaintiffs may sue to enforce compliance with such legislation.see wright city of roanoke redevelopment hous,d federal housing act supports a cause of action under section wilder.hosp.ass n,d medicaid providers had an individual right to reasonable reimbursement rates under the boren amendment.still,the court has since limited the circumstances where a private right of action is found under section.see suter artist,d no private right of action under the adoption assistance and child welfare act,which requires states to make reasonable efforts to keep children out of foster homes blessing freestone,d no private right of action under title of the social security act,which requires states to substantially comply with requirements designed to ensure timely payment of child support gonzaga,at.no private right of action under the family educational rights and privacy act,which prohibits federal funding of educational institutions that have a policy of releasing confidential records to unauthorized persons.
a test determines whether spending clause legislation creates a right of action under congress intended the statutory provision to benefit the plaintiff the asserted right is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence and the provision clearly imposes a mandatory obligation upon the states.blessing,at.if the legislation meets this test,there is a presumption it is enforceable under section.id.at.the presumption is rebutted if congress explicitly or implicitly forecloses section enforcement.id.noting that implied foreclosure occurs if congress creates a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement.the availability of administrative mechanisms alone,however,can not defeat the plaintiff ability to invoke section,so long as the other requirements of the test are met.see id.at.
in gonzaga university doe,the supreme court clarified the first prong,holding that anything short of an unambiguously conferred right does not support an individual right of action under section.gonzaga,at.as section enforces rights,as opposed to benefits or interests,the statutory language must clearly evince an intent to individually benefit the plaintiff.id.at.where a statute does not include this sort of explicit right or language we rarely impute to congress an intent to create a private right of action.accordingly,the statute must focus on an individual entitlement to the asserted federal right,rather than on the aggregate practices or policies of a regulated entity,like the state.id.at.
medicaid requirement provides that a state medicaid plan must include reasonable standards for determining eligibility for and the extent of medical assistance under this plan.a.like the ninth only other circuit to address this court finds the statutory language insufficient to evince a congressional intent to create federal rights.see watson weeks,cir.first,the statute is not phrased in terms of the individuals it intends to benefit,as it lacks any reference to individuals or persons.id.noting this omission is fatal under gonzaga to the existence of a section right,citing gonzaga,at.rather than focusing on an individual entitlement to medical services,the provision focuses on the aggregate practices of the states in establishing reasonable medicaid services.see,gonzaga,at.this is insufficient to establish an individual right to reasonable standards under the first prong of the test.
even if the statute referenced the individuals benefitted,the right it would create is too vague and amorphous for judicial enforcement.watson,at.the provision focuses on the of potential beneficiaries,as the statute orders the states to base medicaid eligibility on financial need.see id.at congress provided no meaningful instruction for the interpretation of reasonable standards in terms of medical need.th
