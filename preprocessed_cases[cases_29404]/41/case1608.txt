a vocational expert testified at the administrative hearing.the alj asked the vocational expert to assume a hypothetical claimant of the same age,education,and work experience as gragg,who can stand six to eight hours per day,sit six to eight hours per day,and can lift pounds occasionally and pounds frequently.the hypothetical claimant could reach up and get something on occasion,but the use of his arms above shoulder level should not be a regular job task.additionally,the hypothetical claimant could not read or write,although he could identify and read symbols and single words that are repeated over and over,such as an instruction,stop,pull or push,but as far as reading and writing any sentences or anything more than something simple,the hypothetical claimant could not do that.the hypothetical claimant also could add and subtract and perform simple tasks,but he could not have frequent public contact.in response,the vocational expert testified that the hypothetical claimant would be able to perform a range of work,including the jobs of sewing machine operator,shipping and receiving weigher,stuffer,and eyeglass polisher.
following the administrative hearing,the alj determined that gragg did not qualify as disabled under the social security act,and denied gragg claim for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income.in making this decision,the alj followed the disability evaluation process set forth in.see,ramirez barnhart,cir.at step one,the alj concluded that gragg has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since december,the alleged onset date of disability.at step two,the alj determined that gragg mild degenerative disc and joint disease of the cervical spine,right shoulder impingement syndrome,history of back pain,affective disorder,and learning disorder were severe impairments that impose significant limitations upon his ability to perform basic activities.however,at step three,the alj found that gragg impairments did not meet or medically equal one of the listed impairments in part,subpart p,appendix.at step four,the alj determined that gragg had the following residual functional capacity 
claimant retains the residual functional capacity to lift pounds maximum occasionally and pounds frequently.he is capable of occasionally reaching above shoulder level to obtain objects,but is limited to only rare use of his bilateral arms above shoulder level during regular performance of job tasks.he is capable of sitting or standing each hours total throughout the course of a normal workday.he is precluded from reading or writing as a job task,but is capable of reading and identifying simple words such as on,off,stop,push,or pull.he is capable of reading and identifying numbers and performing basic addition and subtraction calculations.he is limited to performance of only simple job tasks.he is capable of maintaining adequate social interactions with supervisors or coworkers,but is restricted to job tasks not requiring frequent or prolonged contact with the general public.
based on this rfc,the alj determined that gragg was unable to perform his past relevant work.finally,at step five,the alj found that,based on the testimony of the vocational expert,gragg could perform jobs that exist in significant numbers within the regional and national economies.thus,the alj found that gragg was not disabled,and denied his claim for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income.
on august,after the administrative hearing and after the alj denied gragg claim for disability case,gragg participated in a vocational evaluation performed by mary titterington.titterington assessed gragg verbal iq to be,his visual iq to be,and his general iq to be.she noted that these scores fall into the substantially below average range.titterington concluded that in word reading,gragg was at grade equivalent in sentence comprehension,he was at grade equivalent k in spelling,he was at grade equivalent and in math computation,he was at grade equivalent.gragg score on the reading comprehension test placed him at the sixteenth percentile and at grade equivalent third grade,eighth month.gragg scored substantially below industrial standards on the hand tools dexterity test and below average on the box and blocks manual dexterity test.titterington noted that gragg does not know how to use a keyboard,and he is functionally illiterate,with academic skills at the early elementary school level.titterington opined that gragg was not a good candidate for vocational rehabilitation services,given his low total functioning level combined with his physical and emotional limitations.she concluded that gragg was unemployable in the open labor market.
the appeals council of the social security administration denied review of the alj decision on october,resulting in a final decision of the commissioner.see van vickle astrue,cir.gragg then sought review by the united states district court for the western district of missouri.the district court upheld the alj opinion.gragg now appeals,arguing that the commissioner decision to deny his claim for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income is not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.specifically,gragg asserts that the alj did not properly consider his borderline intellectual functioning in assessing his severe impairments and in positing the hypothetical question to the vocational expert.
this court reviews de novo the district court decision to uphold the denial of social security benefits,and will affirm the alj findings if they are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.bowman barnhart,cir.substantial evidence is less than a preponderance but is enough that a reasonable mind would find it adequate
