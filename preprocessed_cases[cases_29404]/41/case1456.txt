david burnett brought this action alleging violations of the family and medical leave act fmla and the americans with disabilities act ada against his former employer,the habitat company.the district court granted the habitat company motion for summary judgment,concluding that burnett had failed to provide his employer with notice of his medical condition,as required under both the fmla and ada.because we find that burnett provided his employer information sufficient to notify his employer of his need for fmla leave,we reverse the grant of summary judgment on his fmla claim.however,we conclude that burnett has failed to show that he was disabled within the meaning of the ada at the time of his termination,and therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment on burnett ada claim.
background 
the following facts are recounted in the light most favorable to burnett,the nonmovant.burnett began working as a janitor for the habitat company habitat,a property management company,in.beginning in,burnett came under the supervision of sergio polo.in,burnett became a detailer,responsible for verifying that apartment equipment and furnishings were in working order before the arrival of a new tenant.as a detailer,burnett was sometimes required to lift heavy objects,such as closet doors and appliances.according to polo,no complaints regarding burnett performance were brought to his attention before october.
in october,burnett first informed habitat that he was experiencing some medical difficulties.that month,polo offered to transfer burnett to a different location in the facility,presumably because of recurring conflicts between burnett and an assistant engineer.burnett,however,declined the transfer,telling polo that given his weak bladder,he did not wish to transfer to the position,which would result in reduced restroom access.further,he informed polo that he was going to see a doctor to determine the cause of the bladder problem.at the end of november,polo gave burnett a verbal warning regarding his performance.
after his absence in december,burnett again spoke with polo about his health.on december,burnett presented polo with a copy of a doctor order for blood testing to justify some of his absences.burnett further explained that during his time off he had visited the doctor,undergone a physical examination,and learned that he had two serious psa antigen and cholesterol levels.burnett did not explain the significance of a heightened psa level nor did anyone ask him to do so.however,he did inform polo of his upcoming doctor appointments and need to see a urologist.
on december,burnett met with polo,other habitat managers,and a union representative to further discuss his absences.burnett told the individuals present at the meeting that he had been sick during his absence.he elaborated that although he did look sick,he felt he was getting sick or was sick.and,he named the probable source of his illness by comparing his circumstance with that of his who had been afflicted with prostate cancer.that same day,polo sent an email to other supervisors informing them that burnett should be afforded sick leave on january and,to attend doctor appointments.
on january,burnett notified habitat that he would be undergoing a prostate biopsy on january.burnett gave one of his supervisors,mitch hehr,a document describing the prostate ultrasound and biopsy procedures.the document provided that i ndications for the examination are an abnormal rectal exam or an elevation of prostate cancer screening blood test psa.under standard habitat policy,hehr should have provided polo with a copy of the document,although polo denies receiving it.that same day,polo issued burnett a reprimand for substandard work.
one week later,on january,polo gave burnett written reprimands regarding two events occurring on that day.first,polo accused burnett of wasting company time by disrupting another employee work.second,polo stated that burnett was disruptive during their conversation about burnett upcoming appointment with human resources.specifically,burnett believed that he was scheduled to meet with the human resources manager that afternoon to discuss his desire to transfer to a midnight shift,but polo assured him that the meeting was scheduled for the following day.when burnett called human resources,he learned that polo was correct,but accepted the human resources department offer to see him that day.
polo met burnett at the time clock as burnett prepared to leave work to attend the meeting with human resources.at that time,polo stated that he would not grant burnett the desired transfer,because burnett was a loose cannon.he also gave burnett a written reprimand concerning the first episode of the day.when burnett asked whether that would be his final reprimand,polo said no.instead,polo referred to a document in his hand as burnett final reprimand.burnett claims to have understood polo conduct to indicate that he was being terminated.
thereafter,burnett filed a union grievance,and a union meeting was set for january.on the advice of his union representative,burnett did not return to work until the day of the union meeting.as a result,polo issued a reprimand stating that burnett had missed work on january,and,and suspended burnett for three days without pay.
at the union meeting,burnett told polo and others that he was scheduled to have a biopsy the following day.he described the biopsy as a nasty,nasty procedure involving bleeding and infections.he also stated that if he were ultimately diagnosed with a progressive form of prostate cancer like that of his,he might commit suicide,because he lived alone,had no means of caring for himself,and did not wish to be bedridden.
on january,burnett underwent the prostate biopsy,as scheduled.the next day,burnett gave habitat a document entitled treatment plan,confirming that he had had the biopsy and instructing him to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity following the biopsy.it is undisputed that polo received a copy of the document.additionally,burnett spoke to one of his supervisors about his work restrictions and asked for help with his duties.according to burnett,the supervisor ignored his request,and burnett agreed to perform his duties to the best of his ability.that same day,burnett submitted a vacation request for the second week of february the week he anticipated receiving the biopsy results.the next day,january,he submitted an additional vacation request,this time for the first week in february,purportedly because he did not get a light duty assignment or the help that he had requested on the previous day and was worried about being injured.
burnett second request for leave set off a flurry of activity among the habitat supervisors.one supervisor informed burnett that polo wished to see him in his office.in response,burnett asked the supervisor to notify polo that he felt sick and wanted to go home.two other supervisors then confronted burnett at the time clock and demanded that he visit polo before leaving work.burnett refused,saying again that he felt sick.at that time,the supervisors contacted polo via radio,requesting that polo immediately meet them and,by implication,burnett at the time clock.when polo arrived,burnett told him that he felt sick and wanted to go home.according to burnett,polo stated that if burnett was referring to the document the treatment plan,which advised burnett to refrain from heavy lifting,it not important.burnett replied that the treatment plan was important to him and that,i not going to sit here and argue my health is more important than arguing with you.burnett then punched out at the time clock,and polo accused him of being insubordinate.
after burnett left work on january,polo and the other managers met to discuss him.polo testified that at that point he probably knew that burnett had undergone a prostate biopsy,and that he generally knew that biopsies were a method of testing for cancer.nonetheless,on february,polo sent a letter to burnett terminating his employment effective january.
on january,burnett went to the emergency room due to complications from the biopsy.he delivered the discharge paperwork to a colleague on or about february,who passed the documents on to a supervisor.polo testified that he briefly looked at the documents,but did not reconsider his decision.on february,burnett was diagnosed with prostate cancer.
burnett filed suit against habitat,claiming violations of the fmla and the ada.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of habitat,primarily because it concluded that burnett could not show that he had provided adequate notice to habitat that he suffered from a serious health condition,and thus no fmla or ada claim could be made.burnett timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing all facts and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see,anders waste mgmt.of,cir.summary judgment is only appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see also celotex catrett,d.
a.the fmla claims 
we begin with burnett claims under the family and medical leave act of.the fmla entitles any eligible employee suffering from a serious health condition that renders him unable to perform the functions of his position to twelve workweeks of leave during each period.a d.the fmla makes it unlawful for an employer to interfere with an employee attempt to exercise any fmla rights.id.a.it also forbids an employer from retaliating against an employee who exercises fmla rights.see id.a prohibiting discrimination against an individual who opposes practices made unlawful by the fmla id.b prohibiting discrimination against persons who participate in or institute fmla proceedings or inquiries.the fmla therefore contemplates the interference and retaliation theories of recovery advanced here.see hoge honda am,cir.
fmla interference claim 
to prevail on an fmla interference claim,an employee need only show that his employer deprived him of an fmla entitlement no finding of ill intent is required.hoge,at.accordingly,the employee must establish that he was eligible for the fmla protections,his employer was covered by the fmla,he was entitled to leave under the fmla,he provided sufficient notice of his intent to take leave,and his employer denied him fmla benefits to which he was entitled.id.habitat concedes that burnett has satisfied the first and second requirements.see a detailing the fmla years and eligibility requirements id.defining which employers are subject to the fmla provisions 
we easily conclude that burnett has satisfied the third and fifth elements of an interference claim.with regard to the third prong,burnett argues,and we agree,that his incapacity due to undiagnosed prostate cancer and the diagnostic procedures pertaining thereto,entitled him to fmla leave.an employee is entitled to fmla leave if he is afflicted with a serious health condition and that condition renders him unable to perform the functions of his job.a d.
an employee has a serious health condition within the meaning of the fmla,where he has an illness,injury,impairment,or physical or mental condition that involves a inpatient care in a hospital,hospice,or residential medical care facility or b continuing treatment by a health care provider.we are satisfied that burnett had an serious health condition that involved continuing treatment by a health care provider.he was incapacitated,unable to work due to a condition cancer that required periodic treatments,diagnostic examinations,continued for an extended period over four months,and might have caused episodic rather than continuous incapacity.see a iii see also price city of fort wayne,cir listing a biopsy as one of a series of procedures qualifying the plaintiff as having a serious health condition involving continuing treatment by a health care provider.
as a result of his serious health condition,burnett was unable to perform at least one of his job functions.see an employee is deemed unable to perform the functions of his position when he is unable to perform any one of the essential functions of his position.in this case,burnett was instructed not to lift heavy objects or engage in strenuous activity after his biopsy,two tasks required of detailers,who routinely move heavy closet doors and appliances.thus,we conclude that burnett provided sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment with respect to the third prong of an interference claim,and habitat has offered no argument to the contrary.
the fifth prong of the test need not detain us long as it is beyond dispute that habitat failed to provide burnett with requested leave.indeed,burnett was terminated before receiving any of the time off that he sought for the month of february.having concluded that the first,second,third,and fifth elements of an interference case have been satisfied,we turn to the fourth element and the crux of the dispute between the.
the notice requirements of the fmla are not onerous.an employee need not expressly mention the fmla in his leave request or otherwise invoke any of its provisions.see phillips quebecor world rai,cir citing b.indeed,the employee can be completely ignorant of the benefits conferred by the act stoops v.one call commc,cir.the employee notice obligation is satisfied so long as he provides information sufficient to show that he likely has an condition.see aubuchon knauf fiberglass,gmbh,cir t he employee duty is merely to place the employer on notice of a probable basis for fmla leave.emphasis added collins,cir e mployers are entitled to the sort of notice that will inform them that the fmla may apply.emphasis added 
although adequacy of notice is a question,we have held that in the usual case,an employee bare assertion that he is sick is insufficient.phillips,at collins,at simply put,a n employee reference to being sick,does not suggest to the employer that the medical condition might be serious or that the fmla otherwise could be applicable.phillips,at quoting collins,at.in certain instances,however,an employer is obligated to provide medical leave even though an employee has failed even to say he is sick.indeed,an employee may be excused from expressing a need for medical leave in at least two exceptional circumstances provide the employer with sufficient notice of the need for medical leave or when the employee is incapable of providing such notice.see byrne avon,cir.some observable changes in an employee condition such as a broken arm present an obvious need for medical leave,thereby obviating the need for an express request for medical leave.see id.at.for instance,in byrne,we stated that an employee uncharacteristic conduct at work beginning to sleep on the job after an unblemished work history perhaps provided adequate notice of a medical condition.see id.at.alternatively,we have said that an employee may be excused from giving notice where his medical condition,clinical depression prevents him from communicating the nature of his illness and resulting need for medical leave.see id.at.
although burnett seeks the benefit of the byrne exceptions,we conclude that byrne does not apply here.burnett can not show that his medical condition resulted in a dramatic,observable change in his work performance or physical condition.by his own admission,burnett did look sick.burnett also can not show that his illness somehow impeded his ability to communicate his health needs to his employer.accordingly,burnett is subject to the general notice rule,requiring that he do more than simply declare that he is sick.
once an employee informs his employer of his probable need for medical leave,the fmla imposes a duty on the employer to conduct further investigation and inquiry to determine whether the proposed leave in fact qualifies as fmla leave.see aubuchon,at the employee just has to give the employer enough information to establish probable cause,as it were,to believe that he is entitled to fmla leave.that is enough to trigger the employer duty to request such additional information as may be necessary to confirm the employee entitlement.citing c,b,d.
with this framework in mind,we consider burnett request for leave.the facts of this case present a close question.at no point prior to his termination did burnett communicate to anyone that he had prostate could he,as he was not diagnosed until shortly after being fired.habitat therefore insists that in remarking that he was sick and wanted to go home on january,burnett did no more than declare i sick.
this argument effectively disregards the surrounding context of burnett remarks.however,when considered in their proper context,burnett remarks on january were sufficient to put habitat on notice of his need for medical leave.over a period of four months,burnett communicated that he was suffering from a weak bladder,which was severe enough to preclude a potential transfer of assignment he was on a trajectory of increased medical visits and testing,including a blood test showing an elevated psa he had recently had a prostate biopsy a test that polo knew was used to diagnose cancer and requested help in his work duties as a result he repeatedly stated that he felt sick and intimated that his condition may be similar to his latent prostate cancer and his concerns were significant enough for him to suggest that he might commit suicide if he ended up bedridden as a result of prostate cancer.burnett therefore gave an account of symptoms and complaints,which formed a coherent pattern and progression,beginning with initial symptoms,continuing with doctor visits,and then additional testing and communicated in one form or another to polo.
in response,habitat argued at oral argument that asking an employer to consider medical information provided over a period to appreciate the context of an employee declaration of sickness is a troubling novel theory,placing untold obligations on employers.not at all.in collins,we specifically noted that the employee invoked employer knowledge about her depression,which traced back over one year 
plaintiff d epression did not come on her overnight.in this suit she contends that it had been developing for years and that she had mentioned the problem to supervisors early in,a year before the absence that led to her discharge.once collins knew that she had a problem,she could predict that this would lead her to miss work on occasion,and she could have given the notice contemplated by long before march.then when depression incapacitated her on a particular day she could have made clear the serious nature of her condition by referring to knowledge already in the employer possession.a reference to being sick not only withheld important information from the employer but likely threw it off the scent.certainly it did not suggest to the employer that the medical condition might be serious or that the fmla otherwise could be applicable.
at.the point of collins is that it is entirely appropriate under the fmla for an employee to give accumulating information about a medical condition as it evolves.to do otherwise risks losing the claim.accordingly,we do not believe we place an unreasonable burden on habitat in asking it to consider burnett disclosed medical history in assessing the seriousness of his assertion of sickness on january.burnett is not seeking to reach back over vast periods of time to grasp at an isolated mention of illness that was reasonably banished from his employer institutional memory.he seeks only to invoke habitat institutional memory as to the natural course of his illness,which spanned a period of only four months and included the same supervisor throughout the entire relevant period.and,importantly,habitat can not claim a loss of memory here.polo approved burnett requests for days off for doctor appointments little more than a month before his termination.just days before his termination,burnett discussed his upcoming biopsy with polo and others at the union grievance meeting.finally,during his january with burnett at the time clock,polo himself made reference to the overall context of burnett health,stating that burnett treatment plan did matter.
when considered in their proper context,then,burnett declarations on january were more than a vague and untethered claim of sickness.rather,burnett proclamation of illness was supported by details suggesting a serious health condition.accordingly,we reverse the grant of summary judgment on burnett fmla interference claim.
fmla retaliation claim 
in making out a charge of retaliation under the fmla,a plaintiff may proceed under the direct or indirect methods of proof.see buie,cir.under the direct method,a plaintiff must present evidence that his employer took materially adverse action against him on account of his protected activity.see phelan cook county,cir setting forth showings required to prove retaliation under title vii citing burlington northern santa fe ry.white,d if the plaintiff evidence is thereafter contradicted 
the case must be tried unless the defendant presents unrebutted evidence that he would have taken the adverse employment action against the plaintiff even if he had had no retaliatory motive in that event the defendant is entitled to summary judgment because he has shown that the plaintiff was harmed by retaliation.
see stone city of indianapolis pub.utils,cir to proceed under the indirect method,burnett must show that after taking fmla leave the protected activity he was treated less favorably than other similarly situated employees who did not take fmla leave,even though he was performing his job in a satisfactory manner.hull stoughton trailers,llc,cir.because burnett has not identified a similarly situated person treated more favorably than he,he must proceed under the direct method of proof.
habitat claims that burnett can not demonstrate a causal relationship between his request for fmla leave and his termination because habitat disclaims knowledge of any protected activity or serious health condition.this argument is essentially identical to the argument that habitat raises with regard to burnett purported failure to provide adequate notice to habitat under the fmla interference claim,and it runs into the same problems discussed above.
as we concluded above,over the course of four months burnett gave his employer sufficient notice of his serious medical condition.thereafter,he engaged in protected activity by taking time off upon realizing that he would not be able to perform one of the essential functions of the job and would not be provided an accommodation to assist in performing the tasks.he was subsequently terminated for the allegedly insubordinate act of leaving work on january a materially adverse action.those facts,therefore,suggest a direct,causal connection between the protected activity and adverse action.
habitat assertion that it terminated burnett on the basis of insubordination does not justify the grant of summary judgment in this case.although insubordination may be a valid,nondiscriminatory basis for termination,see,kahn united states sec y of labor,cir,a question of fact remains as to whether this was the true reason for burnett termination.
first,habitat classification of burnett conduct as insubordinate stems in large measure from its mistaken belief that burnett was not entitled to fmla leave on january,because he had failed to provide notice of his medical condition.by habitat reasoning,then,burnett had no more fmla protection when he left work on january,than any other habitat employee.because we have already concluded that burnett did provide sufficient notice of his condition,we must disagree.
second,the present factual scenario is different from the normal situation where the alleged insubordination was entirely separate from the request for fmla leave.here,burnett alleged insubordinate act was his request for fmla leave,or at least a key component of it.that is,his demand to go home because he felt ill is the very act that habitat labels as insubordination.thus,under the circumstances,habitat has not presented unrebutted evidence that it would have terminated burnett even absent burnett exercise of his fmla rights.stone,at.accordingly,a jury question remains,see,and burnett fmla retaliation claim should have survived summary judgment
