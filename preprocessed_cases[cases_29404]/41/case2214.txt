a group of pharmacies,health care providers,senior citizens groups,and beneficiaries collectively ilc seek to enjoin a state official from implementing legislation reducing payments to medical service providers under the state medicaid program,known as,by ten percent.ilc alleged in its complaint that the state legislation violates certain provisions of the federal medicaid act,and is therefore preempted under the supremacy clause although ilc sought preliminary relief,the district court denied any such relief,holding that ilc could not allege any viable claim for injunctive relief because none of the petitioners or their members have any federal right to payments or benefits.we do not agree that this suit fails for this threshold reason,and therefore reverse.
under title xix of the social security act,et the medicaid act,the federal government provides funds to participating states to enabl e each state,as far as practicable to furnish medical assistance on behalf of families with dependent children and of aged,blind,or disabled individuals,whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.medicaid is a cooperative program,enacted by congress pursuant to its powers under the spending clause,see const.art.i,cl,that directs federal funding to states to assist them in providing medical assistance to individuals.ball rodgers,cir quoting katie los angeles county,cir.to receive federal funds,states are required to administer their programs in compliance with individual state plans for medical assistance approved by the federal secretary of health and human services.the act sets forth detailed requirements for state plans,see id.a,including the specific provision at issue in this appeal.
under that provision,a a section a,a state plan must 
provide such methods and procedures relating to the payment for care and services as may be necessary to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.
that is,a state plan must establish reimbursement rates for health care providers that are both consistent with medical care the quality of care provision and sufficient to enlist enough providers to ensure that medical services are generally available to medicaid recipients the access to care provision.see generally orthopaedic hosp.belshe,cir.
california assembly bill ab,enacted on february,during a special session convened by the governor to address the state budget deficit,reduces payments to medical providers participating in the state program by ten percent.section of ab instructs the director of the department of health care services,the state agency responsible for administering the program,to reduce payments to physicians,dentists,pharmacies,adult day health care centers,clinics,health systems and other providers participating in program by ten percent.see cal.welf.inst.code.section also reduces payments to managed health care plans under contract with the department by the actuarial equivalent of ten percent.id.section of ab instructs the director to reduce payments for inpatient services provided by acute care hospitals not under contract with the department by ten percent.see id.all of these cuts were scheduled to take effect july.
ilc filed this suit in california state court seeking to enjoin implementation of ab on april,maintaining that the rate reduction violates both the quality of care and access to care provisions of a and is therefore invalid under the federal constitution supremacy clause,as it conflicts with governing federal law.the complaint alleged that even prior to passage of ab,a substantial percentage of medical care of primary care providers and of unwilling to participate in the program due to low reimbursement rates that of dentists refused to accept patients and that reimbursement rates for prescription drugs allowed pharmacies to uniformly earn less than a net profit.by further reducing reimbursement rates,ilc argued,ab would drive even more primary care physicians,specialists,dentists,and pharmacies out of the program and force existing providers to reduce services.as a result,ilc contended,recipients would be denied quality medical services and access to quality medical services,in violation of a.ilc also maintained that nothing in the legislative history of ab demonstrated that the legislature had considered whether reduced payments would be consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care,or whether such payments would be sufficient to enlist an adequate network of health care providers.rather,the sole purpose cited in the legislation was to address the fiscal emergency declared by the governor and implement cost containment measures affecting health services,at the earliest possible time.ilc therefore requested a peremptory writ of mandate or injunction to prevent the department of health care services and its director,sandra shewry the director,from implementing ab 
the state defendants removed the suit to federal court,where ilc filed a motion for preliminary injunction.the district court denied relief,holding that although it was acutely cognizant of the potential adverse consequences of the ten percent rate reduction,ilc had no likelihood of succeeding on the merits because they do not have any federal rights under a.
in reaching this conclusion,the district court relied heavily on this court decision in sanchez johnson,which held that a does not create an individual right that either medicaid recipients or providers would be able to enforce under,cir.although the district court acknowledged that ilc in this case filed suit under and the supremacy clause rather than under,the court viewed this as a distinction without a difference,reasoning that the supremacy a is not a source of any federal rights.golden state transit city of los angeles,d quoting chapman houston welfare rights,d.in the absence of any right,the district court concluded,ilc almost surely had failed to state a claim for injunctive relief.
in so ruling,the district court rebuffed ilc argument that it was entitled to seek purely injunctive is all it is the basis of federal preemption under the doctrine recognized in shaw delta air lines,d.shaw held that a plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief from state regulation,on the ground that such regulation is by a federal statute which,by virtue of the supremacy clause,must prevail,thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under to resolve.id.at.the district court held shaw and its,as we shall see,are to ilc claims,holding that shaw preemption claims have been permitted in only three circumstances where the plaintiff claims that a state law requires him to act in violation of federal law where the plaintiff contends that his conduct will be restricted by a state law that is preempted by federal law and where state law interferes with federally created rights.the court concluded that ilc claims did not fall under any of these three categories,as ab neither compels nor restricts petitioners own conduct and a does not give rise to a federally created right.ilc claims thus fell outside the shaw supremacy clause doctrine,rendering its probability of success on the merits low,if not wholly lacking.
ilc immediately sought emergency relief in this court.we granted ilc motion to expedite oral argument,but denied the balance of its emergency motion.we heard argument on july,and issued an order the same day reversing the district court decision and remanding for consideration of the merits of ilc motion for preliminary injunction this opinion more fully sets forth the rationale for our july order.
we review a district court denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.the lands council mcnair,cir en banc.a district court abuses its discretion in denying a request for a preliminary injunction if it base s its decision on an erroneous legal standard or clearly erroneous findings of facts.id.quoting earth island inst.forest,cir alteration in original.we therefore review the district court legal rulings de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.see also perfect,cir.
in this case,the district court denied ilc motion for a preliminary injunction based solely on its legal ruling that ilc could not bring suit under the shaw supremacy clause doctrine.the only issue before this court is thus whether ilc may maintain a valid cause of action to enjoin implementation of ab on the basis of federal preemption.
the supreme court has repeatedly entertained claims for injunctive relief based on federal preemption,without requiring that the standards for bringing suit under be met,and without intimating that such claims must fit into one of three categories or circumstances in order to be cognizable.in city of burbank lockheed air terminal,d,for example,the court enjoined a city ordinance prohibiting jet aircraft from taking off between and id.at.plaintiffs,the owner and operator of a private airport,filed suit under the supremacy clause,arguing that the federal aviation act preempted the city ordinance.id.at.as the court noted,the act permitted the federal government to possess and exercise complete and exclusive national sovereignty in the airspace of the united states,id.at.quoting a,displacing both state and local regulation of airspace private right to occupy airspace at a given time or place.without questioning plaintiffs authority to bring suit,the court proceeded directly to the merits of their claim for injunctive relief,holding the city ordinance preempted under the supremacy clause.see id.at.
in ray atlantic richfield,d,the court proceeded along much the same path.ray involved a claim for injunctive relief brought by the operators of an oil refinery and tanker vessels,who argued that the state of washington tanker law,which regulated the design,size,and movement of oil tankers in puget sound,was preempted by the federal ports and waterways safety act pwsa.id.at.without comment on plaintiffs authority to bring suit under the supremacy clause,the court once again proceeded straight to the preemption analysis.see id.at.indeed,none of the court seminal preemption cases casts any doubt on the presumptive availability of declaratory and injunctive relief under the supremacy clause to the contrary,the court has consistently the supremacy clause provides a cause of action to enjoin implementation of allegedly unlawful state legislation.see gade solid wastes mgmt.ass n,d pac.gas state energy res.conservation dev.comm n,d.lime avocado growers,paul,d see also richard fallon,daniel meltzer,david shapiro,hart wechsler the federal courts the federal system ed describing the rule that there is an implied right of action to enjoin state or local regulation that is preempted by a federal statutory or constitutional provision as.
perhaps the most in this line of cases is shaw delta air lines.shaw involved the claims of several large employers,who brought suit against the acting commissioner of the new york state division of human rights,arguing that the state human rights and disability benefits required employers to treat pregnancy no differently than any other preempted by the federal employee retirement income security act erisa.at.erisa does not confer any express cause of action on employers to challenge state benefits laws in federal court but the as it had in city of burbank and the merits of the preemption claims anyway,holding that the state legislation was preempted only insofar as it prohibited practices that were otherwise lawful under erisa.id.at.in an footnote,the court emphasized that its decision in franchise tax board construction laborers vacation trust,d,decided the same day,does not call into question the lower courts jurisdiction to decide these cases.at.rather,the court reaffirmed the general rule that a plaintiff seeking to enjoin state law based on federal preemption maintains a valid federal cause of action.as the court explained,
it is beyond dispute that federal courts have jurisdiction over suits to enjoin state officials from interfering with federal rights.a plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief from state regulation,on the ground that such regulation is by a federal statute which,by virtue of the supremacy clause of the constitution,must prevail,thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under to resolve.
id.internal citations omitted.the court concluded by noting that it frequently has resolved disputes in a similar jurisdictional posture,citing,inter alia,ray and florida lime avocado growers.id.thus,shaw did not give rise to some unique line of shaw preemption cases,but merely reaffirmed the traditional rule that injunctive relief is presumptively available in federal court to enjoin state officers from implementing a law allegedly preempted under the supremacy clause see lawrence county sch.dist,d describing shaw as reaffirming the general rule that a plaintiff asserting preemption under the supremacy clause has stated a federal claim for injunctive relief.
contrary to the district court conclusion that shaw preemption claims have been permitted in only three circumstances,we know of no authority limiting shaw in this manner,nor has the director cited any.in fact,the supreme court recently reaffirmed shaw holding,maintaining that it had no doubt as to the authority of private parties to seek injunctive relief on the basis of federal preemption under and the supremacy clause.see verizon.pub.serv.comm n,d.
nor are we certain on what grounds the district court concluded that ilc lacked a valid cause of action in this case.the first two of the district court three circumstances whether the challenged statute restricts or compels petitioners own to reflect traditional standing doctrine,which requires a litigant to demonstrate that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is either actual or imminent,that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant,and that it is likely that a favorable decision will redress that injury.massachusetts,d.we address ilc standing to bring suit separately below,as that inquiry raises questions apart from whether the supremacy clause provides a valid cause of action to seek injunctive relief on the basis of federal preemption.
the parties have proceeded on the assumption that the district court denied relief because ilc lacked any judicially enforceable rights under the federal statute the director specifically urges this court to deny ilc relief because a does not confer a private right of enforcement upon petitioners,which is the necessary predicate to seeking relief under the supremacy clause.were we to accept it,this argument would work a fundamental change in supremacy clause jurisprudence.we decline to do so,and thus join several other circuits in holding that a plaintiff seeking injunctive relief under the supremacy clause on the basis of federal preemption need not assert a federally created right,in the sense that term has been recently used in suits brought under,but need only satisfy traditional standing requirements.
although the director asserts that the express conferral of a private right of enforcement on petitioners is a necessary predicate to a claim for injunctive relief under the supremacy clause,the rule in both this court and in other circuits is precisely the opposite.in bud antle,barbosa,cir,we addressed a claim for injunctive relief brought by a large agricultural employer,who sought to enjoin the california agricultural relations board alrb from adjudicating various unfair labor practice charges.id.at.the employer argued that the alrb proceedings were preempted by the national labor relations act nlra,and were therefore invalid.id.we held that a private party may bring an action in a federal district court seeking to enjoin allegedly unlawful state conduct,noting the general rule that a private party may seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement of a state statutory scheme on the ground of federal preemption.id.at citing shaw.we reached this conclusion e ven in the absence of an explicit statutory provision establishing a cause of action,id.at,and regardless of whether the nlra conferred a federal right on employers,see id.at finding it unnecessary to apply the test set forth in cort ash,d.
our holding in bud antle is consistent with established practice in the other circuits,which have universally affirmed the right of private parties to seek injunctive relief under the supremacy clause regardless of whether the allegedly preemptive statute confers any federal right or cause of action.as the tenth circuit explained,
a federal statutory right or right of action is not required where a party seeks to enjoin the enforcement of a regulation on the grounds that the local ordinance is preempted by federal law.a party may bring a claim under the supremacy clause that a local enactment is preempted even if the federal law at issue does not create a private right of action.

the director acknowledges these general principles but argues for a different result in this case,based on the specific statutory provision at issue.the director provides little,if any,justification for treating a claim of preemption under a federal statute passed pursuant to congress spending power differently from a claim of preemption under any of the federal statutes discussed above.but even if she had,this argument has also been flatly rejected by the supreme court and the other circuits that have addressed the question.
in pharmaceutical research manufacturers of america phrma concannon,cir,aff sub nom.phrma walsh,d,a pharmaceutical manufacturers trade group challenged a maine statute designed to lower prescription drug prices for residents by essentially requiring manufacturers to issue rebates id.at.phrma argued,inter alia,that maine statute was preempted by the federal medicaid act under the supremacy clause,and moved for injunctive relief to prevent implementation of the program.id.at.in response,the defendants contended that phrma could not bring suit in this manner,as the medicaid act was not intended to confer any private right on pharmaceutical manufacturers.id.at.the first circuit rejected the defendants argument,explaining that phrma has not asserted an action to enforce rights under the medicaid statute but rather a challenge under the supremacy clause.in this type of action,it is the interests protected by the supremacy clause,not by the preempting statute,that are at issue.id.citing a decision from the third circuit,the court noted 
we know of no governing authority to the effect that the federal statutory provision which allegedly preempts enforcement of local legislation by conflict must confer a right on the party that argues in favor of preemption.on the contrary,a state or territorial law can be unenforceable as preempted by federal law even when the federal law secures no individual substantive rights for the party arguing preemption.
id.quoting.john hotel tourism ass n,at.the court thus stark contrast to the director position in this regardless of whether the medicaid statute relevant provisions were designed to benefit phrma,phrma can invoke the statute preemptive force.id.
although the first circuit permitted phrma to bring suit,the court ultimately held that maine statute was not preempted by federal law because there was no conflict between its requirements and those of the medicaid act.see id.at.phrma successfully petitioned the supreme court for certiorari,and the state defendants renewed their claim that phrma lacked any federal right to bring suit.like the director in our case,defendants argued that the supremacy clause does not,by its own force,protect or regulate any interests,and that phrma must therefore look to the allegedly preempting federal statute to find an interest to support standing.brief for respondents at,phrma walsh,d.phrma took issue with this claim in its reply brief,noting that the supreme court and the lower federal courts had decided innumerable cases in which parties claiming to be injured by a state law have challenged it as preempted by federal law and that the court had never held that a party directly claiming a supremacy clause violation must demonstrate an enforceable right under the preemptive federal law.reply brief of petitioner at,phrma walsh,d.
not acceding to the defendants argument that phrma lacked a cause of action under the supremacy clause,seven justices reached the merits of phrma claim for injunctive relief.see phrma walsh,at.stevens,joined by souter,and ginsburg,id.at.breyer,id.at,joined by rehnquist,and kennedy.only justices scalia and thomas would have denied phrma ability to bring suit for preemption,although they ultimately concurred in the court judgment that maine statute was likely not preempted by the federal medicaid act.see id.at.scalia,concurring in judgment id.at.thomas,concurring in judgment faced with arguments similar to those presented by the director in this case,the court necessarily a private party seeking to enjoin implementation of a state law allegedly preempted by the federal medicaid act may bring suit for injunctive relief directly under the supremacy clause.
although the supreme court decision in walsh affirmed phrma ability to bring suit under the supremacy clause sub silentio,two circuits have expressly relied on walsh to permit suits for injunctive relief.in phrma thompson,the circuit addressed a similar challenge to michigan best practices initiative,which was like maine provide lowcost prescription drug coverage to state residents.id.at.citing justice thomas opinion in walsh,the defendants argued that there were serious questions as to whether third parties may sue to enforce spending clause or otherwise.id.at.the circuit rejected defendants argument,holding that by reaching the merits of phrma preemption claim in walsh,the supreme court implicitly affirmed phrma authority to bring suit for injunctive relief under the supremacy clause.id.
in planned parenthood of houston sanchez,cir,the fifth circuit relied in part on the supreme court decision in walsh to permit a claim for injunctive relief under the federal social security and public health services acts.id.at.several local branches of planned parenthood claimed that a texas statute known as rider,which restricted the distribution of public funds for family planning services to contractors who pledged not to perform,or to contract with any individual or entity that performed,any elective abortion procedures,was preempted by federal law id.at.plaintiffs argued,inter alia,that the state statute violated the supremacy clause by imposing eligibility requirements that were inconsistent with those imposed under the federal funding statutes.id.
in assessing plaintiff claims for injunctive relief,the fifth circuit began by noting that i t is that the federal courts have jurisdiction under over a preemption claim seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.id.at citing shaw.the court then cited walsh and thompson for the principle that asserting the preemptive force of federal spending clause legislation itself states a claim for relief,even if planned parenthood was not seeking to vindicate any right or to enforce any duty running to them.id.at.after a thorough canvassing of preemption cases,see id.at nn,the court had little difficulty holding that planned parenthood had an implied right of action to assert a preemption claim seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.id.at.
we find the reasoning of the and fifth circuits persuasive for more than a century,federal courts have entertained suits seeking to enjoin state officials from implementing state legislation allegedly preempted by federal law,and we see no reason to depart from the general rule in this case,or in this category of cases.we therefore join several other circuits in holding that a party may seek injunctive relief under the supremacy clause regardless of whether the federal statute at issue confers any substantive rights on plaintiffs.
the reasoning adopted by the other circuits is also helpful in identifying the fundamental flaw with the director position.by maintaining that ilc can not proceed unless it can demonstrate that ab interferes with some federally created right,the director essentially asks us to apply the test for determining whether a plaintiff may seek relief under,which provides a remedy for the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws.the supreme court has interpreted the text of to require a plaintiff to show the deprivation of an unambiguously conferred right in order to support a cause of action brought under.gonzaga doe,d.but both the supreme court and the courts of appeal have consistently rejected attempts to extend this analysis to claims for purely prospective injunctive relief under the supremacy clause,rendering the rights requirement inapplicable to ilc claims in this case.
the eighth circuit decision in lankford sherman,cir,is instructive.in response to severe budget constraints,the missouri state legislature amended its state medicaid plan to eliminate coverage for durable medical equipment dme for most medicaid recipients.id.at.plaintiffs,a group of adult medicaid recipients,brought suit under both and the supremacy clause to enjoin state regulations implementing the amendment,arguing that the cuts violated certain provisions of the federal medicaid act.id.at.like the director in our case,the defendant argued that there is no individualized federal right to reasonable medicaid standards.id.at.the court agreed with the defendant as to the claim,holding that r ather than focusing on an individualized entitlement to medical services,the provision of the medicaid act focuses on the aggregate practices of the states in establishing reasonable medicaid services.id.at.the court noted,however,that the issue was not dispositive,as plaintiffs had also brought suit under the supremacy clause.preemption claims are analyzed under a different test than section claims,affording plaintiffs an alternative theory for relief when a state law conflicts with a federal statute or regulation.id.the lack of any federally created right under the medicaid act was inconsequential to the supremacy clause analysis,and plaintiffs preemption claim was remanded for consideration on the merits.id.at.
the fifth circuit reached a similar conclusion in planned parenthood sanchez.as noted above,plaintiffs sought to enjoin implementation of texas rider,which required recipients of federal funds to cut all ties with any organization performing elective abortions.sanchez,at.advancing the same arguments asserted by the director in our case,the texas department of health contended that to seek injunctive relief,plaintiffs must meet the requirements for an action under,as recently enunciated in gonzaga university doe,namely,that the federal statutes at issue confer privately enforceable rights.id.at.the fifth circuit flatly rejected this argument,finding that it mischaracterize d planned parenthood claim 
appellees are not asking the courts to enforce their right under to secure enforcement of the public health safety act,as tdh asserts.rather,appellees supremacy clause argument is fundamentally different they argue that rider imposes conditions on the receipt of federal funds that are incompatible with the act.therefore,we need not be concerned that the supremacy clause does not of its own force create rights enforceable under.
id.the court then noted that gonzaga,by its terms,applies only to claims the supremacy clause claim advanced here is not based on a claim of right under the act,nor is it a claim for damages it is a preemption claim.the gonzaga court gave no indication that it intended to alter its prior practice regarding such claims.id.the court therefore concluded that a claim of preemption under the supremacy clause does not require a showing,as per gonzaga,that a action would also be proper.see also local union,at distinguishing between claims brought under and claims for injunctive relief under the supremacy clause qwest,at same burgio campofelice,at same.
for the reasons identified by the fifth circuit in planned parenthood sanchez,the director heavy reliance on our decision in sanchez johnson,cir,is misplaced.johnson merely applied gonzaga to a claim seeking to enforce the substantive provisions of a of the medicaid act brought under.we held that the quality of care and access provisions of a do not give rise to the type of unambiguously conferred rights required under gonzaga.see id.at.but our decision in johnson had nothing to say about a claim for injunctive relief brought under the supremacy clause.
indeed,even as the supreme court has tightened the requirements for seeking damages under,it has consistently reaffirmed the availability of injunctive relief to prevent state officials from implementing state legislation allegedly preempted by federal law.in green mansour,d,two classes of plaintiffs alleged that the state of michigan method of calculating benefits under the federal aid to families with dependent children afdc program violated federal law.id.at.while the suits were pending in federal district court,the state altered its program to comply with recent congressional amendments.id.at.these changes mooted plaintiffs claims for prospective relief,since it was undisputed that respondent calculations thereafter have conformed to federal law.id.at.plaintiffs nonetheless sought notice relief and a declaration that michigan prior conduct violated federal law.id.
the court denied relief,holding that plaintiffs requests for notice and declaratory relief constituted claims for retrospective damages and were thus barred by state sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment.id.at.all nine justices agreed,however,that injunctive relief would have been available under the supremacy clause if changes to the state program had not mooted plaintiffs prospective claims.see id.at.id.at.brennan,dissenting.writing for the majority,rehnquist noted that the availability of prospective relief of the sort awarded in ex parte young gives life to the supremacy clause.remedies designed to end a continuing violation of federal law are necessary to vindicate the federal interest in assuring the supremacy of that law.id.at.
the director arguments fail to honor this distinction,broadly asserting instead that because a of the medicaid act does not confer any substantive rights,ilc is not entitled to relief of any kind,whether prospective or retrospective.green cautioned against conflating claims for prospective and retrospective relief in precisely this manner,recognizing that a state interest in continuing to flout binding federal law is illegitimate.at.see also idaho coeur tribe,d an allegation of an ongoing violation of federal law where the requested relief is prospective is ordinarily sufficient to seek injunctive relief under ex parte young.we therefore adhere to the general rule that injunctive relief is presumptively available to remedy a state ongoing violation of federal law.
because it held that ilc could not bring suit under the supremacy clause,the district court did not technically reach petitioners standing to bring suit.as noted above,however,the first and second prongs of the district court shaw f
