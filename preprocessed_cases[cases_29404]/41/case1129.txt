this appeal concerns the scope of the expert report requirement of rule a b of the federal rules of civil procedure.in particular,the issue is whether a plaintiff pursuing a claim under the federal employers liability act fela,et,must file an expert report before the plaintiff treating physician can testify as to the cause of the plaintiff carpal tunnel syndrome.in this case,jesse fielden did not file a timely expert report from his treating physician about the cause of fielden carpal tunnel syndrome.the district court held that rule a b required the filing of the expert report and refused to consider the treating physician testimony that fielden use of a plate jack while working at csx transportation caused fielden carpal tunnel syndrome.without the treating physician testimony,there was no expert evidence that csx transportation caused fielden injury,and the district court therefore granted summary judgment for the defendant.because rule a b did not require the filing of an expert report in this case,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment.
in,fielden began working in the railroad industry,and,after brief stints in other jobs,began working as a trackman and equipment operator at csx transportation,csxt,an interstate railroad company,on june.in,fielden complained of numbness and tingling in his arms and fingers,and a law firm referred fielden to mark woodward,who diagnosed fielden with mild carpal tunnel syndrome in his right hand.in june,david southwick,fielden treating physician,diagnosed fielden with carpal tunnel syndrome in his left hand.in october,march,and february,fielden underwent a series of surgeries to alleviate his symptoms.although he does not experience the pain that he once had,fielden complains of motor skills problems and a loss of movement in his hands.
evidence of the source of fielden injuries is of two sorts.first,fielden described how he experienced pain in his right hand when operating a plate jack,a pounding and vibrating machine that jacked up a rail to permit an operator to slide a tie plate underneath.second,thomas fischer,another of fielden treating physicians,testified that he felt that fielden original carpal tunnel syndrome was a condition.
on october,fielden brought a civil action against csxt pursuant to fela alleging that csxt negligently subjected fielden to the risk of severe injury to his hands and wrists by assigning fielden to operate a plate jack machine,and that as a direct and proximate result of csxt negligence,fielden sustained severe,permanent and lasting injury to both hands and arms.fielden sought to recover money damages for lost earnings,medical expenses,and physical pain and suffering.
on april,fielden served his initial disclosure of potential witnesses,identifying southwick and fischer as individuals who may have information relevant to fielden employment history and his medical condition resulting from csxt negligence.on september,fielden responded to csxt interrogatories.interrogatory read please disclose the existence of all persons and produce all documents forthwith required by federal rule of civil procedure a a b.fielden responded by listing southwick and fischer,noting that both will testify on the issue of causation.
the deadline for filing expert reports repeatedly changed.on april,the magistrate judge issued a preliminary pretrial order directing primary expert disclosures under rule a to occur by september,discovery to continue until december,and the filing of dispositive motions by january.the order did not set a trial date.on september,the district court extended the deadline for fielden expert disclosures,and on october,csxt filed an unopposed motion for an extension of time,which the magistrate judge granted on october.at the end of all extensions,fielden needed to file expert reports by december,the new deadline for discovery was march,and the final day for filing dispositive motions was april.fielden did not provide expert reports to csxt by december.
on december,fielden counsel wrote a letter to fischer requesting a detailed narrative report and an opinion as to whether the condition for which you treated fielden is causally related to his work with the railroad.on december,the parties set southwick deposition for january.at csxt request,the parties moved the date to april,and then to june.the parties deposed southwick and fischer on june and,respectively.
on april,the final day for filing dispositive motions,csxt filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that the record did not demonstrate csxt negligence or a causal connection between csxt actions and fielden injuries.in his response to csxt motion for summary judgment,fielden attached a letter report from one of fielden treating physicians and moved under rule f for a continuance pending the completion of the depositions of fischer and southwick.
on september,the district court granted csxt motion for summary judgment and denied fielden rule f request.the district court held that fischer was an expert under rule a b and noted that fielden did not file the required expert report by the december,deadline.citing a letter from fielden counsel to fischer,the district court noted that counsel failed to request the report from fischer until days after the deadline.the court also noted that counsel letter demonstrated that counsel considered fischer to be a rule a b witness.because the district court considered fielden two treating physicians as retained experts under rule a b,it excluded their testimony as a sanction for failure to comply with the rule.finally,the district court granted summary judgment because,without expert testimony on the issue of causation,there was no genuine issue of material fact on an essential element of the claim.
reversal is required in this case because rule a b does not require an expert report from a treating physician in the context of this fela case where the proposed testimony was that a patient extensive use of a plate jack at work caused the patient carpal tunnel syndrome permitting a treating physician to testify on causation in this context is consistent with the plain language of rule a b and does not lead to the perverse results that district courts have recognized in other contexts.
rule a b by its terms provides that a party needs to file an expert report from a treating physician only if that physician was retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony.in this case,fielden did not retain fischer for the purposes of providing expert testimony because there is evidence that fischer formed his opinions as to causation at the time that he treated fielden and there is no evidence that fischer formed his opinion at the request of fielden counsel.the advisory committee notes also support the conclusion that fielden did not need to file an expert report from fischer.the note to rule states that a treating physician can be deposed or called to testify at trial without any requirement for a written report.a,cmt.amendments,subdivision a,para.under a straightforward reading of the rule and its advisory note,fielden did not need to file an expert report from fischer.
this conclusion is supported by the obvious fact that doctors may need to determine the cause of an injury in order to treat it.determining causation may therefore be an integral part of treating a patient.as a thoughtful magistrate judge reasoned in permitting causation testimony without a prior expert report,
it is within the normal range of duties for a health care provider to develop opinions regarding causation and prognosis during the ordinary course of an examination.to assume otherwise is a limiting perspective,which narrows the role of a treating physician.instead,to properly treat and diagnose a patient,the doctor needs to understand the cause of a patient injuries.see mccloughan city of springfield,doctors do not operate in a vacuum thus,the c ourt believes causation,diagnosis,and prognosis would be based on the treating physician personal knowledge.
