background 
advocate south suburban hospital advocate employs about people at its facilities in hazel crest,illinois.in the summer of,service employees international union seiu was campaigning to unionize some of them.one employee receptive to seiu campaign was susan hall,a certified nurse assistant still employed at advocate at the time of her testimony.in she had worked the graveyard shift and an occasional night shift at advocate for six and a half years.hall claims that when advocate discovered her attendance at seiu meetings and she appeared in seiu literature she was threatened by her supervisor beverly mulvihill,advocate manager of surgical services.hall also claims that a security guard warned her not to pass out seiu literature to other employees.advocate and its witnesses claim that neither of the alleged events occurred.
in a hearing before an administrative law judge alj,hall testified that two seiu representatives,identified only as grimes and julie,visited her house some time in the summer of.the precise date is unknown hall could roughly describe when events occurred in relation to each other but was mostly unable to give precise dates.after they discussed conditions at the hospital,the organizers invited hall to an seiu meeting.hall attended two such meetings at the tinley park convention center,the first about a week and a half to two weeks after grimes and julie visited hall house,the second about a week and a half after the first meeting.during the second meeting the seiu photographed her.hall only other activity prior to late july,early august was a discussion at the hospital with three about how the union had acquired their names,addresses and telephone numbers.hearing tr.at.
hall flirtation with the seiu allegedly drew a threat from advocate.she testified that on a day between late july and august,she was working a double shift night and graveyard.at or,mulvihill caught hall in the hallway and said she needed to talk to hall.id.at.thinking that she was being disciplined for some infraction,hall followed mulvihill into mulvihill office,where kathy mrozek,advocate director of nursing,was already present.id.at.mulvihill told hall to close the door,and she did.id.at.mulvihill then told hall that she had been hearing people talk about the union.hall responded that everybody was talking about it.mulvihill added that she had specifically heard that hall had been talking.id.at.hall said she did want to discuss it.mulvihill then said sternly that we make examples of people who talk about the union,and that t here will be a sacrificial lamb.id.nonplused,hill told mulvihill to do whatever and left the office.id.according to hall,mrozek was silent throughout the conversation.id.at.hall felt that her job had been threatened and telephoned grimes to tell her what had happened.id.at.
advocate contends that hall story is a complete fabrication.mulvihill testified that she never made any of the comments that hall attributed to her at any time.mrozek testified that she had not been in mulvihill office with hall on or about august,that mulvihill had never asked her to watch mulvihill discipline an employee and that she had never heard another supervisor tell hall that advocate would make a sacrificial lamb out of anyone.id.at.advocate also attempted to impeach hall with statements about the confrontation she had made in seiu videos and speeches,and with quotes from seiu pamphlets.while hall story has the same backbone in the union materials as in her testimony,the sources arguably vary with respect to where the confrontation occurred and whether mrozek was present.
reviewing the evidence,the alj concluded that mulvihill had interrogated and threatened hall and implied that the seiu was under surveillance,meaning that advocate had interfered with hall right to assist labor organizations in violation of national labor relations act a nlra,a.the alj found hall testimony credible,stating that she appeared sure of her recollection,gave spontaneous answers and held to her story under withering.alj op.at.further,she had little reason to falsely testify against advocate in light of her continued employment there,and there was no evidence that hall was hostile to management or biased as a result of having been disciplined.id.
although hall had made prior inconsistent statements and had the tendency to exaggerate or embellish her statements in minor respects,these did not shake the alj belief in the essential elements of her story.id.at.hall testified that the seiu composed the brochures and scripted her videos and speeches.to the extent that the inconsistencies could be attributed to her,they were minor.her prior statements still generally supported her testimony,and where they differed from it the alj found her testimony the more believable account.
mulvihill testimony,by contrast,sounded mechanical and rehearsed to the alj,and she appeared evasive and defensive when asked questions by opposing counsel.id.at.further,her management position and her critical description of union tactics that she seemed to feel improperly harassed employees led the alj to conclude that she was biased in favor of advocate.
mrozek,the alj found,was also biased as an advocate manager and as mulvihill personal friend.further,she had answered limited questions and had not clearly denied the key elements of hall story.her testimony that she had not witnessed any discipline,had not heard the term sacrificial lamb and had not seen hall in mulvihill office on or about august left open the possibility that there had been a confrontation not involving the dramatic sacrificial lamb comment at some time before august.
hall also testified that an advocate security guard threatened her the week of october.after briefly talking to grimes and another union organizer in the street outside the hospital,hall parked in the hospital lot.a security guard approached and asked her if she knew those people.he told her that if she talked to them on hospital property she could be arrested,and that if she passed out any of their stuff on hospital property she would be walked off the premises.hearing tr.at.although hall described the security guard,she did not know who he was and had not tried to identify him except by asking another guard if he knew a matching her description.apparently he did,one roger who was no longer employed by advocate at the time of the hearing.
the alj did not find a violation with respect to the security guard incident.although he believed that the general scenario could have occurred,hall tendency to exaggerate and embellish made him worry that the guard alleged threats may have been innocent.hall had no right to distribute union literature on company time and in patient care areas,so slight variation s in what the guard told her could make the difference between a proper instruction and a prohibited threat.additionally,he thought it unfair to advocate that hall had not identified the guard and that he now,apparently having left advocate employ,could not be located to testify.id.at.
the alj ordered advocate to cease and desist from interrogating and threatening employees and suggesting that union activities are under surveillance.it also required posted notice informing employees of their rights.advocate appealed the alj decision to the national labor relations board the nlrb or the board.the nlrb adopted and affirmed the alj decision subject to one minor modification in re advocate south suburban hospital,nlrb,wl.the parties now take the fight to this court.advocate petitions for review of the nlrb decision on many grounds the nlrb,with the intervenor seiu,petitions to have it enforced.
ii.discussion 
this is not a difficult case.we do not draw our own conclusions as to what witnesses are most convincing,or hazard a guess as to what may have happened at advocate in the summer of.as an appellate court,our task is to determine whether the nlrb legal conclusions have a reasonable basis in law,slusher nlrb,cir,whether its factual conclusions are supported by substantial evidence,nlra e f,e f,and whether the two together build an accurate and logical bridge between the evidence and the result,penney nlrb,cir,quoting sarchet chater,cir.this review is deferential.substantial evidence means evidence that a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support the nlrb conclusions if the record could reasonably be interpreted to support the nlrb,that is the end of our inquiry.slusher,at.
advocate acknowledges our limited role yet it scours the record for anything that could lead a factfinder to discredit hall and believe its own witnesses,insisting that the nlrb failed to properly discuss the inferences which could be drawn from the evidence.pet r br.at.this may reflect not only the laudable zeal of advocate advocates,but also a misunderstanding of the nlrb duty to explain its decision.at times,advocate seems to believe that reversal is automatic if it can dig up an argument for its position of whatever strength that the nlrb failed to explicitly address in advocate chosen terms.for instance,advocate states that the nlrb failure to consider or even to reference one of its weaker arguments requires the petition for review to be granted.id.at emphasis added.
section e of the nlra does not require an impossible level of detail from the nlrb.true,failure to address important evidence can sometimes cause a decision logical bridge to collapse.see,young barnhart,cir lopez barnhart,cir scott barnhart,cir zurawski halter,cir.but the duty to bridge the gap between evidence and result does not require a complete written evaluation of every piece of testimony and evidence.haynes barnhart,cir,quoting diaz chater,cir.in assessing the adequacy of the board explanation,we must use common sense to determine whether requiring additional explanation of a point would be appropriate or mere nitpicking.rice barnhart,cir.
with that in mind,we proceed to advocate various arguments against the nlrb decision.its claims can be grouped into three categories those relating to witness credibility,those relating to the nlrb general counsel failure to present certain testimony at the hearing and those alleging logical inconsistency in the nlrb decision.
witness credibility 
this case is basically a swearing contest in the union corner,susan hall in advocate,the tag team of beverly mulvihill and kathy mrozek.the nlrb adjudged hall the victor by decision,and advocate protests the referee scorekeeping.advocate insists that the nlrb findings are based in part on factors other than witness demeanor and are consequently not credibility determinations entitled to special deference beyond ordinary substantial evidence review.see services,nlrb,cir kopack nlrb,cir.we do not address that contention because advocate substantive arguments do not require us to do so.the nlrb findings are supported by substantial evidence.
susan hall 
advocate attacks the nlrb decision to credit hall testimony on two grounds first,that she was impeached by several prior inconsistent statements second,that she was biased.
prior inconsistent statements 
advocate repeatedly contrasted hall hearing testimony with arguably inconsistent accounts of her story in seiu promotional literature.it appears that mulvihill alleged threats became something of a cause celebre for seiu campaign at advocate,and hall story was recounted in various media.for instance,advocate entered into evidence an seiu pamphlet entitled faith in action.the pamphlet contains tales of several advocate employees meant to illustrate problems at the company and the need for a union.hall story,including an account of her confrontation with mulvihill written in the third person,appears in the pamphlet along with her photograph.resp t ex.at.additionally,hall told her story in videos such as untie my hands and separate and unequal,transcripts of which advocate introduced into evidence resp t ex,and in a speech at bethany church,a script from which advocate introduced into evidence resp t ex.
advocate argues that a reasonable factfinder could not believe hall because the story in some of the union materials differs from her hearing testimony.it focuses on two alleged discrepancies.first,hall at times indicated that mulvihill had confronted her in a hospital hallway,without mentioning mulvihill office second,many accounts omitted mrozek presence at the confrontation,with hall describing the confrontation as in her bethany church speech these are flimsy weapons with which to attack the nlrb findings.indeed,the statements arguably do not contradict hall testimony.the speech and pamphlet indicate that mulvihill pulled hall aside in the hall at work and spoke to her resp t ex.at resp t ex.at,but as the nlrb observes,this meshes with hall testimony that she and mulvihill moved to mulvihill office after meeting in the hallway.hall statement in her bethany church speech that mulvihill pulled me away from my patients to interrogate me is also ambiguous.resp t ex.at.she might have meant only to indicate that mrozek did not actively participate in the interrogation.
at any rate,these questions are not critical,and neither is whether hall controlled the contents of her speech and the brochures,both of which were composed largely by the union depending upon the situation,substantial evidence may support a factfinder belief in a witness despite prior inconsistent statements.see,nlrb chem fab,cir affirming the decision to credit a witness testimony regarding a manager order to remove a union sweatshirt where the witness had previously affirmed that the manager said nothing about the shirt.the circumstances and relevance of the contradiction are critical.where a contradiction goes to the heart of a witness story,belief can be error.see capric ashcroft,cir nlrb local,metallic lathers union,cir.but crediting the witness makes sense where the impeaching statements differ only with respect to minor aspects of the story or where the discrepancies are easily explained.giday gonzales,cir,shah attorney,cir.
in the present case the differences between the union promotional material and hall testimony are minor and explicable.the nlrb adopted the alj finding that any contradictions were unimportant the union material generally supported hall testimony and appeared consistent with her sworn account of the conversation.in re advocate south suburban hospital,nlrb,wl,at.moreover,the minor omissions were explicable in a persuasive pamphlet or speech composed with some literary license.id.while invention would be less understandable,omitting details of hall story in a persuasive context would help make her story more concise and forceful.hall testimony supported the nlrb take on the union material.for instance,she said that the pamphlets were advertisement.and what i mean by advertisement is,is that they have taken things that other people have said or that was quoted as union meetings sic and they just kind of threw it together.hearing tr.at.later,when asked why she made statements that she thought contained inaccuracies,she responded that she was trying to make a point and that the seiu said it would be good because it would show the type of coercion that you all are subjected to,again emphasizing that the union literature was not designed to recount hall story in full but to convincingly illustrate purported problems at advocate.id.at.given the omissions limited relevance to the core of hall story and her explanation for them,it was reasonable for the nlrb to credit her testimony.
advocate also argues that the nlrb could not believe hall because she was biased against advocate.the nlrb found that she was not biased in light of her continuing employment with the hospital at the time of the hearing,which gave her reason to testify in its favor and avoid the ire of her superiors.advocate south,wl,at,citing in re flexsteel industries,nlrb,holding that the testimony of current employees contradicting their managers is adverse to the employees pecuniary interests and particularly reliable.advocate argues that every employee who complains about mistreatment at work is necessarily biased.we do not agree.the case advocate cites in support concludes only that a particular former employee was disgruntled because of a past dispute with a company,not that all dissatisfied employees are untrustworthy.see t j meat packing,serv.employees int l union,local,wl,at.while the alj statement that there was no evidence of bias was perhaps an overstatement,it was reasonable to find any such evidence of bias outweighed by hall current employment.
beverly mulvihill 
as advocate seeks to discredit the nlrb witness,so it seeks to bolster its own,arguing that the nlrb finding that mulvihill was biased is unsupported by the record.it is supported,despite advocate flurry of objections.when asked what she had heard employees saying about the union,mulvihill repeatedly described the seiu tactics in harsh terms,saying for example that they would go away,s tuck their foot in employees door s hearing tr.at and pound ed on people car windows when they were trying to get into work,trying to give them information id.at.advocate argues that mulvihill was only repeating others words,but that is not clear in the record.advocate also urges that mulvihill statement at an employee meeting that she did not have an opinion with regard to unionization proves her neutrality.it proves that she is not both biased and foolish,but it leaves the possibility that she is wise enough to display bias only behind a closed door.neither do mulvihill relatives who are union members prove her friendly with the seiu in particular.finally,advocate says that there was no evidence that mulvihill adopted sentiments expressed at managerial training sessions,forgetting,of course,hill testimony that mulvihill threatened her with vague doom for talking about the seiu.
even assuming that mulvihill is biased,the nlrb still adopted the alj finding that mulvihill seemed mechanical and rehearsed,as well as hesitant and evasive when asked questions by opposing counsel.advocate south,wl,at.such demeanor evidence alone can,in the present circumstances,support a conclusion that mulvihill lied.
kathy mrozek 
the nlrb disbelieved mrozek,adopting the alj conclusion that she was biased by her friendship with mulvihill,and thought she had given very narrow testimony that did not fully contradict hall account.both conclusions were supported by substantial evidence.
advocate urges that friendship alone can never support a finding of bias,citing a case that instead holds that a factfinder is not compelled to disbelieve a friend testimony.hampton leibach,cir holding that an attorney failure to present the exculpatory testimony of a criminal defendant friends prejudiced the defendant.friendship is evidence for a factfinder to consider,and it supported the nlrb conclusion here.
assuming mrozek testimony were true,the nlrb additionally concluded that mrozek had not contradicted hall account.mrozek testified that she had not been in mulvihill office with hall on or about august,hearing tr.at,that mulvihill had never invited her to witness mulvihill discipline an employee and that she had never heard anyone tell hall that advocate would make a sacrificial lamb out of an employee id.at.the possibility remains that mrozek had witnessed a confrontation before august in which mulvihill had not used the term sacrificial lamb.advocate notes that in legal parlance the phrase on or about indicates a reasonable period of time around the named date,and argues that mrozek testimony must be taken to indicate the full period in which hall said the encounter could have occurred.see,lewis merrill,or.but mrozek,who so far as the record reveals has no legal expertise,might have understood the attorney question differently,especially in light of advocate unsuccessful effort to prove that the alleged confrontation could have occurred only on august the seiu brief suggested a narrow understanding of her answer by revealing that mrozek had been in mulvihill office earlier in the summer.id.at.in these circumstances,the nlrb understanding of mrozek testimony was supported by substantial evidence.
advocate also argues,without citation,that the alj failure to further question mrozek to determine what she understood on or about august to mean demonstrated bias requiring reversal.the constitution requires unbiased adjudicators in administrative proceedings,but aljs are presumed fair absent contrary evidence of favoritism.see liteky united states,d schweiker mcclure,d.in the present case,the alj failure to pin down mrozek can be easily explained without the farfetched theory that he was determined to build a record to support judgment for the nlrb.he might simply have missed the problem at first.besides,in an adversary legal system it is generally the attorney duty to provide specific testimony.advocate can not palm off on the alj its apparent failure to properly question mrozek.
adverse inference from grimes failure to testify 
advocate attacks not only the inferences the nlrb drew from testimony the alj heard,but one it drew from testimony the alj did hear,or rather that it drew from the nlrb general counsel failure to present it.the general counsel flirted with calling the seiu organizer,grimes,to the stand,presumably to corroborate hall testimony and rebut advocate fabrication defense.hall testified that she telephoned grimes shortly after her confrontation with mulvihill if that is true,grimes could confirm the conversation and its contents.but the general counsel chose not to call grimes.advocate urges that this must be because grimes would have corroborated hall,but would have instead critically contradicted her,or otherwise made some damning admission.what form the contradiction or admission would have taken is,of course,speculative.below,advocate urged that grimes would have testified that hall original story was the one told in the union materials,aiding its impeachment efforts.resp t exceptions to the administrative law judge decision,resp t reply to charging party and general counsel answer to resp t exceptions and br.in supp.at.advocate now suggests that grimes would have revealed that the chronology of hall account was confused and impossible specifically,she would have indicated that the second union meeting,which hall said occurred before the confrontation,occurred after august,which hall instead said postdated the confrontation.pet r br.at.advocate argues that the nlrb should have inferred that grimes would have testified to such an effect and taken that inference into account in reaching its decision,an application of the missing witness rule.see interstate circuit,united states.roper nlrb,cir,wigmore on evidence.
the argument collapses when one considers that advocate had the power to compel testimony.if grimes would have done so much damage,why did advocate put her on the stand the inference advocate urges against the general counsel can be turned back at itself,which is why we have previously held that a party can take advantage of the missing witness rule only when the missing witness was peculiarly in the power of the other party to produce.penney nlrb,cir,quoting oxman,cir see also wigmore both parties agree that advocate could have subpoenaed grimes.advocate does not argue that it was somehow unaware of the potential relevance of grimes testimony or otherwise unable to bring her to the stand.under these circumstances,the nlrb failure to draw an inference in favor of advocate was entirely reasonable.
even if an adverse infer
