petitioner marion hospital corporation mhc seeks review of a decision by the national labor relations board board or nlrb,holding that petitioner committed multiple unfair labor practices ulps.the board found that mhc violated a and of the national labor relations act nlra or act,a,in refusing to bargain with the designated bargaining agent of its employees,southern illinois laborers district council local local or union,withdrawing recognition from the union,and unilaterally changing conditions of employment.see marion hosp.marion memorial,illinois laborers dist.council local,wl,at marion hospital.as a remedy for these violations,the board issued an affirmative order to bargain.
mhc claims that the cited conduct was not illegal,because company officials had a reasonable doubt about the union majority status.mhc contends that,in finding the disputed ulps,the board misapplied the legal standard enunciated in allentown mack sales serv.nlrb,d employer may withdraw recognition from an incumbent union based on reasonable doubt or genuine,reasonable uncertainty supported by objective considerations,and ignored substantial record evidence supporting the employer defense.mhc also challenges the affirmative order to bargain,claiming that the board engaged in only a cursory recitation of the considerations required by this court in vincent indus.plastics nlrb.the nlrb disputes each of petitioner contentions and for enforcement of its orders.
we deny mhc petition for review and grant the board for enforcement.substantial evidence supports the board finding that petitioner refused to bargain with the union.mhc was aware of nothing occurring before the refusal to bargain to give rise to a reasonable,uncertainty over the union majority status.it is also undisputed that mhc did nothing to mitigate,rescind,or otherwise remedy its refusal to bargain.the employer remained firm in its unlawful refusal to bargain,which continued unabated for over a month through the time when mhc withdrew recognition from the union.because nothing happened to cure the initial unlawful refusal to bargain,the employer subsequent withdrawal of recognition was unjustified.therefore,the board was fully warranted in issuing an order to bargain in this case.
background 
the facts of this case are fully recounted in the board decision,see marion hospital,wl,at,so we merely summarize the most salient facts here.since,marion memorial hospital has been owned and operated by mhc as a private health care facility in southern illinois.id.at.employees at marion memorial hospital are organized into separate units for medical and administrative personnel.even before petitioner acquired the hospital,all employees were represented by local.id.the record indicates that the union and petitioner successfully negotiated a series of collective bargaining agreements,the last of which expired in april of.id.the main issues presented in this case concern efforts by the parties to negotiate a successor contract.
the parties commenced negotiations over a new labor contract in may of,but talks stalled on issues relating to wages,a pension plan,and a wage incentive program for medical transcriptionists.id.after a round of additional meetings yielded no progress,the parties requested assistance from the federal mediation and conciliation service.on july,petitioner presented its best offer to the union.id.representatives from local took that proposal to the employees in the bargaining unit.on july,the employees voted to reject the employer offer the employees also voted in support of a strike authorization notice.the union never called a strike,however,ultimately preferring instead to pursue bargaining.
not all bargaining unit employees endorsed the strike authorization.between late july and early august,some employees who had demurred on the strike authorization notified mhc of their intent to change their status in the union and become financial core members of local.id.at.and,on july,one hospital employee,joy woods,initiated an effort to decertify local.id.at.
the union agreed to rescind the strike notice and continue contract talks with petitioner,which resumed on august.id.negotiations continued until august,when the union presented a to mhc offer regarding wages and pension benefits.id.petitioner requested additional time to review the and to calculate the costs.petitioner agreed to reconvene bargaining on september,but that proved to be an idle promise.
on september,laborers international union of north america,international the parent organization of local filed a petition with the board to become the certified bargaining agent for employees at the hospital.id.the board agreed to a consolidated proceeding to consider the international petition for certification with the pending decertification petition filed earlier by woods.the hearing on both matters was scheduled for september,but the international withdrew its petition for certification on that date.the board,however,allowed the affected parties to present evidence on the decertification petition.during the course of the proceeding,the parties agreed that the size of the bargaining unit at issue was about workers.id.
meanwhile,the union sent letters to mhc on september and requesting a resumption of bargaining.on september,mhc responded with a letter questioning whether the local was still authorized to negotiate on behalf of the unit employees.see also letter from leonard sachs,counsel,mhc,to randall mayhew,president,local,reprinted in joint appendix mhc letter.mhc also requested from both local and the international copies of their constitutions,related,and procedures for certifying a new bargaining representative.mhc letter at.mhc letter made it clear that bargaining would not resume until the union sent the material requested and,then,only if warranted.id.the union sent five additional letters in september requesting mhc to meet and bargain,all to no avail.
on october,employee woods,whose decertification petition was still pending before the nlrb,presented petitions to mhc with the signatures of workers who were allegedly dissatisfied with the union representation.marion hospital,wl,at.woods cover letter accompanying the petitions stated that a majority of workers no longer wished to be represented by the union.id.the petitions included a total of dated signatures from various hospital employees.of these signatures,were dated between july,and august,while seven were dated between october,and october.the remaining signatures were those of employees who were not members of the bargaining unit.id.at.
on october,a hospital administrator told employees that mhc was withdrawing official recognition from the union and that mhc would begin unilaterally implementing its proposed wage changes.id.at.thereafter,petitioner unilaterally changed a number of conditions of employment at the hospital.id.
local filed ulp charges against mhc,and the general counsel for the nlrb issued a consolidated complaint on december.id.at.an alj conducted an evidentiary hearing and,on april,found that petitioner had violated a and of the nlra in refusing to bargain on september,withdrawing recognition from the union on october,and unilaterally implementing changes to the employees terms and conditions of employment.id.at.
with respect to the refusal to bargain,the alj found that mhc letter of september,was undisputed evidence that petitioner had placed an unlawful condition on bargaining with local.id.the judge rejected petitioner assertions that its refusal was permissible because of a good faith doubt about the union authority.the alj found that the union aborted strike activity,the international withdrawn certification petition,the pending decertification petition,and the employees letters gave petitioner no credible reasons to question local authority to bargain on behalf of the employees.id.at.
the alj reached a similar conclusion with respect to mhc defense of its conduct in october of.on this point,petitioner principally claimed that the employee petitions established uncertainty sufficient to justify mhc withdrawal of recognition on october.id.at.the alj,however,discounted the petitions,because mhc did not receive the petitions or know of their contents until after unlawfully refusing to bargain with the union on september.the alj thus found that the petitions were tainted,so they could not support a withdrawal of recognition.see also lee lumber.material nlrb.
the board,on a divided vote,agreed with the alj ultimate conclusion that all of the employer challenged actions violated the nlra.first,the board affirmed the alj finding that the september refusal to bargain was illegal and that petitioner had failed to offer any credible evidence calling into question the union majority status.marion hospital,wl,at.specifically,the board noted that neither the international certification petition nor woods decertification petition could overcome the presumption that the union enjoyed continued majority status.the board also found that the actions of the employees who became financial core members made clear their desire for continued representation by the union.id.at.
the board likewise agreed with the alj that mhc committed an ulp when it withdrew recognition from the union.however,the board disagree d with the alj finding that all the signatures on the antiunion petitions the employer received on october were tainted by the employer september unlawful refusal to bargain.id.on this point,the board found that only employee signatures dated after september are presumptively tainted by the unlawful refusal to bargain.no such presumption of unlawful taint attaches to those employee signatures dated before september.id.the board nonetheless held that,under the allentown mack standard,mhc had not established a reasonable,uncertainty about the union majority status 
the record reveals that the bargaining unit consisted of employees on october,when mhc withdrew recognition.as stated above,the petitions mhc received from employee woods together with the letter appeared to contain the signatures of employees.however,examination of those petitions reveals that of the signatory employees,were not unit employees on october and others signed the petition after mhc refusal to bargain beginning on september.in sum,the bargaining unit consisted of employees,but only employee signatures on the antiunion petitions can be counted,short of a majority.such a showing is insufficient to establish a reasonable uncertainty as to the union continuing majority status.
aside from the petitions,the record contains no other evidence that might establish uncertainty as to the union continuing majority status.furthermore,even if the respondent had presented additional evidence of employee disaffection arising at the time it received the antiunion petitions,the lee lumber presumption of unlawful taint would apply.because the presumption has not been rebutted,any such evidence would not be probative of a reasonable uncertainty.

finally,in light of the entire record,the board found that an affirmative bargaining order was warranted to remedy mhc unlawful refusals to bargain.id.at.after considering the facts of the case in light of the nlra overall goals,the board found that an order to bargain was more appropriate than a less restrictive alternative.
this petition for review and the board for enforcement followed.
ii.discussion 
an employer who is charged with refus ing to bargain collectively with representatives of his employees,a,may defend against the charge by proving that it possessed a reasonable doubt that the union commanded majority support among unit employees.this exception to the duty to bargain only applies where an employer demonstrates a genuine,reasonable uncertainty about whether a union enjoys the continuing support of a majority of unit employees.allentown mack,at.at.and any such uncertainty must focus on objective considerations supported by evidence external to the employer own subjective impressions.pacific bell nlrb,quoting allentown mack,at.at emphasis omitted.to mount this defense successfully,the employer must overcome the presumption that an incumbent union enjoys majority support.scepter,nlrb.
an employer may not succeed with a genuine,reasonable uncertainty defense using evidence of employee disaffection arising after an unlawful refusal to bargain.the board presumes that any employee disaffection in such circumstances is unlawfully tainted.see prime,nlrb.therefore,a withdrawal of recognition following an unlawful refusal to bargain is illegal unless the employer can show that the preceding refusal to bargain was cured 
the presumption can be rebutted only by an employer showing that employee disaffection arose after the employer resumed its recognition of the union and bargained for a reasonable period of time without committing any additional unfair labor practices that would detrimentally affect the bargaining.

in the instant case,mhc has not rebutted this presumption.the board finding that mhc unlawfully refused to bargain on september is fully supported by substantial evidence in the record.see universal camera nlrb.the employer had no credible basis on or before that date upon which to rest a reasonable,uncertainty over the union majority status.furthermore,mhc did nothing to mitigate,rescind,or otherwise remedy its refusal to bargain before subsequently withdrawing recognition.the record is thus clear that the unlawful refusal to bargain never abated before mhc withdrew recognition from the union.therefore,because nothing happened after september to cure the unlawful refusal to bargain,the subsequent withdrawal of recognition was unlawful.it is true,as the board found,that not all of the employee signatures on the antiunion petitions were tainted,because some were given before the september refusal to bargain.that fact is of no moment,however,because mhc was unaware of any such antiunion petitions when it refused to bargain on september.and the september refusal to bargain was never cured.
in an effort to overcome this failing in its case,mhc argues that its demand for information on september,was not a refusal to bargain.even if the demand was illegal,petitioner adds,its refusal to bargain was nonetheless justified in light of the certification and decertification petitions filed with the board,the notifications from employees who had changed their status in the union,and the union aborted strike activity.these arguments are specious.therefore,the board was fully justified in concluding that mhc asserted objective considerations for refusing to bargain as of september,either individually or in combination,do not establish reasonable uncertainty.marion hospital,wl,at.
in mhc september letter to the union,the employer made it clear that it would not resume collective bargaining unless it gained access to the rules and procedures covering the union and its parent organization.mhc letter at.the union was under no obligation to comply with mhc demand,because the employer had no right to obtain the union files being sought.see pacific bell,at.therefore,the board reasonably found that mhc demand for this information as a condition of bargaining was an unlawful refusal to bargain.
mhc points to the circumstances surrounding the international certification petition,as if to suggest that these events gave rise to uncertainty regarding the union majority status.the board unsurprisingly rejected this argument out of hand,because the international petition was no longer pending when mhc refused to bargain on september.the board additionally held that the international certification petition could not give rise to uncertainty,because the mere existence of a rival union petition can not itself call into doubt an incumbent union majority status.nlrb maywood plant of grede plastics.for much the same reason,the board properly rejected mhc claim that the petition to decertify local was credible proof of good faith uncertainty 
allowing an employer to refuse to bargain in the face of either a decertification petition,a petition for representation,or both,would not give due weight to the incumbent union presumption of continuing majority status,especia
