this is a diversity action which was dismissed under.b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.plaintiffs thomas pace and karol pace plaintiffs,the parents and heirs of the deceased,angie putnam,brought this action against defendant barry swerdlow defendant.plaintiffs originally hired defendant,a licensed physician,to serve as their expert witness in a medical malpractice case plaintiffs had filed in utah state court.in the medical malpractice case,plaintiffs had sued the surgical center and the doctors who treated their daughter and released her from their care shortly before she died.after the state court dismissed the medical malpractice case,plaintiffs filed the present action against defendant in utah state court.defendant removed the case to federal court based upon diversity jurisdiction.plaintiffs claim that defendant abrupt change of position,on the eve of trial,caused the state court to dismiss their medical malpractice case.specifically,plaintiffs allege that defendant committed professional malpractice,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and negligent infliction of emotional distress.defendant filed a motion to dismiss under.b,and the district court granted the motion,holding that defendant change of position was not the proximate cause of the state court decision to dismiss the medical malpractice case.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and reverse and remand.
plaintiffs are residents of utah,and they are bringing this action pursuant to utah code ann,as the parents and heirs of their daughter,angie putnam.putnam died after her release from the hospital after having breast augmentation surgery.prior to her release,it is alleged that she complained to doctors that she was having difficulty breathing and was experiencing pain of nine on a scale of ten.following her death the night of her surgery,plaintiffs filed a medical malpractice action against the doctors who treated her.pace shuput,case utah,third dist.
defendant is a licensed physician and a resident of california who approached plaintiffs counsel,michael lawrence,to offer his services as an expert witness in the medical malpractice case.plaintiffs retained defendant as their expert witness and supplied him with the medical records pertaining to putnam surgery and subsequent death.after reviewing the records,defendant documented his opinion in an affidavit dated september.in the affidavit,defendant stated his belief,based upon a reasonable degree of medical certainty,that shuput and ihc surgical center did breach the appropriate standard of care when releasing angela putnam under the circumstances aplt,ex.a,at,defendant also stated,given my expertise,training,education,experience,and pursuant to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,it is my opinion that putnam should not have been released but should have been monitored overnight.if she had been monitored overnight,it is very likely that she would be alive today.id.at.originally,this last sentence read,if she had been monitored overnight,she would be alive today,but defendant added the phrase,it is very likely that,in his own handwriting.see id.in addition,defendant affidavit opined,
it is further my opinion that it is a breach of the standard of care for both the anesthesiologist surgical center,whoever made that decision,to have released putnam with her symptoms of difficulty breathing and the level of chest pain she was experiencing.again,she should have been admitted to the hospital and monitored through the night.
id.at.finally,defendant stated his ultimate conclusion that,a s a direct and proximate result of her premature discharge,putnam died.id.at.defendant did not alter this last sentence from its original wording.see id.
on april,plaintiffs counsel,lawrence,wrote a letter to defendant,in which he requested that defendant review shuput written discovery responses.the discovery responses contained shuput reasons for discharging putnam,rather than admitting her to a hospital and monitoring her condition.defendant did not alter his affidavit after reviewing these discovery responses.in addition,lawrence provided defendant with a copy of shuput deposition transcript,and another of plaintiffs retained counsel,gregory hansen,again made shuput deposition transcript available to defendant immediately before defendant own deposition was taken on january,
when defendant was deposed,he did not prove to be a strong advocate for plaintiffs claims.opposing counsel asked defendant if he believe d it consistent with ethical practices for expert witness es in the guidelines approved by the american society of anesthesiologists asa to testify against an anesthesiologist when you have not asked for his deposition transcript,if there is one,so that you can see his side of the story id.at.defendant responded,i think it would have been good for me to have seen it,and i did not ask for it.i did not think to ask for it.and i would comment upon the ethics thereof.id.defendant also admitted that he had never testified in trial,that he was not aware that shuput deposition had been taken,and that he was a relative novice at this whole thing.id.at.
as for the merits of plaintiffs claim,defendant testified that his ultimate opinion here is that discharging this patient with severity of pain,as documented in the pacu record,was not something that a prudent physician in shuput situation should have done.id.at.as to causation,defendant and opposing counsel had the following exchange 
q are you of the opinion,doctor,that if the patient had been admitted to the hospital,she would be alive today 
a i of the opinion that if she had been admitted to the hospital,there an increased probability that she would have been alive today.
q but you can not state within a reasonable degree of medical probability,can you,doctor,that she would have been alive today if she had been admitted to the hospital 
id.at.defendant also agreed that shuput was not required under the standard of care to read putnam pain score,and that if shuput was reassured that this patient pain was moderate,reasonable,then he does need to look at the pain score.id.at.further,defendant testified that he did not know what shuput knew about putnam pain complaints,id.at,and that shuput would not have breached the standard of care if he felt the patient was not at that level of severity,id.at.
at the end of the deposition,defendant was asked if he had any other opinions or criticisms that he intend ed to offer in this case,or had any clarifications or retractions of any statements that he had given today that he would like to make.id.at.to both questions,defendant responded,not that i can think of.id.hansen then told defendant that,once the deposition transcript was available,defendant would have two weeks to review it and get the changes back to lawrence,after which lawrence would deliver them to opposing counsel.id.at.
following the deposition,defendant called lawrence by phone and complained that opposing counsel was mean.defendant also told lawrence that he did not want problems with his license defendant requested a copy of shuput deposition transcript,and lawrence sent him a copy,as well as copies of the deposition transcripts of the two surgical center nurses.after receiving these transcripts,as well as the transcript from his own deposition,defendant made edits and drafted a addendum to his deposition.during this time,defendant did not communicate with plaintiffs or their counsel,lawrence and hansen.
the addendum to defendant deposition directly opposed plaintiffs malpractice claims and supported shuput defense.defendant stated that he had reviewed the deposition transcripts of shuput and the nurses,and on that basis,he wish ed to modify his opinions accordingly.compl.ex.f,supp.roa,at.he ultimately concluded 
as such,it is apparent that shuput and the pacu nurses,on the basis of their appropriate assessment of putnam postanesthetic recovery course,felt that the pain level was not as documented by the pain score and was much more moderate and mild.therefore,it is now my opinion,that shuput care of specifically his decision to discharge her from the intermountain surgery center on within the standard of care.
id.at citation omitted.on friday,february,without contacting lawrence or hansen beforehand,defendant simultaneously submitted this addendum by facsimile to lawrence and opposing counsel 
several days earlier,shuput had filed a motion for summary judgment.shuput based his motion,in part,on a lack of,that defendant deposition testimony did not show that shuput care or treatment caused putnam death.with the summary judgment hearing approaching on monday,february,and trial scheduled for approximately one week later,plaintiffs attempted to contact defendant about his addendum,but they were unsuccessful.they also sent a letter to defendant,demanding that he repair the damage that he had caused to plaintiffs case.at the summary judgment hearing,plaintiffs were able to obtain a brief continuance,but when defendant refused to help them,plaintiffs moved for another continuance of both the hearing on the summary judgment motion and the trial,withdrew defendant as their testifying expert,and filed a motion with the court for permission to designate a different liability expert witness to replace defendant.plaintiffs attached defendant addendum to these motions.plaintiffs did not file a memorandum opposing the motion for summary judgment.
ultimately,the utah state court denied plaintiffs motions and granted summary judgment in favor of shuput in the medical malpractice action.in its formal order,the court explained 
the court,thus having been fully advised of the motions and memoranda filed in this case and being fully aware of the record,facts and arguments in the matter and finding good cause appearing therefore,granted defendant shuput motion for summary judgment with prejudice for the reasons and upon the grounds stated therein and for the reason that swerdlow testimony and addendum fail to meet the grounds necessary to pursue any malpractice claim against shuput.

instead,plaintiffs commenced the instant action against defendant in utah state court.plaintiffs allege that defendant abrupt change of position,on the eve of trial,caused the state court to dismiss their medical malpractice case.specifically,plaintiffs present claims for professional malpractice,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and negligent infliction of emotional distress.defendant removed the case to federal court and filed a motion to dismiss under.b,arguing that witness immunity barred plaintiffs claims,defendant modified opinion was not the sole or primary ground for dismissal of the underlying case,and each of plaintiffs claims failed upon independent grounds.
the district court granted defendant rule b motion,holding that defendant change of position was not the proximate cause of the state court decision to dismiss the medical malpractice case.see dist,aplt.roa,at.as a preliminary matter,the court decided not to reach the issue of expert witness immunity because it presented an issue of first impression under utah law,and the lack of proximate cause was dispositive,rendering a decision on witness immunity unnecessary.id.at.then,the court held that,even without defendant change of position,defendant original affidavit was not strong enough to withstand a motion for summary judgment.the court explained that the two statements in the affidavit addressing statement,if she had been monitored overnight,it is very likely that she would be alive today,and the statement,as a direct and proximate result of her premature discharge,putnam died were in conflict and doomed plaintiffs medical malpractice case even before defendant change of position.id.at.the court also explained that plaintiffs failure to file a memorandum in opposition to shuput motion for summary judgment contributed to the state court grant of summary judgment in shuput favor as much as anything else did.id.at.thus,the district court granted the motion to dismiss all seven of plaintiffs claims against defendant.id.at.
as a preliminary matter,the parties dispute whether we should treat the ruling appealed as a grant of a motion to dismiss under.b,or as a grant of a motion for summary judgment under.c.before the district court,defendant titled his motion as a motion to dismiss and submitted it pursuant to.b.motion to dismiss,aplt.roa,at.the district court likewise treated this as a motion to dismiss,and explained 
swerdlow argues that plaintiffs can not demonstrate as a matter of law that he caused the dismissal of the malpractice action.because plaintiffs attached several exhibits from the underlying action to their complaint,the court can consider those materials and all of the materials referenced in the complaint on this motion to dismiss.the court can also take judicial notice of all the materials in the state court file.

the district court was correct in considering these materials on a motion to dismiss under.b.see utah gospel mission salt lake city,cir we have recognized however,that a document central to the plaintiff claim and referred to in the complaint may be considered in resolving a motion to dismiss,at least where the document authenticity is not in dispute.dean witter reynolds,howsam,cir it is accepted practice that,if a plaintiff does not incorporate by reference or attach a document to its complaint,but the document is referred to in the complaint and is central to the plaintiff claim,a defendant may submit an indisputably authentic copy to the court to be considered on a motion to dismiss.quoting gff associated wholesale grocers,cir,rev on other grounds,d zimomra alamo,cir citing.as authoriz ing a federal court to take judicial notice of adjudicative facts at any stage of the proceedings,and in the absence of a request of a party,and explaining that the district court properly took judicial notice of an ordinance on a motion to dismiss.thus,we have summarized the facts of the case by citation to the complaint and documents attached to the complaint,as well as state court documents of which the district court took judicial notice.see supra part

the district court erred in its determination that plaintiffs loss was not caused by any alleged change in opinion by swerdlow.dist,aplt.roa,at.under.b,we look to the specific allegations in the complaint to determine whether they plausibly support a legal claim for relief.alvarado,at.viewing this case through the lens of a rule b dismissal,we conclude that the district court improperly drew critical inferences against plaintiffs,and plaintiffs have alleged facts that,if proven,could establish the proximate cause element in their action against defendant.
first,the district court improperly concluded that the two statements in the affidavit addressing statement,if she had been monitored overnight,it is very likely that she would be alive today,and the statement,as a direct and proximate result of her premature discharge,putnam died were in conflict and necessarily doomed plaintiffs medical malpractice case even before defendant change of position.in their underlying medical malpractice action brought pursuant to utah law,plaintiffs needed to prove 
the standard of care required of physicians under similar circumstances practicing in the same field or specialty,that the applicable standard of care was breached,that the injury to the plaintiff was proximately caused by the defendant negligence,and that damages occurred as a result of defendant breach of duty.
kent pioneer valley,utah quoting dalley utah valley reg l med,utah.because of the complex issues involved in a determination of proximate cause in a medical malpractice case,plaintiffs had to provide expert testimony establishing that the health care provider negligence proximately caused the injury.id.in this context,utah courts have defined proximate cause as follows 
proximate cause is that cause which,in natural and continuous sequence,unbroken by an efficient intervening cause,produces the injury and without which the result would not have occurred.it is the efficient one that necessarily sets in operation the factors that accomplish the injury.state lawson,utah.further,there can be more than one proximate cause of an injury so long as each is a concurrent contributing factor in causing the injury.see anderson parson paving,utah,jacques farrimond,utah.
steffensen smith mgmt,utah.further,under utah law,i t is well established that the question of proximate cause is generally reserved for the jury,and o nly in rare cases may a trial judge rule as a matter of law on the issue of proximate causation.id.
given the utah proximate cause standard,defendant affidavit almost certainly would have enabled plaintiffs to survive a motion for summary judgment in the underlying medical malpractice action.tellingly,shuput did not view the affidavit as being weak.rather,in his motion for summary judgment filed in the medical malpractice action,shuput proximate cause argument relied upon defendant deposition defendant affidavit.nor do the statements,if she had been monitored overnight,it is very likely that she would be alive today,and,as a direct and proximate result of her premature discharge,putnam died,necessarily conflict.the phrase very likely denotes a high probability of putnam being alive today if her doctors had monitored her overnight.this is perfectly consistent with the affidavit second statement addressing proximate considering that we are analyzing these statements on a motion to dismiss under.b.in that context,the district court erred in characterizing them as conflicting statements.
in addition,the district court erred in its ultimate conclusion that defendant change of position was not the proximate cause of the utah state court granting summary judgment against plaintiffs in their medical malpractice action.under the utah proximate cause standard,there can be more than one proximate cause of an injury so long as each is a concurrent contributing factor in causing the injury.steffensen,at.here,the state court basis for granting summary judgment in favor of shuput was the following 
the court,thus having been fully advised of the motions and memoranda filed in this case and being fully aware of the record,facts and arguments in the matter and finding good cause appearing therefore,granted defendant shuput motion for summary judgment with prejudice for the reasons and upon the grounds stated therein and for the reason that swerdlow testimony and addendum fail to meet the grounds necessary to pursue any malpractice claim against shuput.
decision and order of utah state court,compl.ex.i,supp.roa,at.this language indicates that defendant change of position,as manifested in the addendum,was a concurrent contributing factor in causing the utah state court to grant summary judgment in favor of shuput.see steffensen,at.as such,and particularly on a motion to dismiss,the district court erred in concluding that defendant change of position,as evidenced by his addendum to his deposition,was not the proximate cause of the state court grant of summary judgment.
the plaintiffs failure to file a memorandum in response to shuput motion for summary judgment does not change the analysis.shuput had filed his motion for summary judgment several days before plaintiffs received defendants addendum to his deposition.upon receiving defendant addendum,plaintiffs worked diligently to confront the changed circumstances,and in light of defendant abrupt change of position,a responsive filing by plaintiffs would have made little plaintiffs were,at that point,without an expert witness.plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that defendant change of position,as well as the timing of that change of position,proximately caused the state court grant of summary judgment,and the district court erred in concluding otherwise.
because the district court held that the proximate cause issue was dispositive on all seven of plaintiffs claims,it never addressed the alternative grounds for,whether expert witness immunity barred plaintiffs claims,or whether each of plaintiffs claims failed upon independent grounds.based on the record,it is unclear whether plaintiffs complaint fails under these alternative grounds.on remand,therefore,the district court is free to determine whether expert witness immunity bars plaintiffs whether that question should be certified to the utah supreme whether,for each of plaintiffs seven claims,the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.see conkle potter,cir.
we reverse and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.in addition,defendant motion to certify the expert witness immunity issue to the utah supreme court is denied with leave to reassert it before the district court.
i agree with my colleagues thoughtful analysis of the proximate cause issue and their conclusion that swerdlow has not shown,as a matter of law,that his initial affidavit was so weak or contradictory it would have necessarily failed to defeat summary judgment in the underlying state malpractice action.but we may of course affirm the district court for any grounds supported by the record,see,proctor united parcel,cir,and i respectfully submit that a review of the complaint yields multiple other grounds upon which the district court decision should be affirmed.
in bell atl.twombly,d,the supreme court changed the way we look at motions to dismiss under.b.prior to twombly,every law student learned from their civil procedure professors the familiar conley refrain that dismissal is inappropriate under.and unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling it to relief.see conley gibson,d.in twombly,the supreme court retired conley and instructed that we must determine whether a complaint has set forth factual allegations sufficient to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.id.at.in doing so,we look to the specific allegations in the complaint to determine whether they plausibly support a legal claim for relief.alvarado,llc,cir 
the scenario the supreme court addressed in twombly bears striking similarities to the one we face today.there,the plaintiffs alleged that the baby bells had entered into a conspiracy to restrain trade in violation of section of the sherman act,twombly.at,and pointed to the bells parallel conduct as evidence of such a conspiracy,id.at.but the court emphasized that parallel business conduct can be consistent either with an illegal conspiracy or with legal business strategies.id.because the plaintiffs had failed to identify facts plausibly suggesting,rather than merely raising the possibility of,an illegal agreement,the court dismissed the case.
here,plaintiffs have alleged facts showing that swerdlow changed his expert opinion.but,as in twombly,the facts alleged regarding swerdlow change of opinion could rationally support at least two opposing inferences.first,one might infer that his behavior was.swerdlow changed his opinion,we are encouraged to surmise,because he feared counsel meanness and threat to attack swerdlow medical license.changing one opinion for such reasons,plaintiffs seem to assert,amounts to professional malpractice or some other form of tortious conduct.second,and very differently,one might just as easily suppose that swerdlow simply and honestly changed his professional opinion about the propriety of shuput actions as he learned more about those actions.
it is,of course,not clear whether utah recognizes the doctrine of absolute witness immunity,and if it does not,whether it is possible to state a claim for professional malpractice or some similar tort against one own expert witness.op.at.but,even supposing that utah would allow such a suit,plaintiffs allegations fall well short of the line twombly has drawn.if twombly means anything,it means that plaintiffs had to plead some facts that would,if proved,allow a jury to infer both that swerdlow change of opinion was something other than an innocent and professional reassessment of his expert opinion in light of newly considered evidence and that his change of opinion caused their damages.
perhaps most obviously,one might addressed these issues by alleging if the facts permitted it that another expert,provided with all the information available to swerdlow at the time he changed his opinion,still would thought shuput engaged in as in twombly,had plaintiffs alleged some facts suggesting a conspiratorial agreement rather than mere parallel conduct,their complaint might well have survived.as it is,however,we are given no facts suggesting that any responsible physician,after reviewing the full record,would thought shuput conduct constituted malpractice.without factual allegations along these or similar lines,plaintiffs have pled neither a breach of any imaginable standard of care however broadly that might be defined,nor causation of damages.
the insistence on factual allegations tending to suggest actionable rather than innocent conduct is not mere formalism.rather,the supreme court emphasized that it serves at least two vital ensure that a defendant is placed on notice of his or her alleged misconduct sufficient to prepare an appropriate defense,twombly.at,and to avoid ginning up the costly machinery associated with our civil discovery regime on the basis of a largely groundless claim,id.at.specifically,in twombly the supreme court was concerned that allowing a claim to proceed that was just as likely predicated on lawful business conduct as on an alleged conspiracy posed a serious risk of penalizing legitimate and even conduct.id.at.
here,we have cause for even greater concern.allowing this claim to march along sends the message to expert witnesses be changing your mind,even when doing so might be consistent with,or compelled by,the standards of your profession.neither can there be any doubt this is exactly the message plaintiffs wish to send,candidly explaining,as they do,that their real beef with swerdlow was his failure to deliver the expert liability opinion he had promised the paces all along.appellant opening br.at.in our legal system,demanding that experts deliver a specified opinion,as opposed to their honest judgment,is supposed to be ethically the basis for a cause of action 
parties already exert substantial influence over expert witnesses,often paying them handsomely for their time,and expert witnesses are,unfortunately and all too frequently,already regarded in some quarters as little more than hired guns.when expert witnesses can be forced to defend themselves in federal court beyond the pleading stage simply for changing their no factual allegation to suggest anything other than an honest change in view based on a review of new add fuel to this fire.we make candor an expensive option and risk incenting experts to dissemble rather than change their views in the face of compelling new information.the loser in all this is,of course,the function and cause of justice our legal system is designed to serve 
even putting aside twombly and the lack of any factual allegations suggesting tortious conduct by swerdlow,additional essential elements of the various torts plaintiffs allege are obviously missing,and no purpose is served by remanding this matter except needlessly to drag out this case further and increase the parties litigation costs.
by way of example only 
we today remand to the district court for further adjudication plaintiffs claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress.in utah,however,such a claim appears to require that the plaintiff feared physical injury or peril.lawson salt lake trappers,utah.and plaintiffs have not alleged any facts or even made any conclusory assertions that they feared physical injury from swerdlow change of opinion.
plaintiffs also bring claims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation.under utah law,both claims require,among other things,a false representation of a material fact.see larsen exclusive cars,utah debry valley mortgage,utah.yet,plaintiffs fail to identify any representations of fact made by swerdlow that satisfy these criteria.while plaintiffs conclusorily claim that swerdlow misrepresented his qualifications,they fail to identify any factual discrepancies between swerdlow qualifications in actuality and as represented.there are,for example,no allegations that swerdlow is not in fact a licensed anaesthesiologist competent to present his expert opinion to the court,or that any particular item on his resumé was false.neither do plaintiffs appear to allege any false statements by swerdlow about his experiences serving as an expert.to be sure,plaintiffs point to swerdlow deposition,in which he stated that he had never testified in trial.compl.but they fail to allege that swerdlow had ever told them otherwise.plaintiffs also point to swerdlow statement that he is a relative novice at this whole thing.compl.but the statement was made in the context of explaining why swerdlow had not asked if shuput deposition had been taken before his own,ex.e,at,and familiarity with the mechanics of the civil litigation discovery process is hardly a characteristic one would necessarily expect in someone holding himself out as an expert in anaesthesiology.because plaintiffs have not alleged that swerdlow made any representations to dispel this assumption,their claims should fail as a matter of law.
for the foregoing reasons,and with respect for my colleagues considered views,i am unable to join fully the court judgment.
shuput was the attending anesthesiologist who released putnam shortly before she died.he was also the primary defendant in the plaintiffs medical malpractice case.
defendant appears to claim that he did not receive a copy of shuput deposition transcript until after defendant own deposition,but because this is a motion to dismiss under.b,we must construe all factual allegations in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.see infra part ii.
