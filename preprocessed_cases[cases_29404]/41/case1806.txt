a jury found that titan distribution,titan discriminated against robert wayne chalfant based on chalfant disability and awarded him in back pay and in punitive damages.the district court then awarded chalfant in front pay and denied titan motions.titan appeals.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
background 
titan,a division of titan international,hired quintak,to run its tire mounting and distribution operation.quintak employees worked at titan building and used titan equipment.in july,titan decided to cut costs by terminating quintak and hiring its own employees.william campbell,president of titan,announced that titan would be hiring only a portion of quintak employees.all quintak employees who wanted to work at titan were required to apply for a position with titan and have a qualifying physical.nadis barucic and cheryl luthin oversaw the application process.
chalfant worked for quintak as a second shift supervisor in the tire and wheel mounting division.his duties included loading trucks with a forklift.jerry williams was chalfant direct supervisor,and martin craig warren was williams supervisor.at the time of quintak termination,chalfant was years old and had been working for quintak for five years.chalfant had suffered a heart attack in and had undergone carpal tunnel surgery and heart surgery in.he had arthritis in his back,neck,ankle and hands.
chalfant applied at titan for the same position he had with quintak,second shift supervisor in the tire and wheel mounting division.he believed that this position would have the same duties and responsibilities with titan as it did with quintak.in his application forms,chalfant stated on a voluntary applicant identification survey that he was physically handicapped.he based this conclusion on the fact that he had numerous physical ailments.
the final part of the application process,the physical examination,was conducted by anthony sciorrota.sciorrota determined that chalfant could work in his current capacity,including driving a forklift.sciorrota also wrote on the exam record that chalfant would need to have a functional capacity examination if he was required to do heavy lifting.barucic received the exam record,wrote px ok for lift driving on the top of the record and sent it,along with the application,to luthin.chalfant continued working as a second shift supervisor in the tire and wheel mounting division as an employee of labor ready,a temporary work service used by titan during the application period.
at some point after the physical exam,barucic wrote not pass px on top of chalfant application.barucic testified that he did not make the decision,but he did not know who told him to write that note.luthin,in her deposition testimony,said that she did not know who decided that chalfant failed the physical.however,during trial,luthin changed her testimony and said that cheri holley,corporate counsel,made the decision in august.at trial,luthin testified that barucic gave holley the documents and holley decided that chalfant did not pass the physical.holley did not testify at the trial.
during the first week of august,williams told chalfant that he was included in a list of quintak employees to be retained by titan.on august,williams and warren told chalfant that he had failed the physical and would not be hired.jerry palmer,the second shift supervisor in the tire distribution division,assumed the duties of chalfant second shift tire and wheel mounting supervisor position.by september,titan had eliminated the entire second shift in the tire and wheel mounting division.
after titan refused to hire him,chalfant took a job with ampco systems,a parking ramp management company,within two months.at ampco,chalfant performed general service work,walking up to five miles a day and lifting more than he did as a quintak employee.his wages were half of what he earned at quintak.once he started working at ampco,chalfant continued his job search by reviewing newspaper classifieds for other jobs.the day after he accepted his job with ampco,chalfant received another offer.he declined that job offer because it required chalfant to lift pounds and chalfant did not believe that he could do that type of lifting.
prior to litigation proceedings,titan maintained that it did not hire chalfant because he did not pass the physical.titan proferred this reason to the iowa civil rights commission.in a letter to the commission,titan said that chalfant had a conditional offer of employment before the physical examination that was withdrawn after he failed the physical.during litigation,however,titan claimed that chalfant was not hired as a second shift supervisor because the entire second shift was going to be eliminated.
chalfant sued titan for disability and age discrimination under the americans with disabilities act ada,et,and the age discrimination in employment act,et,respectively,and the parallel provisions of the iowa civil rights act,iowa code ch.the district court granted titan motion for summary judgment as to the age discrimination claims and denied titan motion for summary judgment as to the disability discrimination claims.a jury found for chalfant on the disability discrimination claims,awarding in back pay and in punitive damages.the district court then awarded in front pay.the district court denied titan motion for judgment as a matter of law,its alternative motion for a new trial,its motion for remittitur and its motion to alter or amend the front pay award under.e.titan appeals.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,titan contends that i it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,a new trial because the evidence was insufficient both to support a verdict that titan discriminated against chalfant based on his disability and to allow the district court to submit the issue of punitive damages to the jury ii the district court clearly abused its discretion in determining that chalfant mitigated his damages to permit an award of back pay and iii the district court abused its discretion in awarding chalfant front pay.we address each argument in turn.
sufficiency of the evidence 
titan argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law or,alternatively,a new trial because there was insufficient evidence for the jury verdict of discrimination and for the jury to consider the issue of punitive damages.we review these issues under both standards of review and find that the district court did not err in denying titan motion for judgment as a matter of law nor did it abuse its discretion in denying titan motion for a new trial.
judgment as a matter of law 
we review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law,applying the same standard as the district court.canny bottling group,cir.judgment as a matter of law is granted only if a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.id.at quoting.a.we grant the nonmoving party all reasonable inferences and view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.id.at.
ada discrimination 
a plaintiff alleging discrimination based on a disability under the ada must establish a prima facie case the three elements of this prima facie case are that the plaintiff has a disability within the meaning of the ada that he is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job,with or without reasonable accommodation and that he suffered an adverse employment action due to a disability.wenzel.water,cir.titan challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury finding for chalfant on all three elements of the prima facie case.
with respect to the first element of the prima facie case,the ada defines disability in the following three ways a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual b a record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment.webner titan distribution,cir.a person is regarded as disabled if the employer mistakenly believes that the employee has an impairment which would substantially limit one or more
