order and opinion 
appellees petition for panel rehearing is granted.the prior opinion filed on july,and reported at is vacated concurrent with the filing of a new opinion today.
the full court has been advised of the petition for rehearing en banc and no active judge has requested a vote on whether to rehear the matter en banc.fed.
the petition for rehearing en banc is denied.subsequent petitions for panel rehearing and for rehearing en banc may be filed with respect to the new opinion.
it is so ordered.
we must decide whether the district court abused its discretion by preliminarily enjoining the enforcement of new rules promulgated by the washington state board of pharmacy board that require pharmacies to deliver lawfully prescribed federal drug administration fda approved medications and prohibit discrimination against patients,on the ground that the rules violate pharmacies or their licensed pharmacists free exercise rights under the first amendment to the constitution.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.because we conclude that the district court incorrectly applied a heightened level of scrutiny to a neutral law of general applicability,and because the injunction is overbroad,we vacate,reverse,and remand.
factual and procedural background 
the practice of pharmacy in the state of washington is regulated by the washington state board of pharmacy pursuant to a comprehensive regulatory scheme which directs the board to r egulate the practice of pharmacy and enforce all laws placed under its jurisdiction,e stablish the qualifications for licensure,conduct disciplinary proceedings,and p romulgate rules for the dispensing,distribution,wholesaling,and manufacturing of drugs and devices and the practice of pharmacy for the protection and promotion of the public health,safety,and welfare.ann.under the code,a license is required for any person to practice pharmacy or to institute or operate any pharmacy.id.at.a pharmacist is defined as a person duly licensed by the washington state board of pharmacy to engage in the practice of pharmacy,id.at,and a pharmacy is defined as every place properly licensed by the board of pharmacy where the practice of pharmacy is conducted,id.at.the practice of pharmacy includes the practice of and responsibility for i nterpreting prescription orders and the compounding,dispensing,labeling,administering,and distributing of drugs and devices,in addition to and monitoring responsibilities.id.at.
in january,the board became concerned with the lack of clear authority regarding destruction or confiscation of lawful prescriptions and refusals by pharmacists to dispense lawfully prescribed medications.recognizing the importance of providing washington patients timely access to all medications,the board initiated a rulemaking process to address these issues.for sixteen months,the board considered its various rulemaking options,receiving written comments and testimony from the public and various interest groups.pursuant to the washington administrative procedure act.ann,the board conducted hearings on the proposed rules.
some public comments addressed the availability of a variety of prescription medicines and devices,such as syringes,prenatal vitamins,oral contraceptives,and aids medications.most of the comments,however,focused on whether pharmacists should be allowed to refuse to dispense a lawful prescription for plan b based on their personal,moral,or religious beliefs.
approved by the fda on july,plan b is a postcoital hormonal emergency contraceptive which contains the same hormones as ordinary birth control pills,estrogen and progestin,in much stronger dosages.it is used to prevent pregnancy after the intended method of birth control fails or after unprotected sexual activity.plan b is most effective within the first to hours after sexual intercourse and becomes less effective with each passing hour.it should be taken within hours of sexual intercourse.after hours,it has no effect.plan b is approved for dispensation nationwide to adults eighteen and over.the drug must be held behind the pharmacist counter and can be sold to any adult,male or female,upon age verification.at the time of the district court decision,females younger than eighteen were required to present a medical prescription to obtain the drug 
the drug is generally available to washington residents through pharmacies,physicians offices,government health centers,hospital emergency rooms,planned parenthood,the internet,and a hotline.percent of washington pharmacies,responding to a sample survey of pharmacies conducted before the adoption of the challenged new rules typically stock plan those who did not cited low demand percent or an easy alternative source percent.only two pharmacies percent surveyed did not stock the drug because of personal,religious,or moral objections.if the survey is accurate and representative,that translates into approximately of the licensed pharmacies in washington.the survey does not reveal how many pharmacists in the state decline to dispense the drug.
one of the comments received by the board during its rulemaking process was set forth in an april,letter from the washington state human rights commission hrc executive director,marc brenman.hrc was created by the legislature and is authorized to act to prevent discrimination in violation of the washington law against discrimination wlad.ann.it may issue and investigate complaints,attempt conciliation,or refer matters to the attorney general office for a hearing before an administrative law judge.id.admin.code to.hrc is not authorized to make a final determination that discrimination occurred or to issue penalties.see.ann.hrc is authorized to comment on rules being considered by other agencies or state officials.see id.hrc shall formulate policies to effectuate the purposes of this chapter and may make recommendations to agencies and officers of the state or local subdivisions of government in aid of such policies and purposes.it was under this authority that the executive director submitted a letter to the board,which concluded 
it is illegal and bad policy to permit pharmacists to deny services to women based on the individual pharmacists religious or moral beliefs.we have examined the issue from federal and state law perspectives,from the public interest,and from possible defenses and compromises that could be raised and made.on no ground would refusal to fill a lawful prescription for emergency contraception be appropriate.
the letter also posited that any pharmacy or pharmacist who declined to dispense plan b for any reason engaged in sex discrimination in violation of federal and state law,even if another pharmacist filled the prescription.it concluded that the board itself risked liability under wlad if it were to permit such refusals.
after considering a number of draft rules the board adopted two rules by unanimous vote on april.the first rule,an amendment to washington administrative code section,governs pharmacists.under this rule,a pharmacist may be subject to professional discipline for destroying or refusing to return an unfilled lawful prescription,violating a patient privacy,or unlawfully discriminating against,or intimidating or harassing a patient.the rule,however,does not require an individual pharmacist to dispense medication in the face of a personal objection.
the second rule,washington administrative code section,governs pharmacies.it requires pharmacies to deliver lawfully prescribed drugs or devices to patients and to distribute drugs and devices approved by the food and drug administration for restricted distribution by pharmacies in a timely manner consistent with reasonable expectations for filling the prescription.a pharmacy may substitute a therapeutically equivalent drug or provide a timely alternative for appropriate therapy,but apart from certain necessary exceptions a pharmacy is prohibited from refusing to deliver a lawfully prescribed or approved medicine.a pharmacy is also prohibited from destroying or refusing to return an unfilled lawful prescription,violating a patient privacy,or unlawfully discriminating against,or intimidating or harassing a patient.
in the concise explanatory statement accompanying the regulations,the board noted that it created a right of refusal for individual pharmacists by allowing a pharmacy to accommodate a pharmacist who has a religious or moral objection.a pharmacy may not refer a patient to another pharmacy to avoid filling a prescription because the pharmacy has a duty to deliver lawfully prescribed medications in a timely manner.a pharmacy may accommodate a pharmacist personal objections in any way the pharmacy deems suitable,including having another pharmacist available in person or by telephone.
the regulations took effect on july.
stormans,doing business as ralph thriftway,a grocery store in olympia,washington,which also operates a pharmacy,and individual pharmacists rhonda mesler and margo thelen collectively,appellees,filed a lawsuit pursuant to on july,the day before the effective date of the rules,in the district court for the western district of washington they allege violations of the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment,the supremacy clause,and title vii.they ultimately seek a permanent prohibition against enforcement of the new rules and the washington state antidiscrimination law,wlad.ann,against pharmacists and pharmacies that object to dispensing plan b on moral or religious grounds.
appellees assert that their personal religious views do not permit them to dispense plan b,and,consequently,they refuse to provide plan b to patients who request it.they claim that the board rules impinge on their constitutional right of free exercise of religion,arguing that the rules force them to choose between their religious beliefs as christians and their livelihood.
the two individual pharmacists claim that by compelling their employers to hire another pharmacist to work with them during their accommodation about which their employers have expressed varying degrees of regulations will cause them to voluntarily leave their jobs or be terminated.mesler has so far remained with her employer,who accommodated her during the five months between the effective date of the new rules and the issuance of the preliminary injunction.mesler alleges,however,that without the court injunction,she expects to be fired,because her employer has told her that it would not be able to accommodate her.thelen voluntarily resigned from her former employment to work at a pharmacy that accommodates her religious belief by ensuring there is always another pharmacist on duty.
stormans,which is owned by ken stormans and his three children,claims that it has been under investigation since may,and that the board is investigating complaints that its pharmacy has refused to stock or sell plan b.in his declaration,vice president kevin stormans states that he received a phone call in may asking whether ralph thriftway carried plan b.he did not know the answer and did not know much about the drug.after a pharmacy employee told him that ralph did not carry plan b because customers had not requested it,he told the caller that the store did not carry the product.soon afterwards,stormans received a few other inquiries as to why ralph did not stock plan b.these inquiries prompted kevin stormans to research plan b.after he learned that plan b can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus,and because stormans owners believe life begins with fertilization,stormans decided that it would not sell the drug.
in the summer of,the board began investigating ralph thriftway and questioned kevin stormans,requiring a written statement.though the board closed that investigation without taking any action,in january,the board initiated a new investigation against ralph.kevin stormans asserts that the matter has been referred to the board legal counsel for final review.after stormans filed suit,the board began a new investigation of ralph under the new rules.this investigation is pending.stormans expects that the board investigation will result in disciplinary charges,including possible revocation of its pharmacy license,as well as the initiation of an enforcement action by hrc if the preliminary injunction is overturned.
the district court granted the motion of seven individuals to intervene pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a.these individuals collectively,intervenors are five women who have been refused plan b may need timely access to plan b in the future,and two individuals who need timely access to prescribed medications to manage their illness 
plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction,asking that the court enjoin enforcement of the new rules against them pending litigation.on november,the district court issued an order granting a preliminary injunction based solely on plaintiffs free exercise claim.stormans,selecky,d.the court enjoined the state defendants from enforcing washington administrative code d and d the provisions against any pharmacy which,or pharmacist who,refuses to dispense plan b but instead immediately refers the patient either to the nearest source of plan b or to a nearby source for plan id 
the state defendants and the intervenors timely appealed and asked the district court to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal.plaintiffs opposed the stay,but apparently recognizing that the injunction was overbroad,moved to modify the preliminary injunction,seeking to narrow its scope only to the named plaintiffs and their employees.the district court denied the motions.
on may,another panel of our court denied intervenors motion to stay the district court injunction pending appeal.stormans selecky,cir.judge tashima dissented from the denial of the stay.id.at tashima,dissenting in part.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review

iii.discussion 
justiciability 
federal jurisdiction is limited to actual cases and controversies.allen wright,d.we conclude that appellees have standing to assert their claims under the free exercise clause.although their claims against the state appellants are ripe for review,the claims they assert against hrc are not ripe for consideration and should be dismissed.
article iii standing is a controlling element in the definition of a case or controversy.alaska right to life political action comm.feldman,cir alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.t o satisfy article iii standing requirements,a plaintiff must show it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
intervenors argue that stormans,a corporation,lacks standing to assert a claim under the free exercise clause.we decline to decide whether a corporation can assert its own rights under the free exercise clause and instead examine the rights at issue as those of the corporate owners.
in first national bank of boston bellotti,the supreme court held that the proper question was not whether corporations have first amendment rights and,if so,whether they are coextensive with those of natural persons,d.instead,the question must be whether the challenged statute abridges rights that the first amendment was meant to protect.id.the court refused to address the abstract question whether corporations have the full measure of rights that individuals enjoy under the first amendment.id.at.
we have held that a corporation has standing to assert the free exercise right of its owners.see eeoc townley eng g,cir.in townley,a closely held manufacturing company whose owners made a covenant with god to run their business according to the principles of christian faith,argued that under the free exercise clause,they were entitled to an exemption from the requirement that employers accommodate employees asserting religious objections to devotional services.we reasoned that b ecause townley is merely the instrument through and by which and townley express their religious beliefs,it is unnecessary to address the abstract issue whether a corporation has rights under the free exercise clause independent of those of its shareholders and officers.id.at.we found that townley presents no rights of its own different from or greater than its owners rights because the corporation is an extension of the beliefs of the owners,and the beliefs of the owners are the beliefs and tenets of the townley company.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore held that townley has standing to assert jake and helen townley free exercise rights,id.at,and examined the rights at issue as those of jake and helen townley.
here,ken stormans is the president,and his three children,including kevin stormans,serve as vice presidents of stormans.stormans asserts that because ralph is a,business whose shareholders and directors are made up entirely of members of the stormans family,kevin stormans opposition to plan b is that of ralph and all the owners.in the amended complaint,stormans alleges that ralph can not sell plan b based on religious and moral grounds,and that kevin stormans s religious beliefs prevent him from selling a drug that intentionally terminates innocent human life.stormans argues that ralph is an extension of the beliefs of members of the stormans family,and that the beliefs of the stormans family are the beliefs of ralph.thus,stormans,does not present any free exercise rights of its own different from or greater than its owners rights.we hold that,as in townley,stormans has standing to assert the free exercise rights of its owners 
harris mcrae,d,is not to the contrary.in harris,the women division of a church,as an organization,sought to challenge a restriction on the use of federal funds for abortion.the court held that because the free exercise claim asserted here is one that ordinarily requires individual participation because a plaintiff must show the coercive effect of the enactment as it operates against him in the practice of his religion and because members of the women division had a diversity of view s concerning the law,the organization did not satisfy the requirements for associational standing.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted see also hunt.apple adver.comm n,d.but here,stormans is not seeking relief as an organization and does not need to satisfy the requirements for associational standing.thus,we will consider the rights of the owners as the basis for the free exercise claim.
stormans meets the standing criteria to pursue free exercise claims in this case.its injuries are concrete and particularized,actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical,and fairly traceable to the new rules.see friends of the earth,at.because the new rules require the pharmacy to deliver medications,such as plan b,in a timely manner,stormans will not be able to avoid stocking plan b on the basis of its religious objections.its injuries will certainly be ameliorated should the new rules be held unconstitutional.
the individual pharmacists,mesler and thelen,also enjoy standing to sue under the free exercise clause the injuries suffered by mesler and thelen are concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.see id.mesler alleges that,without the court injunction,she expects to be fired because her religious convictions prohibit her from dispensing plan b and her employer has told her that it will not be able to accommodate her.thelen alleges she was forced to leave her former job after her pharmacy was unable to hire a second pharmacist to work at a pharmacy that accommodates her religious belief by ensuring that there is always another pharmacist on duty.thelen has taken a job farther away from her house for less pay because her religious beliefs did not allow her to dispense plan 
while indirect,there is a causal connection between the new rules and mesler threatened termination.though it does not suffice if the injury complained of is the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court,that does not exclude injury produced by determinative or coercive effect upon the action of someone else.bennett spear,d quoting lujan,at.emphasis,alterations,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted.the new rules require a pharmacy to deliver medication in a timely act for which pharmacies generally depend upon their pharmacists.if certain pharmacists believe they can not deliver certain medications and their employer is unable to accommodate this moral or religious belief,the pharmacy may not employ in the first may objecting pharmacists.thus,if the new rules had not been passed,mesler would not expect to lose her job and thelen would not have been forced to find a new job.furthermore,a favorable decision likely will redress the alleged injuries.if the new rules are invalidated,mesler and thelen will not be limited to employment only at pharmacies able to accommodate their religious views.
in addition to the immutable requirements of article iii,the federal judiciary has also adhered to a set of prudential principles that bear on the question of standing.valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church and state,d.p rudential standing concerns require that we consider whether the alleged injury is more than a mere generalized grievance,whether plaintiffs are asserting their own rights or the rights of third parties,and whether the claim falls within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the constitutional guarantee in question.alaska right to life political action,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the prudential zone of interest test,as the supreme court has observed,is not meant to be especially demanding.clarke sec.indus.ass n,d.prudential standing is satisfied unless the party interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it can not reasonably be assumed that the legislature intended to permit the suit.ocean advocates army corps of eng rs,cir quoting clarke,at.appellees also meet the prudential standing requirements.appellees conduct is directly regulated by the new rules and their constitutional interests are,according to the appellees,directly infringed by the new rules.it is difficult to imagine a more appropriate group of plaintiffs to challenge new rules governing the conduct of pharmacies and pharmacists than a pharmacy and two pharmacists.
r ipeness is peculiarly a question of timing,designed to prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.thomas anchorage equal rights comm n,cir quoting abbott labs.gardner,d,abrogated on other grounds by califano sanders,d internal quotation marks omitted.our role is neither to issue advisory opinions nor to declare rights in hypothetical cases,but to adjudicate live cases or controversies consistent with the powers granted the judiciary in article iii of the constitution.id.constitutional ripeness,in many cases,coincides squarely with standing injury in fact prong and can be characterized as standing on a timeline.id.
as detailed above,appellees injuries are real and concrete rather than speculative and hypothetical.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.however,when a litigant brings a preenforcement challenge,we have found that a generalized threat of prosecution will not satisfy the ripeness requirement.id.rather,there must be a genuine threat of imminent prosecution.id.internal quotation marks omitted.there are three factors we consider when analyzing the genuineness of a threat of prosecution whether the plaintiffs have articulated a concrete plan to violate the law in question,whether the prosecuting authorities have communicated a specific warning or threat to initiate proceedings,and the history of past prosecution or enforcement under the challenged statute.id.
in thomas,landlords claimed that their religious beliefs prevented them from renting housing to unmarried couples and therefore would compel them to violate a law banning housing discrimination on the basis of marital status.we found that the claims were not ripe because the landlords had only a general intent to violate the law on some uncertain day in the and when an unmarried couple attempts to lease one of their rental properties.id.at.the landlords could not even specify when,to whom,where,or under what circumstances they have refused to rent to unmarried couples in the past.id.at.we held that a general intent to violate a statute at some unknown date in the future does not rise to the level of an articulated,concrete plan.id.
here,by contrast,although appellees can not control when a patient requesting plan b will visit their a refusal constituting a violation of the new appellees can point to specific past instances when they have refused to sell plan b or have made the decision not to stock the medication,which are direct violations of the challenged rules.
intervenors also contend that mesler and thelen claims are unripe because there has not been any state action threatening them and the new rules do not threaten them directly.however,the board need not take any further action for individual pharmacists to be affected by the new rules the very existence of the new rules may cause an employer to terminate a pharmacist who objects to dispensing a medication.given the procedural posture of the case,and considering that the new rules became effective one day after the lawsuit was brought,the record with respect to mesler and thelen is sparse.we do not know whether mesler and thelen employers have been contacted by the board nor do we even know their employers identity.still,we conclude that their claims are ripe for review because as a result of the new rules and the guiding principles communicated by the board,thelen has been forced to leave her job,and mesler is in danger of termination.
until june,thelen served as a staff pharmacist in a washington retail pharmacy and was the only pharmacist on duty during her work hours.she had informed her employer when hired that her religious beliefs would prevent her from dispensing plan b.when customers requested plan b,thelen referred them to local pharmacies that she knew sold the drug.when she learned that the board passed the new rules,but before they went into effect,thelen contacted the board to make sure she understood what the new rules would require.a member of the board responded to her emails,and instructed her that she would not face discipline by refusing to dispense plan b for moral or religious objections,but that her pharmacy would be subject to discipline i f another pharmacist is not available or if the patient will not wait for the change of shift.according to thelen,her employer said the company could not hire another pharmacist to work with her or to remain on call.because they could not accommodate her religious beliefs,her employer said it would not work for her to remain employed there.even though she absolutely loved her job and the fact that it allowed her to work in her local community,thelen declares that she was forced to find other employment.because she could not find any pharmacy positions in her community and the new rules limited her employment opportunities,thelen found work at a hospital pharmacy with a much longer commute,less income and work hours,and less desirable work shifts that keep her away from her family until around many nights.
rhonda mesler was hired by her current employer in november.when she was hired,she told her supervisor that she objected to dispensing plan b,and her employer agreed to accommodate her by not forcing her to dispense the drug.when a customer requested plan b,mesler referred them to nearby pharmacies.she is the only pharmacist on duty during her shift.after receiving a june,email from the department of health concerning the new rules that would go into effect on july,mesler emailed her supervisor.she asked how the store would handle her religious objection.mesler employer said that the company can not afford to hire another pharmacist to work with her.mesler thus expect s to be fired from her position very soon.
in the amended complaint,appellees seek a declaratory judgment,and a preliminary and permanent injunction.we determine whether a declaratory judgment action is ripe for adjudication by evaluating whether the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.cas.pac.coal oil.although mesler has not yet suffered the consequences of the new rules,her employer has informed her that it will not be able to accommodate her refusal to dispense plan b under them.she is at serious risk of losing her job because of these new rules.this risk is sufficiently real and immediate such that,assuming her claims have merit,a declaratory judgment or injunction is warranted.thelen claims are also ripe.her employer told her it would not work for her to remain employed there.she was forced to find another job.that job is less desirable to thelen for many reasons.thus,there is a substantial controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of declaratory and injunctive relief.if the rules are struck down,thelen would not be limited to working only in those pharmacies that could accommodate her religious beliefs.
in addition to the state appellants,appellees sued hrc,the entity responsible for enforcing wlad.appellees base their challenge against hrc entirely on an april,letter sent to the board by hrc executive director while the rulemaking process was pending.the letter advised that it would be illegal and bad policy to permit pharmacists to deny services to women based on the individual pharmacists religious or moral beliefs.according to the letter,it is hrc opinion that any pharmacy or pharmacist who declines to dispense plan b for any reason engages in sex discrimination in violation of federal and state law,even if another onsite pharmacist filled the prescription.the district court relied on the views expressed in the april letter,the posting of the letter on hrc website,and hrc history in aggressively pursu ing violators of the wlad to conclude that plaintiffs claims against the hrc appellants are ripe for judicial review.stormans,d at.
we disagree.in alaska right to life political action committee feldman,the executive director of the state commission on judicial conduct issued a letter interpreting the code of judicial conduct to require recusal of judges committed to a position on an issue that could come before the court.at.a political action committee brought suit against,inter alia,members of the commission,when judges refused to answer the committee questionnaire regarding their views on abortion.we dismissed the suit on ripeness grounds,finding no threat of enforcement because the letter was written by a commission that had no enforcement power and that had never taken,and could never take,action against a judge because it was actually the duty of the state supreme court to discipline judges for violations of the code.id.at.
similarly,here,because no enforcement action against plaintiffs is concrete or imminent or even threatened,appellees claims against hrc are not ripe for review.first,hrc has no authority to enforce the board rules and therefore can not bring an enforcement action under the new rules or revoke a pharmacist license.second,while appellees allege that hrc intends to charge pharmacies and pharmacists who refuse to dispense plan b with sex discrimination under wlad,hrc also lacks authority to discipline violations of wlad or to issue penalties.as in alaska right to life,the final determination of discrimination is made by an independent this case,an administrative law judge.see.ann.according to brenman,hrc executive director,hrc has received no complaints and has taken no action against any pharmacy or pharmacist for any conduct related to the new rules.brenman has even declared that he did not intend his letter to be construed as a rule and that it can not be understood as such.the washington supreme court has held that an agency written expression of its interpretation of the law does not implement or enforce the law and is advisory only.educ.ass.state pub.disclosure comm n,en banc internal quotation marks omitted analyzing interpretive guidelines posted on agency website.moreover,the april letter,written a year before the new rules were adopted,was not a specific warning to appellees and binds no one.even if the was not directed to appellees or any other specified pharmacy or be construed to be a threat of enforcement,it is nothing more than a generalized threat moreover,the board has even disagreed with the letter by approving accommodations the letter identified as discriminatory,such as allowing a second pharmacist or perhaps a pharmacy technician to sell the drug.
the district court further erred by considering the history of hrc enforcement of wlad claims as evidence of a history of past prosecution.in thomas,we dismissed the landlords claim on ripeness grounds because the defendant agency had never enforced the actual law challenged and had investigated only citizen complaints.at.hrc has never initiated an action against any pharmacist refusing to provide plan thus,how aggressively hrc generally enforces wlad against claims of discrimination is irrelevant to examining whether hrc is specifically threatening to enforce wlad against appellees.
hrc is authorized to comment on rules being considered by other agencies or state officials,and that is exactly what it did when it issued the april letter.therefore,appellees claims against the hrc appellants are not ripe and they must be dismissed on remand.
finally,we examine the issue of prudential ripeness.though a concrete case or controversy is present,we also evaluate whether we should decline to exercise jurisdiction on the basis of two interrelated factors the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.id.quoting abbott,at.
to meet the hardship requirement,a litigant must show that withholding review would result in direct and immediate hardship and would entail more than possible financial loss.us west commc ns mfs intelenet,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we consider whether the regulation requires an immediate and significant change in the plaintiffs conduct of their affairs with serious penalties attached to noncompliance.ass of am.med.colls.united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this factor is certainly met,because unless appellees prevail in this litigation,they will suffer the very injury they will be required to dispense plan b over their religious and moral objections.
a claim is fit for decision if the issues raised are primarily legal,do not require further factual development,and the challenged action is final.us west commc ns,at internal quotation marks omitted.we consider whether the administrative action is a definitive statement of an agency position whether the action has a direct and immediate effect on the complaining parties whether the action has the status of law and whether the action requires immediate compliance with its terms.ass of am.med,at.although the new rules may undergo some amendment or agency construction,they currently have the force of law and would be binding on appellees as written absent the existence of preliminary relief.there is no indication that these rules are anything other than a definitive statement of an agency position,requir ing immediate compliance by appellees.this situation is unlike that in thomas,in which the court held that the landlords claim rests upon hypothetical situations with hypothetical tenants,and,due to the lack of an adequately developed factual record,was not ripe.at.here,the record is admittedly sparse,but the circumstances presented by appellees are not hypothetical.if a patient enters their pharmacies requesting plan b,which the record reflects has occurred,appellees will refuse to deliver the medication.whether this action would directly violate the new rules is a primarily legal inquiry.because there are no incomplete hypotheticals or open factual questions akin to those in thomas,see id.at noting that it was unclear from the record,for example,whether the landlords view on appropriate tenants extends to female roommates,we hold that despite the preliminary nature of the record,appellees claims satisfy the requirements of prudential standing.
grant of preliminary injunction 
when the district court applied the legal standard for granting a preliminary injunction,it did not have the benefit of the supreme court decision in winter natural res.def.council,d.as a result,the district court applied the legal standard subsequently rejected by the supreme court in winter as too lenient.id.at.
before winter was decided,we had held that to prevail on a motion for preliminary injunction,the plaintiff must demonstrate 
either a likelihood of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury or that serious questions going to the merits were raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in its favor.these two alternatives represent extremes of a single continuum,rather than two separate tests.thus,the greater the relative hardship to the party seeking the preliminary injunction,the less probability of success must be shown.
see,clear channel outdoor city of,cir emphasis added and alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.in winter,the supreme court definitively refuted our possibility of irreparable injury standard,stating the ninth circuit possibility standard is too lenient.our frequently reiterated standard requires plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief to demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction.winter.at.the court instructed that i ssuing a preliminary injunction based only on a possibility of irreparable harm is inconsistent with our characterization of injunctive relief as an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.id.at citing mazurek armstrong,d per curiam.
applying winter,we have since held that,t o the extent that our cases have suggested a lesser standard,they are no longer controlling,or even viable.am.trucking ass ns,city of los angeles,cir footnote omitted.thus,the district court appropriate application of our approach in granting relief is now error.the proper legal standard for preliminary injunctive relief requires a party to demonstrate that he is likely to succeed on the merits,that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,that the balance of equities tips in his favor,and that an injunction is in the public interest.winter.at.
likelihood of success on the merits 
the district court held that appellees demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their free exercise claim.because this holding was based on the district court findings that the new rules are not neutral and generally applicable,which in turn triggered application of the strict scrutiny standard of review,it was in error.thus,the district court conclusion that the new rules fail strict scrutiny review because they were neither justified by a compelling interest nor narrowly tailored constitutes an abuse of discretion.stormans,d at.

underlying the supreme court jurisprudence is the principle that the free exercise clause embraces two concepts freedom to believe and freedom to act.the first is absolute but,in the nature of things,the second can not be.conduct remains subject to regulation for the protection of society.cantwell,at.this principle traces its roots to the idea that allowing individual exceptions based on religious beliefs from laws governing general practices would make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land,and in effect permit every citizen to become a law unto himself.reynolds united states.the smith court explained that it is 
p recisely because we are a cosmopolitan nation made up of people of almost every conceivable religious preference,and precisely because we value and protect that religious divergence,we can not afford the luxury of deeming presumptively invalid,as applied to the religious objector,every regulation of conduct that does not protect an interest of the highest order.
at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.such a presumption would have and injurious effects on our society,as exemptions could be mandated from compulsory military service,payment of taxes,health and safety regulation such as manslaughter and child neglect laws,compulsory vaccination laws,drug laws,and traffic laws,and social welfare legislation such as minimum wage laws,child labor laws,animal cruelty laws,environmental protection laws,and laws providing for equality of opportunity.id.at.citations omitted.
the principles enunciated by the court in smith and lukumi thus flow from the court free exercise jurisprudence.in its first case addressing the free exercise clause,the court held that congressional legislation prohibiting the practice of polygamy was constitutional,and that those who made polygamy part of their religious practice,such as members of the mormon church at the time,were not excepted from the statute operation.see reynolds,at.the court explained that congress was free to reach actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order,id.at,because l aws are made for the government of actions,and while they can not interfere with mere religious belief and opinions,they may with practices,id.at.
the court focused on the distinction between belief and conduct again in cantwell,at,when it invalidated a state statute requiring a license for religious solicitation because the officer would have had to determine,as a condition for the license,whether the applicant had a religious belief.the court explained that if the law had been a general regulation of conduct that did not involve any religious test,it would not have been open to any constitutional objection.id.at.in a subsequent case,the court concluded that requiring public school children to salute the flag as part of a daily school exercise did not violate the free exercise clause because c onscientious scruples have not,in the course of the long struggle for religious toleration,relieved the individual from obedience to a general law not aimed at the promotion or restriction of religious beliefs.minersville sch.dist.gobitis,overruled on other grounds by.state bd.of educ.barnette.it emphasized that t he mere possession of religious convictions which contradict the relevant concerns of a political society does not relieve the citizen from the discharge of political responsibilities.id.at.
the supreme court continued to uphold the constitutionality of such general law s not aimed at the promotion or restriction of religious beliefs.id.at.in prince massachusetts,the court found that a mother could be prosecuted pursuant to child labor laws when she used her jehovah witnesses children to dispense religious literature in the streets.the state was permitted to prevent these children from doing there what no other children may do.id.at.in braunfeld brown,d,the court upheld a law that prohibited retail sales on sunday.orthodox jews challenged the law because they already closed their businesses on saturdays for religious reasons,and claimed that to close their business on sunday as well would result in economic hardship and thus interfere with the free exercise of their religion.the court found that the law simply regulate d a secular activity and declined to find the law invalid.id.at.
the court articulated the current governing a neutral law of general applicability will not be subject to strict scrutiny smith and lukumi.in smith,the plaintiff was fired from his job after using peyote for sacramental purposes.peyote use violated state law,and,as a result,smith was denied unemployment compensation.smith,at.although the court confirmed that the government may not regulate religious beliefs,it stated that it has never held that an individual religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the state is free to regulate.id.at.the court thus held that because oregon prohibition on peyote use is constitutional,and smith dismissal resulted from illegal peyote use,it was permissible to deny smith unemployment compensation.id.at.
the court held that neutral and generally applicable statutes that regulate conduct are not required to pass strict scrutiny review,thus limiting the viability of sherbert verner,d,which previously had applied the compelling interest test to governmental denial of unemployment compensation.the court reasoned that while t he compelling government interest requirement seems benign and familiar from cases analyzing race discrimination and content regulation of speech,it is unsuitable for the free exercise context.smith,at.what it produces in those other of treatment and an unrestricted flow of contending constitutional norms what it would produce private right to ignore generally applicable a constitutional anomaly.id.at.the court concluded that it would contradict both constitutional tradition and common sense to make a person obligation to obey a generally applicable neutral law contingent upon the law coincidence with his religious beliefs,except where the state interest is compelling.id.at.
in lukumi,the court reiterated the general proposition that a law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice.at.however,a law burdening religious practice that is not neutral or not of general application must undergo the most rigorous of scrutiny,id.at,and is invalid unless it is justified by a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to advance that interest,id.at.as the district court correctly recognized,smith and lukumi govern this case.to determine whether rational basis review or strict scrutiny applies,we must first decide whether the new rules are neutral and generally applicable.though n eutrality and general applicability are interrelated,and failure to satisfy one requirement is a likely indication that the other has not been satisfied,id.at,we consider each of the two criteria in turn.we must evaluate the text of the challenged law as well as its effect in its real operation.id.at.
i neutrality 
i f the object of a law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation,the law is not neutral.lukumi,at.there are,of course,many ways of demonstrating that the object or purpose of a law is the suppression of religion or religious conduct.id.the lukumi court considered both the text and the operation of the ordinance at issue.id.at.we employ the same analysis in determining that the rules are neutral.
facial neutrality 
a law lacks facial neutrality if it refers to a religious practice without a secular meaning discernable from the language or context.id.at.in its textual analysis,the lukumi court asked whether the ordinance was facially neutral.id.at.t he minimum requirement of neutrality is that a law not discriminate on its face.applying the lukumi analysis to the plain text of the ordinances,the district court correctly concluded that the new rules are facially neutral.see stormans,d at.the new rules make no reference to any religious practice,conduct,or motivation.
ii.the rule operation 
apart from the text,the effect of a law in its real operation is strong evidence of its object.lukumi,at.in its operational analysis,the lukumi court assessed the design of the ordinance and asked whether it was over or relative to its stated object.see id.at.the design of these laws accomplishes instead a religious gerrymander,an impermissible attempt to target petitioners and their religious practices.the court determined that the ordinances at issue were underinclusive in their effect where the burden of the ordinance,in practical terms,falls on santeria adherents but almost no others.id.at.the ordinance was careful ly draft ed to ensure that,although santeria sacrifice is prohibited,killings that are no more necessary or humane in almost all other circumstances are unpunished.id.at.the lukumi court also found the ordinance at issue to be overinclusive where it prohibit ed santeria sacrifice even when it does not threaten the city interest in the public health.id.at.for example,the city banned ritual sacrifices of animals when regulation of conditions and treatment,regardless of why an animal is kept,is the logical response to the city concern for the adequate care of animals.id.at.
unlike the ordinance at issue in lukumi,the new rules operate neutrally.they do not suppress,target,or single out the practice of any religion because of religious content.the evidentiary thin given the procedural posture of this reflects that the object of the rules was to ensure safe and timely patient access to lawful and lawfully prescribed medications.as such,the new rules eliminate all objections that do not ensure patient health,safety,and access to medication.they require delivery of all lawfully prescribed medications,save for when one of several narrow exemptions permits refusal.thus,aside from the exemptions,any refusal to dispense a medication violates the rules,and this is so regardless of whether the refusal is motivated by religion,morals,conscience,ethics,discriminatory prejudices,or personal distaste for a patient.
that the rules may affect pharmacists who object to plan b for religious reasons does not undermine the neutrality of the rules.the free exercise clause is not violated even though a group motivated by religious reasons may be more likely to engage in the proscribed conduct.see reynolds,at upholding a polygamy ban though the practice is followed primarily by members of the mormon church united states,d rejecting a first amendment challenge to a statutory prohibition of the destruction of draft cards though most violators likely would be opponents of war.the fourth circuit decision in american life league,reno,cir,is instructive.the reno court upheld the freedom of access to clinic entrance act,which established criminal penalties and civil remedies for certain conduct intended to injure,intimidate,or interfere with persons seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services.id.at.the court found no free exercise though it acknowledged that congress passed the law in response to antiabortion it recognized that the act punishe d conduct for the harm it causes,not because the conduct is religiously motivated.id.at see also vision church vill.of long grove,cir finding no free exercise violation even if a zoning ordinance targeted a proposed plan for a new church because the commission was concerned about the nonreligious effect of the church on the community knights of columbus,council town of lexington,cir finding no free exercise violation although a regulation limiting displays on the town green was adopted in response to a flood of religious groups seeking to erect displays.thus,the district court erred in finding that the object of the regulations is to eliminate from the practice of pharmacy those pharmacists who,for religious reasons,object to the delivery of lawful medications,specifically plan stormans,d at.the neutrality of the new rules is not destroyed by the possibility that pharmacists with religious objections to plan b will disproportionately require accommodation under the rules.
iii.legislative history 
in addition to the text and operation of the new rules,the district court considered something that the lukumi majority did historical background of the ordinances.it is unclear whether the district court was permitted to undertake this analysis.while the analysis of legislative history is proper in the equal protection context,the law is unsettled regarding the scope of its consideration in the free exercise arena.
that the law is unclear on this point is evident from the lukumi court splintering on this issue.analysis of legislative history was sanctioned as part of the free exercise analysis only in justice kennedy nonprecedential part,which was joined only by justice stevens lukumi,at.kennedy,joined by stevens.meanwhile,chief justice rehnquist and justices scalia and thomas joined all but that portion of the opinion because,in their view,such an inquiry was inappropriate in the free exercise context.see id.at.scalia,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment i do not join part because it departs from the opinion general focus on the object of the laws at issue to consider the subjective motivation of the lawmakers as noted elsewhere,it is virtually impossible to determine the singular motive of a collective legislative body.internal quotation marks omitted.justice scalia,the author of the smith opinion,explained that the free exercise clause does not refer to the purposes for which legislators enact laws,but to the effects of the laws enacted.id.
we may discern with certainty only that chief justice rehnquist and justice scalia did not join part of the opinion due to disagreement with justice kennedy use of legislative history.justices souter,blackmun,and disagreed with smith holding and may have agreed with justice kennedy approach.see lukumi,at.souter,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment declining to join part ii because of concerns about whether the smith rule merits adherence.justice white joined all but part of the opinion.justice blackmun filed an opinion concurring in the judgment,in which justice joined,explaining that he continue s to believe that smith was wrongly decided,and while he agree s with the result the court reaches in this case,he arrive s at that result by a different route.id.at.blackmun,concurring in the judgment.therefore,the supreme court in lukumi left open the question of whether it is appropriate to consider legislative history as part of a free exercise clause analysis 
cases within our circuit do not offer meaningful guidance on the unsettled question of whether courts may examine legislative history in determining whether a challenged law violates the free exercise clause neutrality requirement.for example,in san jose christian college city of morgan hill,cir,we expressed a lack of concern with the district court citation of an opinion of our court discussing the equal protection clause because t he supreme court has approved reference to equal protection jurisprudence i n determining if the object of a law is a neutral one under the free exercise clause.id.at quoting lukumi,at.we neither elaborated on that statement nor examined the historical or legislative background of the challenged ordinance in reaching our conclusion that the ordinance at issue was generally applicable and neutral.see id.at t here is not even a hint that college was targeted on the basis of religion.in kdm reedsport school district,cir,a disabled student challenged a state law which provided special education services to students in private secular schools,but not to students in private sectarian schools.although we stated that evidence of a substantial animus that motivated the law in question could distinguish lukumi,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,we held that there was no showing that application of the regulation to kdm case burdens kdm or his parents free exercise of their religion,id.at.
nor do cases from our sister circuits aid us in determining whether legislative history may be appropriately considered in the neutrality analysis.these cases serve only to illustrate that the issue is unsettled.compare john united church city of chicago,cir stating that it is appropriate to consider legislative history when determining neutrality,wirzburger galvin,cir considering evidence of animus against catholics in massachusetts in when the challenged law was passed,and prater city of burnside,cir primarily analyzing the law effect in operation,but also considering the manner in which the city rejected its proposed alternative to the challenged law,with midrash sephardi,town of surfside,cir under lukumi,it is unnecessary to identify an invidious intent in enacting a law.
we need not decide whether it was permissible for the district court to rely upon the administrative history of the new rules because that history provides no meaningful guidance on the object or neutrality of the final rules adopted by the board.while the board deliberative process may have been initiated over concerns regarding plan b,the administrative history hardly reveals a single design to burden religious practice rather,it is a patchwork quilt of concerns,ideas,and motivations.the record reveals that the draft rules morphed and evolved throughout the deliberative process,as did the concerns raised both by rulemakers and the public participants.the collective will of the board can not be known,except as it is expressed in the text and associated notes and comments of the final rules.to the extent the record indicates anything about the board motivation in adopting the final rules,it shows the board was motivated by concerns about the potential deleterious effect on public health that would result from allowing pharmacists to refuse to dispense lawfully prescribed medications based on personal,moral objections of which religious objections are a subset.it would,therefore,be incorrect to the district court the entire board a motivation to impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief.lukumi,at.
therefore,regardless of the proper role of legislative history in a free exercise clause,as discussed,remains district court erroneously relied upon it because it reveals little about the board motivation in adopting the rules,and,to the extent it does reveal anything,it indicates that the board concern was to promote the public welfare,not to burden religious belief.
ii general applicability 
a law is not generally applicable when the government,in a selective manner,impose s burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief.lukumi,at.the selective manner analysis tests the rules for substantial underinclusiveness.for example,the lukumi court concluded that the challenged ordinances were not of general applicability because each of hialeah ordinances pursues the city governmental interests only against conduct motivated by religious belief.id.at.because the ordinances fail ed to prohibit nonreligious conduct that endanger ed these interests in a similar or greater degree than santeria sacrifice does,id.at,it was religion,and religion alone,that bore the burden of the ordinances,giving the ordinances the appearance of a prohibition that society is prepared to impose upon santeria worshippers but not upon itself,id.at.alteration in original citations and internal quotation marks omitted.according to the court,t his precise evil is what the requirement of general applicability is designed to prevent.id.at.thus,it was the ordinances substantial underinclusiveness with respect to the city supposed interests in protecting the public health and preventing cruelty to animals that led to the court conclusion that the ordinances were not generally applicable.
instead of analyzing whether the new rules were substantially underinclusive,the district court decided that it should examine the law means and the law ends if the means fail to match the ends,the statute likely targets religious conduct and is therefore not generally applicable.stormans,d at.it held that the new rules do not appear to the court to be of general application because t he evidence now before the court convinces it that the means used by the rulemakers do not square with the end currently espoused by the defendants.id.at.by adopting a test instead of the lukumi underinclusiveness analysis,the district court committed legal error.the test is,in essence,a version of intermediate scrutiny under which a regulation must be substantially related to an important governmental objective.see,craig boren,d.the district court thus applied a level of scrutiny that runs contrary to the rule of smith and lukumi.
utilizing the correct legal standard,the new rules are generally applicable because they are not substantially underinclusive.there is no evidence that state appellants pursued their interests only against conduct with a religious motivation.under the rules,all pharmacies have a duty to deliver all medications in a timely manner.neither regulation challenged in this case applies to refusals only for religious reasons.the new rules apply to all lawful medications,not just those that pharmacies or pharmacists may oppose for religious reasons.pharmacies and pharmacists who do not have a religious objection to plan b must comply with the rules to the same more and no pharmacies and pharmacists who may have a religious objection to plan therefore,the rules are generally applicable.
the narrow class of reasons for failing to fill a not impair the general applicability of the rules.these provisions exempt a pharmacy from its comprehensive duty to deliver medications in certain enumerated situations,such as when a state of emergency is declared,a prescription is potentially fraudulent or erroneous,or the patient can not pay.admin.code a e,the district court acknowledged that these exemptions all reflect legitimate,reasons for not filling a prescription.stormans,d at.nonetheless,it concluded that because the new rules do not mandate delivery of all medications under all circumstances,the rules do not actually further access to medications.id.
the district court reasoning is unpersuasive.how much the new rules actually increase access to medications depends on how many people are able to get medication that they might previously have been denied based on religious or general moral opposition by a pharmacist or pharmacy to the given medication.whatever that number,it will not be smaller than the number of pharmacists or pharmacies affected by the regulation,so it can not be shrugged off as insignificant.
the existing exemptions are narrow.nobody could seriously question a refusal to fill a prescription because the customer did not pay for it,the pharmacist had a legitimate belief that it was fraudulent,or supplies were exhausted or subject to controls in times of declared emergencies.nor can every single pharmacy be required to stock every single medication that might possibly be prescribed,or to maintain specialized equipment that might be necessary to prepare and dispense every one of the most recently developed drugs.instead of increasing safe and legal access to medications,the absence of these exemptions would likely drive pharmacies out of business or,even more absurdly,mandate unsafe practices.therefore,the exemptions actually increase access to medications by making it possible for pharmacies to comply with the rules,further patient safety,and maintain their business.
that the pharmacy regulations recognize some exceptions can not mean that the board has to grant all other requests for exemption to preserve the general applicability of the regulations.there is no claim that the existing regulation recognizing these exceptions has not been fairly applied or that it will not be fairly and evenly applied in the future.these exemptions are a reasonable part of the regulation of pharmacy practice,and their inclusion in the statute does not undermine the general applicability of the new rules.
the text of the new rules itself suggests that their objective was to increase access to all lawfully prescribed medications,including plan b.according to the survey cited by the district court,percent of the pharmacies in the state do not carry plan b,amounting to pharmacies throughout the state.moreover,even among the pharmacies that carry the drug,it is unclear how many pharmacists refuse to dispense it.based on the sparse record before it,the district court erred in finding that access to plan b was not a problem,especially given that state officials have already made findings suggesting the opposite see final significant analysis for rule concerning pharmacists professional responsibilities,wac pharmacies responsibilities,wac.
the district court also erred in finding that the board has chosen to rely on state and federal antidiscrimination laws to define when refusal to dispense is or is not allowed.stormans,d at.the district court found this choice of weapons suspicious and concluded that because the antidiscrimination provisions prohibit only certain refusals and do not require pharmacies or pharmacists to dispense lawful medications without delay every time they are requested,the rules are underinclusive and therefore not generally applicable.id.the district court finding is not supported by the record.the new rules,as any other rule promulgated by the board,will be enforced by the board pursuant to washington revised code annotated section,which permits the board to refuse,suspend,or revoke a pharmacy or pharmacist license when t he licensee has violated any of the rules and regulations of the board of pharmacy.while the new rules prohibit discrimination against patients in a manner already prohibited by state or federal laws,they also require pharmacies to deliver lawfully prescribed and approved drugs in a timely manner,and mandate stocking of drugs to serve the needs of the community.in contrast,the hrc is in charge of compliance with wlad and is authorized to recommend action to other officials in response to possible violations of wlad.wlad is a comprehensive but general antidiscrimination law an exercise of the police power of the state for the protection of the public welfare,health,and peace of the people of this state,and in fulfillment of the provisions of the constitution of this state concerning civil rights.ann.wlad does not define when refusal to dispense is or is not allowed.stormans,d at.thus,wlad is decidedly not the enforcement mechanism of the new rules.
pharmacies were already subject to antidiscrimination laws as places of public accommodation.ann.the antidiscrimination subsections of the new rules reiterate that antidiscrimination laws forbid pharmacies or pharmacists from discriminating against protected groups.they are not limited to refusals to dispense or distribute certain medications.for example,the antidiscrimination subsections would prohibit a pharmacist from filling all lawful prescriptions for,but requiring additional payment from,persons of a particular race or ethnic group,or refusing to accept personal checks only from persons with a disability.antidiscrimination laws also prohibit a pharmacy or a pharmacist from refusing to dispense a drug because of a personal animus or objection to a patient based upon that patient membership in a protected class.
as a corollary,the board rules regulate the practice of pharmacy,primarily by requiring pharmacies to deliver lawfully prescribed and approved drugs in a timely manner.the rules do not equate a pharmacist refusal to dispense a drug because of a religious objection to the drug with a pharmacist discrimination against a patient in a manner prohibited by state or federal law.further,a pharmacy could violate the new rules by not stocking plan b despite community demand even if,in doing so,it was not violating any state or federal antidiscrimination laws.thus,the district court finding that the board relies on antidiscrimination laws to determine which refusals to deliver medication are and are not lawful was incorrect.therefore,the court clearly erred in concluding that the challenged rules are underinclusive and not generally applicable.
the district court failed to give proper weight to the rules distinction between pharmacies and pharmacists.the rules do not prohibit individual pharmacists from refusing to dispense a medication for religious reasons.a pharmacist may refuse to dispense plan b on a religious ground because ultimately it is the duty of the pharmacy,not the pharmacist,to deliver lawfully prescribed drugs.compare.admin.code governing pharmacies,with id.governing pharmacists.the district court found that accommodation of objecting pharmacists was too burdensome on the pharmacy because the only method of accommodation available is the hiring of another pharmacist to work with the objecting pharmacist.id.at see also id.at stating the rules allow for only a narrow right of conscience if the pharmacist worked with another pharmacist on shift who would dispense the medication in place of the conscientious objector.but this finding is contrary to the evidence.the record demonstrates that several different methods of accommodation are available.for example,the board itself stated,in a letter to pharmacists and pharmacy owners,that for females eighteen and over,a pharmacy technician can sell plan b as an product,but the pharmacist must be available to provide the patient with consultation and advice if requested.it may also be sufficient to have a second pharmacist available by telephone if the onsite pharmacist objects to dispensing a medication or providing a requested consultation.thus,the rules do not selectively impose an undue obligation on conduct motivated by religious belief because the rules actually provide for religious individual pharmacist can decide whether to dispense a particular medication based on his religious beliefs and a particular pharmacy may continue to employ that pharmacist by making appropriate accommodations.
b application of rational basis review 
because the rules are neutral and generally applicable,the district court should have subjected the rules to the rational basis standard of review.the district court instead introduced a heightened scrutiny to a neutral law of general applicability,contrary to the rule of smith and lukumi.when a law is neutral and generally applicable,the rational basis test applies.see miller reed,cir holding that a regulation requiring the use of a social security number to obtain a driver license survives rational basis review on a free exercise challenge.under rational basis review,the rules will be upheld if they are rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.see gadda state bar of,cir.to invalidate a law reviewed under this standard,t he burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.heller doe by doe,d alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.the record before us does not suggest that appellees have negated every conceivable basis supporting the new rules,so it appears that the new rules are rationally related to washington legitimate interest in ensuring that its receive lawfully prescribed medications without delay.
the district court,however,has not yet had the opportunity to analyze or to make the appropriate factual findings as to whether the new rules are rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.whether the rules pass muster under the rational basis test must be determined by the district court in the first instance.
balance of hardships 
to qualify for injunctive relief,the plaintiffs must establish that the balance of equities tips in their favor.winter.at.in assessing whether the plaintiffs have met this burden,the district court has a duty to balance the interests of all parties and weigh the damage to each.see mem l coliseum comm football league,cir.without discussion or analysis,the district court found that t he facts presented show,to the court satisfaction,the possibility of irreparable injury.stormans,d at.as discussed above,however,the correct standard is not whether there is a possibility but whether there is a likelihood of irreparable injury.winter.at.given that the district court applied the incorrect legal standard for granting injunctive relief and that it applied a strict scrutiny standard of review,the district court must reweigh the balance of hardships among the parties and reconsider the interests at stake.
in reweighing the harms,the district court should focus on the harms to the individual appellees and the intervenors.the alleged injury to the appellees is interference with their constitutional right of free exercise of their religion.though b y bringing a colorable first amendment claim,the movant certainly raises the specter of irreparable injury,simply raising a serious first amendment claim is not enough to tip the hardship scales.paramount land.lp cal.pistachio comm n,cir.if appellees are compelled to stock and distribute plan b without the benefit of the preliminary injunction,and a trial on the merits shows that such compulsion violates their constitutional rights,appellees will have suffered irreparable injury,since u nlike monetary injuries,constitutional violations can not be adequately remedied through damages.see nelson aeronautics space,cir.even if thelen and mesler leave their jobs or stormans closes the pharmacy,they will not necessarily avoid constitutional injury.see id.t he loss of one job does not carry merely monetary consequences it carries emotional damages and stress,which can not be compensated by mere back payment of wages.
there are also several possible harms to intervenors since an injunction against enforcement of the new rules places the intervenors at risk that the dispensing of plan b will be delayed or denied.some of these threatened harms to intervenors may be mitigated by limiting the scope of the injunction.the district court must determine the likelihood that these harms will occur and weigh any harm likely to be suffered by the intervenors if the injunction is granted against the injury that will likely befall the appellees if it is not.
public interest 
the district court also failed to weigh in its analysis the public interest implicated by the injunction,as winter now requires.see.at.when the reach of an injunction is narrow,limited only to the parties,and has no impact on,the public interest will be at most a neutral factor in the analysis rather than one that favor s granting or denying the preliminary injunction.see bernhardt county,cir.if,however,the impact of an injunction reaches beyond the parties,carrying with it a potential for public consequences,the public interest will be relevant to whether the district court grants the preliminary injunction.see sammartano first judicial dist.court,cir in cases where the public interest is involved,the district court must also examine whether the public interest favors the plaintiff.alteration omitted quoting fund for animals lujan,cir see also golden gate rest.ass city county of,cir.when an injunction is asked which will adversely affect a public interest the court may in the public interest withhold relief until a final determination of the rights of the parties,though the postponement may be burdensome to the plaintiff.weinberger,d.in fact,courts should pay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.id.at.
in this case,the overbreadth of the district court injunction implicates the public interest.the district court did not merely enjoin enforcement of the washington regulations against the plaintiffs,as it should have,see infra part.rather,it purported to enjoin the enforcement of the regulations against any pharmacy or pharmacist who,refuses to dispense plan see stormans,d at.the injunction clearly reached and implicated issues of broader public concern that could have public consequences.
even if the district court had limited the application of the injunction to the named appellees,the public interest is still a necessary consideration given the facts of this case.the general public has an interest in the health of state residents.see golden gate rest.ass n,at.there is a general public interest in ensuring that all citizens have timely access to lawfully prescribed medications.with regard to plan b,it may be in the public interest to deny the injunction to the extent that it is likely that sexually active women of childbearing age will be denied reasonable access to plan likewise,the injunction may not be in the public interest if it would likely cause unreasonable delay to a woman ability to acquire and use the drug,where such delay may render the drug ineffective in preventing an unwanted pregnancy.
there may be additional evidence showing the public interest in the grant or denial of the injunctive relief in this case.the plaintiffs bear the initial burden of showing that the injunction is in the public interest.see winter.at.however,the district court need not consider public consequences that are highly speculative.see golden gate rest.ass n,at.in other words,the court should weigh the public interest in light of the likely consequences of the injunction.such consequences must not be too remote,insubstantial,or speculative and must be supported by evidence.see eccles peoples bank of lakewood.concluding that a grievance that is too remote and insubstantial or too speculative in nature does not justify an injunction or declaratory relief.
finally,the district court should give due weight to the serious consideration of the public interest in this case that has already been undertaken by the responsible state officials in washington,who unanimously passed the rules that are the subject of this appeal.see golden gate rest.ass n,at the public interest may be declared in the form of a statute.internal quotation marks omitted see also burford sun oil.i t is in the public interest that federal courts of equity should exercise their discretionary power with proper regard for the rightful independence of state governments in carrying out their domestic policy.internal quotation marks omitted.
this case may present a situation in which otherwise avoidable human suffering results from the issuance of the preliminary injunction.golden gate rest.ass n,at.the district court clearly erred by failing to consider the public interest at stake.
scope of injunction 
injunctive relief must be tailored to remedy the specific harm alleged,at.an overbroad injunction is an abuse of discretion.id.
the district court should have limited the injunction to the named appellees,as was requested by appellees themselves in their initial motion for a preliminary injunction,or even to the named appellees and their employers as requested in appellees subsequent motion for modification of the injunction.instead,the court issued an overbroad injunction,enjoining enforcement of the new rules against any pharmacy which,or pharmacist who,refuses to dispense plan b but instead immediately refers the patient either to the nearest source of plan b or to a nearby source for plan stormans,d at.the district court abused its discretion in enjoining
