an autoclave sterilizes medical instruments quickly and cheaply.but some instruments ca stand the high temperatures and pressures of an autoclave,so there is a demand for sterilizers that use lower temperatures and sterilants.one system in widespread use relies on ethylene oxide gas as the sterilant.that gas is toxic and hard to handle,however,and ross caputo saw a business opportunity in these drawbacks.he designed a system using a plasma of peracetic acid as the sterilant and in asked the food and drug administration to approve this device,which his company abtox called the plazlyte.
since it has been unlawful to sell a new medical device without the fda approval.the medical device amendments to the food,drug,and cosmetic act have a grandfather clause covering devices that had been lawfully sold on or before may,or are substantially equivalent to them.f a ii.abtox asked the fda to approve sales of a plazlyte as substantially equivalent to units that employ ethylene oxide as the sterilant.we refer to a plazlyte rather than the plazlyte because abtox made at least two models.the first had an interior volume of one cubic foot and used peracetic acid made by mixing water with a solution of peracetic acid.the water and the solution were in separate bottles.this device used a procedure,applying gas plasma twice to sterilize the instruments.the second model had an interior volume of approximately five cubic feet,used peracetic acid from a single bottle no dilution with water from a second bottle,and ran just one cycle,at a different pressure from the first model.we call the first model the small plazlyte and the second model the large plazlyte.
abtox submitted the small plazlyte for approval in.it also submitted only those tests that favored the device effectiveness others,less helpful to abtox,were concealed or so a jury could conclude we recount the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.the agency staff doubted whether the plazlyte was equivalent to ethylene oxide systems and insisted on limiting the uses to which it could be put.when the fda signed off on the small plazlyte in,it approved the device only for use with solid instruments.if abtox wanted to sell the plazlyte to sterilize instruments containing interior space that the gas plasma might not fully penetrate such as those with hinges or lumens or instruments made from materials that might react chemically with peracetic acid,an organic peroxide,it had to file an application for approval as a new device rather than one equivalent to a grandfathered device.any medical instrument containing plastic,solder usually made of lead,tin,or silver,or brass an alloy of copper and zinc was outside the scope of the fda approval.
a new and expensive machine plazlytes sold for about for sterilizing solid instruments made of stainless steel had no prospect in the market.autoclaves are cheaper and do require the handling of acids.caputo understood that abtox would never be able to sell a single unit of the small plazlyte for the limited use approved by the fda.caputo and his assistant robert riley did not try.instead they immediately began promoting the large plazlyte as a replacement for devices,and thus as suitable for sterilization.it had begun selling the large plazlyte outside the united states in thus,long before receiving the fda approval to sell the small plazlyte,it knew that the small device would never be marketed and that the large plazlyte would be promoted for use with many kinds of it did not tell the fda these things when negotiating the details of the limited use that would be allowed to the small plazlyte.
problems ensued when some hospitals used the plazlyte to sterilize brass instruments employed for procedures in the eye.the plazlyte left a residue on some of these,although the instruments were sterile,the residue copper and zinc acetate was harmful to patients eyes.some patients experienced corneal decompensation,a severe condition that entails loss of vision.
in may the fda found out what abtox was telling customers and reminded it about the limitations on the scope of approval.this notice informed abtox that the plazlyte as promoted was misbranded.abtox then sought the fda approval to sell the large plazlyte to sterilize a wider class of instruments when the fda rejected abtox request for expedited decision and told abtox that it may not market this device until you have received a letter from the fda allowing you to do so,abtox went on promoting the large plazlyte as before.on september,the fda sent abtox another instruction to stop selling the large plazlyte abtox failed to comply though it did not tell the fda so.the agency never authorized abtox to sell the large plazlyte for any use.
the centers for disease control opened an investigation to discover what was causing the eye injuries.meanwhile,in january,the fda inspected abtox facilities and discovered that it was still selling the large plazlyte.the inspectors told abtox to desist it did.in april the fda issued a warning to all hospitals,telling them that the large plazlyte was not an approved device and at all events must not be used with any instruments containing solder,copper,or zinc,or for any ophthalmic instruments.the fda directed abtox to recall the devices marshals seized its inventory this criminal prosecution eventually followed.
the prosecutor threw the book at caputo and riley.the indictment charged them with conspiring to defraud the united states,mail fraud,wire fraud,lying to federal agents,and the delivery of misbranded devices,a and a.a jury convicted them of these charges after an trial.caputo has been sentenced to months imprisonment and riley to months.both were ordered to make restitution of million,the list price of all plazlyte units ever sold.
defendants lead argument is that the food,drug,and cosmetic act violates the first amendment by restricting promotional materials to those uses that the fda has approved.the argument starts from the premise that federal law allows customers of any approved medical device or drug to put it to any use that the customer sees fit.these uses being lawful,the argument goes,it must also be lawful to tell customers about them.
until the last years,such an argument would have been laughed out of court.valentine chrestensen,had held that commercial speech that is,speech promoting a product for not part of the freedom of speech as that term was understood in.but the court overruled valentine in virginia board of pharmacy virginia citizens consumer council,d,holding that the government can not regulate by ensuring ignorance among consumers.if it is lawful to sell a product then,the court held,it must be lawful to inform consumers that the product is available to buy.consumers themselves must decide what to do the constitution forecloses an enforced ignorance based on a paternalistic view that informed consumers will make mistakes.see also,greater new orleans broadcasting ass n,united states,d rubin coors brewing,d bolger youngs drug products,d coase,advertising and free speech,legal studies.
for a time judges thought the supreme court new understanding inapplicable to drugs and,by implication,medical devices federal law allows vendors to tell customers about all lawfully available drugs and devices,after all,and thus avoids the precise problem presented by virginia citizens consumer council.but federal law does prohibit manufacturers from alerting consumers to lawful uses,and thompson western states medical center,d,held that this limit is unconstitutional in at least some applications.a federal law allowed pharmacists to compound some drugs that had been approved for sales,creating substances that had not been subjected to the normal testing.the legislation granting pharmacists this compounding privilege attached conditions to the way they could promote the compounded drugs.the court held these limits unconstitutional if the compounded drug could be sold,the court held,then it could be freely promoted for every lawful use.western states medical center establishes that drugs are not a special case for analysis.the court once held that gambling is a special case,see posadas de puerto rico associates tourism of puerto rico,d,but the status of that rule is doubtful.see liquormart,rhode island,d plurality opinion.the court suggested in western states medical that congress either adopt a substantive rule prohibiting compounding or,here,prohibiting uses or allow the fda to supply warnings via its own speech.compelling private persons to toe the government line,or shut up,is unconstitutional,the court held.this is the doctrine that caputo and riley propose to invoke in their defense.
whether virginia citizens consumer council and western states medical center apply to promotion by a product manufacturer,which struck a bargain with the fda in the approval process by promising to limit its bargain that the private litigants in the earlier cases had not a difficult question.the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions places limits on the promises that an agency may extract from those who seek approval.and if a given use is lawful,and thus can be written about freely in newspapers or blogs,and discussed among hospitals that already have purchased a plazlyte,does it make a good deal of sense to allow speech by the device manufacturer,which after all will have the best information why privilege speech by the uninformed the manufacturer has an incentive to slant the speech in its favor and may withhold bad news,but many listeners especially professionals such as physicians understand this and can discount appropriately.that,at any rate,is the view of virginia citizens consumer council and the cases that followed in its wake.
yet if a manufacturer promise to the fda to avoid speech about uses is unenforceable,the fda may respond by withholding any approval of drugs or devices that have questionable additional uses.abtox small plazlyte would not have been approved at all,had the fda anticipated that approval would enable abtox to tout it or its larger brother for use with brass ophthalmic instruments.other firms,with no desire to promote uses or,at least,no desire to pay for the expensive tests needed to persuade the fda to sanction wider use,would be made worse off by their inability to strike deals allowing the fda to approve a subset of all possible uses.consumers who could benefit from drugs or devices that would be excluded from the market by the fda response to a broad privilege to tout uses also would be made worse off.doubtless the first amendment differs from bentham felicific calculus,but a court should hesitate before extending an a historical reading of the constitution in a way that injures the very audience that is supposed to benefit from free speech.
fortunately,we need not decide today whether a seller of drugs or medical devices has a constitutional right to promote uses.virginia citizens consumer council and its successors rest on the assumption that the law allows the activity that the speaker seeks to promote.here that assumption holds only if abtox lawfully could sell the large plazlyte for the approved use with solid instruments.unless the machine itself could be sold lawfully,there were no lawful uses to promote.and the jury found,by its verdicts on both the count and the counts,that the large plazlyte could not lawfully be sold.the jury concluded not only that caputo and riley had lied to the agency when seeking approval of the small plazlyte but also that the large plazlyte differed enough from the small one that new approval was essential.for current purposes it is enough to concentrate on the latter conclusion.defendants insisted at oral argument that the jury could have convicted,under the instructions given,without finding either lies to the fda or sale of a device.we have reviewed the instructions and conclude that,to convict on all counts as it did,the jury had to find both.
once the fda certifies a medical device under the grandfather clause,the seller may make modifications to that device without obtaining fresh approval.the line between a modification no approval needed and a new device which must be submitted independently for approval is drawn in.there are two principal inquiries first,whether the changes significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device and,second,whether there is a major change or modification in the intended use of the device.a.we doubt that the large plazlyte could be described as a modification of the small one recall that the large device had been placed on sale outside the united states in,the year before the fda approved the small device.modification suggests a change in an approved device,not a different device that was already on sale before the approval.but suppose that this is wrong,and suppose further that the large plazlyte was as safe as the small one notwithstanding the difference in the concentration and number of applications of the sterilant.there remains the rule that a major change or modification in the intended use of the device requires fresh approval.promoting the large plazlyte as suitable for use with all medical instruments is a major change in intended use,compared with using it for solid instruments alone.this expansion of use caused the copper and zinc acetates that injured patients.so the large plazlyte,with its expanded intended use,was not covered by the fda approval of the small plazlyte and could not lawfully be sold at all.that knocks out the premise of virginia citizens consumer council and similar cases.there was no lawful activity for speech to promote.
caputo and riley try to avoid this conclusion by arguing that the due process clause of the fifth amendment disabled the fda from keeping the large plazlyte off the market.the line between new and modified devices is too vague to be enforceable,the argument goes.we grant that phrases such as significantly affect and major change in the intended use are not.but then no legal phrase is.think of material as in material misrepresentations are forbidden,a staple of legal discourse,or unreasonable as in unreasonable danger to the health and safety of park users,a phrase deemed adequately specific in thomas chicago park district,d.the supreme court has rejected vagueness challenges to the antitrust laws,see nash united states,which must be an order of magnitude more ambulatory than a,and has held that a rule can not be deemed unconstitutionally vague if it suggests a metric for decision.see united states powell,d.section a tells us what dimensions of difference matter,even though it does not give an exact answer to the question how much is too much the statute in powell,which forbade the mailing of a firearm capable of being concealed on the person,also omitted a quantitative rule,but the court held that its qualitative approach suffices.
the uncertainty that is inevitable in legal standards as opposed to numerical rules often is offset by notice,so that people need not guess what is required of them.the fda gave abtox notice,and to spare.it published in march before the small plazlyte was approved a guidance stating that any change in the sterilant or chamber size of a sterilizer creates a new device that requires new approval.it sent letters,which abtox ignored.the letters not only called attention to the guidance but also restated the fda view of abtox duties under the statute and regulation.it sent an inspection team,whose directions abtox spurned.there was no such notice in united states prigmore,cir,a decision on which defendants heavily rely.and prigmore did not hold the statute or regulations unconstitutionally vague,either,though it did remand for a new trial with jury instructions adequate to pin down the meaning of the rules at issue there.
to say that the fda showered interpretations and advice on caputo and riley is not to say that the published guidance has the effect of a regulation,let alone that abtox was legally bound to comply with the letters.only the statute,regulations,and formal directives of the agency as opposed to its staff have legal force.the agency did not issue its and recall orders until april.until then caputo and riley were at liberty to chart their own course,as their own legal advisers counseled them.when they did thi
