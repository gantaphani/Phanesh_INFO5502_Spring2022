this case tests the scope of hospital liability under the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala.emtala requires a hospital to administer an appropriate screening procedure to all emergency room patients and,if it determines that an emergency medical condition exists,to stabilize the patient condition before discharge or transfer to another hospital.see id.asserting that hospital español auxilio mutuo de puerto rico auxilio mutuo did not comply with its own protocol in screening edgardo cruz and that it failed to stabilize him prior to discharge,the plaintiffs appeal a grant of summary judgment against them.for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment on both the screening and stabilization claims and remand for further proceedings.
in reviewing a grant of summary judgment,we view the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.see del carmen guadalupe negron agosto,cir.accordingly,we draw the following facts from the summary judgment record,indulging all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.smith,cir.
at approximately on august,cruz visited the auxilio mutuo emergency room complaining of pain in his chest,arm,and wrist.pursuant to auxilio mutuo written policy,emergency room patients receive a screening examination upon arrival to determine the severity of their conditions and are then classified in one of four categories.category i encompasses the most serious conditions,including acute chest pain with unstable vital signs,and categories ii,iii,and iv encompass progressively less serious conditions.triage officer miguel rodríguez performed an initial screening evaluation of cruz pursuant to auxilio mutuo policy.after checking cruz vital signs and noting that cruz complained of pain in his left arm and warmth in his wrist,rodríguez placed cruz in category iv,which includes back and muscle pain.notes from the screening examination do not indicate that cruz complained of chest pain.for purposes of summary judgment,however,we must credit cruz assertion that he did,in fact,report such pain,and,drawing all reasonable inferences in cruz favor,we must assume that the emergency room doctors were aware of the chest pain.
a second physician,james davison,performed a more thorough examination of cruz at approximately like rodríguez,davison did not document a complaint of chest pain.finding that cruz suffered from shoulder pain,however,davison ordered an electrocardiogram ekg and a cervical spinal.he interpreted the results of both tests as negative.based on his examination and the test results,davison diagnosed cruz with thoracic outlet syndrome,a disorder that involves the compression of blood vessels and nerves in the shoulder region.see national institute of neurological disorders and stroke,thoracic outlet syndrome information page,at http last visited july.davison prescribed celebrex an and clonazepan an and discharged cruz,encouraging him to follow up with a specialist.
the following day september,cruz returned to the auxilio mutuo emergency room with severe chest pain radiating to his left arm and jaw.doctors determined that cruz had suffered an acute myocardial infarction heart attack.he was admitted to the coronary care unit,where he remained for approximately one week before being transferred to another hospital where he underwent sextuple bypass surgery.as a result of the infarction,cruz suffered permanent damage to his heart,including scarring and decreased cardiac performance.
on october,the his wife,maria isabel and their conjugal a complaint against auxilio mutuo and american international insurance company charging violations of emtala.specifically,the plaintiffs asserted that cruz had been suffering from acute coronary syndrome during his august hospital visit and that hospital personnel failed to properly screen and stabilize him.the plaintiffs also contended that these deficiencies led to the permanent damage that cruz suffered as a result of his heart attack on september.after the close of discovery,auxilio mutuo filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim under emtala.it argued that cruz had been given an appropriate medical screening,that he was subjected to the same procedures used for every patient who visits the emergency room,that the august visit did not implicate emtala stabilization requirement because the hospital did not detect an emergency medical condition,and that there was no causal relationship between the damages alleged and the purported emtala violation.over the plaintiffs vigorous objections,the district court granted auxilio mutuo motion,finding that the plaintiffs claims are more suited to a medical malpractice claim.the plaintiffs appeal from this decision.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.littlefield acadia ins,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
a.the emtala statutory scheme 
congress enacted emtala in response to the increasing number of reports that hospital emergency rooms are refusing to accept or treat patients with emergency conditions if the patient does not have medical insurance.correa hosp.san francisco,cir internal quotation marks omitted.emtala imposes two primary requirements on participating hospitals 
first,it requires that a participating hospital afford an appropriate medical screening to all persons who come to its emergency room seeking medical assistance.see a.second,it requires that,if an emergency medical condition exists,the participating hospital must render the services that are necessary to stabilize the patient condition,see id.b a 
id.at.as an enforcement mechanism for these requirements,emtala creates a private right of action for violations.see d.
emtala screening claim 
although emtala does not define an appropriate medical screening examination,our circuit law does 
a hospital fulfills its statutory duty to screen patients in its emergency room if it provides for a screening examination reasonably calculated to identify critical medical conditions that may be afflicting symptomatic patients and provides that level of screening uniformly to all those who present substantially similar complaints.
correa,at.the essence of this requirement is that there be some screening procedure,and that it be administered.id.when a hospital prescribes internal procedures for a screening examination,those internal procedures set the parameters for an appropriate screening.id a hospital thus must adhere to its own procedures in administering the screening examination.
the plaintiffs do not dispute that cruz received a screening examination,nor do they contend that auxilio mutuo screening protocol was per se inappropriate.rather,they argue that the hospital failed to follow its own protocol when it placed cruz in category iv despite his complaint of chest pains that should have placed him in category ii acute chest pain with stable vital signs,and that this departure from hospital protocol violated emtala appropriate screening requirement in short,they challenge the district court conclusion that they have no claim under emtala because cruz was screened and evaluated according to auxilio mutuo protocol.there is more to this challenge than may initially meet the eye.
in its brief,auxilio mutuo devotes a great deal of attention to the aspects of its triage protocol that were followed in this case.it points out that cruz was examined and placed in a triage category upon his appearance in the emergency room,and that he was subsequently evaluated by the emergency room physician.auxilio mutuo asserts that cruz screening therefore did not deviate from the standard hospital protocol and that,at bottom,the plaintiffs claim is really one of medical malpractice rather than of an emtala violation.see id.at emtala does not create a cause of action for medical malpractice.therefore,a refusal to follow regular screen
