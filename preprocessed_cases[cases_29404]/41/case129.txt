since,maine has required all hospitals to provide free medical services to certain low income patients under a set of statutes and regulations collectively known as free care laws.see.ann.tit,et.maine free care laws do not reimburse the hospitals for their expenses incurred in delivering care to low income patients,and the amount of free care that the hospitals must provide is not limited under the statute.
separately,maine pays for the medical treatment provided to some low income patients through its medicaid program,called mainecare.yet the mainecare reimbursements fall well below the hospitals actual cost of providing medical services.
plaintiff franklin memorial hospital fmh is a,general acute care hospital located in farmington,maine with a tradition of voluntarily providing free and reduced price medical care to low income patients.fmh sued brenda harvey,the maine official charged with enforcing the state free care laws and administering mainecare.in a complaint,fmh sought a declaratory judgment that both maine free care laws and mainecare are unconstitutional takings of property.the district court dismissed the count relating to mainecare and granted summary judgment to the state official on fmh takings challenge to the free care laws.we affirm.
since july,maine free care laws have required hospitals to provide free medically necessary inpatient and outpatient hospital services to maine residents who earn incomes at or below of the federal poverty level see a,c.under the regulations,n o hospital shall deny services to any maine resident solely because of the inability of the individual to pay for those services.id.a.compliance with the free care laws is not a condition for having a license to operate a hospital in maine.instead,the state obtains compliance with its free care requirement through a system of fines and enforcement suits brought by the state attorney general or any affected patient.see.ann.tit.maine free care laws do provide relief to hospitals for which compliance with the regulations would have ruinous financial consequences.specifically,in any legal action brought to enforce maine free care laws,the hospital may avoid liability by showing that its economic viability would be jeopardized by compliance.id.d.
the parties agree that maine free care laws are unique in that 
the laws mandate that a hospital provide care to persons deemed eligible by the state through a penalty enforcement scheme,the hospital is not reimbursed any amount for the provision of care,and the provision of free care is not a license condition or is not linked to the state certificate of need process.
to the parties knowledge,no other state has a system of free care with each of those three features 
fmh operates in one of the poorest counties in maine,and the amount of free medical services it provides in compliance with maine free care laws has grown over the past several years.in,fmh provided in mandatory free care.during the eleven months preceding may,fmh spent to meet its free care obligations 
still,these expenditures represent only a small fraction of fmh overall budget.indeed,the roughly in mandatory free care that fmh provided during fiscal year amounted to only of the hospital gross revenues for that year,and fmh has not alleged that the level of free care that it currently provides threatens its continued economic viability.
although maine provides no payment for the medical services rendered in compliance with its free care laws,fmh recovers some of the costs it incurs in treating certain low income patients through reimbursements from the mainecare program.yet reimbursements through mainecare fall well short of fmh actual costs in treating patients.for example,in fiscal year,fmh received reimbursement under mainecare at a rate of per discharge for inpatient services,but fmh actual cost per discharge had historically been approximately.mainecare reimbursement rate for outpatient services is more favorable to fmh but still only covers of the hospital outpatient costs.
on august,fmh sued harvey in her capacity as the commissioner of the maine department of health and human services,seeking a declaratory judgment that both maine free care laws and the mainecare program constitute uncompensated takings of property.on october,harvey filed a motion to dismiss the count in fmh complaint relating to the mainecare program.the district court granted harvey motion to dismiss the mainecare count on january,holding that fmh could not state a takings claim because it voluntarily participates in the mainecare program.the parties filed for summary judgment on the remaining count relating to maine free care laws.on september,a magistrate judge recommended granting harvey motion for summary judgment.the magistrate judge,applying an ad hoc analysis,held that maine free care laws did not constitute a regulatory taking.on november,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommended decision and granted harvey motion for summary judgment.fmh timely appealed.
we first address fmh takings challenge to maine free care laws,which the district court rejected on summary judgment.we review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.see sullivan city of springfield,cir.
the takings clause of the fifth amendment,which applies to the states through the fourteenth amendment,prohibits the taking of private property for public use without just compensation.lingle chevron,d.although physical occupation of a person property is the paradigmatic taking,the constitution also guards against certain uncompensated regulatory interferences with a property owner interest in his property.id.at.here,the challenged government action,which does not directly appropriate fmh property but rather regulates how fmh may use it,is properly analyzed under the law of regulatory takings,not the law of physical takings.see philip morris,reilly,cir en banc a physical taking occurs either when there is a condemnation or a physical appropriation of property.id.a regulatory taking transpires when some significant restriction is placed upon an owner use of his property for which justice and fairness require that compensation be given.quoting goldblatt hempstead,d.
the supreme court regulatory takings jurisprudence has eschewed rules.indeed,in contrast to the law of physical takings,which typically involves the straightforward application of per se rules,council,tahoe reg l planning agency,d,regulatory takings jurisprudence is characterized by essentially ad hoc,factual inquiries,id.quoting penn cent.transp.city of new york,d,designed to allow careful examination and weighing of all the relevant circumstances,id.quoting palazzolo rhode island,d,concurring.
still,the supreme court has identified two categories of regulatory action that generally will be deemed per se takings.lingle,at.first,where the government requires an owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her must provide just compensation.id.the court cited,as an example,loretto teleprompter manhattan catv,d,where a state law requiring landlords to permit cable companies to install cable facilities in apartment buildings effected a taking.lingle,at.second,the court has held that per se regulatory takings occur where the regulations completely deprive an owner of all economically beneficial us e of her property.id.emphasis and alteration in original quoting lucas coastal council,d.neither of these situations is presented here.
per se analysis 
fmh argues that maine free care laws fall under the first category of per se takings because fmh is required to admit and house and board patients who need admission to a hospital for free.in its view,t here is no difference in the government occupying a room or the government ordering that a room be made available to someone it designates.and fmh contends that this case involves laws that force fmh to give its real property hospital rooms away for free.additionally,fmh stresses that maine free care laws require it to give away its personal property to the extent that it must purchase and freely provide expensive medicin
