in the spring of,plaintiff akida berry,an inmate in the wisconsin department of corrections,was transferred temporarily to the waushara county jail because of overcrowding.berry developed a serious toothache.the nurse and the doctor at the jail told him to take pain relievers,but they refused to refer him to a dentist.after about two months of serious pain,berry was returned to a state facility where he promptly saw a dentist who performed a root canal the same day.
berry,proceeding without a lawyer,sued the nurse,the doctor,and the jail administrator under for violating his eighth amendment right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.the defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that berry failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by a that berry did not suffer a serious medical condition and that even if berry did suffer a serious medical condition,he could not prove that any defendant acted with deliberate indifference toward that condition.the district court disagreed with the defendants on the first two points but agreed on the third and thus granted summary judgment to all three defendants.berry peterman,wl.
we affirm in part and reverse in part.we agree with the district court that berry has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he exhausted his administrative remedies.we also agree that berry suffered a serious medical condition and that the jail administrator is entitled to summary judgment because he was not deliberately indifferent to berry situation.as a layperson,the administrator was entitled to rely on the doctor and nurse advice regarding berry dental pain.but we conclude that berry has offered sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that the doctor and nurse acted with deliberate indifference toward his condition by persisting in an easy but ineffective course of treatment that subjected him to two months of serious but avoidable pain.we remand those claims for trial.
the facts for summary judgment 
this case comes before us on review of a grant of summary judgment,so we must give plaintiff berry the benefit of all conflicts in the evidence and all reasonable and favorable inferences that might be drawn from the evidence.see johnson snyder,cir betaco,cessna aircraft,cir.we do not vouch for the objective truth of every detail of the following account or take any position as to berry ultimate chance of success on the merits.
berry was confined at the waushara county jail for approximately ten march,through june,to overcrowding at wisconsin department of corrections doc facilities.approximately one month before his transfer to waushara,berry had a doc dental exam and was classified as level,meaning that he had routine or chronic dental needs and appeared unlikely to suffer an acute dental episode in the next six months.
during his detention at the waushara county jail,berry filed numerous complaints concerning a toothache.as early as april,berry asked to see a dentist about an ailing tooth,claiming that air,water,and food all caused him pain.on april,berry filed a complaint stating that he did not believe he could wait until his transfer back to a doc facility to see a dentist.he wrote that nothing was helping his tooth and that he was having constant pains and headaches.on april,berry again asked to see a dentist and complained that his tooth caused him continuous pain,headaches,and problems eating and sleeping.again on april,berry complained that his tooth was causing him a great deal of pain,and the worst headache i ever had,and that he was unable to drink water at times,or brush my teeth due to the pain.on april,berry asked his nurse whether he could be sent to an dentist to address his increasing pain,and he complained that his pain medication was ineffective.berry complained again on april that he was in such pain that he had to chew food on only one side of his mouth,and he noted that the pain had affected his sleeping and eating.on april,berry complained that he had not been able to brush his teeth because cold water caused him intolerable pain.a few days later,on may,berry complained to the jail administrator that he needed to see a dentist.berry filed this lawsuit on may.he complained to the jail administrator again on may,stating that he needed to see a dentist and that his requests had been ignored.
defendant dave registered nurse working for health professionals,which contracted to provide medical and nursing services at the waushara county and replied to most of berry complaints.in response to berry numerous requests to see a dentist,nurse reich regularly responded that waushara did not have a dentist on staff,that the waushara county jail medical staff could treat only pain or infections,and that any dental work would be performed when berry was transferred back to a doc facility.at times nurse reich changed berry treatment or made suggestions to alleviate his pain,but he often merely reminded berry that he had upcoming doctor appointments and that he was already receiving pain treatment pain relievers.other times,nurse reich simply replied that berry complaints had already been addressed.
defendant karen butler,a physician also working for health professionals,examined berry twice during his time at the waushara county jail.the record contains no evidence that butler berry teeth nor any details as to the methods used to examine berry teeth on either visit.on the limited record,it appears that butler examined berry only for infections or dental emergencies.during her examination on april,butler noted no such infections or emergencies.on april,butler examined berry again,this time noting a filling in tooth but nothing that would cause pain.on this second visit,berry insisted on seeing a dentist.butler refused to make a referral,apparently because berry presented with nothing more urgent than unexplained severe pain.instead,she recommended a different pain medication.butler persisted in this course of treatment even after berry complained that those medications were ineffective.she never contacted a dentist to examine berry teeth.
defendant george peterman,waushara county jail administrator,had limited contact with berry,who addressed only three complaints to him.peterman replied to the second complaint and told berry that he had raised his concerns with the medical staff.at berry request,peterman later looked at berry teeth himself.not surprisingly,he told berry that he was not qualified to diagnose or treat dental problems.in response to the third complaint,in which berry requested to see a dentist,peterman forwarded berry request to the medical staff and notified the doc of berry complaints.
berry was transferred from the waushara county jail to a doc facility on june and had a priority appointment with a dentist on june.according to his chart,berry complained of pain in tooth when he ate,when he brushed his teeth with cold water,and at night.the dentist exam revealed that the pulp in tooth was clearly necrotic,and the dentist performed a root canal or removal of a portion of the tooth pulp the connective tissue within,containing blood vessels and nerve tissue to salvage the remaining pulp.the dentist notes indicate that if berry pain had not subsided after the root canal,the tooth would have to have been removed.
the district court granted summary judgment for all three defendants,concluding that berry dental pain was objectively serious but that none of the defendants had been deliberately indifferent to his condition.the court explained that peterman and nurse reich properly deferred to the medical assessments made by butler,who treated berry pain and examined him twice but saw no indication of infection or other dental emergency.
the eighth amendment to the united states constitution protects prisoners from being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.this amendment,incorporated to apply to the states pursuant to the fourteenth amendment,includes a right to adequate medical care.estelle gamble,johnson doughty,cir.pursuant to,a prisoner may bring suit against any person who caused a violation of the prisoner eighth amendment rights while acting under color of state law.
berry asserts that his eighth amendment rights were violated because the defendants showed deliberate indifference to his repeated complaints of severe dental pain.to succeed on this claim,berry must show that he suffered from an objectively serious medical condition and that the individual defendant was deliberately indifferent to that condition.johnson snyder,cir,citing zentmyer kendall county,cir.
on the first element,the district court correctly concluded that berry had come forward with sufficient evidence of an objectively serious medical condition.berry offered ample evidence that he suffered from tooth decay and serious pain while at the waushara tooth pulp was clearly necrotic,according to the dental records,requiring an immediate root canal when berry was finally seen by a dentist shortly after leaving waushara and returning to a doc facility.tooth decay can constitute an objectively serious medical condition because of pain and the risk of infection.board farnham,cir harrison barkley,cir tooth cavity presented serious medical condition 
though the district court agreed that berry suffered from an objectively serious medical condition,it concluded that none of the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to that condition.deliberate indifference occurs when a defendant realizes that a substantial risk of serious harm to the prisoner exists,but the defendant disregards that risk.see farmer brennan,gayton mccoy,cir,citing collins seeman,cir.deliberate indifference is intentional or reckless conduct,not mere negligence.gayton,at.because each defendant played a different role in regard to berry treatment at the waushara jail,we address each defendant in turn.
i.the jail administrator 
berry failed to present sufficient evidence to support a reasonable jury finding that jail administrator peterman acted with deliberate indifference.as a nonmedical administrator,peterman was entitled to defer to the judgment of jail health professionals so long as he did not ignore berry.see hayes snyder,cir johnson doughty,cir greeno daley,cir spruill gillis,cir.the undisputed facts show that peterman met this standard.he consulted with the medical staff,forwarded berry concerns to the doc,and timely responded to berry complaints.that he took no further action can not be seen as deliberate indifference.as a practical matter,it would be unwise to require more of a nonmedical staff member like peterman.as hayes,johnson,greeno,spruill,and a host of other cases make clear,the law encourages security and administrative personnel at jails and prisons to defer to the professional medical judgments of the physicians and nurses treating the prisoners in their care without fear of liability for doing so.the district court properly granted summary judgment as to defendant peterman.
ii.the jail doctor 
butler is not entitled to summary judgment.neither medical malpractice nor mere disagreement with a doctor medical judgment is enough to prove deliberate indifference in violation of the eighth amendment.see estelle,at estate of cole fromm,cir.but a prisoner also is not required to show that he was literally ignored.sherrod lingle,cir.although the doctor did not completely ignore plaintiff pain,a doctor choice of the easier and less efficacious treatment for an objectively serious medical condition can still amount to deliberate indifference for purposes of the eighth amendment.estelle,at,citing williams vincent,cir johnson doughty,at stating that medical personnel can not simply resort to an easier course of treatment that they know is ineffective greeno,at noting that persistence in a course of treatment known to be ineffective violates the eighth amendment.a significant delay in effective medical treatment also may support a claim of deliberate indifference,especially where the result is prolonged and unnecessary pain.grieveson anderson,cir reversing summary judgment for defendants where plaintiff did not receive treatment for painful broken nose for nearly two days,citing gutierrez peters,cir collecting cases.also,as we explained in grieveson,a delay in treating serious pain can be actionable even without expert medical testimony showing that the delay aggravated the underlying condition.at,distinguishing langston peters,cir delay in responding to claim of injury by rape in prison did not rise to level of constitutional violation.in this context,courts may consider the cost of treatment alternatives when determining what constitutes adequate,medical care,johnson,at,citing ralston mcgovern,cir,but medical personnel can not simply resort to an easier course of treatment that they know is ineffective.johnson,at,citing kelley mcginnis,cir.
on the summary judgment record,a jury could reasonably conclude that butler knowingly adhered to an easier method to treat berry pain that she knew was not effective.she had not identified an effective pain medication,nor could she explain berry pain,yet she rejected the obvious alternative of referring berry to a dentist.a jury could find that she simply concluded that berry could endure his pain until his transfer back to the doc several weeks later,when berry would be the doc dentist problem,not hers.it is hard to imagine that a doctor seeing a civilian patient,or a doctor in a prison having dental staff,would respond in this way to persistent complaints of severe dental pain over a period of weeks,even in the absence of a dental emergency.a basic dental examination is not an expensive or unconventional treatment,nor is it esoteric or experimental.see ralston,at.such examinations are inexpensive and commonly sought immediately to address severe dental pain.thus,butler refusal to permit berry such a basic treatment option could be characterized as a gratuitous cruelty forbidden by the eighth amendment.see id.where berry made a modest request for treatment by a dentist,butler obdurate refusal to alter berry course of treatment despite his repeated reports that the medication was not working and his condition was getting worse,see greeno,at,is sufficient to defeat her motion for summary judgment 
we are troubled by the evidence that butler would not refer berry to a dentist unless and until he presented either a dental emergency or infection.for a physician to wait to treat a patient until an infection occurs seems counterintuitive.medical science has long tried to prevent infections from occurring in the first place.the record does not explain just what is included in the term dental emergency,but such emergencies are certainly not the only serious dental conditions that demand reasonably prompt professional attention.berry could have required emergency treatment if an infection had spread from his afflicted tooth into his bloodstream,but a doctor could not conscionably wait until that late point to finally provide effective treatment,particularly when confronted with persistent complaints of severe dental pain that was not responding to medication.
butler refusal to refer berry to a dentist resulted in a substantial and unnecessary delay in the treatment of his decaying tooth.the medical records and berry steady complaints of escalating pain indicate that the delay unreasonably prolonged berry suffering,making summary judgment inappropriate.see,grieveson,at evidence of day delay before treating painful broken nose was sufficient to survive summary judgment williams liefer,cir affirming denial of judgment as a matter of law jury could conclude that the delay in treatment unnecessarily prolonged and exacerbated prisoner pain.of course,we do not suggest that a minor delay in treatment constitutes deliberate indifference.see,knight wiseman,cir noting that hour delay in treatment of plaintiff shoulder injury was minimal and had no adverse consequences.anyone who has ever visited a doctor office knows that some delays in treatment are inevitable,particularly absent a emergency.such delays are even more likely in the prison environment.see,id.at noting that delay was result of guards inability to leave prison work gang unattended.the delay in this case,however,was neither minimal nor jus
