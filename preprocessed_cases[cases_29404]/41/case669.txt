jose de la luz perez appeals from an order of the district court concluding after an evidentiary hearing that perez is a sexually dangerous person,a,under the adam walsh child protection and safety act of the act,stat,and committing him to the custody of the united states attorney general.perez asks us to vacate the civil commitment order,contending that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction because the government failed to serve him with a summons pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.alternatively,perez argues that the district court finding that he is a sexually dangerous person under the act was clearly erroneous.as explained below,we affirm.
under the act,the government has the authority to civilly commit sexually dangerous federal inmates following the expiration of their federal prison sentences.a see united states wooden,cir.the statute defines a sexually dangerous person as one who has engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation and who is sexually dangerous to others.a.a person is considered sexually dangerous to others if the person suffers from a serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder as a result of which he would have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released.id.a emphasis added.
the attorney general or the director of the bureau of prisons bop may commence a commitment proceeding by filing with the clerk of court for the district in which the respondent is confined a certification that the person is sexually dangerous as defined by the act.see id.a.the filing automatically stays the release of the person from custody pending a hearing before the district court.united states heyer,cir see a.the district court is then required to convene a hearing to afford the government the opportunity to prove the ultimate truth of its certification.united states caporale,cir a the court shall order a hearing to determine whether the person is a sexually dangerous person.emphasis added.if,after the hearing,the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is a sexually dangerous person,the court shall commit the person to the custody of the attorney general.d emphasis added.
in december,perez was incarcerated at the bop facility in butner,north carolina,where he was serving the final few months of a year federal sentence for transportation of a minor in foreign commerce with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity,see a,and importation of an alien for immoral purposes,see.on january,the bop certification review panel filed in the eastern district of north carolina a certification seeking to have perez civilly committed as a sexually dangerous person.a.perez subsequently moved to dismiss the commitment proceedings on the basis that the government failed to comply with rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure by failing to serve a summons.the united states filed a response in opposition to perez motion,arguing that only requires the filing of a certification to initiate commitment proceedings,not a standard civil summons.the united states argued,in the alternative,that perez service of process argument was barred by rule h because he failed to raise it in a prior motion that addressed other procedural issues.the district court denied the motion to dismiss on slightly different grounds,concluding that even if service of the summons was required here,dismissal was not mandatory where,as here,perez received actual notice of the proceeding and suffered no prejudice from the government failure to serve him with a summons.
as mandated by the act,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine whether perez was a sexually dangerous person.a.any person subject to a hearing pursuant to the act shall be represented by counsel and shall be afforded an opportunity to testify,to present evidence,to subpoena witnesses on his behalf,and to confront and witnesses who appear at the hearing.d see id.c the hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of section d.perez moved to proceed pro se,and the court found that perez knowingly and voluntarily elected to appear without legal counsel.believing that the proceedings against him were unlawful,however,perez refused to be present or otherwise participate in the hearing.accordingly,the hearing was conducted in perez absence.
the government presented the expert testimony of three forensic psychologists who each performed a evaluation of perez for the purpose of determining whether he was a sexually dangerous person under the act hy malinek,a forensic psychologist who has evaluated hundreds of individuals in commitment proceedings heather ross,also a forensic psychologist specializing in the assessment of sex offenders and joseph plaud,a forensic psychologist who was appointed on behalf of perez.see b.all three experts prepared written reports stating their opinions and summarizing the bases for their opinions.
in making their assessments,all three experts reviewed perez criminal history records which established the following.in september,perez was arrested for abducting a boy at a laundromat in san antonio,texas.perez drove the boy to a motel where he held the boy overnight and forced him to engage in oral sodomy numerous times.the next morning,perez dropped the boy off in the street fifteen blocks away from his home.perez was convicted in texas state court of kidnapping a minor from his parents and sentenced to years imprisonment.see perez state.he was released on parole in may.
in may,perez made sexual contact with a boy in a dressing room at a mall.the boy mother reported the incident to a security officer who then returned with the boy to the dressing room and found perez victimizing a boy.the victim identified perez as the molester.in each case,perez approached the boy and offered him money to try on jeans,suggesting that they were the same size as perez nephew,for whom perez was shopping.each victim fell for perez ruse,and perez entered the dressing room with them and asked how the jeans fit.eventually,perez put his hands down the boys pants and felt their genitals,patted their buttocks,and asked them to bend over and touch their toes.
perez was arrested at the time of the offense in may.after being placed on bond,perez fled and evaded detection for several years.he was eventually apprehended in march.the charge involving the mall dressing room molestation was dismissed because the old victim could not be located,but perez was convicted under texas law in november of indecency with a child in relation to the victim.the charge also alleged that perez had one prior felony conviction for enhancement purposes.perez was sentenced to five years imprisonment in texas.he was paroled in february and was discharged from parole in august.
during the time that he was a fugitive from charges relating to the mall incident in,perez was convicted of indecency with a child and sentenced to five years of probation in march in texas.this offense,which occurred approximately six months after the offense in the mall,took place as perez was selling subscriptions and noticed a young boy in a woman apartment.after making a sale to her,perez left but returned a short time later,asking to use the telephone.while he was on the telephone,the woman told her son to take the trash out to the dumpster in the parking lot.perez followed the boy into the parking lot,where he pinched and rubbed the child buttocks,touched him on the front of his pants,and told him to unzip his pants.the victim was instructed not to tell anyone about what happened.finally,in september,perez was arrested after agents from the immigration and naturalization service executed a search warrant at his house in texas.the agents found two boys,ages twelve and thirteen,who were living with perez and perez father.the boys were mexican citizens and were living in the united states illegally.
interviews with the boys revealed that they had been living with respondent and his father for approximately two years,after respondent picked them up on the street in el paso,texas.the boy reported that respondent began sexually abusing them the very next day.the reported sexual abuse involved anal intercourse and occurred in several locations besides the home,including locations in the state of new mexico.perez also transported the boys to and from mexico on several occasions.at least three other children were interviewed during the investigation and reported that respondent had sexually molested them.medical evaluations of the two reported victims revealed signs consistent with chronic perianal trauma.
in,perez pled guilty to transportation of a minor in foreign commerce with intent to engage in aggravated sexual assault and to importation of an illegal alien for the immoral purpose of sexual assault.he was sentenced to months imprisonment on each charge,to be served consecutively,as well as three years of supervised release.
in addition to reviewing this criminal offense history,all three experts sought to interview perez.malinek and ross were rebuffed by perez,who refused to cooperate.plaud was more successful,eliciting a few limited statements from perez relating to his personal sexual history.all three experts,however,found perez statements to plaud to be significant and considered them in assessing perez sexual dangerousness.the experts unanimously diagnosed perez with pedophilia,marked by an exclusive sexual attraction to young males,a condition all agreed qualified as a serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder.a.and,finally,all three experts agreed that perez would have serious difficulty refraining from child molestation upon release from custody.
the district court found that the government established by clear and convincing evidence that perez was a sexually dangerous person as defined by a,and that civil commitment was therefore required under d.first,based on perez criminal records,the court found that perez has engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation in the past.id.a.second,based on the unanimous opinions of the expert witnesses,the district court concluded that perez suffers from a serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder.id.a.and third,relying on the detailed testimony of the experts as well as perez criminal history,the district court held that the government had proven that perez pedophilia presently impairs respondent volitional ability to refrain from deviant behavior and that,absent abatement by effective treatment,would in the future give him serious difficulty in refraining from child molestation or sexually violent conduct.
in an appeal from an order granting or denying a civil commitment under the act,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.united states hall,cir.perez first challenge to the district court commitment order is a purely legal one that the district court could not exercise personal jurisdiction over him because he was never served with a summons pursuant to rule.we reject this argument.
a civil action in federal court commences with the filing of a complaint,see,and personal service of a summons and a copy of the complaint upon the defendant,see.c.rule dictates that the summons must,among other things,identify the court and the parties apprise the defendant when he or she must appear to defend against the allegations and warn the defendant that failure to appear will result in a default judgment in favor of the plaintiff.see.a.if the summons is not served on the defendant within days after the complaint is filed,dismissal is required unless the district court extends the time for good cause shown.see.m.it is undisputed that the government never served perez with a summons and that no extension of time was sought or granted.the government contends,however,that service of a standard civil summons under rule is not required to commence civil commitment proceedings under against an allegedly sexually dangerous person in the custody of the bop.
as perez points out,a commitment proceeding under is civil and not criminal in nature,see united states timms,cir,and thus,broadly speaking,the federal rules of civil procedure would apply to a commitment proceeding.rule provides that t hese rules govern the procedure in all civil actions and proceedings in the united states district courts,except as stated in rule.although rule enumerates several types of civil actions or proceedings to which the rules of civil procedure,to one extent or another,do not apply,a civil commitment proceeding pursuant to is not among them.see.
that the rules of civil procedure generally apply to civil commitment proceedings under the act,however,does not mean that they can not be displaced by specific procedural provisions included in the act.congress has ultimate authority over the federal rules of civil procedure it can create exceptions to an individual rule as it sees fit either by directly amending the rule or by enacting a separate statute overriding it in certain instances.shady grove orthopedic,allstate ins.the question is whether the act requires the government to serve a summons pursuant to rule upon a respondent in federal custody despite the obvious differences between the initiation of civil commitment proceedings under and a typical civil action.we think not.
the act does not expressly indicate whether service of a summons is required service of process under rule is simply not mentioned.however,the act is not silent as to how to initiate and to notify the respondent of a commitment proceeding 
institution of proceedings.in relation to a person who is in the custody of the bureau of prisons,the attorney general or any individual authorized by the attorney general or the director of the bureau of prisons may certify that the person is a sexually dangerous person,and transmit the certificate to the clerk of the court for the district in which the person is confined.the clerk shall send a copy of the certificate to the person,and to the attorney for the government 
a emphasis added.the act provides a streamlined procedure for initiating commitment proceedings against individuals in bop custody who have been certified as sexually dangerous under.under the act,t he attorney general,his designee,or the director of the bop may initiate a commitment proceeding in the district court for the district in which the person is confined by filing a certification that the person is sexually dangerous within the meaning of the act.heyer,at emphasis added.and,rather than require the government to effect formal service of the certificate and a standard summons upon the respondent,the act directs the clerk of court simply to send a copy of the certificate to the person in bop custody who was certified as sexually dangerous.a.
we conclude that the procedure set forth in a for initiating proceedings for the civil commitment of a sexually dangerous person supplants the summons requirement set forth in rule.service of process pursuant to rule serves two primary functions in a typical civil action in federal court it provides formal notice to the defendant to appear and defend against an action that has been commenced in federal court,and it is the means by which the court asserts its personal jurisdiction over the defendant.see henry perritt,jurisdiction in cyberspace,vill,service of process performs two functions in anglo american civil procedure it represents assertion of judicial power of the forum state over the person of the defendant,and it is the formal means of providing notice to the defendant so that he or she may defend the lawsuit.in the unique context of a proceeding,however,service of a standard summons under rule is not necessary to perform either function.
first,the paramount function of serving a summons is to provide formal notice to the defendant that action is required to avoid liability and preserve his or her rights.service of the summons apprises a defendant of the pendency of the action and afford s the defendant an opportunity to present his objections.peralta heights med,quoting mullane central hanover bank trust.establishing notification to a civil defendant through proper service of the summons is critical since,among other things,service of the summons triggers defendant duty to file a responsive pleading to the complaint,see.a a i a defendant must serve an answer within days after being served with the summons and complaint,and the failure to respond in a timely fashion can result in liability being imposed by default,see.a.
the respondent in a civil commitment proceeding,by contrast,is not required to file any responsive pleading and faces no risk of a contrary merits determination being entered by default or without his knowledge.in fact,congress afforded respondents a number of procedural safeguards,including a mandatory evidentiary hearing,see a the court shall order a hearing to determine whether the person is a sexually dangerous person.id.d granting district courts the power to commit the respondent to the custody of the attorney general after the mandatory hearing and the right to be represented by an attorney at the mandatory evidentiary hearing,see id.c,d providing that a t a hearing ordered pursuant to this chapter the respondent shall be represented by counsel and,if he is financially unable to obtain adequate representation,counsel shall be appointed for him.moreover,at the mandatory hearing,the respondent shall be afforded an opportunity to testify,to present evidence,to subpoena witnesses on his behalf,and to confront and witnesses who appear at the hearing.id.d.in light of these procedural safeguards inherent in proceedings,receipt of a copy of the certificate initiating commitment proceedings suffices to provide notice to the respondent and it is undisputed that perez was provided a copy of the certificate seeking to have him committed as a sexually dangerous person.service of a summons is unnecessary in this context in view of the fact that congress provided another means of notifying the respondent of the proceedings as well as several procedural safeguards see meadows krischer,so d,concluding that a standard civil summons would be unnecessary to initiate proceedings under florida law providing for the civil commitment of sexually violent predators where the law did not require service of a regular civil summons.
a second function performed by service of a civil summons under rule is to assert the district court jurisdiction over a person.before a federal court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant,the procedural requirement of service of summons must be satisfied.service of summons is the procedure by which a court having venue and jurisdiction of the subject matter of the suit asserts jurisdiction over the person of the party served.omni capital int l,rudolf wolff,emphasis added internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.historically,however,personal jurisdiction in both the civil and criminal contexts flowed from physical custody or control over the defendant.see als scan,digital serv.consultants,cir t he limits on personal jurisdiction were grounded in a court power over the actual person of the defendant.thus,a person presence within the territorial jurisdiction of a court was prerequisite to its rendition of a judgment personally binding him.quoting int l shoe washington.over time in the civil context,t he idea of minimum contacts developed as a surrogate for actual presence in a state but did not alter the essentially territorial nature of jurisdiction.la ligue contre le racisme et,cir en banc,concurring in judgment.personal jurisdiction in a criminal case is still based on physical presence,which is usually acquired by taking the defendant into custody via arrest.see united states wilson,cir it has long been the general rule that a court power to try a criminal defendant is not impaired by the government use of even forcible abduction to bring the defendant within the court jurisdiction.united states rendon,cir a federal district court has personal jurisdiction to try any defendant brought before it on a federal indictment charging a violation of federal law.even if physical custody is no longer necessary to endow a civil court with personal jurisdiction over a defendant,it is clearly sufficient to do so.thus,that the government has physical custody over the respondent in civil commitment proceedings obviates the need for a summons.
next,perez contends that the district court committed clear error in finding him to be a sexually dangerous person.d.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.hall,at internal quotation marks omitted.
to obtain a civil commitment order under the act,the government must prove three elements by clear and convincing evidence.see united states wood,cir.the government first must demonstrate that the person has previously engaged or attempted to engage in child molestation.a see wood,at.second,the government must establish that the person currently suffers from a serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder.a wood,at.and third,the government is required to show that the defendant,as a result of the illness,abnormality,or disorder,would have serious difficulty in refraining from child molestation if released.wood,at quoting a.clear and convincing evidence is evidence of such weight that it produces in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction,without hesitancy,as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established,and,as well,as evidence that proves the facts at issue to be highly probable.jimenez daimlerchrysler,cir internal quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted.t he clear and convincing standard of proof is an intermediate standard that falls between a mere preponderance of the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt.hall,at quoting addington,at.
perez does not dispute that the government established the first two elements by clear and convincing evidence that he previously engaged or attempted to engage in child molestation and that he suffers from a serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder,pedophilia.perez challenges only the district court finding that as a result of his pedophilia,he would have serious difficulty in refraining from child molestation if released.a.t he serious difficulty prong of certification proceeding refers to the degree of the person volitional impairment,which impacts the person ability to refrain from acting upon his deviant sexual interests.hall,at internal quotation marks omitted.the lack of control or inability to control behavior will not be demonstrable with mathematical precision.it is enough to say that there must be proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior.id.quoting kansas crane,alteration omitted.
perez contends that the government evidence rested almost entirely on his criminal offense history and failed to adequately account for perez current level of volitional impairment.perez claims,moreover,that any expert opinion about his present mental state and capacity for volitional control rests on speculation,especially,he points out,because none of the experts who testified at the commitment hearing interviewed him.
first,we reject perez suggestion that the district court substantial consideration of his criminal offense history was erroneous or improper.although t he nature of perez prior crimes may well be a historical factor,it is by no means a stale or irrelevant one.when the question is whether an inmate suffering from pedophilia will have serious difficulty refraining from if released,consideration of the nature of his prior crimes provides a critical part of the answer.wooden,at.
moreover,it is not entirely accurate to suggest that each expert evaluation was completed without perez being interviewed.although perez refused to submit to interviews with the government psychologists,he ultimately participated to some extent in plaud interview perez refused to discuss his offense history with plaud,but he did comment generally on his sexual history,denying pedophilic sexual arousal and presenting himself as a,moral heterosexual male.despite this,perez admitted to plaud that he had never experienced sexual relations with an adult
