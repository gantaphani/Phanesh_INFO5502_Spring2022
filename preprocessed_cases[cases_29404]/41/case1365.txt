choose life illinois,cli,collected more than signatures from illinois residents interested in purchasing a choose life specialty license plate and applied to the secretary of state for issuance of the plate under.comp.stat.a amended effective.that statute prohibits the secretary from issuing a new line of specialty plates unless he has a minimum number of applications on file,and cli signatures far exceeded the minimum.since,however,when illinois authorized its first specialty license plate,almost no specialty plate had been issued without prior legislative approval.the secretary referred cli to the general assembly for enabling legislation.
cli hit a roadblock in the general assembly.despite the strong showing of support,the proposal for a choose life license plate died in subcommittee.cli turned to federal court for relief,claiming that the secretary was authorized to issue the plates without legislative approval once cli met the statutory requirements and that his failure to do so constituted impermissible viewpoint discrimination in violation of the first amendment.if legislative approval was required,cli claimed the general assembly refusal to adopt the choose life license plate was viewpoint discrimination.the district court accepted the first of these arguments and ordered the secretary to issue the choose life plate,but stayed its judgment pending appeal.
in the meantime,the general assembly resolved cli first claim by amending.comp.stat.to require express prior legislative approval before the secretary may issue new specialty plates.as to the second claim,the secretary now argues that the amendment reinforces his position that the messages on specialty license plates are the government own private or a mixture of government and private therefore no first amendment rights are implicated.we disagree,though we acknowledge the question has divided other circuits 
specialty license plates implicate the speech rights of private speakers,not the doctrine.this triggers first amendment forum analysis,and we conclude specialty plates are a nonpublic forum.illinois may not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint,but it may control access to the forum based on the content of a proposed that any restrictions are reasonable.the distinction between content and viewpoint discrimination makes a difference here.
it is undisputed that illinois has excluded the entire subject of abortion from its program it has authorized neither a plate nor a plate.it has done so on the reasonable rationale that messages on specialty license plates give the appearance of having the government endorsement,and illinois does not wish to be perceived as endorsing any position on the subject of abortion.the state rejection of a choose life license plate was thus content based but viewpoint neutral,and because it was also reasonable,there is no first amendment violation.we reverse the judgment of the district court.
background 
specialty license plates in illinois 
for an extra fee,illinois will permit a vehicle owner to have a specialized license plate that,in addition to the generic or personalized numbers and characters required for license identification,also bears a specific message or symbol.see.comp.stat.et.like most other states,illinois offers a broad selection of specialty plates.some denote that the vehicle owner is an alumnus of a certain college or university schools in illinois and contiguous states qualify or a member of a civic organization,the knights of columbus or the masons.id.others signify support for a particular cause,such as a love of pets i am pet friendly opposition to violence the dove of peace symbol mammogram or awareness mammograms save lives,be an organ donor or prevention of childhood cancer stop neuroblastoma see id.
with insignificant historical exceptions,each specialty license plate in illinois has its own authorizing statute describing the plate and establishing the required additional fee.these statutes typically allocate a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the plates to the specific state or local program that corresponds to the message or to the or charitable organization that sponsored the plate.for example,proceeds from the park district youth plate benefit local park and recreational districts the police memorial plate benefits the police memorial committee fund.see id.beyond their obvious utility as a means of promoting a message or cause,specialty license plates thus also serve a fundraising purpose for units of state and local government and for private organizations.
the basic requirements for issuance of a new series are set forth in.comp.stat,enacted in.until recently,that statute provided as follows 
a the secretary of state shall not issue a series of special plates unless applications,as prescribed by the secretary,have been received for plates of that series except that the secretary of state may prescribe some other required number of applications if that number is sufficient to pay for the total cost of designing,manufacturing and issuing the special license plate.
c this section shall not apply to special license plate categories in existence on the effective date of this amendatory act of,or to the secretary of state discretion as established in section relating to specialty plates for specific categories of persons,typically elected officials.
id.amended effective.although the statute specifies a default minimum of applications,the secretary often required far less approximately applications before issuing a new legislatively approved specialty plate.that lesser number was usually enough to make the program financially feasible from a manufacturing standpoint.illinois currently has about specialty license plates available for purchase.
cli quest for a choose life specialty license plate 
cli is a agency that promotes adoption in the state of illinois.in cli embarked on an initiative to obtain approval for a specialty license plate bearing the words choose life.to that end cli collected more than signatures from prospective purchasers and applied to the office of illinois secretary of state jesse white for issuance of the plate.the secretary informed cli that he could not issue a new specialty plate that had not been approved by the general assembly.for the next several years,cli waged a legislative battle for approval of its choose life specialty license plate,lining up support among sympathetic legislators.its efforts were thwarted,in the illinois senate and later in the house.the proposal died in a house subcommittee.
cli and several individual plaintiffs then brought this suit against the secretary for violating their rights.the parties filed for summary judgment.cli first argued that the secretary had authority under section to issue the choose life plates without legislative approval,and his refusal to do so constituted viewpoint discrimination within a forum for private speech.alternatively,cli claimed that if legislative approval was required,it had been subjected to impermissible viewpoint discrimination by the general assembly.cli also claimed the program was facially unconstitutional because the lack of any governing standards invited discrimination against disfavored messages.cli asked the district court to order the secretary to issue the choose life plate or shut down the entire program.
the secretary argued that although section was silent on whether an enabling statute was required for a new series,all specialty plates in illinois other than those grandfathered under section c had in fact been authorized by specific statutory enactment.accordingly,the secretary argued,the messages on specialty license plates were government speech,and the rights of the plaintiffs as private speakers were not implicated.the secretary maintained in the alternative that even if the program amounted to a forum for private speech,it was a nonpublic forum and the state decision to exclude the entire subject of abortion from the forum was a reasonable restriction on content and was therefore constitutionally permissible.
the district court granted summary judgment for cli.the court interpreted section as permitting the secretary to issue new specialty license plates without specific enabling legislation.applying the test from sons of confederate veterans,commissioner of the virginia department of motor vehicles,cir,a fourth circuit case,the court concluded that the illinois program established a forum for private speech and that the exclusion of the choose life message from this forum was viewpoint discrimination and could not withstand strict scrutiny.the court ordered the secretary to issue the choose life license plates,but stayed its order pending appeal.
in response to the district court decision,and while this appeal was pending,the general assembly amended section to include an explicit requirement of legislative approval for any new specialty license plate.effective january,the statute provides the secretary of state shall issue only special plates that have been authorized by the general assembly.act of.pub.act.
ii.analysis 
our standard of review is de novo.metro.life ins.johnson,cir.the material facts are undisputed.the question presented is whether the messages on specialty license plates are the government own speech or private speech,and if the latter,whether the exclusion of cli proposed choose life plate from the forum violates the free speech clause of the first amendment 
a.the district court interpretation of the unamended statute 
a considerable amount of the parties initial briefing concerned the proper interpretation of unamended.comp.stat.the district court read the statute to permit the secretary to issue new specialty license plates without a specific authorizing statute upon presentation of the minimum required number of applications.there is reason to doubt this interpretation.the statute is phrased not as a positive grant of authority to approve a new plate series but as a limitation on the secretary authority to commence issuing plates in an approved series.id.the secretary shall not issue a series of special plates unless applications have been received for plates of that series.this begs the question of who has the approval authority nothing in the illinois vehicle code addresses the secretary power to approve new specialty license plates.in practice,the secretary has never issued specialty plates in a new series without a specific statutory enactment creating the series.
we need not resolve this aspect of the appeal.the amendment to section a makes explicit what the secretary had argued was implicit that the authority to approve new specialty license plates resides with the general assembly act of,pub.act amending.comp.stat.a to add the following the secretary of state shall issue only special plates that have been authorized by the general assembly.we ordinarily apply the law in effect on appeal,and where as here a party requests only prospective relief,there is no impediment to doing so retroactively.landgraf usi film,d a pplication of new statutes passed after the events in suit is unquestionably proper in many situations.when the intervening statute authorizes or affects the propriety of prospective relief,application of the new provision is not impermissibly retroactive.
government speech or private speech 
it is well established that when the government speaks,it is entitled to say what it wishes,and it may take legitimate and appropriate steps to ensure that its message is neither garbled nor distorted.rosenberger rector visitors of the of,d citations omitted see also johanns livestock mktg.ass n,d bd.of regents of of.southworth,d keller state bar of,d.u nits of state and local government are entitled to speak for themselves,hosty carter,cir,and w hen the government speaks,it is,in the end,accountable to the electorate and the political process for its advocacy.southworth,at.if the citizenry objects,newly elected officials later could espouse some different or contrary position.id.
accordingly,when the government is the speaker,it may choose what to say and what not to say it need not be neutral.subject to other constitutional limitations not at issue here such as the establishment clause,the constraints on the government choice of message are primarily electoral,not judicial.while it is true that the government may not compel a person to express a message he disagrees with,imposed by the government the compelled speech doctrine or compel a person to subsidize a message he disagrees with,expressed by a private entity the compelled subsidy doctrine,see johanns,at,neither of these principles is implicated here.we will have more to say about johanns in a moment.it follows,then,that if the messages on specialty license plates in illinois are the state own speech,no rights are involved and cli remedy for the defeat of its choose life license plate is at the ballot box.
if,on the other hand,the messages on specialty license plates are not government speech,then the denial of cli application for a choose life specialty plate is analyzed under the supreme court speech forum doctrine.the government violates the free speech clause of the first amendment when it excludes a speaker from a speech forum the speaker is entitled to enter.christian legal soc y walker,cir citing rosenberger,at.hosty,at.judicial scrutiny in this context varies depending on the nature of the forum,and speech fora come in three basic varieties traditional public,designated public,and nonpublic.
we will return to forum analysis later the predicate question is whether the messages on specialty license plates are government speech,private speech,or a combination of the two.other circuits are divided on the question.the fourth and ninth circuits have held that messages on specialty license plates are private or hybrid speech the sixth circuit has held that messages on specialty license plates are government speech.compare.life,stanton,cir messages on specialty license plates in arizona are private speech,planned parenthood of,rose,cir choose life message on south carolina specialty license plate is a mixture of government and private speech,and sons of confederate veterans,at messages on virginia specialty license plates are private speech,with am.civil liberties union of bredesen,cir choose life message on tennessee specialty license plate is government speech.
the fourth circuit was the first to weigh in.in sons of confederate veterans,the court was confronted with a first amendment challenge to a virginia statute authorizing a specialty license plate for an organization of descendants of confederate army veterans.the statute differed from others authorizing specialty plates for private organizations because it specifically prohibited the group included the confederate being displayed on the plate.at.the sons of confederate veterans cried foul,alleging viewpoint discrimination in violation of the first amendment.virginia argued in response that the specialty plate was government speech or,if it was not,that the restriction on the display of the confederate flag was a reasonable,not,restriction.
the fourth circuit began its analysis by adapting an approach developed by the tenth circuit in a case involving a first amendment challenge to a holiday display featuring joint public and private sponsorship.id.at citing wells city county of denver,cir.to determine whether the speech at issue was governmental or private,the court weighed the following factors 
the central purpose of the program in which the speech in question occurs the degree of editorial control exercised by the government or private entities over the content of the speech the identity of the literal speaker and whether the government or the private entity bears the ultimate responsibility for the content of the speech 
id.quoting wells,at.
applying this framework,the court noted that virginia program had dual purposes the collection of revenue for the state and the facilitation of expression by private organizations and their members.id.at.the court also observed that the state generally exercised minimal editorial control over the content of specialty license plates because it usually accepted the designs submitted by the sponsoring organizations.id.at.finally,the court noted that although specialty license plates like other license plates were technically the property of the state,the owners of the vehicles on which they were mounted were the literal speakers and bore ultimate responsibility for the messages contained on the plates.id.at.the court concluded that the messages on virginia specialty license plates were predominantly private rather than government speech.id.the court went on to hold that the virginia statute logo restriction amounted to viewpoint discrimination within a forum for private speech.id.at.
the fourth circuit returned to this subject just two years later in rose,a case involving a challenge to south carolina choose life specialty license plate.the statute at issue provided that proceeds from the sale of the choose life plate were to be distributed to local private crisis pregnancy not to those that performed or promoted abortion services.rose,at.planned parenthood of south carolina challenged the statute shortly after it was adopted.the fourth circuit consulted the factors identified in sons of confederate veterans but its analysis.rejecting south carolina argument that its choose life specialty plate was government speech,the court determined that the plate embodie d a mixture of private and government speech.id.at.
the indicators of government speech were more strongly present in rose than in sons of confederate veterans.for example,south carolina choose life license plate had its origins in the state legislature rather than a private sponsoring organization two lawmakers acting on their own had initiated the legislative effort.other factors,that individual vehicle owners became the literal speakers with ultimate responsibility for the speech when they purchased and displayed the choose life plate on their the court to conclude that the message was a form of hybrid speech,both governmental and private.id.at.the attributes of the specialty plate were substantial enough to analyze the case under nonpublic forum doctrine,testing for viewpoint neutrality.id.at.the choose life plate flunked.see id.at south carolina has impermissibly favored the viewpoint by authorizing the choose life plate.
the following year the supreme court decided johanns,elaborating on the doctrine in the context of an alleged compelled subsidy.johanns was a first amendment challenge by a group of beef producers to a special federal assessment imposed on heads of cattle and used to fund a promotional campaign encouraging the consumption of beef.the advertising featured,among other things,the catchy beef.it what for dinner slogan.johanns,at.the complaining ranchers argued that the federal government could not constitutionally compel them to subsidize a private message.
the supreme court held that the assessment did not amount to a compelled subsidy of a private message because the promotional campaign was entirely the government speech.id.at.congress had established the framework for the promotional program in the beef promotion and research act of and directed the secretary of agriculture to implement it via a cattlemen beef promotion and research board,whose members were appointed by and answerable to the secretary.id.at.the beef board,in turn,convened an operating committee composed of beef board members and representatives appointed by a federation of state beef councils.id.the ranchers argued that the advertising could not be considered government speech because it was actually developed by the operating committee,some of whose members were private representatives.id.at.
the court disagreed,holding that t he message set out in the beef promotions is from beginning to end the message established by the federal government.id.the program was established by congress,and the secretary of agriculture implemented and retained ultimate control over it.id.at.when,as here,the government sets the overall message to be communicated and approves every word that is disseminated,it is not precluded from relying on the doctrine merely because it solicits assistance from nongovernmental sources in developing specific messages.id.at.
relying almost entirely on johanns,a divided panel of the sixth circuit broke with the fourth circuit and held in bredesen that tennessee choose life specialty license plate was government speech,implicating no speech rights of private speakers whatsoever.at.the bredesen majority thought johanns established a new test for government speech,applicable in all contexts,and on this basis declined to follow the fourth circuit lead in rose.the johanns standard,the court held,classifies the choose life message on tennessee specialty plate as government speech.id.
the court conclusion in johanns had been driven by the federal government pervasive and complete control from beginning to end over the message.at.the sixth circuit believed the same total governmental control was evident in bredesen.the tennessee legislature had consulted with new life resources,a private,nonprofit organization,on the design of the choose life plate the statute authorizing the plate also directed that new life was to receive half the profits from its sale.bredesen,at.but because the tennessee legislature chose the choose life plate overarching message and approved every word to be disseminated,the court held that johanns supports classifying choose life on specialty license plates as the state own message.id.at.
that specialty license plates involve additional private individual vehicle owners who carry the messages on their not alter the sixth circuit analysis.on this point,the court distinguished wooley maynard,d,a compelled speech case involving a new hampshire vehicle owner who repeatedly obliterated the state motto,live free or die,from his license plate.after multiple convictions and a jail term for violating the state vehicle code,the vehicle owner sought and obtained a injunction against further enforcement of the state statute.the supreme court affirmed,noting that the state statute in effect requires that vehicle owners use their private property as a mobile billboard for the state ideological message or suffer a penalty.id.at.this,the court held in wooley,was a form of coerced speech,impermissible under the first amendment.id.at.
not so in bredesen,said the sixth circuit no vehicle owner is compelled to carry tennessee choose life message.at.from this unremarkable observation the court extrapolated the following conclusion because display of a specialty license plate is voluntary,not compulsory,tennessee had not created a forum for private speech.id.at.this strikes us as a non sequitur.as judge martin noted in dissent,if messages on license plates implicated no interests at all,then wooley among other cases would have come out differently.see id.at martin,dissenting.judge martin also noted that the first amendment harm in the compelled speech or compelled subsidy context is the the former,being compelled against one conscience to utter the government preferred message,and in the latter,being compelled to subsidize someone else private message.see id.at.the first amendment harm in the context,on the other hand,is being denied the opportunity to speak on the same terms as other private citizens within a government sponsored forum.id.at.we think judge martin has it exactly right.
the ninth circuit did,too,in arizona life coalition,stanton,a case very much like our own.the arizona license plate commission denied the arizona life coalition application for a choose life specialty license plate,and the group sued,alleging a violation of its members rights and asking the court to order the commission to issue the plate.the ninth circuit viewed the sixth circuit decision in bredesen as a of johanns and declined to follow it.stanton,at.
the court found johanns instructive,however,in that the supreme court had focused on some of the same factors the fourth circuit had identified as important in sons of confederate veterans.applying the fourth circuit test,the court in stanton concluded that messages on specialty license plates in arizona were not government speech instead,as in sons of confederate veterans and rose,messages on specialty license plates in arizona should be treated as private speech and subjected to forum analysis.see id.at.the court held that the forum was a limited one more precisely,a nonpublic forum,meaning that any access restriction must be viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum.id.at.finally,the court concluded that the commission exclusion of the choose life message was viewpoint discriminatory and ordered the commission to approve the plate.id.at.
we will come back to this last point in a moment.for now,we pause to note that what emerges from this trip through caselaw is that the sixth circuit stands alone in holding that specialty license plates implicate no rights at all.we think this conclusion is flawed for the reasons we have noted and instead find the approach of the fourth and ninth circuits more persuasive.their test can be distilled and simplified by focusing on the following inquiry under all the circumstances,would a reasonable person consider the speaker to be the government or a private party factors bearing on this analysis include,but are not limited to,the degree to which the message originates with the government,the degree to which the government exercises editorial control over the message,and whether the government or a private party communicates the message.
applying this approach here,we arrive at the same conclusion as in sons of confederate veterans,rose,and stanton messages on specialty license plates can not be characterized as the government speech.like many states,illinois invites private civic and charitable organizations to place their messages on specialty license plates.the plates serve as mobile billboards for the organizations and vehicle owners to promote their causes and also are a lucrative source of funds.editorial control over the message is shared between the sponsoring organization and the state the organization typically develops the plate design,subject to the state authority to modify it.the most obvious speakers in the context are the individual vehicle owners who choose to display the specialty plates and the sponsoring organizations whose logos or messages are depicted on the plates.the state can reasonably be viewed as having approved the message it is commonly understood that specialty license plates require state authorization.nonetheless,messages are most closely associated with drivers and the sponsoring organizations,and the driver is the ultimate communicator of the message.in short,we agree with the fourth and ninth circuits that there are enough elements of private speech here to rule out the doctrine the messages on illinois specialty license plates are not government speech.because rights are implicated,we proceed to first amendment forum analysis.
c.what kind of forum 
as we have already noted,the supreme court has identified three types of speech fora traditional public,designated public,and nonpublic.in an open or traditional public forum,state restrictions on speech get strict scrutiny.christian legal soc y,at citing good news club milford cent,d lamb chapel ctr.moriches union free sch,d widmar vincent,d hosty,at.speakers may be excluded from an open or traditional public forum only when necessary to serve a compelling state interest and when the exclusion is narrowly drawn to achieve that interest.cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d see also christian legal soc y,at.a traditional public forum is public property that by long tradition or by government fiat has been devoted to assembly and debate,such as a public street or square.perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d.government creates a designated public forum when it intentionally open s a nontraditional forum for public discourse.cornelius,at.see also christian legal soc y,at.strict scrutiny applies here as well.christian legal soc y,at citing.educ.television comm forbes,d.
all other government property is considered under the rubric of nonpublic forum property that is not by tradition or design a forum for public communication.perry educ.ass n,at.see also good news club,at.restrictions on speech within a nonpublic forum must not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint and must be reasonable in light of the forum purpose.good news club,at.citing cornelius,at.forbes,at.rosenberger,at.lamb chapel,at.
specialty license plates are an unusual species of not a traditional public forum,and we think not a designated public forum,either.illinois has opened this particular property for general public discourse and debate.t he government need not permit all forms of speech on property that it owns and controls,int l soc y for krishna consciousness,lee,d,and it does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse,but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse,cornelius,at.relevant factors in the analysis include the policy and practice of the government and the nature of the property and its compatibility with expressive activity.id.
these factors weigh against a conclusion that specialty license plates are a designated public forum.license plates in illinois,as elsewhere,are heavily regulated by policy and practice.see.comp.stat.et,et,et.their primary purpose is to identify the vehicle,not to facilitate the free exchange of ideas.license plates are not by nature compatible with anything more than an extremely limited amount of expressive activity.we conclude that specialty license plates are a forum of the nonpublic variety,which means that we review cli exclusion from that forum for viewpoint neutrality and reasonableness.
viewpoint neutrality and reasonableness 
within a nonpublic forum,the supreme court has recognized a distinction between,on the one hand,content discrimination,which may be permissible if it preserves the purposes of th e limited forum,and on the other hand,viewpoint discrimination,which is presumed impermissible when directed against speech otherwise within the forum limitations.rosenberger,at.distinguishing between a permissible restriction and an impermissible restriction is not always easy.id.at.acknowledging that the distinction between content and viewpoint discrimination is not a precise one.
the difference between content and viewpoint discrimination was more readily apparent in sons of confederate veterans and rose than it is here.excluding the confederate flag from a design sons of confederate veterans and authorizing a choose life specialty plate without permitting a plate for those who wish to espouse the viewpoint rose were fairly obvious instances of discrimination on account of viewpoint.virginia was not imposing a no flags rule it was prohibiting the display of a specific symbol commonly understood to represent a particular viewpoint.south carolina was favoring one viewpoint on the subject of abortion over any other.
here,in contrast,illinois has excluded the entire subject of abortion from its program.the secretary argues this is a but restriction.we agree.illinois has not favored one viewpoint over another on the subject of abortion rose or prohibited the display of a symbol sons of confederate veterans.instead,the state has restricted access to the forum on the basis of the content of the proposed,in effect,no specialty plates,period.this is a permissible restriction on access to the forum,not an impermissible act of discrimination based on viewpoint.
we noted earlier that the ninth circuit came to the opposite conclusion in stanton,and our disagreement with this aspect of its analysis requires some explanation.like the secretary here,arizona license plate commission argued in stanton that it had rejected the choose life specialty plate not because of the viewpoint it expressed but because the state did not wish to entertain specialty plates on any aspect of the abortion debate.because the state had no specialty license plates expressing any view on the abortion issue,the commission maintained that its rejection of the choose life plate was a restriction on access to the forum.the ninth circuit rejected this argument preventing life coalition from expressing its viewpoint out of a fear that other groups
