we must decide whether public hospital districts may bring federal and state claims against tobacco firms to recover their unreimbursed costs for treating patients suffering from illnesses.
the association of washington public hospital districts,along with the association individual member districts collectively,hospital districts,appeal from the district court dismissal of their federal antitrust,racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,and supplemental state law claims against a number of tobacco companies and tobacco industry organizations collectively,tobacco firms.the hospital districts are political subdivisions of the state of washington which are required by state and federal law to provide health care services to the general public regardless of their patients ability to pay.
the hospital districts allege that the tobacco firms have engaged in a conspiracy against the public generally and the health care industry in particular.according to the hospital districts,the tobacco firms have conspired to misrepresent and to conceal the addictive nature of nicotine and the health risks associated with tobacco use,promoting their alleged deception through propaganda disguised as independent scientific research while endeavoring to suppress legitimate scientific research that demonstrates the dangers of tobacco use.the hospital districts further claim that the tobacco firms have conspired to suppress competition to develop less harmful nicotine and tobacco products and have manipulated the levels of nicotine in their products to ensure continuing addiction.finally,the tobacco firms have allegedly conspired to refrain from making any claims concerning the relative health superiority of specific tobacco products.
according to the hospital districts,the tobacco firms unlawful conduct has caused them considerable financial harm.but for the tobacco firms conspiracy to suppress competition,they allege,less harmful tobacco products would have been developed which would have garnered a substantial market share.the hospital districts maintain that they themselves were potential consumers of such products,as they could have purchased them for the use and treatment of their patients suffering from nicotine addiction.patients who used these less harmful products presumably would have experienced fewer health illnesses,thereby reducing the hospital districts costs for treating such illnesses.further,the tobacco firms alleged conspiracy to spread misinformation regarding the adverse health effects of tobacco use,the addictive nature of nicotine,and the tobacco firms own manipulation of nicotine levels allegedly prevented the hospital districts from instituting more effective smoking cessation programs.such misinformation also induced the hospital districts patients to use tobacco products.thus,but for the tobacco firms alleged conspiracy to deceive the public,the hospital districts could have assisted more patients to overcome their addiction to nicotine products,again reducing their costs for treating illnesses.
the hospital districts commenced this action against the tobacco firms to recover their increased costs for treating their patients illnesses caused by the tobacco firms unlawful conduct,alleging federal antitrust and rico violations state common law claims for fraudulent misrepresentation,fraudulent concealment,breach of special duty,unjust enrichment,civil conspiracy,and public nuisance and violations of the washington unfair business practices protection act.ann.in a carefully reasoned decision,the district court dismissed all claims with prejudice for failure to state a claim,relying on oregon health welfare trust fund philip morris,cir.the court held that the hospital districts did not have antitrust or rico standing because their claimed damages were not proximately caused by the tobacco firms unlawful conduct,but were instead derivative of the personal injuries of smokers afflicted by illnesses.ass of.pub.hosp.dists.philip morris,d.the court also held that the hospital districts antitrust claims were barred for lack of antitrust injury under american ad,gte of,cir,because the hospital districts did not experience their injuries in the market where competition was being restrained.ass of.pub.hosp,d at.finally,the district court dismissed the hospital districts state common law claims for lack of proximate cause,id.at,and dismissed their consumer protection act claims under.state physicians ins.exch.ass fisons,for failure to allege an injury to business or property,ass of.pub.hosp,d at.this appeal followed.
we must first decide whether the district court erred in dismissing the hospital districts federal antitrust and rico claims.
section of the clayton act provides that any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may bring a private damages suit.similarly,c provides that a ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section,the substantive provisions of rico,may bring a private damages suit.c.nonetheless,the courts have recognized that private antitrust and rico actions are subject to traditional judicial tools to limit a person responsibility for the consequences of that person own acts.holmes securities investor protection,d.among these limitations is the requirement that the alleged violations of the law be the proximate cause of the injury suffered.id.rico blue shield mccready,d antitrust.
a direct relationship between the injury and the alleged wrongdoing has been one of the central elements of the proximate causation determination,and a plaintiff who complained of harm flowing merely from the misfortunes visited upon a third person by the defendant acts generally has been said to stand at too remote a distance to recover.oregon laborers,at quoting holmes,at.internal citations omitted.to determine whether an injury is too remote to allow recovery under both the antitrust laws and rico,a test is applied whether there are more direct victims of the alleged wrongful conduct who can be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general whether it will be difficult to ascertain the amount of the plaintiff damages attributable to defendant wrongful conduct and whether the courts will have to adopt complicated rules apportioning damages to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries.id.citing holmes,at,and associated contractors of,cal.state council of carpenters agc,d.
in oregon laborers,we considered the antitrust and rico proximate cause requirement in the tobacco litigation context.there,five union health and welfare trust funds that provide health care benefits to their beneficiaries brought suit against various tobacco firms,alleging federal antitrust and rico violations as well as state common law and statutory claims.the trusts complaint was predicated on the same conspiracy allegations as are at issue here.id.at.like the hospital districts,the trusts sought to recover their increased expenditures for treatment of their beneficiaries illnesses that allegedly resulted from the tobacco defendants wrongdoing.id.at.
we held that the trusts claims failed as a matter of law.we explained that the trusts lacked both antitrust and rico standing,as they could not establish that their injuries were proximately caused by the tobacco defendants wrongdoing.id.at.we observed that the trusts injuries were entirely derivative in nature,for without any injury to smokers,plaintiffs would not have incurred the additional expenses in paying for the medical expenses of those smokers.id.at.thus,there was no direct link between the defendants alleged wrongdoing and the trusts damages,and the proximate cause requirement was not met.id.at.
we then applied the proximate cause test.we held that the first factor weighed against the trusts because there existed more directly injured victims,in the form of the smokers themselves,who would be motivated to punish the defendants for their wrongdoing.id.we recognized that such directly injured victims could not bring suit under rico or the antitrust laws,given that they suffered personal injuries rather than the requisite injury to business or property.id.nonetheless,we rejected the trusts argument that this weighed in favor of standing.although smokers could not vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement,they could bring other claims to deter the defendants wrongdoing.id.next,we observed that the trusts damages were entirely speculative in nature,as they would involve proof,ultimately,of how smokers themselves would have changed their behavior in the absence of the defendants wrongdoing.id.at.we remarked that t he difficulty of ascertaining the damages attributable to defendants alleged wrongful conduct and the complexity involved in calculating these damages weigh heavily,if not dispositively,in favor of barring plaintiffs actions.id.finally,we noted that there was the potential for duplicative recovery given the possibility that smokers might bring suit against the defendants for their personal injuries under state law theories.id.at.
all other courts of appeals that have addressed the issue have agreed that union trust funds lack standing to bring antitrust and rico claims against the tobacco industry to recover their increased expenditures for treating illnesses the fact that the hospital districts are health care providers rather than third party health care payers like the union trusts in oregon laborers is immaterial for purposes of rico and antitrust standing.the ratio decidendi of oregon laborers and the union health trust cases from our sister circuits is fatal to the hospital districts claims.
like the union trust funds in oregon laborers,the hospital districts are attempting to recover damages that are derivative of the injuries suffered by smokers.the district court properly noted that w ithout any injury to smokers,plaintiffs would not have incurred the additional expenses in paying for the medical expenses of those smokers.ass of.pub.hosp.districts,d at.thus,there is no direct link between the alleged misconduct of the tobacco firms and the hospital districts claimed damages.
as we did in oregon laborers,the district court examined the hospital districts claims according to the proximate cause factors set forth in agc and holmes the directness of the injury,the speculative nature of the harm,and the risk of duplicative recovery and complexity of apportioning damages.id.at.the court correctly concluded that each of these factors weighs strongly against according the hospital districts antitrust and rico standing.id.at.smokers are the more direct victims who can vindicate the public interest in deterring the tobacco firms wrongful conduct.see oregon laborers,at.the difficulty of ascertaining the hospital districts damages attributable to such wrongful conduct is just as great here as it was in oregon laborers.calculation of the hospital districts damages would entail considerable speculation regarding how individuals tobacco usage would have changed in the event that accurate information and less harmful tobacco products were available.see id.at.finally,the same potential for duplicative recovery is present given the possibility that smokers themselves could bring state law claims against the tobacco firms to recover for their personal injuries see id.at.
the hospital districts offer several possible bases on which to distinguish oregon laborers.the common theme underlying the hospital districts contentions is that looser rico and antitrust standing rules apply to health providers due to their special relationship with their patients,a relationship that third party payers such as union health trusts lack the differences between health care providers and third party payers,however,do nothing to remedy the fundamental defect with the hospital districts claims they are attempting to recover for harm that is derivative of personal injuries visited upon their patients.their claims are just as remote,and would occasion the same unfounded speculation concerning damages,as the union trusts claims in oregon laborers.thus,the hospital districts attempts to distinguish oregon laborers are unavailing.
the hospital districts cite mccready,d,as establishing a special rule of antitrust standing for health care providers.the hospital districts are incorrect.in mccready,a group health plan subscriber brought an antitrust suit against the plan,alleging that it conspired with psychiatrists to restrain competition in the psychotherapy market.id.at.the plan reimbursed its subscribers for psychotherapy treatment provided by psychiatrists,but not psychologists.the plaintiff received unreimbursed treatment from a psychologist.id.while recognizing that the conspiracy was targeted at psychologists rather than plan subscribers,the court nevertheless held that the plaintiff had antitrust standing,explaining that d enying reimbursement to subscribers for the cost of treatment was the very means by which it is alleged that blue shield sought to achieve its illegal ends.id.at.the court further explained that the plaintiff injury was inextricably intertwined with the injury the conspirators sought to inflict on psychologists id.at.
mccready does not establish a special standing rule for health care providers,as the hospital districts would read it,nor does it dispense with the general requirement that antitrust and rico plaintiffs must be directly harmed by the defendant wrongful conduct.as the court subsequently explained in agc,in mccready the actual plaintiff was directly harmed by the defendants unlawful conduct.agc,at.she was denied reimbursement for her psychotherapy expenses.her damages were not derivative of the harm the conspirators inflicted upon psychologists.in fact,the court noted that mccready psychologist was fully paid for his services and was in no way injured by blue shield refusal to reimburse mccready for the cost of such services.mccready,at.neither mccready nor any of the other cases cited by the hospital districts provides any support for the hospital districts attempt to recover for their remote harm 
similarly,the fact that the hospital districts allege that they were potential purchasers of less harmful tobacco and nicotine delivery products does not render their claims any less remote.the harm suffered by the hospital districts as potential purchasers of products whose development the tobacco firms allegedly conspired to suppress is derivative of the harm suffered by their patients,who were the potential users of such products.had such less harmful products been available,the hospital districts patients might have used them,and in turn might have suffered from fewer diseases,with the result that the hospital districts might have incurred lower treatment costs.this is the very essence of a derivative injury.
the hospital districts antitrust claims fail on a second,independent ground failure to allege an antitrust injury.an antitrust injury is an injury of the type that the antitrust statute was intended to forestall.agc,at.the requirement that the alleged injury be related to behavior requires,as a corollary,that the injured party be a participant in the same market as the alleged malefactors.bhan nme,cir.further,a ntitrust injury requires the plaintiff to have suffered its injury in the market where competition is being restrained.parties whose injuries,though flowing from that which makes the defendant conduct unlawful,are experienced in another market do not suffer antitrust injury.am.ad,at.
although the hospital districts allege that they are potential participants in the nicotine delivery market,and this is the market where competition allegedly has been restrained,the district court ruled that they nonetheless failed to state an antitrust injury.the court reasoned that the hospital districts injuries were not experienced in the nicotine delivery market,but rather in the health care market.we agree.the essence of the hospital districts allegations is that the tobacco firms conspiracy to suppress the development of less harmful tobacco products indirectly resulted in the districts incurring increased health care expenses.these expenses simply can not be characterized as injuries that the hospital distric
