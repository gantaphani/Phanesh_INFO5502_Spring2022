eleven national medical societies and associations representing physicians of different specialties collectively petitioners appeal the district court dismissal of their statutory and constitutional challenge to a regulation promulgated by the secretary of the department of health and human services secretary implementing a new system for calculating a component of the medicare physician fee schedule for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.petitioners contend that their claim is not precluded from judicial review,and that the secretary regulation is directly contrary to the transition formula congress established for calculating the relevant component.because i b bars judicial review of petitioners claim,we affirm the district court.
medicare,the federal health insurance program for the aged and disabled has three parts part insurance benefits part medical insurance benefits and,part provisions.see et.this case deals with part b,which is a voluntary supplemental insurance program that covers payment for physicians services and other healthcare services to aged and disabled individuals who enroll in the program.see.physicians who participate in the medicare program are reimbursed at a rate outlined in a physicians fee schedule.payment amounts under the fee schedule are calculated by multiplying the relative value of a service the conversion factor for the particular year and the geographic adjustment factor applicable to the locality in which the service was provided.see b.the first component,the relative value of a service,is calculated by combining three subcomponents each of which is measured in terms of relative value units rvus.the three subcomponents are the work component work rvus the practice expense component and the malpractice component malpractice rvus.see c a i c c i iii.

two days after the final rule was promulgated,the petitioners filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois,alleging that the final rule was arbitrary,capricious,and contrary to law in violation of the medicare act,the administrative procedure act,and the due process clause of the fifth amendment.petitioners sought expedited relief that included a declaratory judgment finding that the secretary transition formula as described in the final rule was improper an injunction enjoining respondents from implementing the transition formula as described in the final rule and an order requiring the implementation of the transition formula as petitioners contend congress mandated by statute the respondents moved to dismiss petitioners complaint,contending that i barred petitioners claim.
title of the united states code section i provides that 
there shall be no administrative or judicial review under section of this title or otherwise of 
a the determination of the adjusted historical payment basis as defined in subsection a d i of this section,
b the determination of relative values and relative value units under subsection c of this section,including adjustments under subsection c f of this section and section b of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of,
c the determination of conversion factors under subsection d of this section,
d the establishment of geographic adjustment factors under subsection e of this section,and 
e the establishment of the system for the coding of physicians services under this section.
emphasis added.the district court referred the case to a magistrate judge to conduct necessary proceedings and enter a report and recommendation on respondents motion to dismiss and petitioners motion for expedited declaratory judgment.the magistrate judge first considered whether i b precluded judicial review of the petitioners challenge.the magistrate judge found that although this subsection clearly bars administrative and judicial review of the determination of relative value units this type of bar on judicial and administrative review does not preclude a collateral challenge on statutory or constitutional grounds.thus,the magistrate reasoned that because w hat petitioners were really seeking was a ruling on whether the secretary violated the constitution or federal statutes while interpreting the statutory requirements for the transition to,they were not precluded from seeking judicial review.
the magistrate judge then considered the merits of petitioners claims.in light of the unclear text of c c ii,the context of the statute,the related sections of the medicare act,the history of,and the situation to which the statute pertains,the magistrate found that the language of c c ii was not plain and unambiguous.furthermore,for many of the reasons articulated as to why the statute was ambiguous,as well as the deference due to the secretary interpretation,the magistrate judge determined that the secretary integration of the adjusted into the such product language of the transition formula was a reasonable interpretation of the statute.thus,the magistrate concluded that the respondents did not violate the medicare act,the apa,or petitioners due process rights.
both parties filed objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation with the district court.the district court considered the magistrate judge report and recommendation however,the court decided to grant the respondents motion to dismiss petitioners complaint for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to i b.the court explained that b ecause the express language of the statute bars judicial review,and the overall structure of the medicare part b payment scheme supports this conclusion,it found sufficient congressional intent to foreclose judicial review of the secretary instructions and regulations.additionally,the district court found that petitioners challenge to the process used to determine relative values and relative value units was not procedural or collateral but was in fact substantive,and therefore subject to preclusion by i b.furthermore,with respect to the merits of petitioners complaint,the court noted that even if the medicare act permitted judicial review of petitioners challenge,it would still have found in favor of respondents,the court then adopted the magistrate judge report with respect to this issue.petitioners now appeal.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,this court first must determine whether i b precludes judicial review of petitioners claim.if review is precluded,we must consider whether this bar violates petitioners constitutional rights and the doctrine of separation of powers.however,if this court does have jurisdiction to review petitioners claim,the issue becomes whether the secretary regulation violated the medicare act,the apa,or the petitioners due process rights.
we review a district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.see neuma,amp,cir.we conduct this review mindful of the strong presumption that congress intends judicial review of administrative action.see bowen.acad.of family physicians,d.o nly upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review.abbott labs.gardner,d.while we acknowledge that respondents bear a heavy burden to overcome the strong presumption that congress did not mean to prohibit all judicial review of administrative action,bowen,at.quotation omitted,we also recognize that all presumptions used in interpreting statutes,may be overcome by,inter alia,specific language or specific legislative history that is a reliable indicator of congressional intent,or a specific congressional intent to preclude judicial review that is fairly discernible in the detail of the legislative scheme.bowen,at.quotations omitted.
we agree with the district court determination that the medicare act,by its express terms,precludes judicial review of the determination of relative values and relative value units,including review of the regulation promulgated by the secretary implementing a statutory transition formula for the determination of.title of the united states code section i expressly provides that there shall be no administrative or judicial review under section of this title or otherwise of b the determination of relative values and relative value units under subsection c of this section emphasis added paragraph b.we find this provision to be a clear and explicit indication of congress intent to prohibit administrative and judicial review of the secretary decision now challenged by petitioners.while petitioners acknowledge that paragraph b precludes administrative and judicial review of the secretary determination of specific rvus assigned to specific services,the secretary decision to assign a specific number of rvus for gallbladder surgery,they assert that this provision does not foreclose review of a systemic challenge to the secretary interpretation of congress nondiscretionary instructions for establishing components of the physician fee schedule.
in support of their argument,petitioners rely on language from furlong shalala,wl,at july,aff.in part and rev in part on other grounds,cir.in furlong,the district court found that paragraph b did not bar judicial review of a challenge to the application of the rule to reimbursement payments under the physician fee schedule.id.in so finding,the furlong court explained that paragraph b does not foreclose judicial review of all issues which may implicate subsection c.id.in the case at bar,petitioners assert that,similar to furlong,their challenge involves an issue that implicates subsection c and to which judicial review is not foreclosed.however,petitioners ignore the balance of the furlong court reasoning.the rule challenged in furlong was an ancillary policy applied only after relative values had been determined.see id.the furlong court explicitly recognized that relative values first must be determined and that only after this determination does a value exist which the ancillary policy may reduce by.id.far from being ancillary to the determination of relative values,the regulation challenged by petitioners in this case is an integral part of the relative value determination.
petitioners also seek support for their position from the supreme court decision in mcnary haitian refugee center,d.in mcnary,the court held that e of the immigration and nationality act ina,which barred judicial review of a determination respecting an application for special agricultural worker saw status,did not bar judicial review of collateral challenges to unconstitutional practices and policies used in processing the application.at.quotation omitted.petitioners rely on the similar use of the word determination in paragraph b to support their claim that the scope of that prohibition should be interpreted so as to permit their challenge.we do not agree.
the fact that the regulation in mcnary and the regulation at issue in the case at bar both contain the word determination does not further petitioners argument.petitioners mechanical comparison fails to acknowledge important differences between the claims asserted in mcnary and the claim in the case at bar,and how these claims relate to the respective regulations being challenged.in mcnary,the court found that the language of e prohibited the judicial review of an individual challenge to the determination of his or her application for saw status.see id.at.thus,the court concluded that the plaintiff claim was outside the scope of e prohibition because it merely challenged the policies and practices employed by the ins in processing applications.see id.conversely,in this case,the language in paragraph b explicitly includes petitioners challenge.petitioners claim consists of a challenge to a regulation implementing a formula for determining.it would be difficult for congress to have written paragraph b in clearer terms prohibiting such a challenge.see painter shalala,cir finding that the no review provision clearly indicates congress intent to preclude administrative and judicial review of the manner in which the conversion factor is calculated by the secretary am.soc y of dermatology shalala,finding that congress plainly intended to give the secretary the authority to develop and implement the relative value scale system without being subjected to judicial scrutiny,aff.paragraph b bars the review of the determination of relative values and relative value units.i.the regulation at issue sets out the formula for calculating,practice expense relative value units.petitioners challenge is precisely what congress sought to prohibit.
we find heckler ringer,d,a case which involved the medicare act,to be more analogous than mcnary.in heckler,the court addressed a challenge to the secretary policy of refusing reimbursement for a particular type of surgery.see id.at.without exhausting the administrative remedies,the plaintiffs sought relief in district court.see id.they attempted to distinguish their claim on the ground that it was procedural and not substantive,and therefore,not within the scope of the administrative review channeling provision.see id.at.however,the court concluded that the claims of respondents were nothing more than,at bottom,a claim that they should be paid for their particular surgery.id.the court explained that the proce
