john walker,a state prisoner,sued a number of prison doctors and nurses for violating his constitutional rights by acting with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.the district court found that all of the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity,and dismissed the case with prejudice.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
although the district court did not label its ruling as such,we are reviewing a grant of summary judgment.thus,our review is de novo,and we construe the facts in a light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.hostetler quality dining,cir.john walker was an inmate at western illinois correctional center at the time of these events.on july,while walker was in his bunk in his cell,a heavy steel drawer fell from the bunk above him and struck his right hand.a screw in the drawer punctured his finger.he suffered a deep cut on his small finger and an injury to the joint at the base of the finger.he asked a correctional officer for medical care but was not allowed to go to the health care unit at that time.he was seen at the health care unit two days later by vickie rowlands,a nurse.he asked to see a doctor at that time but nurse rowlands declined his request,opting instead to examine and treat the wound herself.he complained to the nurse that he was in great pain and that the wound was down to the bone.after examining walker,nurse rowlands applied topical antibiotics and directed him to soak his hand in salt water.
on july,walker returned to the health care unit,complaining of pain and infection in his right hand and finger.at this point,the wound was draining pus,and walker was walking with his hand bent upward at the elbow to help limit the throbbing pain he felt when his hand was lower.he told the nurse who examined him that he thought his finger was broken.she noted in his medical records that an infection was suspected,and she called adrian feinerman to report her suspicion.over the phone,feinerman ordered an of walker hand but did not personally examine him.walker asserts that feinerman did not order antibiotics,but his record citations do not support that assertion.at most,walker record cites demonstrate that he did not receive antibiotics,but he offers no evidence regarding whether feinerman ordered them.the defendants present unrebutted prison records showing that feinerman ordered penicillin for the infection and ibuprofen for pain.feinerman did not refer walker to a specialist at that time and did not review the.sherrick,who is not a defendant here,reviewed the that same day and found it negative for fracture and negative for osteomyelitis an infection involving the bone.
on july,benjamin reviewed sherrick report and examined walker.at that time,his entire arm was swollen,he could not move his hand and he was in great pain.again,unrebutted medical records show that she ordered a topical antibiotic,an ace bandage,and motrin for pain.she did not order iv antibiotics at that time.according to walker,benjamin told him that his fingers were fine.
although walker visited the medical unit for treatment of a sinus condition on july,the medical progress notes do not indicate any complaints about his hand that day.two days later,however,he returned to the medical unit complaining about pain and swelling in his hand.his wound was draining pus.an unidentified nurse scheduled walker to see a doctor the next day.on july,walker saw benjamin again and nurse rowland.benjamin noted an infection and prescribed keflex,a different antibiotic.she continued a topical antibiotic as well and scheduled walker for a visit in a week.she did not refer walker to a specialist and did not order a second at that time.
walker continued to experience pain and the drainage of pus from his wound,but did not return to the health care unit for more than a week.the record does not reveal who was responsible for his failure to receive care during that week he implies the defendants were responsible but provides no record support for this proposition.nor does he provide record evidence regarding who was responsible for his failure to receive the oral antibiotics that were prescribed for him during this time.the defendants cite unrebutted evidence that on august,three days after his scheduled appointment,walker appeared at the health care unit complaining only of nasal stuffiness.on august,he returned to the heath care unit for treatment of the wound to his hand.he was seen by nurse dunbar.although he was in great pain,nurse dunbar did not give him any pain medication.he was seen that same day by virgilio pilapil,the doctor on call,who referred walker to ansar ansari,a surgeon.ansari told walker he had an infection that was eating away the bone and that he would have to see a specialist.he ordered a complete blood chemistry,a culture,and an to rule out osteomyelitis.he did not prescribe pain medication.he noted that walker would require a procedure to correct the problem.the and complete blood chemistry were completed within a day.
on august,feinerman was informed that the showed displacement of the joint.feinerman prescribed the oral antibiotic cipro but directed that it not be given to walker until the culture was completed.walker was scheduled to see benjamin on august.she examined walker that day and reviewed the results.she diagnosed infection going into the bone and displacement of the bone at the base of the finger.although walker complained of great pain,she did not prescribe pain medication.she ordered that walker be given cipro and dressings for his wound.she did not refer walker to a specialist and did not order intravenous antibiotics.
a radiologist reviewed the second and dictated a report on august.the radiologist diagnosed osteomyelitis.ansari was informed of this report on august,and requested a consultation for walker with an orthopaedic specialist.on august,walker was seen by dr,herrin,an orthopaedist.herrin scheduled walker for emergency surgery and performed the procedure that same afternoon at a hospital outside the prison.walker remained in the hospital until august.during that time,he was given intravenous antibiotics,and was treated by donald graham,a physician board certified in internal medicine and infectious diseases.
graham prescribed,a narcotic pain reliever,as needed.after his return to prison,walker repeatedly asked for pain medication,and both nurse dunbar and benjamin refused to give him anything for pain.according to walker,while he was in the prison infirmary after his surgery,he repeatedly pushed the call button to ask the nurse for pain medication.nurse dunbar either failed to respond to the call button or angrily told walker to stop pushing the damned call button,you do need anything.she also told walker,you will get pain medication when i want you to have it,and i do want you to have it.walker also told benjamin he was in pain and not receiving his pain medication,and benjamin replied that walker just wanted to get high,did not need the pain medication,and could not have it.when he returned to graham for a visit,walker told graham that he was not getting the prescribed darvocet.graham said he would try to help.when walker next saw nurse dunbar,she said,so you blabbed to the doctor that we were giving you your pain medication.you only want to get high,and we are going to let you do that.
walker sued benjamin,feinerman,ansari and pilapil,and nurses dunbar and rowland under for violating his constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.he alleged they were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs by not providing adequate medical care or pain relief the defendants moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted judgment in favor of nurse rowland and pilapil,finding that walker had insufficient evidence of deliberate indifference by these two defendants.the court denied summary judgment as to the remaining defendants.as the parties prepared for trial,walker filed a motion for a directed finding on the issue of qualified immunity.walker sought to exclude the issue of qualified immunity from trial on the grounds that the defendants were not entitled to immunity in this case because a prisoner right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by the denial of necessary medical care and pain relief was at that time.the defendants argued that walker motion was untimely and that he was not entitled to a directed finding in his favor on the issue of qualified immunity.the defendants asked the court to find instead that they were entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law and requested that the case be dismissed with prejudice.
the district court found that nurse dunbar was entitled to qualified immunity because walker had not produced evidence that she had indeed refused to refer him to a doctor or had refused to give him antibiotics.the court declined to consider walker claim that nurse dunbar had refused to give him pain medication after his surgery because walker had not pleaded those facts in his complaint.the court found that ansari was also entitled to qualified immunity because there was no evidence that he knew of and disregarded a risk to walker health.instead,ansari had correctly diagnosed walker condition and had referred him to a specialist for care.an affidavit from a hospital administrator showed that ansari could not expedite walker physical removal from prison to the hospital,and thus any delay was due not to deliberate indifference but to factors outside ansari control.
feinerman was entitled to qualified immunity,according to the district court,because walker produced no evidence of feinerman deliberate indifference.instead,the evidence showed that feinerman ordered oral antibiotics on two occasions,and ordered an of walker hand.the court found that feinerman failure to prescribe intravenous antibiotics after the diagnosis of osteomyelitis had been made may have been negligent but was not adequate to demonstrate deliberate indifference in light of the other care this physician provided.as with feinerman,the court found that benjamin was at most negligent with her failure to prescribe intravenous antibiotics after walker was diagnosed with osteomyelitis.examining the totality of the medical care provided by benjamin,the court found that there was no evidence of deliberate indifference because on the three occasions she treated walker,benjamin prescribed antibiotics,dressings or other medications as she deemed medically appropriate for his injury.the court refused to consider walker claim that benjamin refused to give him his prescribed pain medication after surgery because walker did not put benjamin on notice of this claim in his complaint.the court therefore found benjamin was entitled to a finding of qualified immunity.because all of the remaining defendants were entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law,the district court dismissed the case with prejudice.walker appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of benjamin,ansari and feinerman,as well as nurse dunbar.he does not appeal the district court earlier grant of summary judgment in favor of pilapil and nurse rowland.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity de novo.clark,cir walker shansky,cir.walker complains that the defendants subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment,made applicable to the states by the fourteenth amendment.in particular,he alleges that they were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs,and this indifference caused him great pain and permanent injury.the supreme court held in estelle gamble that deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain proscribed by the eighth amendment and that such indifference may give rise to a claim under section.estelle gamble,d.
a deliberate indifference claim contains both objective and subjective elements.gutierrez peters,cir.the deprivation suffered by the prisoner must be objectively sufficiently serious that is,it must result in the denial of the minimal civilized measure of life necessities.gutierrez,at citing farmer brennan,d.in the medical care context,the objective element requires that the inmate medical need be sufficiently serious.gutierrez,at.the subjective element requires that the prison official acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind.id.a negligent or inadvertent failure to provide adequate medical care is insufficient to state a section claim because such a failure is not an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,and is not repugnant to the conscience of mankind.estelle,at.medical malpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisoner.estelle,at.however,the standard for deliberate indifference is satisfied by something less than acts or omissions for the very purpose of causing harm or with knowledge that harm will result.haley gross,cir.a prisoner claiming deliberate indifference need not prove that the prison officials intended,hoped for,or desired the harm that transpired.haley,at.it is enough to show that the defendants actually knew of a substantial risk of harm to the inmate and acted or failed to act in disregard of that risk.id.a factfinder may conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was obvious.farmer,at.
walker moved to preclude the defendants from raising a defense of qualified immunity at trial.qualified immunity protects government officials from civil liability when performing discretionary functions so long as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.alvarado litscher,cir walker,at.to overcome the defense of qualified immunity,a plaintiff must show the deprivation of a constitutional right,and must also show that the right was clearly established at the time of the violation.alvarado,at.the district court blended together its analysis of whether there was a genuine issue of material fact with respect to walker claim and whether the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.under certain circumstances,such as those presented here,the two inquiries effectively collapse into one,at.as we just discussed,a plaintiff claiming an eighth amendment violation must show the defendant actual knowledge of the threat to the plaintiff health or safety,the defendant failure to take reasonable measures,and the defendant subjective intent to harm or deliberate indifference.id.if there are genuine issues of fact concerning those elements,a defendant may not avoid trial on the grounds of qualified immunity.id.likewise,if the uncontested facts reveal a fatal gap in the plaintiff case,the defendant will win on the merits.id.with these standards in mind,we will examine walker claim that the defendants caused him permanent injury when they failed to appropriately treat his infection,and that they failed to treat him for his pain.
we begin with his assertion that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs when they failed to appropriately treat his infection,leading to osteomyelitis and permanent injury.because walker cites no evidence relating to nurse dunbar on this claim,we look to the action or inaction of the physician defendants.ansari saw walker for the first time on august,following a referral from pilapil.walker does not dispute that ansari correctly identified walker condition as an infection that had entered the bone.ansari ordered further tests to determine the exact nature of the infection.when the test results came back on august,ansari requested a consultation for walker with an orthopaedic specialist.prison officials arranged for walker to see the specialist on august.walker sole complaint about ansari seems to be the delay between the initial visit,the diagnosis,and the visit to the specialist.walker has presented no evidence that these delays were even within ansari control,much less that he was deliberately indifferent to walker medical needs.nor has walker presented any evidence that the delay contributed to his injuries.langston peters,cir prisoner who complains that delay in medical trea
