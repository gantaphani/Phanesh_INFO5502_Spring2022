in this case,we consider the validity of a maintenance rate that is applicable to ill crew members and is one of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement cba.the cba contained,inter alia,a maintenance rate of per week for ill crew members and a rate of per week for injured crew members.due to this differential treatment,the district court granted larry skowronek,an ill crew member,summary judgment and awarded him the injured crew member rate.we reverse.
background 
the facts in this case are not in dispute.skowronek was employed as a wheelsman aboard american steamship company ship,the john boland.on september,while at sea,skowronek suffered a heart attack.he departed the ship at that time,and he remained unfit for duty until december.as a member of the seafarer international union while he was employed by american steamship,the terms and conditions of skowronek employment were governed by a cba between his union and his employer.the portion of the cba relevant to this case provides 
the weekly recovery stipend shall be paid at the rate of three hundred dollars weekly and will be composed of dollars maintenance eight dollars per day contractual rate and two hundred dollars contractual support benefit.
such payments are an obligation of the employer to an employee who suffered an injury aboard the ship covered under maritime law,which incapacitates him for at least seven days and shall be due and payable not less frequently than each second week anniversary of the injury.such coverage shall be retroactive to the date of injury.the injured seaman must see a doctor chosen by the employer at reasonable times when requested.unless mutually extended,payments will not exceed one year.
the payment of this benefit shall constitute satisfaction of the obligation to pay maintenance but otherwise shall not constitute a waiver or be deemed to lessen any legal or contractual rights held by such injured employee.it is agreed that the weekly recovery stipend is separate and distinct from any other rights and options of the employee,except as specified above.
when a member of the unlicensed personnel is entitled to maintenance under the maritime law,he shall be paid maintenance at the rate of eight per day for each day or part thereof of entitlement,upon presentation of a medical abstract.this payment shall be made regardless of whether he or she has or has not retained an attorney,filed a claim for damages,or taken any other steps to that end.the payments due hereunder shall be paid in a timely manner,generally not less frequently than twice monthly.
skowronek am,wl,at.may.thus,the cba provides that injured crew members are entitled to payments of per week for the time they are unfit for duty.that amount includes an per day maintenance payment.ill crew members,however,are entitled only to the per day maintenance payment.
american steamship therefore paid skowronek per week during the period he was unfit for duty.on september,he commenced an action in michigan state court in which he sought per week for the period.he complained that the cba discriminated against ill crew members.american steamship removed the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan.both parties filed motions for summary judgment,and on may,the district court granted skowronek motion and denied american steamship.the latter filed a timely appeal.
ii.analysis 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment under the de novo standard.nichols moore,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.the district court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.
under united states maritime law,maintenance is the shipowner duty to provide food and lodging to a seaman who becomes ill or injured while in the service of the ship.vaughan atkinson,d.the right to maintenance is related to the right to cure,which is care,including nursing and medical attention during such period as the duty continues.calmar taylor.the shipowner duty to pay maintenance continues until either the seaman has recovered or his condition is declared permanent.vella ford motor,d.the duty exists irrespective of both whether the shipowner was negligent and whether the illness or injury is.id.at.maintenance has traditionally been said to serve three purposes to protect the poor and improvident seaman while ill in foreign ports,to encourage shipowners to protect the seaman safety and health while in service,and to induce employment in the merchant marine.gardiner,cir citing vella,at.
the issue in this case is whether the maintenance rate of per week applicable to ill crew members is enforceable even though injured crew members are entitled to a rate of per week,where those provisions are part of a cba that contains several other terms governing the working conditions of union crew members.we hold that it is.
federal appellate courts have all but uniformly concluded that maintenance rates specified in a cba will be enforced,regardless of whether they actually cover a crew member daily food and lodging expenses.indeed,in addition to our decision in am,cir,the first,second,fifth,ninth,and eleventh circuits have so held the third circuit decision in barnes andover,cir,stands alone in holding to the contrary.the analysis in gardiner,on which we and our sister circuits have relied,considered the enforceability of maintenance rates in the context of national labor policy.see at.specifically,the ninth circuit noted that such policy is predicated on the assumption that employees bargain most effectively by acting through freely chosen labor organizations.id.consequently,it would not lightly embrace the repudiation of contractual obligations enumerated in a collective bargaining agreement rather,it would choose the rule that w ould promote the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements.id.the court further emphasized that it is clearly the policy of our national labor legislation to encourage both labor and management to negotiate contracts that will effectively regulate every aspect of their complex relationship.id.at.thus,because the parties in that case included a maintenance rate in the cba,t he national labor policy of promoting and encouraging collective bargaining agreements would be unduly compromised were we to conclude that the rate was anything but a consequence of the normal give and take process of collective bargaining therefore,the rate is entitled to the same reliability accorded to other terms and conditions within the same agreement.id.at.
the ninth circuit emphasized that the maintenance rate is but one of many elements contained within the union contract and over which the parties negotiate,and there may be a considerable amount of give and take exercised by the parties in coming to a final agreement on all of the elements.id.consequently,the maintenance rate adequacy should not be examined in isolation by the court because the determination of its adequacy in relation to the whole scheme of benefits has already been made by the union and the seamen who voted for the contract.id.therefore,gardiner held that when a benefits package includes an express reference to a precise rate of maintenance,the adequacy of this rate,considered in isolation,is not a subject for judicial speculation when the rate is part of a total package of wages and benefits resulting from the process of collective bargaining.id.
like many of our sister circuits,we have found gardiner reasoning persuasive,and we have accordingly adopted it.in,the plaintiff crew member who had become ill aboard the defendant ship instituted an action in which he argued that the maintenance paid to him was both insufficient and in conflict with the intent and purpose of the supreme court decisions imposing the maintenance requirement upon shipowners.at.the plaintiff was a member of the seafarers international union,and the union had a cba with the defendant providing that the plaintiff was entitled to maintenance of per day.id.at.
relying heavily on gardiner,we affirmed the district court judgment in favor of the defendant.id.at.we began by noting that the duty to provide maintenance can be modified and defined by contract even if it can not be entirely abrogated.id.at citing gardiner,at.we then adopted gardiner rationale in emphasizing that when a benefits package includes an express reference to a precise rate of maintenance,it must be presumed that this rate was arrived at by negotiation.id.at emphasis added.thus,we reasoned that maintenance rates,like any other benefit that is the ultimate result from give and take collective bargaining between parties,should be binding on them.id.we therefore concluded that the per day rate fixed by the cba was enforceable,as we also noted that c ourts generally have decided that it is more appropriate for the courts to enforce privately negotiated contractual rates of maintenance,rather than engaging in overt legislation of particular dollar figures.id.
provides strong guidance for our conclusion that the district court erred.as set forth above,the cba includes a maintenance rate of per day.therefore,a presumption that the rate was arrived at by negotiation attaches.see,at.skowronek has not rebutted that presumption.indeed,he does not allege that the agreement was not legitimately negotiated,that the cba was unfair as a whole,or that he was not adequately represented by the union.it therefore follows that we must conclude that the maintenance rate specified in the cba was the result of give and take collective bargaining between the parties.see id.consequently,that rate is binding on the parties pursuant to.id.
although courts are not to usurp the collective bargaining process by selecting various portions of a cba with which they do not agree and legislating particular dollar figures,see,this is not to say that a plaintiff crew member can never overcome the presumption of negotiation afforded to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.however,pursuant to,the burden properly rests on the plaintiff to produce evidence that a bona fide negotiation did not take place,that the cba was unfair,or that he was not adequately represented.at see also ammar,at baldassaro,at gardiner,at.skowronek has only presented a portion of the cba showing that different payments apply to injured and ill crew members.this evidence does not permit us to determine the fairness of either the negotiation or the cba,or the adequacy of the union representation of skowronek.as gardiner emphasized,t he adequacy of the maintenance rate should not be examined in isolation by the court because the determination of its adequacy in relation to the whole scheme of benefits has already been made by the union and the seamen who voted for the contract.at.
although the cba here provides a different level of payment for ill and injured crew members,that distinction does not prevent from providing strong persuasive authority.the court below,focusing on that distinction,relied heavily on a decision by another district court that invalidated a provision that discriminate d between sick and injured sailors by withholding payment to sick sailors.vitco joncich,aff,cir.however,that case preceded both and gardiner by several decades,and the second circuit recently concluded that the need for courts to intervene to protect seamen has been substantially lessened.ammar,at.additionally,requiring collective bargaining agreements to contain the same payments for ill and injured crew members contravenes this court recognition that it is not appropriate for courts to engage in overt legislation of particular dollar figures in connection with privately negotiated payments.see,at.
the district court application of vitco to the instant case also runs afoul of gardiner holding that when a benefits package includes an express reference to a precise rate of maintenance,the adequacy of this rate,considered in isolation,is not a subject for judicial speculation when the rate is part of a total package of wages and benefits resulting from the process of collective bargaining.gardiner,at.indeed,to the extent that the cba in the instant case governed the crew members wages,hours,and working conditions in addition to maintenance rates,examining the adequacy of the ill crew members maintenance rate,whether in comparison to that of the injured crew members or otherwise,is inappropriate.the difference between the two rates indicates,if anything,that the parties actually considered and negotiated a departure from the typical rate of per day.see ammar,at.furthermore,invalidating the cba in the instant case because of discrimination would create a rule that allows crew members to bargain for an maintenance rate per,but prevents crew members from increasing benefits for injured crew members absent an attendant increase for ill crew members.such a rule,of course,is contrary to the labor law policy of enforcing freely negotiated contracts,and would consequently undermine gardiner and,by implication.
finally,we note that the district court also erred because vitco is distinguishable from the instant case.indeed,the present dispute,unlike vitco,see.at,does not involve the entire abrogation of the maintenance payment rather,it merely provides a lesser payment to ill crew members injured crew members.this distinguishing feature is critical because this court has emphasized that w hile the duty to provide maintenance payments can not be entirely abrogated,as an implied contractual provision,the right to maintenance can be modified and defined by contract,at see also gardiner,at.
the dissent several arguments in support of its conclusion that the district court should be affirmed fail to provide reason for us to depart from the overwhelming this court and its sister above.first,the dissent asserts that if there were evidence in the record that the ill and injured crew members maintenance payments were actually negotiated,the majority position might follow,yet it refus es to infer actual good faith bargaining and it therefore focuses its scrutiny on the structure of maintenance rates while disregarding all other terms of the cba.dis.op.at.the dissent approach is contrary to this court precedent,and for that reason alone,it must be rejected.see,at w hen a benefits package includes an express reference to a precise rate of maintenance,it must be presumed that this rate was arrived at by negotiation.emphasis added.
but,undeterred by,the dissent continues by incorrectly stating,without authority,that the burden is on the shipowner to present evidence that the maintenance rate was specifically negotiated because there is certainly no justification for making the seaman demonstrate an unfair procedure,as opposed to requiring the shipowner to demonstrate a fair one.dis.op.at.the justification for placing the burden on the seaman,however,is the presence of the maintenance rate in a mutually agreed upon cba that governs the relationship between the shipowner and the seaman.see gardiner,at explaining that courts will not lightly embrace the repudiation of contractual obligations enumerated in a collective bargaining agreement and will choose the rule that will promote their enforcement citation omitted.thus,in the absence of proof offered by the seaman that the cba as a whole is unfair or that this seaman was not adequately represented by the union,the maintenance rate is binding on the parties.baldassaro,at.requiring the shipowner to prove that the individual maintenance rate was specifically negotiated overlooks the fact that the rate is part of a total package of wages and benefits resulting from the process of collective bargaining.gardiner,at.we likewise refuse to countenance a rule requiring the shipowner to prove that a maintenance rate provision in a collective bargaining agreement was specifically negotiated.
several of our sister circuits afford the same presumption of negotiation as in this context.indeed,the ninth circuit specifically rejected the approach that the dissent employs today,as it noted that the plaintiff crew member in that case did not allege that the cba as a whole was unfair or inadequate,which was significant because we do not believe the rate of maintenance specified in the collective bargaining agreement can be examined in isolation.gardiner,at see also ammar,at emphasizing that the plaintiff did not assert that the agreement was not legitimately negotiated,that his interests were not adequately represented,that the agreement as a whole was unfair,that the process was unfair,or that the maintenance provision was not a subject of the negotiation baldassaro,at noting that the plaintiff did not allege that the collective bargaining agreement was unfair as a whole or that he was not adequately represented by the union.just as in those cases,skowronek makes no such allegations.accordingly,the presumption of give and take negotiation attaches,and from that presumption it follows that the specific maintenance rate agreed upon by the parties is binding on them,at.
the dissent also asserts that it is reluctant to give significant weight to the argument that the economic strength of unionized seamen requires the court to acquiesce in the terms of the cba.dis.op.at.in doing so,the dissent questions the premise upon which national labor policy has been built according to the supreme court,namely that by acting through a labor organization freely chosen by the majority,employees have the most effective means of bargaining for improvements in working conditions.see nlrb,d.it also rejects the finding of one of our sister circuits that seamen are a work force with sophisticated leaders who constantly press for better working conditions as well as that circuit conclusion that the need for judicial intervention to protect seamen has been substantially lessened.ammar,at.it therefore follows that by insisting that the courts intervene in privately negotiated cbas to ensure that seamen are economically protected against the hardships that accompany illness or injury,dis.op.at,the dissent rejects the reasoning upon which our decision in and our five sister circuits cited above is based 
as stated above,our precedent,like that of our sister circuits,affords a presumption of negotiation to a rate of maintenance specified in a collective bargaining agreement and recognizes that it is not appropriate for courts to engage in legislation of dollar figures in connection with privately negotiated maintenance rates,at.because skowronek has failed to produce any evidence demonstrating that the cba was not a legitimately negotiated agreement,that his interests were not adequately represented in the negotiation process,or that the agreement as a whole is unfair,he has not rebutted the presumption of negotiation.accordingly,our precedent requires us to give binding effect to the maintenance rate at issue.id.we refuse to examine it in isolation,as it is but one of many terms of the cba.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the decision of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the collective bargaining agreement presently before the court contains an unusual provision that discriminates between ill and injured seamen.this provision is inconsistent with the common law of admiralty,and at odds with the reasons why courts originally developed and protected seamen right to maintenance.the majority disputes none of this.instead,the majority reverses the judgment of the district court,relying almost exclusively on the holdings of am,cir and gardiner service,cir,which it misconstrues.in my view,the record in this case does not provide a sufficient basis for upholding the collective bargaining agreement.i would therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
this question in this case concerns the contours of a shipowner duty to provide maintenance and cure.maintenance and cure is designed to provide a seaman with food and lodging when he becomes sick or injured in the ship service.vaughan atkinson,d.the right to maintenance and cure has ancient origins,and has been universally recognized by maritime nations.see the iroquois.see also great lakes dredge dock.tracing the right of maintenance to the twelfth century laws of oleron.it was recognized in united states jurisprudence in the seminal case of harden gordon,cas.story,and was adopted and defined by the supreme court in the osceola.
maintenance refers to a shipowner obligation to provide a mariner with food and lodging if he becomes injured or falls ill while in service of the ship,while cure alludes to the duty to provide necessary medical care and attention.blainey am,cir.traditionally,the amount of maintenance was measured by reference to value of food and lodging provided to the seaman by the ship.springborn am.commercial barge lines,cir citing calmar taylor.the duty to provide maintenance arises upon the onset of illness or injury,see stevens mcginnis,cir,and continues until the seaman reaches maximum medical recovery.see vaughan,at.the seaman entitlement to maintenance attaches so long as he is in the service of the ship at the time that he is afflicted with injury or illness.farrell united states.if the seaman was answerable to the ship call,the negligence of the seaman is irrelevant,and his claims for maintenance will not be denied except for cases of gross misconduct or insubordination.id.
there exist two classic and interrelated justifications for the right of maintenance the protection of seamen,whose circumstances subject them to unique perils and the promotion of a merchant marine,which is beneficial to the economic of the nation as a whole.vella ford motor,d citing aguilar standard oil of.in the words of justice story,then riding circuit,seamen are generally poor and friendless,and acquire habits of gross indulgence,carelessness,and improvidence.if some provision be not made for them in sickness at the expense of the ship,they must often in foreign ports suffer the accumulated evils of disease,and poverty,and sometimes perish from the want of suitable nourishment.harden,cas.at.by aligning the interest of the seamen in maintaining their health with the economic concerns of the shipowner,the shipowner is induced to watch over the health of the seamen with vigilance and fidelity.id.the shipowner,and the country at large,also stand to gain.maintenance encourages seamen to engage in perilous voyages with more promptitude,and at lower wages,it also diminishes the temptation of pluderage upon the approach of sickness and urges the seamen to encounter hazards in the ship service,from which they might otherwise be disposed to withdraw.id.
the same characteristics of seamen that have caused courts to vouchsafe their right to maintenance have also induced courts to profess that seamen are emphatically the wards of the admiralty and though not technically incapable of entering into a valid contract,they are treated in the same manner,as courts of equity are accustomed to treat young heirs.garrett.quoting harden,cas.at.the supreme court has consistently reiterated and never shied away from this wardship theory.see,chandris,latsis,d vaughan,at.aguilar,at.taylor,at.as stated in vaughan,admiralty courts interpret the duty of maintenance for the benefit and protection of seamen,resolving ambiguities or doubts in their favor.at.
these considerations have undoubtedly influenced the supreme court view that maintenance is something other than a fully alienable right.as justice cardozo explained in cortes baltimore insular line,t he duty to make such provision is imposed by the law itself as one annexed to the employment.contractual it is in the sense that it has its source in a relation which is contractual in origin,but,given the relation,no agreement is competent to abrogate the incident.citation omitted.
the sixth circuit,like the majority of circuits,has modified the common law of maintenance as applied to collective bargaining agreements.in,the court held that while a shipowner duty to provide maintenance can not be entirely abrogated,as an implied contractual provision,the right to maintenance can be modified and defined by contract.at.followed the trail blazed by the ninth circuit in gardiner,which held that a rate of maintenance resulting from the give and take of the collective bargaining process must be enforced according to its terms.at.the reasoning of gardiner has tended to carry the day of the six circuits to consider this issue in gardiner wake,five courts,including the first,second,fifth,sixth and eleventh circuits,have chosen to follow gardiner lead.see ammar united states,cir frederick kirby tankships,cir baldassaro united states,cir,at macedo paul michelle,cir.only the third circuit has adopted the contrary position.barnes andover,cir.under the reasoning of these cases,courts have upheld maintenance payments as low as per day as late as the fact that the rate dates back to the no pretensions that this rate could actually cover food and lodging equivalent to that which a seaman would receive on the ship.see ammar,at.
gardiner view rests on several justifications.first and foremost,this view harmonizes the doctrine of maintenance with the policies underpinning labor law.see gardiner,at.national labor policy has been built on the premise that by pooling their economic strength and acting through a labor organization freely chosen by the majority,the employees of an appropriate unit have the most effective means of bargaining for improvements in wages,hours,and working conditions.nlrb,d.collective bargaining agreements are to cover the whole employment relationship.united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf navigation,d.under this view,maintenance rates are not to be considered as separate and apart from the remainder of the negotiated relationship.instead,the rate of maintenance is recognized to be merely one axis of the agreement between the union and the employer,with the amount of maintenance fixed in tandem with the other terms of the collective bargaining agreement.gardiner,at.intrinsic in this view is the premise that seamen as a whole are better off if they are allowed to exchange the economic protection against illness and injury afforded by the common law of maintenance for other benefits they more strongly desire.see id.noting that the collective bargaining agreement provided for overtime,premium and penalty pay for unpleasant tasks,for very generous vacation allowances,and for such amenities as television sets and feature films,ice cream and fresh baked bread macedo,at a union representing fisherman who,when they are ashore,are at home and not adrift at some foreign port,might recognize this circumstance and prefer to emphasize a different contractual benefit.
a closely related rationale has been offered by the second circuit in ammar.under ammar view,the changed economic circumstances occasioned by the labor movement have rendered the policies of harden obsolete 
the modern reality is that most seamen are no longer friendless rather,they have gained strength through collectivity,and they are a work force with sophisticated leaders who constantly press for better working conditions,pay,and benefits,as well as increased job security.thus,the need for judicial intervention to protect seamen has been substantially lessened.recognizing both the goal of providing protection for injured seamen and the importance of collective bargaining to industrial peace,we conclude that,in light of the reality of modern circumstances,the appropriate accommodation between federal maritime common law and federal common law for the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements is to allow unionized seamen to bargain for rights and privileges they prefer in exchange for limiting the per diem rate of maintenance.
finally,in,this court provided another reason for following gardiner,namely,the institutional limitations of the judiciary.accordingly,c ourts generally have decided that it is more appropriate for the courts to enforce privately negotiated contractual rates of maintenance,rather than engaging in overt legislation of particular dollar figures.at.
the issue in this case is whether the common law of admiralty permits the cba to distinguish between ill and injured seamen when setting the maintenance rate,where there is no indication that the distinction between ill and injured seamen was actually negotiated plaintiff does not argue that the rate of per day would be unenforceable if it resulted from a negotiated collective bargaining agreement that was uniformly applied to all seamen.
few reported decisions have considered the propriety of distinguishing between ill and injured seamen the sole court to directly consider the permissibility of this distinction has found it to violate the common law of admiralty.vitco joncich,aff,cir.vitco involved a provision of a collective bargaining agreement that denied the right of wages for the full period of employment,which is a right that the maritime law attaches to the seaman contract of employment,to ill but not to injured seamen id.at.vitco reasoned that because ill seamen did not receive a corresponding advantage,the historical considerations of maritime law and public policy compelled the court to declare as pro tanto void a collective bargaining agreement that,without quid pro quo,deprives a seaman of wages because of unavoidable illness during the term of his employment.id.at.
the majority claims that the critical distinction between this case and vitco is that vitco involved an entire abrogation of the right to the earnings of the vessel.majority op.at.this distinction is implausible and artificial.under the contract in vitco,ill seamen were paid part,but not all,of their wages for the voyage,in derogation of their admiralty law right to recover their full wages.pac.mail lucas,cir.presumably,the majority reasons that because vitco concerned seamen right to their full wages,any diminution of wages was an entire abrogation of that right.linguistically and logically,this is a perfectly plausible reading of entire abrogat ion in,at.but were this reading correct,the decreased rate of maintenance at issue in would entirely abrogate the right to maintenance,which is the right to comparable conditions to those furnished at sea.taylor,at.clearly,entire abrogation as used in means something other than paying less than the full amount of an obligation imposed by admiralty law.
in any event,vitco makes clear that the discrimination between ill and injured seamen was the primary problem with the collective bargaining agreement in that case.see.at.for the majority distinction between vitco and the instant case to have any force,it would have to be true that the provision in vitco would have been void notwithstanding its discriminatory character.nothing in vitco suggests that it considered this to be the case.
the supreme court has also declined an invitation to distinguish between ill and injured seamen.in aguilar,the seaman was injured when traversing the only available route to the moored ship while on shore leave.at.the shipowner suggested that ill seamen who caught infectious diseases while on shore leave should be entitled to maintenance on account of the problems of proof that would arise in determining when the seaman contracted the disease,while no such problems would arise with injured seamen,to whom maintenance could be denied.the supreme court refused to credit such a difference 
c ases of illness,which are within the reason and policy of the liability,are indistinguishable from cases of injury received without misconduct.the risk of incidence is not less in the one case than in the other.the afflicted seaman is made as helpless and dependent by injury as by illness.his resources for meeting the catastrophe and his employer burden are not greater because he is hurt rather than ill.
the supreme court has been equally unwilling to classify seamen in their entitlement to maintenance in other contexts.in farrell,the supreme court rejected the contention that the amount of maintenance was dependant upon the seaman negligence.at.this conclusion was perfectly consistent with the nature of maintenance,because logically and historically,the duty of maintenance and cure derives from a seaman dependence on the ship,not from his
