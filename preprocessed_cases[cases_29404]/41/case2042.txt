this appeal involves a constitutional challenge under the commerce clause to washington state department of health department certificate of need certificate regulations.in particular,the challenge targets regulations related to scheduled,or elective,percutaneous coronary interventions pcis,which are nonsurgical procedures used to treat coronary heart disease.hospitals without cardiac surgical facilities may perform elective pcis only if they obtain a certificate demonstrating sufficient need in the region to support an annual minimum volume.yakima valley memorial hospital memorial claims the requirement that elective pcis be performed only at hospitals that have a minimum annual volume of procedures lacks a reasonable basis and that its putative benefits,including safety,are outweighed by the burdens it places on interstate commerce,thus violating the dormant commerce clause.we disagree.the impact on interstate commerce,if any,is highly attenuated,and does not outweigh the safety benefits of the regulations.we affirm the district court dismissal of memorial claims at summary judgment.
background 
pci,a nonsurgical procedure used to treat coronary heart disease,includes balloon stenting and angioplasty.the procedure involves removing arterial plaque,thereby clearing out obstructed coronary arteries and ameliorating the effects of heart disease.elective pcis are performed when the patient is stable and no medical emergency requires immediate action.washington law requires healthcare providers to obtain a in order to offer certain facilities and services,including elective pcis.before,only hospitals that had surgical facilities were permitted to perform elective pcis.in,the state legislature directed the department to promulgate elective pci regulations for hospitals that,like memorial,do not otherwise perform cardiac surgery.id.factors to be considered included,among others,access to care,patient safety,and quality outcomes id.
the department worked with health management associates hma,an operator of hospitals,on an independent review of the circumstances under which elective pcis should be allowed in washington at hospitals that do not otherwise provide surgery.the september hma report stated that e lective pci s should not be performed in hospitals without surgery,and recommended limiting approval to program s that serve a community or population with a fully documented pattern of unmet need.the report also recommended that elective pcis should be performed only at hospitals that had a minimum annual volume of procedures,noting that the optimal annual volume was or more.the report recognized,however,that p ublications suggest or recommend minimum volumes ranging from,to even.
after receiving the hma report,the department met with numerous additional stakeholders,who advised the department that hospitals with surgery facilities preferred a pci minimum,while those without facilities favored a pci minimum.the final regulations elected the midpoint between the two positions only hospitals that can demonstrate that they will perform at least pcis annually will receive a certificate permitting them to perform elective pcis.admin.code.the regulations apply statewide and do not single out or target particular facilities.
only one hospital in the yakima valley area has surgery facilities yakima regional medical and cardiac care center regional.regional is a hospital owned by a florida corporation.as a holder of a pci certificate,it performs both elective and emergency pcis.regional requires a prepayment before performing an elective pci,and it will not perform an elective pci without adequate reimbursement.in contrast,memorial is a nonprofit hospital that serves both uninsured and insured residents of yakima valley.unlike regional,memorial would perform an elective pci on an uninsured patient.in,regional performed elective and emergency pcis and memorial performed emergency pcis.
in february,memorial filed an application for a certificate to perform elective pcis.the department denied the application,finding that memorial had not demonstrated a need for a second elective pci program in the relevant planning area.memorial is unlikely to secure a pci certificate until sometime around,when the yakima valley market projected unmet need will exceed procedures.
in its complaint,memorial alleged that the pci regulations are an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of the sherman act,and unreasonably discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the dormant commerce clause and.the district court previously granted the department motion for judgment on the pleadings,and on a prior appeal of that ruling,we upheld the dismissal of the sherman act claims,but reversed and remanded for further proceedings on the constitutional claim.yakima valley mem hosp.state dep t of health yakima i,cir.
on remand,the department moved for summary judgment,arguing that under the dormant commerce clause,memorial could not show that the burden imposed on interstate commerce by the minimum volume standard is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.pike bruce church.we review de novo the district court grant of the department motion.see universal health,thompson,cir.
the commerce clause of article i,of the united states constitution empowers congress to regulate commerce among the several states.courts have long read a negative implication into the clause,termed the dormant commerce clause,that prohibits states from discriminating against interstate commerce.see dep t of revenue of davis.the modern law of what has come to be called the dormant commerce clause is driven by concern about economic protectionism that is,regulatory measures designed to benefit economic interests by burdening competitors.id.at quoting new energy of limbach.
the first inquiry under the dormant commerce clause is whether the law treats and economic interests differently,in which case it it is virtually per se invalid.or.waste,dep t of envtl.quality of state of.the regulations here do not facially discriminate against interests,but instead act evenhandedly,with,at best,only incidental impacts on interstate trade.hughes oklahoma,internal quotation marks omitted.regulations with incidental impacts are analyzed under the balancing test set forth in pike 
where the statute regulates to effectuate a legitimate local public interest,and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental,it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.if a legitimate local purpose is found,then the question becomes one of degree.and the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved,and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.

i.the minimum procedure requirement does not burden interstate commerce 
the pci regulations do not treat and actors differently,nor are they an law that incidentally makes it harder for actors to do business in the state.instead,the practical upshot of the regulations is to restrict one hospital memorial from expanding its pci business,which ends up going to regional,another hospital our prior opinion noted that memorial allegations involved the impact on interstate commerce and directed the district court to apply the pike balancing test,but made no finding about the significance of the alleged burden.yakima i,at the ultimate question of whether the pci regulations survive pike scrutiny is not before us.the district court correctly interpreted our holding and on remand inquired into the downstream impact of the pci regulations on interstate commerce.accepting as true memorial arguments and evidence,the burden on interstate commerce
