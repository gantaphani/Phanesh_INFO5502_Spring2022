william rogers penis was amputated in a series of operations between april and april,at samson community hospital in glasgow,kentucky.rogers sued his doctors who are not parties to this appeal and the hospital for negligent medical treatment and negligent failure to secure his informed consent for the amputation.at trial,the court instructed the jury that certain missing evidence could be presumed to be adverse to the doctors,but did not include the hospital in the missing evidence instruction.likewise,the court instructed the jury that the doctors had a duty to ensure that rogers gave his informed consent for the amputation,but did not include the hospital in that instruction.the jury held the doctors,but not the hospital,liable.on appeal,rogers seeks a new trial in which the jury instructions will apply the missing evidence presumption and informed consent duty to the hospital.for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the jury verdict with respect to the hospital and remand the case for a new trial.
background 
rogers began receiving treatment at the hospital in march of for an abscess in his left groin.during a march,surgical procedure to drain the abscess,gilman peterson found several areas of necrotic tissue and proceeded to debride the dead material.rogers was prescribed the antibiotics rocephin and gentamicin to treat the infection.after the march procedure,peterson sent a sample of the removed tissue to be cultured and tested for sensitivities to antibiotics.the hospital performed the requested tests and reported that one source of the infection,group b streptococcus,was sensitive to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin.rogers argued at trial that the hospital was negligent in failing to make clear in its march report the fact that although group b streptococcus might be sensitive to ciprofloxacin,such sensitivity does not mean that the infection is treatable by ciprofloxacin.
following the allegedly misleading march sensitivity report,rogers treatment with the prior antibiotics ended,and he was placed on ciprofloxacin beginning on or about march.peterson performed a second operation on march to debride necrotic tissue from rogers groin.at this time,rogers was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis,also known as fournier gangrene.this condition is an aggressive,potentially deadly infection that is typically treated with serial debridements of all dead and dying tissue.peterson ordered additional blood work,chest,and a glucose tolerance test.
rogers was discharged from the hospital on march,but he returned to the emergency room on march,seeking treatment for continued drainage and irritation in the groin area.peterson cleaned the affected areas,as he did again on april and.rogers next checked into the emergency room on april,complaining that his penis had swollen to the size of a.can.from this point on,rogers was primarily under the care of peterson partner,milton slocum.slocum ordered rogers to stop taking ciprofloxacin and to instead take unasyn,which is effective to treat group b streptococcus.by then,however,rogers alleged that the infection and swelling was too far along to respond to the proper medication.
from april to april,slocum repeatedly debrided necrotic tissue from rogers penis,ultimately removing the entire organ.all of the tissue debrided in these procedures was discarded rather than sent to the hospital laboratory for testing.rogers alleged that the hospital acquiescence in the disposal of the debrided tissue from the april through april procedures destroyed evidence that would have proved an essential element of rogers the group b streptococcus was still active due to the use of the wrong antibiotic for the days prior to the change to an effective antibiotic,unasyn,on april.
before each of the debridements that occurred between april and april,rogers signed a consent form.although each form mentioned debridement and two specifically mentioned debridement of the penis,none of the consent forms explicitly stated that rogers would lose his entire penis.rogers alleges that he did not understand that his penis was being gradually removed in its entirety because he was in a near constant state of sedation between april and april.by june of,rogers had been cured of his infection,but he had lost his penis and left testicle in the process.
each of rogers surgeries took place at the hospital,as did all of the laboratory tests on his tissue.peterson and slocum are not employees of the hospital,but hospital nurses treated rogers and discussed the consent forms with him before each procedure.rogers alleged at trial that his infection progressed to his penis and required its amputation because peterson prescribed ciprofloxacin,which is ineffective in treating group b streptococcus.furthermore,if the tissue that was debrided from his groin and penis after april and later had been tested microbiologically,the tests might have shown that the group b streptococcus infection was still active at that time.if this was the case,rogers argues,then the hospital misleading march report was a proximate cause of his loss.he contends that the lack of laboratory tests on tissue debrided on april and later was thus missing evidence that prevented him from proving an essential element of his case against the hospital.
rogers,a resident of indiana,brought suit against the doctors and hospital,with jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship pursuant to.the substantive law of kentucky is therefore controlling.erie railroad tompkins.
regarding the liability of the hospital,the court instructed the jury as follows 
instruction it was the duty of samson community hospital,acting through its employees and agents,to exercise toward william rogers that degree of care and skill which is expected of reasonably competent and prudent hospitals acting under circumstances similar to those about which you have heard evidence in this case.if you believe from the evidence that samson community hospital failed to comply with this duty,and that such failure was a substantial factor in causing william rogers injuries,then you will find for the plaintiffs.otherwise,you will find for the defendant,samson community hospital.
the court instructions regarding missing evidence and informed consent read 
instruction microbiological and surgical specimen evidence is missing in this case.if you believe its absence was caused by the unjustified or careless actions or inactions taken by gilman peterson,or milton slocum,then you may infer,but are not required to infer,that such evidence,if available now,would have been favorable to the plaintiffs and been adverse to that defendant.
instruction in addition to the general duties of care owed by a physician in treating his patient,slocum was obligated to provide information that would give a reasonable person under similar circumstances a general understanding of the surgical procedures to be performed and any medically acceptable alternative procedures or treatment.
during its deliberations,the jury submitted a question to the court,asking is title,chapter,of health services and facilities law concerning the duty of hospitals to test tissue removed during surgery to be followed or a guideline for hospitals to follow allowing some discretion on the hospitals part in response,the district court answered that t he law requires all tissues removed by surgery to be submitted to the pathologist for examination.the law allows written policies of the medical staff to provide exceptions to the macroscopic or microscopic examination of such tissue by the pathologist.
on february,the jury returned a verdict finding the two doctors negligent and awarding rogers.the hospital,however,was found not liable,and was subsequently dismissed with prejudice.both the doctors and rogers appealed.following a settlement with the doctors,rogers now pursues his appeal against the hospital.
