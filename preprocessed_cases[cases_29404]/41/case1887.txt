lucas canny canny brought this action against his former employer,bottling group,dr pepper claiming violations of the americans with disabilities act ada,and the iowa civil rights act icra,iowa code chapter.the case proceeded to trial,and a jury found for canny,awarding him compensatory and punitive damages.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the jury liability finding and compensatory damages award,but reverse the punitive damages award.
background 
in october,canny began working as a route driver in the sales department of bottlers,in ottumwa,iowa.shortly thereafter,dr pepper acquired as a route driver,canny drove a,and accordingly,dr pepper required canny to maintain an unrestricted driver license.in july,dr pepper promoted canny to account manager.canny had to accounts and had to drive to the various customer locations to maintain those accounts.in november,dr pepper promoted canny to route supervisor and put him in charge of several route drivers and account managers.as route supervisor,canny responsibilities included driving routes and making deliveries when his route drivers were unavailable.
on march,canny was diagnosed with stargardt disease,a hereditary degenerative eye disease that causes loss of central vision but does not affect peripheral vision.canny had a visual acuity of,rendering him legally blind and unable to qualify for a driver license.the doctor told canny his visual acuity would probably not become any worse,but it could not be treated or corrected.
on march,canny told his supervisor,doug canny doug no relation,and vending manager,tim,about his diagnosis,and that he no longer qualified for a driver license.the three men discussed the possibility of canny continuing in his position as route supervisor by riding with a vending manager on the occasions he needed to fill in for his route drivers.they also talked about transferring canny to another position in the sales department,in the production facility,or in the warehouse.canny told them,i would transfer anywhere to do about anything at any time.i just really was just worried sick.i wanted to stay.doug said he had no authority to create a new position for canny because of dr pepper hiring freeze and they should talk to brenda dixson dixson,dr pepper regional human resources manager.doug and canny told dixson about canny visual impairment and some of the accommodations they had discussed.dixson told them that those options would require a change in head count,and there is no way they could do it.canny then suggested transferring to a position in the production unit or in the warehouse.according to canny,dixson dismissed the suggestion saying,there just no way we can put you out there.you either kill someone or you lose an arm.dixson ended the meeting after about five minutes saying she would file canny medical leave of absence paperwork.dr pepper placed canny on medical leave effective march.
canny continued to contact doug about available positions.doug discussed the situation with dr pepper division manager,randall hall hall.hall told doug not to have any further contact with canny b ecause we did have anything open in ottumwa and to refer any questions that canny had to dixson,because it was past me.dixson never contacted canny about any available positions.
brenda criswell criswell,a rehabilitation counselor from the iowa department for the blind idb,met with canny shortly after his diagnosis.at canny request,criswell stopped by dr pepper ottumwa facility to see dixson.dixson was unavailable.criswell thereafter left several telephone messages for dixson dixson never responded.on march,idb president sent a letter to hall,with a copy to dr pepper ceo,inquiring about possible accommodations for canny.hall forwarded the letter to dixson who responded that driving was an essential function of all positions at the ottumwa facility.
while on medical leave,canny received disability insurance payments along with social security disability benefits.from june to october,canny worked part time as a forklift operator for schwartz beer wholesalers,schwartz.in march,canny worked full time for mahaska bottling company mahaska until its busy season ended in november.although canny expected mahaska to rehire him,mahaska did not.in may,canny went back to work for schwartz two days a week earning per day.after leaving dr pepper,canny got married,he and his wife had a child,and his wife began attending school in ottumwa making it impossible for canny to leave ottumwa for work.
on april,canny filed a lawsuit alleging dr pepper discriminated against him and failed to accommodate him in violation of the ada and the icra.canny requested compensatory damages,lost wages and benefits,and punitive damages.dr pepper moved for summary judgment,which the district court denied on july,finding genuine issues of fact existed regarding whether reassignment to a vacant position was a reasonable accommodation and whether dr pepper made a good faith effort to engage in the interactive process of seeking reasonable accommodations.in response to the district court ruling,dr pepper sent a letter on july,offering canny a merchandiser position at dr pepper des moines facility july offer.dr pepper conditioned the offer on canny finding his own transportation to job sites,as well as a physician confirmation canny could safely operate forklifts and motorized pallet jacks.dr pepper had not previously notified canny of any job vacancies at any of dr pepper other facilities.canny declined the position because of his family circumstances.
the case proceeded to trial on canny failure to accommodate claim and resulted in a verdict for canny.the jury awarded in back pay,in past emotional damages,and in punitive damages.dr pepper renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing insufficient evidence supported the jury verdict and the punitive damages award.in the alternative,dr pepper moved for a new trial,arguing the district court erred by admitting the july offer into evidence and by submitting certain jury instructions.dr pepper also moved for remittitur of the back pay award.canny moved for the award of front pay,attorney fees,and expenses.the district court granted canny motion for attorney fees and expenses,but denied all other motions.on appeal,dr pepper renews all issues raised in its motions with the exception of the jury instruction challenge.
ii.discussion 
judgment as a matter of law 
we review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law,applying the same standard as the district court.ostrander duggan,cir.a judgment as a matter of law is appropriate if a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.a.we grant canny all reasonable inferences and view the facts in the light most favorable to canny.see webner titan,cir.we have long held that where conflicting inferences reasonably can be drawn from evidence,it is the function of the jury to determine what inference shall be drawn.ryther kare,cir en banc internal quotations omitted.we are reluctant to set aside a jury verdict and will not do so lightly.kelly armstrong,cir.
in his complaint,canny alleged claims of disparate treatment and failure to accommodate under the ada and the icra.however,on appeal,dr pepper only raises issues relating to canny failure to accommodate claim.on claims for failure to make reasonable accommodation under the ada,we apply a modified analysis.fenney dakota,cir thus,canny must first make a facial showing that he has an ada disability and that he has suffered adverse employment action.then he must make a facial showing that he is a qualified individual.id.
the ada defines a disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities,a,and defines a qualified individual as an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires,id.canny visual impairment is a disability within the meaning of the ada because it substantially limits canny major life activity of seeing.canny suffered adverse employment action when he lost his job due to his vision disability.dr pepper,however,contends canny failed to prove by sufficient evidence he was a qualified individual under the ada.
qualified individual 
analyzing whether a person is a qualified individual is a process first,we determine whether the individual possesses the requisite skills for the job second,we must determine whether the individual can perform the essential functions of the job,with or without reasonable accommodation.moritz frontier airlines,cir.an essential function means the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires.the term essential functions does not include the marginal functions of the position.id.at quoting n.evidence a function is essential includes the employer judgment as to which functions are essential,a written job description,and the amount of time spent on the job performing the function.n.
dr pepper concedes canny possessed the requisite skills for the merchandiser and warehouse loader positions,but argues the evidence was insufficient to show canny could perform the essential functions of either position and,therefore,canny failed to prove he was a qualified individual under the ada.dr pepper also argues canny did not prove by sufficient evidence dr pepper failed to engage in the interactive process.canny submits dr pepper waived the sufficiency of the evidence argument regarding the warehouse loader position by omitting the issue in its rule a motion for judgment as a matter of law.alternatively,canny asserts the evidence produced at trial was sufficient to show he could perform the essential functions of either position.canny denies he had the burden of showing dr pepper failed to engage in the interactive process,but argues nonetheless ample evidence supports that conclusion.
warehouse loader position 
rule a requires that challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence must be raised initially at the close of the evidence.such challenges must be sufficiently specific so as to apprise the district court of the grounds relied on in support of the motion.conseco fin.servicing am.mortgage,cir citing.a.articulation of the grounds for judgment as a matter of law affords the nonmoving party the opportunity to cure the defects which may preclude the jury from considering his case.id.stating the grounds of the motion with technical precision is not required,as long as the trial court is made aware of the movant position.id.a motion for judgment can be granted only on grounds advanced in the motion.b advisory comm.notes to amendment.adherence to the rule is mandatory.conesco,at.
at the close of canny,dr pepper moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule a stating 
with respect to the warehouse loader,i have to say that there is a dispute,so i do know that the court grant the directed verdict motion with respect to the issue of warehouse loader.
for those reasons we would ask that the court direct a verdict in favor of defendant and against plaintiff on all positions except the warehouse loader position and that the court direct a verdict on that position based on the good faith defense.
we find dr pepper unambiguously excluded the warehouse loader position from its rule a motion,and therefore waived the issue in its rule b motion.
ii essential functions 
the waiver notwithstanding,ample evidence supports the jury finding canny could perform the essential functions of the warehouse loader position.dr pepper disputed canny ability to operate a forklift.canny testified he maintained a forklift license,operated a forklift without any problems while he worked for dr pepper,and continued to do so at other jobs after leaving dr pepper.doug testified canny drove a forklift safely without incident and he had no reason to believe canny could not continue doing so.also testified he saw canny safely operate a forklift.canny testified dr pepper never asked him about his vision limitations or whether he was able to operate a forklift.doug similarly testified forklift certification did not require a vision examination.dixson testified she never asked canny for medical verification of his ability to drive a forklift,but simply concluded if you ha ve been restricted in operating a motor vehicle,i do believe you would be able to operate a forklift.dixson conceded dr pepper had no minimum vision acuity requirement for driving a forklift,but said canny legal blind vision was the entire issue to be considered.dixson testified there were warehouse loader positions available between march and july,but she did not offer them to canny.even if dr pepper had not waived the issue,this evidence is sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude canny could perform the essential functions of a warehouse loader position.
merchandiser position 
dr pepper argues the employer determines the essential functions of a job,and the merchandiser position requires the ability to drive.canny argues dr pepper july offer demonstrates driving was not an essential function.we agree with canny.
although the ada does not require an employer to reallocate the essential functions of a job,restructuring marginal job functions is a reasonable accommodation.benson northwest airlines,cir.canny testified merchandisers used pallet jacks and forklifts,but did not drive trucks or operate motorized equipment.dixson testified merchandisers usually drove between customer locations and dr pepper always considered driving an essential function of a merchandiser position.dr pepper paid merchandisers for their travel time between customer locations.dixson conceded dr pepper july offer demonstrated canny could have arranged his own transportation between customer locations.dixson also admitted there were open merchandiser positions in iowa after march,and before dr pepper offered canny the position on july.this testimony provided sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude canny could perform the essential functions of available merchandiser positions.
interactive process 
dr pepper asserts canny did not prove by sufficient evidence dr pepper failed to participate in the interactive process to determine reasonable accommodations.under the ada,an employer must engage in an interactive process to identify potential accommodations that could overcome the employee limitations.burchett target,cir.t he failure of an employer to engage in an interactive process to determine whether reasonable accommodations are possible is prima facie evidence that the employer may be acting in bad faith.cravens blue cross blue shield of kansas city,cir quoting fjellestad pizza hut of,cir.to establish dr pepper failed to engage in an interactive process,canny must show he was disabled,he requested accommodations,dr pepper did not assist him in seeking accommodations,and he could have been reasonably accommodated but for dr pepper lack of good faith.see cravens,at citing fjellestad,at.
applying this analysis in the present case,canny presented a submissible case for the jury.first,there is no question canny is disabled and requested accommodations.second,although dr pepper argues canny discussions with doug and,as well as doug multiple efforts to assist canny are evidence of its good faith efforts,we disagree.dr pepper admitted doug had no authority to offer canny a position.furthermore,hall told doug to discontinue discussing accommodations with canny and to refer canny questions to dixson.third,dixson and hall both testified that after march,they did not contact canny regarding available positions or possible job accommodations.dixson also admitted she never investigated canny abilities which was a step that dr pepper could have taken to avoid some of what we going through here today,she never sent canny for a physician evaluation because we did not feel that it was necessary to do more,she never contacted the production manager at the ottumwa facility about available positions for canny,she knew of canny willingness to go to any dr pepper facility to stay e
