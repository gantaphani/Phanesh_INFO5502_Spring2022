resident is an obese woman who required assistance for bed mobility.inasmuch as she was frequently incontinent,her plan of care required the facility to employ reasonable hygienic observations,as well as appropriate changes of clothing and bed linens,every two hours.this dependency and incontinence placed her at additional risk for pressure sores and other forms of skin impairment.during the morning of april,an odh surveyor found that she had developed a pressure sore on her right buttock.in addition,it was also noted that this resident was fed breakfast while her buttocks were moist with urine in a soiled bed.neither the resident state of cleanliness nor the conditions relating to her bed linen were changed for nearly a period after breakfast.

an hearing,a hearing at which witnesses are called and testify is not the only vehicle for the judge to hear and decide the case.if,after giving the parties the opportunity to present their views,the judge determines that there are no genuine issues of material fact,the judge might decide the case based on the undisputed facts and the applicable law.
