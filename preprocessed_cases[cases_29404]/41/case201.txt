on behalf of herself,her husband,and their conjugal partnership,nereida,a psychiatrist formerly employed by the department of veterans affairs the department,brought suit in the district court,alleging that the department had failed to accommodate her disability,as required by the rehabilitation act.the case went to trial,and a jury found for the department.now appeals the district court denial of her motion for a new trial.we affirm.
we review the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.whitfield,cir.worked at the department san juan medical center from until.her tenure at the hospital was uneventful until,when the university of puerto rico medical school stopped sending psychiatry residents to work at the medical center.in november,the department reached an agreement with union,pursuant to which senior physicians would be required to perform the tasks formerly delegated to residents.under the agreement,a staff psychiatrist would be available for patient care at all times.consequently,would be required to work one night or weekend shift a month,and occasionally about once a month to see patients at their bedsides.previously,she had worked only tuesday through friday and had seen patients only in her office.expressed her union steward and to officials in washington the new arrangement.
after her complaints failed to produce results,wrote a letter to the medical center human resources staff,explaining that she suffered from arthritis and had difficulty walking,and requesting a reasonable accommodation under the ada for a qualified person with a disability.the department sought medical certification of condition.rheumatologist,rafael,produced first a diagnostic impression,and later a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis,among other conditions.when the department asked him to clarify how medical condition affected her,opined that she was unable to cover the different areas as required in her new responsibilities.declined the department request for more specific information about limitations.
on the basis of diagnosis,the department offered to provide a motorized wheelchair to use when,on occasion,she had to travel around the hospital.she refused to be so accommodated,averring that she was not crippled or otherwise in need of a wheelchair and did not want to appear disabled to her patients and colleagues.she requested,instead,that she be allowed to see all of her patients in her office,during her customary working hours.
refused to come to work during her negotiations with the hospital because,she said,she felt harassed.she asked at least twice for leave.the department granted her two weeks of sick leave but denied her request for a longer term of unpaid leave.the department offered an opportunity to return to work.instead,she resigned her position at the hospital.
her husband,and their conjugal partnership then brought suit under the rehabilitation act,alleging that the department had failed reasonably to accommodate her disability,and that her supervisors had treated her in an aggressive and hostile manner in retaliation for her request for accommodation.the plaintiffs complained of lost income,emotional distress,and loss of consortium.
the district court granted summary judgment on the claims brought by hill and the conjugal partnership,after concluding that their claims were not cognizable under the rehabilitation act the district court rejected the department motion for summary judgment as to.the case went to trial,focused on whether the department had denied a reasonable accommodation for a disability.attempted to prove that she was disabled by rheumatoid arthritis and that the department offer to provide her a motorized wheelchair did not constitute a reasonable accommodation for her disability.the department sought to convince the jury that actually was not disabled,and that if she was,the department offer to provide her a motorized wheelchair was a reasonable accommodation.also contended that the department took adverse employment action against her in retaliation for her disability discrimination complaint.the department denied that allegation as well.
on the reasonable accommodation issue,both sides presented rheumatologists,who gave conflicting opinions as to whether was disabled.relied on testimony from,from whom she had sought treatment testified that may have suffered from rheumatoid arthritis,but that he could not so conclude for certain.although he recalled that had complained of pain in her joints,he admitted that his records did not contain any reference to a complaint by that she was having difficulty walking.however,reaffirmed his judgment,first expressed in letters to the department around the time of request for an accommodation,that she was capable only of limited ambulation.he agreed that a motorized wheelchair would have aided.
ramad√©s,testifying for the department,opined that there was nothing to suggest that had rheumatoid arthritis at the time she made her complaints.testified that he had performed four physical examinations of and inspected her medical records.in his view,she did not have much of a difficulty in walking.indeed,he said,he had found no evidence that was disabled at all in her history and from what was seen on the available record.testified that he had no opinion regarding the suitability of a motorized wheelchair as an accommodation for a disabled psychiatrist.
twice asked the district court to limit the impact of testimony.though she had not challenged qualifications before trial as the district court required,objected to the admission of his testimony at trial on the ground that his report and testimony did not meet the standards for expert evidence imposed by daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,and.the district court admitted the testimony over the objection.also asked the district court to augment its charge to the jury taken from written proposed instructions with an additional instruction that testimony should not be considered on the question of reasonable accommodation.the district court declined this request as well.
on the retaliation issue,sought to prove that her supervisors had reacted to her complaints about the new union agreement by subjecting her to harassment,by requiring her to comply with unnecessary bureaucratic requests,and by denying her leave.she pointed particularly to two interactions with her supervisor,luis iguina.one concerned a veteran who was patient.iguina complained to that,despite the patient urgent need for psychiatric services,had cancelled three of her appointments,resulting in a delay that iguina feared could verge on patient abuse.averred that the patient was difficult and that she would need support from other professionals to care for the patient.iguina arranged for such support.contended at trial that iguina reference to patient abuse helped create a hostile working environment.on another occasion,iguina said something to the effect that women are always complaining about their illnesses,a remark that contended was harassment.
also argued that the department created a hostile work environment and prompted her resignation by asking repeatedly for more specific medical documentation about her disability,and that the department retaliated against her by refusing to grant all of her requests for leave.
after the jury returned a verdict for the defendant,moved for a new trial.she argued that the court should not have allowed the department medical expert to testify,and should have given the limiting instruction she had requested.additionally,she contended that the jury verdict was against the weight of the evidence.the district court rejected both arguments in a written order,et principi,et,cv.sec,and this appeal followed.
enumerates ten issues for review.these fall into three is her contention that should not have been allowed to testify,two are arguments that the judge should have given a limiting instruction as to that doctor testimony,and seven are objections to the jury view of the evidence.we address first the issues relating to and second the arguments about the sufficiency of the evidence.
defense expert testimony 
admission of testimony and report 
argues that,pursuant to daubert and rule,the district court should have refused to admit testimony as evidence.the district court denied motion both because it was.waited until the moments before testimony to object,even though she had received the doctor report five months because report and proposed testimony met the applicable standard.the district court was correct on both grounds.
parties have an obligation to object to an expert testimony in a timely fashion,so that the expert proposed testimony can be evaluated with care.did not make a timely motion here and has not offered any reason for her delay.the district court was on firm ground in refusing her motion as untimely.see alfred caterpillar,cir explaining that because daubert generally contemplates a gatekeeping function,not a gotcha junction,untimely daubert motions should be considered only in rare circumstances see also club car,club car quebec import,cir a daubert objection not raised before trial may be rejected as untimely.
in any case,daubert motion lacked merit.argues that testimony should have been excluded because opinion differed from that of treating physician,a very well respected and beloved rheumatologist,and because report did not cite medical authorities and w as based on experience and general knowledge.the mere fact that two experts disagree is not grounds for excluding one testimony.even if we were to assume that was somehow more qualified than there is no reason in the record for us to do district court could not have excluded testimony on that ground alone.see holbrook lykes,cir w itnesses may be competent to testify as experts even though they may not,in the court eyes,be the best qualified.who is best qualified is a matter of weight upon which reasonable jurors may disagree.
we also reject assertion that testimony did not meet the standard of daubert and rule because the doctor failed to support his diagnosis with citations to published authorities.as the district court noted,the underlying medical medical condition prevented her from walking around the not a complex medical situation.testimony and report did not involve novel medical theories.the doctor was called upon only to offer a routine diagnosis,on a patient he had examined,pertaining to a common condition well within his particular expertise.in this case,the doctor training and experience placed his report and testimony well above the rule bar.indeed,even in more complicated cases when an examining physician calls upon training and experience to offer a differential diagnosis a determination of which of two or more diseases,presenting with similar symptoms,has caused a patient ailments,most courts have found no daubert problem.see,bitler smith,cir collecting cases holding that qualified doctor differential diagnosis of patient was sufficiently reliable for rule and daubert purposes mattis carlon products,cir a medical opinion based upon a proper differential diagnosis is sufficiently reliable to satisfy daubert.
limiting instruction 
argues that the district court should have instructed the jury that testimony should only be considered on the question of whether was disabled,not on the issue of reasonable accommodation.the district court denied the motion both because it was had not requested the instruction in her written proposed jury instructions,which the court had because it was unnecessary.again,the district court ruled correctly.
the instruction requested was plainly unnecessary.the district court noted,and the transcript confirms,that t he witness was crystal clear that he had no opinion regarding the reasonableness of a motorized wheelchair as an accommodation for a person with rheumatoid arthritis.as the district court concluded,the jury ha d that message.the district court did not err in refusing to offer an unnecessary instruction about the scope of testimony.see,elliott warren,cir finding no error in district court refusal to give requested instruction that was unnecessary to explain the applicable law to the jury.
sufficiency of the evidence 
we will reverse the district court refusal to order a new trial on the ground of insufficient evidence only where the jury verdict was so clearly against the weight of the evidence as to constitute a manifest miscarriage of justice.wagenmann adams,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this is not such a case.
reasonable accommodation 
to succeed on her rehabilitation act reasonable accommodation claim had to convince the jury 
that she suffered from a disability within the meaning of the statute that she was a qualified individual in that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job,either with or without a reasonable accommodation and that,despite her employer knowledge of her disability,the employer did not offer a reasonable accommodation for the disability.
at.the jury could have rejected case either because was not disabled or because the department had offered a reasonable accommodation in the form of a motorized wheelchair.the department agreed that possessed the qualifications for her job.because we have focused on the dueling expert testimony on whether was disabled,we will review the sufficiency of the evidence on that issue.
a qualified expert,gave compelling testimony that did not actually have rheumatoid arthritis.he also testified that the plaintiff had little difficulty walking.moreover,contrary testimony was not emphatic.he revealed that lab tests were negative for rheumatoid arthritis and that had no swelling in her joints.admitted that he had examined only four times over the period leading up to her complaint.he indicated that he had no knowledge of how far would have been required to walk at her job and that he was not familiar with the layout of the medical center.on this evidence the jury could reject claim that she was disabled.
retaliation 
this leaves only argument that the department retaliated against her for her disability discrimination complaint,a claim she is entitled to press even though the jury reasonably rejected her case on outright discrimination.see soileau guilford of maine,cir recognizing that retaliation claim may succeed even where disability discrimination claim fails.to make out a case for retaliation,a plaintiff must show that i she undertook protected conduct,ii she suffered an adverse employment action,and iii the two were causally linked.noviello city of boston,cir see also weber cranston sch,cir holding that rehabilitation act prohibits retaliation.at trial,argued that she suffered an adverse employment action through the creation of a hostile work environment and a constructive termination.to prove that a hostile work environment constituted adverse employment action,the plaintiff must show that the harassment she complains of was so severe or pervasive that it alters the conditions of the plaintiff employment.marrero goya of puerto rico,cir.similarly,to establish a constructive discharge,a plaintiff must show that her working conditions were so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in her shoes would have felt compelled to resign,an objective standard that can not be triggered solely by the employee subjective beliefs,no matter how sincerely held.id.at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.the question whether a work environment is sufficiently hostile to create liability is best left to a jury.che.bay trans,cir.
here,the evidence allowed the jury to find that treatment by the department was not objectively intolerable.marrero,at.on the record,the jury could have found that iguina concerns about the treatment of the female veteran were properly expressed and unobjectionable.and the jury could have found,after listening to testimony on the point,that iguina remark about women complaining a lot and any other isolated comments from her peers did not constitute severe or pervasive harassment,or a course of conduct that would have led a reasonable person to resign.
as for the department insistence that provide medical documentation supporting her insistence that she could not walk around the hospital,the jury could have found,in reliance on the evidence,that t
