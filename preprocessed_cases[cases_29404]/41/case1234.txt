tina and norman field,appeal the district court denial of their motion for a new trial after a jury returned a verdict in favor of,william anderson,following a trial for medical malpractice in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.plaintiffs contend that they are entitled to a new trial because the district court improperly admitted prejudicial hearsay evidence when it permitted anderson to testify about the statements made by two unnamed,undisclosed physicians with whom he allegedly consulted concerning tina field medical care.
because the statements of the two unknown physicians were classic hearsay and do not fall into any of the hearsay exceptions contained in the federal rules of evidence,and because the statements admission was highly prejudicial and more than mere harmless error,we vacate the jury verdict and remand the case to the district court for a new trial.
background 
factual background 
at approximately on september,tina field sought treatment at the trigg county hospital emergency room,in cadiz,kentucky,immediately after being bitten twice in her right foot by a copperhead snake,william anderson,was the physician on call when field arrived at the hospital.anderson is a family practitioner with a solo practice,but he also works shifts at the trigg county hospital emergency room.upon learning that a snake bite victim was coming to the emergency room,anderson reviewed the emergency room textbook concerning the treatment of snake bites and called a hospital in murray,kentucky,to have antivenin delivered to trigg county hospital.the antivenin arrived shortly after tina field checked into the emergency room.anderson had experience with only one venomous snake bite prior to treating tina field injury,and he had no experience administering antivenin.
when she arrived at the emergency room,tina field reported that she felt sick to her stomach,faint,dizzy,and numb,and anderson noted significant swelling in her right foot and that the foot was warm.anderson determined that field had a wet copperhead snake bite,which meant that there had been envenomation.his plan was to monitor her,administer intravenous fluids and a tetanus shot,and look for any progression of the bite severity.anderson checked on field periodically during the night,but did not give her any antivenin.when anderson next saw her,at on september,field had swelling above her right knee,and her right foot was becoming cold and had a bluish color to it.
at on september,field complained of pain in her right big toe and coldness in her right foot.at this point,nurse stephen checked field right foot for a pulse,but did not feel one.as a result,called anderson.at no time after did tina field have a pulse in her right foot.
three hours later,at,anderson made his first call for assistance.he phoned an attending emergency room physician at the vanderbilt university medical center,who then referred him to a vanderbilt toxicologist.the vanderbilt physicians were never deposed and they never testified at trial.indeed,their identities,names,and credentials remain completely unknown.nevertheless,anderson was permitted to testify at trial that he telephoned these individuals and gave them a patient history and condition assessment of tina field however,there was no evidence that anderson told the vanderbilt physicians that tina field lacked a pulse in her right foot.moreover,anderson was permitted to plaintiffs to what the vanderbilt physicians said over the telephone.according to anderson,the vanderbilt emergency room physician and toxicologist told him that he was doing everything appropriately,that they would be doing the same thing and that the main treatment is to elevate and monitor the leg.anderson testimony concerning the vanderbilt physicians alleged statements is the crux of this appeal and will be discussed in more detail below.
tina field remained in the trigg county hospital,under the care of anderson,through september.on that date,despite field foot remaining cool and without a pulse,anderson believed the snake bite was improving,discharged field from the hospital,and instructed her to keep her right leg elevated and to return for an appointment two days later.at the september checkup,field foot was still cool and there was still no pulse in her right foot.
the fields were growing more concerned about field condition and so,on september,they sought treatment at the blanchfield army hospital emergency room in fort campbell,kentucky.field was entitled to medical care at the military hospital pursuant to benefits received by her husband,who is retired from the united states army.tina field stayed at blanchfield until september,when she was transported by a medical helicopter to air force base in dayton,ohio.upon her arrival at,field treating physician,christopher spieles,knew that field was in need of some sort of amputation.in an effort to lessen the amount of amputation,field underwent hyperbaric are designed to deliver large amounts of oxygen to body an attempt to revive the tissue in her right foot.unfortunately,these treatments did not improve her condition.as a result,field right foot was surgically amputated on october.during the surgery,spieles observed that the condition of field leg tissue was such that a second surgery would be necessary.accordingly,on october,field underwent a leg amputation.she subsequently required two additional surgeries to modify the stump in order to accommodate a prosthetic device.
procedural history 
the fields filed this diversity action against trigg county hospital and anderson on february,alleging malpractice and negligence.the hospital settled with the fields prior to trial and was dismissed as a defendant.a jury trial concerning the claims against anderson commenced on march,and lasted four days.at issue was whether anderson breached the standard of care for treating a copperhead snake bite.plaintiffs alleged that anderson was inexperienced in treating venomous snake bites and that tina field should have been transferred to physicians and facilities more capable of treating her serious injury.
each side presented three expert medical witnesses concerning the standard of care administered by anderson.in addition,as explained above,anderson testified that on september,he telephoned the vanderbilt university medical center to seek advice concerning how to treat tina field snake bite.at this point in the trial,anderson attorney halted anderson direct examination to consult with the trial judge about the proper scope of the testimony he could elicit from is,whether anderson could relay to the jury what the vanderbilt physicians told him on the telephone.
at a hearing outside the presence of the jury,the trial judge stated that he would permit anderson to testify as to the vanderbilt physicians statements.it is difficult to discern the rationale used by the district court to admit the testimony and,at is evident from the hearing transcript excerpted rationale appears somewhat contradictory.the judge seems to have ruled that the testimony was admissible under the hearsay exception in,which permits statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment to be admitted for the truth of the matter asserted.in its order denying plaintiffs motion for a new trial,the district court again appears to have relied on.to justify the statements admission.subsequently,this is what leads us to find the district court rationale somewhat court instructed the jury that the statements were not to be considered for their truth that is,that anderson was administering proper care.the fields attorney objected on the grounds that the testimony was classic hearsay,that it did not fall under the.exception,and that vanderbilt physicians statements constituted expert opinions,which,if admitted,would go wholly unchallenged because the physicians could not be.
following is the colloquy among the parties and the the presence of the which time the court announced its somewhat confusing ruling that it would allow anderson to testify as to the vanderbilt physicians statements 
the court well,there a lot,i mean that fits into the,into the rule,but i think
