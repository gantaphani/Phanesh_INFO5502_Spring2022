appellant patricia dodson seeks control over the fate of eighteen cryogenically frozen embryos,which she created with her through the fertilization ivf program at the university of arkansas for medical sciences uams.dodson brought this action,alleging that uams refusal to allow her control over the disposition of the embryos violates her constitutional rights and breaches an implied contract.the district dismissed the complaint because subject matter jurisdiction was lacking pursuant to the doctrine.we affirm.
background 
in,patricia dodson formerly patricia lay and her,jackson lay,participated in the ivf program at uams with the goal of creating an embryo to be implanted into dodson.when they enrolled in the ivf program,dodson and lay signed a document called a control and disposition of embryos statement the disposition statement.the disposition statement governed the ivf program responsibility for custody of dodson ova,lay sperm,and any resulting embryos.moreover,uams acknowledged that dodson and lay would control and direct the disposition of the tissues.at any time prior to implantation in dodson uterus,the couple or the surviving single spouse could direct that the tissues be destroyed,used for medical research,or transferred to the custody of another physician or facility.finally,in the disposition statement,dodson and lay agreed that in the event of dissolution of their marriage by court order,all control and direction of their tissues will be relinquished to the medical director of the ivf program the ivf program director.through the ivf program,the couple produced eighteen embryos,which were cryogenically frozen and stored at uams.
dodson and lay divorced in.the chancery court of hot springs county,arkansas entered a divorce decree,which incorporated a property settlement agreement.in paragraph seven of the property settlement agreement,dodson and lay acknowledged and reaffirmed the terms of the disposition statement.furthermore,they agreed that dodson shall have the right to choose from available options,if any,for disposition as listed in the disposition statement.
in,dodson asked uams to implant the embryos into her.however,uams would not comply with her request unless she obtained explicit written consent from lay.lay authorized uams to either destroy the embryos,use the embryos for medical research,or allow the embryos to be legally adopted by another married couple in connection with the ivf program.lay consented to dodson choosing among those three options,but he refused consent for implantation into dodson.in response,dodson requested the hot springs county chancery court to order that lay,through the divorce decree,had consented to whatever procedure dodson negotiated with uams,including implantation into herself.jackson lay patricia dodson,no,dodson i.the court denied relief,finding that lay only consented to those options listed in the disposition statement.next,the chancery court found under the terms of the disposition statement,all control and direction of the tissues was relinquished to the ivf program director upon the dissolution of the marriage by court order.uams was not a party in dodson i,and the chancery court noted that it was not called upon to interpret the third party contract.
subsequently,the ivf program director allowed dodson days to elect one of the three options available under the disposition statement destruction,medical research,or by another couple.in january,dodson sued uams,the uams chancellor,and the ivf program director in the chancery court for pulaski county,arkansas.patricia dodson uams et,no.ij,dodson ii.dodson later substituted the uams board of trustees for the chancellor and director.according to the chancery court opinion,dodson sought the following relief 
a declaratory judgment that her consented or relinquished his right to consent or object to the implantation of certain embryos into dodson,she fulfilled her obligation under the agreement with uams,and,uams must fulfill its obligation to implant the embryos into her.plaintiff also sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction prohibiting uams from disposing of or injuring the embryos until a final hearing on the merits.
the defendants in dodson ii asserted state law sovereign immunity as a defense.dodson argued that sovereign immunity did not apply because she sought to enjoin arbitrary,capricious,and ultra vires actions of state officials.the court dismissed dodson claim with prejudice.first,the court construed the complaint as requesting,and therefore her claim was not cognizable.second,the court held that,even if construed as a request for injunctive relief,dodson claim failed as a matter of law because uams actions were reasonable,sound,and within their authority.the court explained 
finally,considering the evidence in the light most favorable to dodson,the court can not conclude that defendants actions are arbitrary or ultra vires.to the contrary,dodson and lay authorized the medical director of the ivf program to take control of the embryos in the event the couple divorced.the medical director has full authority to decide how to dispose of the embryos.he has been more than reasonable in allowing dodson to choose which of the three previously options should be selected.it was reasonable for him to ask dodson to get her consent to become the biological father to a child born to his more than two years after they divorced.
dodson appealed the chancery court ruling.the arkansas supreme court dismissed her appeal in december for failure to order a transcript of the chancery court proceedings.
notwithstanding the court orders in dodson i and dodson ii,uams continued to send bills to dodson for embryo storage fees due to an apparent clerical mistake.in total,dodson paid the storage fees on a monthly or quarterly basis for nearly eleven years after her divorce from lay and for over six years after the pulaski county chancery court found that she had no right to control the disposition of the embryos.then,in february,uams notified dodson that it was closing the embryo cryopreservation program and that it would transfer the embryos to another facility.in march,uams sent dodson a consent form required for uams to ship the frozen embryos elsewhere.dodson requested uams allow her to decide the fate of the embryos.uams informed her that the ivf program director retained sole authority over the embryos and that uams was not bound to honor her requests.
in october,dodson filed this action in federal district court against uams through the board of trustees for the university of arkansas system,the uams president,the uams chancellor,the trustees individually,and lay in count i,dodson alleges a claim under for violations of her rights under the fourth,fifth,ninth,and fourteenth amendments to the constitution and amendment to the arkansas state constitution.count ii is a cause of action,alleging that uams breached an implied contract based upon dodson payment of storage fees for the embryos.dodson requested injunctive relief to prevent uams from interfering with her right to control the potential life and the disposition of the embryos simultaneously,dodson moved for a temporary restraining order to prevent uams from jeopardizing the safety of the embryos.that request was denied as moot after uams agreed to maintain the embryos in their current condition pending the resolution of this litigation.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to rules b and h for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and pursuant to rule b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.lay also sought dismissal because the requested relief would force him to become a biological father against his will,violating his alleged right to procreative autonomy.the district court granted the motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the doctrine.in support,the district court found the complaint inextricably intertwined with previous proceedings because dodson claims could succeed only upon a finding that the state courts wrongly decided the issues.
in this appeal,dodson argues that the doctrine is inapplicable because the dodson ii was decided on the basis of sovereign immunity,a jurisdictional bar under arkansas law.in addition,dodson contends that is inapplicable because she does not seek to overturn a state court decision.appellees maintain that dismissal under was proper,and alternatively,that dodson claims are barred due to res judicata,collateral estoppel,the eleventh amendment,and failure to plead a right that can be vindicated under.
ii.subject matter jurisdiction 
the basic theory of the doctrine is that only the united states supreme court has been given jurisdiction to review a decision,so federal district courts generally lack jurisdiction over attempted appeals from a judgment.friends of lake view sch.dist.beebe,cir quoting charles wright,arthur miller and edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at,ed.the doctrine is narrow.id.the doctrine is confined to cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced.id.quoting exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d.
this court has expressly cautioned against a state court loser seeking victory against his adversary in a subsequent action in federal court.
litigants can choose whether to pursue claims in state or federal court.charchenko city of stillwater,cir.once a party has litigated in state court,however,he can not circumvent by recasting his or her lawsuit as a section action.bechtold city of rosemount,cir.in other words,if a litigant has raised and lost claims in state court,he may not recast those claims under section and try again.he must follow the appellate procedure through the state courts and seek review before the supreme court.see rooker fid.trust.
prince.bd.exam rs in,cir.
we affirm the dismissal of count i because dodson is a loser complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced.friends of lake view,at.although the precise context of the hot springs chancery court ruling in dodson i is unclear from the record before us,it is undisputed the hot springs chancery court specifically found as follows under the terms of the disposition statement,upon the dissolution of the marriage by court order,all control and direction of the tissues as of january,was relinquished to the the ivf program director.any ruling in the case at bar in dodson favor,that the federal constitution demands the return of the embryos to dodson,would wholly undermine this part of the hot springs chancery court ruling in dodson 
in dodson ii,the pulaski chancery court determined the ivf program director had the right to dispose of the embryos.even if that determination were technically obiter dictum,it was not a stray remark on an issue not presented to it.stemler florence,cir holding did not preclude a federal lawsuit,where state court only discussed related claim,which was not an issue that was salient to the state court,in dicta.this is not a case in which the state court simply held it lacked jurisdiction and dismissed the plaintiff case without prejudice.rather,the state court discussed the merits of dodson case extensively and dismissed dodson ii with prejudice 
nothing in the foregoing analysis applies to count ii.all of the conduct alleged in count ii occurred after dodson i and ii and,therefore,the doctrine is inapplicable as to count ii.see exxon,at.stressing the doctrine is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.neither the hot springs chancery court nor the pulaski chancery court considered dodson allegations that the defendants continued to bill her for storage of the embryos,accepted payment therefor,and made statements to her in which defendants indicated dodson had the right to dispose of the embryos.
with count i properly dismissed,there are no federal claims in this case and jurisdiction under abates.the supreme court has recognized that,in the usual case in which all claims are eliminated before trial,the balance of factors to be considered under the pendent jurisdiction economy,convenience,fairness,and point toward declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining claims.cohill,d.while this rule is not inflexible,grain land coop kar kim farms,cir,it is difficult to say the district court expended such a substantial amount of time and resources on dodson case to warrant retention of count ii in federal court.murray,cir noting substantial investment of the district court time and resources may justify continued exercise of supplementary jurisdiction.we remand for the dismissal of count ii without prejudice.
iii.conclusion 
we affirm the district court dismissal of count i under the doctrine.we remand for dismissal of count ii without prejudice.
while i agree the dismissal of count i should be affirmed,i believe the district court reliance on was misplaced because dodson alleges injuries caused by injuries caused by a judgment.i would affirm the district court judgment with regard to count i under the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.i concur in the majority remand as to count ii.
subject matter jurisdiction 
it is well established that lower federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over straightforward appeals from a judgment even though they may otherwise be empowered to adjudicate the dispute such appellate jurisdiction rests solely with the supreme court.court of appeals feldman,d holding that the federal district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review plaintiffs complaint to the extent they sought review of the district of columbia court of appeals denial of their petitions rooker fid.trust.affirming dismissal of federal suit to have judgment declared null and void.indirect appeals from judgments have been more controversial,however.in feldman,the supreme court noted that federal district courts are prohibited from reviewing claims that are inextricably intertwined with a final judgment.at.four years later,justice marshall elaborated 
t he federal claim is inextricably intertwined with the judgment if the federal claim succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it.where federal relief can only be predicated upon a conviction that the state court was wrong,it is difficult to conceive the federal proceeding as,in substance,anything other than a prohibited appeal of the judgment.
pennzoil texaco,d marshall,concurring.several lower federal courts relied on justice marshall approach to expand,holding that federal claims were barred because they were inextricably intertwined with judgments indeed,tripped up plaintiffs in our circuit even though they did not seek relief from a judgment and their claims were not identical to claims asserted in state court.see,prince.bd.exam rs in,cir quoted ante at ace const.city of louis,cir holding that the plaintiff due process challenge to a city ordinance was barred because it was inextricably intertwined with a ruling that plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the ordinance lemonds louis county,cir explaining that bars indirect attempts by federal plaintiffs to undermine state court decisions quoting justice marshall concurrence to affirm dismissal of plaintiff creative attempts to reclothe the failed due process claim in new constitutional garb.
then,in exxon mobil saudi basic industries,d,the supreme court clarified the limited circumstances in which bars subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.in its introductory remarks,the unanimous court noted that the doctrine,which was v ariously interpreted in the lower courts,has sometimes been construed to extend far beyond the contours of the rooker and feldman cases.id.at.the court held that is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.id.at.applied to the complaint in exxon,the court held that does not bar jurisdiction over an action brought by a defendant against the plaintiff before the state court entered judgment.id.at.if the state court were to decide the case while the federal lawsuit is pending,the court explained,then preclusion govern the disposition of the federal action.id.at.subject matter jurisdiction is proper even if a party attempts to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court.id.
eleven months later,in lance dennis,d per curiam,the court held that jurisdiction is not barred merely because the plaintiffs were in privity with a party to a prior case.the court rejected the privity theory because it erroneously conflate s preclusion law with.id.at.is not simply preclusion by another name.id.instead,as a narrow doctrine that applies only where a party in effect seeks to take an appeal of an unfavorable decision to a lower federal court.id.at.a more expansive rule,which would incorporate preclusion principles,risks turning that limited doctrine into a uniform federal rule governing the preclusive effect of judgments,contrary to the full faith and credit act.id.at.
we have generally applied a narrower version of since exxon and lance.for example,in skit international dac technologies of arkansas,cir,we explained,albeit as dictum,is implicated in that subset of cases where the losing party in a state court action subsequently complains about that judgment and seeks review and rejection of it.id.at.in riehm engelking,cir,we held that was inapplicable to a complaint that alleges unconstitutional actions by the defendant in seeking and executing an ex parte order,rather than challenging the state court issuance of the ex parte order.id.at.we quoted the ninth circuit,explaining 
if a federal plaintiff asserts as a legal wrong an allegedly erroneous decision by a state court,and seeks relief from a state court judgment based on that decision,bars subject matter jurisdiction in federal district court.if,on the other hand,a federal plaintiff asserts as a legal wrong an allegedly illegal act or omission by an adverse party,does not bar jurisdiction.
riehm,at quoting noel hall,cir see also friends of lake view sch.dist.beebe,cir suggesting that the fact that the plaintiffs did not claim to be aggrieved by the outcome of prior litigation would seem to foreclose the defendants argument that the doctrine applies msk eyes wells fargo bank,cir distinguishing claims seeking review and rejection of a judgment,which are barred,from claims that merely attack an adverse party actions,which are permitted 
dodson complaint is distinguishable from the complaints in our cases.dodson claim can succeed only upon a finding that the arkansas chancery courts wrongly decided that the ivf program director has authority to control the disposition of the embryos.see ante at.since exxon,we have not addressed an indirect appeal where a plaintiff claim can succeed only to the extent that the federal court concludes that a state court wrongly decided a factual or legal issue.as such,this appeal squarely presents a lingering question in our jurisprudence,which is whether the inextricably intertwined language has any independent significance.
in the majority of other circuits,the inextricably intertwined language in feldman does not impose an independent substantive test for indirect appeals from judgments.the seventh and ninth circuits limited the inextricably intertwined test before exxon.see noel,at gash assocs.vill.of rosemont,cir,quoted in exxon,at.following exxon,several circuits have concluded that the court abandoned the inextricably intertwined part of the doctrine.the fourth circuit explained 
under exxon,then,feldman inextricably intertwined language does not create an additional legal test for determining when claims challenging a decision are barred,but merely states a conclusion if the loser seeks redress in the federal district court for the injury caused by the decision,his federal claim is,by definition,inextricably intertwined with the decision,and is therefore outside of the jurisdiction of the federal district court.

in accordance with the view expressed by a majority of circuits,i would hold that is limited to the setting in which it arose.charles wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice procedure,at,supp.if a federal plaintiff presents some independent claim,albeit one that denies a legal conclusion that a state court has reached in a case to which he was a party,then there is jurisdiction and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under principles of preclusion.exxon,at.internal alterations omitted,emphasis added quoting gash,at see also lance,at.reiterating that lower courts should not incorporate preclusion principles into.does not bar jurisdiction merely because a federal claim is inextricably intertwined with a judgment,because the federal claim is premised on a position that contradicts a state court decision.subject matter jurisdiction is improper,and thus the claims are inextricably intertwined,only for cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.exxon,at.to be sure,several courts implicitly disagree with this conclusion by continuing to apply the more expansive rule.lance,at.however,i would decline to follow these cases because they either rely on authority or fail to reconcile their holdings with the limiting language in exxon and lance.
the court would hold that applies to count i because any ruling in dodson favor would wholly undermine findings in dodson i and dodson ii.ante at.this conclusion,in substance,applies justice marshall approach to,albeit without using the inextricably intertwined language.i would hold that the district erred by dismissing the complaint as inextricably intertwined with previous judgments,thereby ignoring exxon limitation on.dodson does not request relief against a judgment,and importantly,the complaint alleges that the arkansas chancery the source of dodson injuries.would apply only if dodson were complaining of injuries caused by judgments.exxon,at.emphasis added see also riehm,at skit int l,at.accordingly,i would hold that does not bar the district court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over dodson complaint.my analysis of dodson claims continues,however,because appellees assert several other justifications for the district court judgment,and we may affirm on any basis supported in the record.friends of lake view,at.
ii.preclusion 
appellees argue that dodson i and ii preclude dodson claims under the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.preclusion is a question of law,b b hardware,hargis,cir,cert.denied,led,and a potential basis for dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b,yankton sioux tribe dep t of health human,cir affirming dismissal based on res judicata.arkansas law governs whether the preclusion doctrines apply here.lance,at.we must accept dodson factual allegations as true,and we may affirm the district court judgment only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.hishon king spalding,d.
res judicata 
dodson i precludes dodson claims to the extent she has requested any relief against lay.the hot springs county chancery court adjudicated lay rights and responsibilities with regard to the embryos,and res judicata prohibits dodson from relitigating those claims or pursuing other similar claims against lay now.see cox keahey.app,res judicata bars a subsequent lawsuit based on the same events as the subject matter of a previous lawsuit,even though the later lawsuit raises new legal issues and seeks additional remedies.
for uams,however,res judicata is unhelpful.res judicata bars relitigation of a claim in a subsequent suit when among other ele
