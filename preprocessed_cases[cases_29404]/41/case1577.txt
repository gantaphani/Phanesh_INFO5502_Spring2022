john lawson,filed a claim against csx transportation,csx under the americans with disabilities act ada or the act.he alleged that csx had discriminated against him because of a disability when it refused to hire him as a trainee for a train conductor position.the district court held that lawson had presented insufficient evidence for a jury to find that his type i diabetes constituted a disability within ada coverage,or that csx refused to hire him because of his disability.because we believe that the district court did not analyze properly whether lawson is entitled to the protections of the act and therefore failed to assess properly the evidence of record,we must reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
backgrounda.facts 
john lawson,has had type i diabetes from infancy.according to the affidavit of his physician in order to manage his disease,lawson must monitor carefully blood sugar levels and minimize fluctuations in his blood sugar.this monitoring requires continued vigilance and strict adherence to a perpetual,and demanding treatment regime,ex at.he must inject insulin,follow a diet plan,exercise daily,and test his blood sugar several times a day.id.more precisely,lawson typically tests his blood four to six times every day and administers three insulin injections.if a blood test indicates a drop in glucose levels,the district court explained that lawson must stop all other activities in which he may be engaged at the time and take in the kinds of food that will bring his sugar levels back to normal.at.unless lawson acts quickly to raise his blood sugar,he will experience disabling episodes of dizziness,weakness,loss of mentation and concentration,and a deterioration of bodily functions,ex at.consequently,lawson can not simply eat when and where he wants to,or exert himself without concern for the effect the exertion will have on his glucose levels.id.unlike a person with normal metabolic function,lawson must always concern himself with the availability of food,the timing of when he eats,and the type and quantity of food he eats.id.at.according to skierczynski,lawson eating as a fundamental,major life activity is substantially limited due to his diabetes.id.
throughout his life,lawson has had great difficulty regulating his blood sugar levels.as a young person,he was in and out of hospitals quite a bit and had frequent insulin reactions that caused him to drop items,get the shakes,headaches,and occasionally pass out,ex at.despite the fact that lawson has not sought hospitalization for his diabetes since,he continues to experience wildly fluctuating glucose levels with hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia and had a severe hypoglycemic reaction in december,when he became confused and briefly lost consciousness,ex at e f.lawson symptoms of low blood sugar,or hypoglycemia,include slur red speech,profuse sweating,paleness,shaking,unsteady walk,and fruity odor breath,ex at.skierczynski concluded that lawson inability to properly regulate his blood sugar levels will always put his life at risk no matter how vigilantly he monitors his condition,ex at.
lawson diabetes also has precipitated a number of other serious ailments that limit him physically and complicate his treatment and prognosis regarding his diabetic condition in and,lawson required multiple laser treatments in each eye for proliferative diabetic retinopathy,a condition that affects the small blood vessels in the retina.he also sought medical advice in for fading erectile ability,a problem commonly associated with diabetes,and continues to suffer from impotence.id.i.lawson periodically experiences symptoms of limited joint mobility syndrome,a condition also associated with diabetes,which causes swelling in his hands and wrists,and pain in his elbows,hips and feet,ex at.additionally,lawson suffers from chronic elevated c hemoglobin tests and proteinuria,a condition involving an excess of protein in one urine that will likely progress over the years to renal failure,ex at k l.skierczynski predicts that,due to lawson fluctuating glucose levels and high hemoglobin test results,lawson has a high risk of aggravating his already existing medical problems and developing long term complications of retinopathy,nephropathy,neuropathy and cardiopathy.id.at.
lawson,since graduating from high school in,has held a few jobs of relatively short duration.from through,lawson worked for a time in his parents kennel business and also performed a variety of odds and ends work while looking for a permanent job,ex at.between and,lawson claims that he was employed with a small construction company but that he was forced to leave this job after a serious insulin reaction rendered him unable to work in the period between through,lawson received social security disability insurance ssdi benefits and worked briefly during two separate periods in temporary jobs,neither of which lasted more than four months.
in march,social security personnel noted that lawson medical condition seemed to be improving and suggested to his caseworker at the indiana vocational rehabilitation agency that lawson might be physically able to find steady employment.lawson indicated an interest in a conductor trainee program the program offered at cincinnati state technical and community college cincinnati state to train conductors for csx,a railroad transportation company based in jacksonville,florida in response to an inquiry from lawson caseworker regarding whether a diabetic could perform the conductor job,cincinnati state furnished a job description prepared by laurie ryan,a resource manager at csx.the job description for the conductor trainee position lists four requirements 
or more years as a freight conductor or g raduation from the week conductor training program at cincinnati state h igh school diploma or ged g ood physical condition,including vision,color vision,hearing,and the ability to lift pounds and grade reading level.
after undergoing a physical examination by his family physician,who pronounced him in good general condition and able to do this csx conductor job on a full time basis,ex.at,lawson also passed two written entrance exams required for admission into the personality test and a mechanical aptitude test.as a result,on december,lawson was admitted to the program at cincinnati state.
lawson began the training program on january,in a class of students.lawson classmates and instructors in the program were well aware of his diabetic condition.at times during the program,lawson explained to them the symptoms of his condition and the methods by which it can be treated at times lawson even injected himself with insulin in class.ultimately,lawson completed the program with a running quiz average of and an exam average of,well above the minimum average that csx requires for consideration as a conductor trainee.
in february,lawson was interviewed by ryan and by jeanie layne,who is also a human resource manager for csx there is a dispute regarding what lawson told ryan and layne at the interview regarding his diabetes.lawson claims that he explained that his lack of employment experience was the result of his diabetic condition,that he had been totally disabled for a number of years,and that he was receiving social security disability benefits,ex at.lawson also claims that he described to ryan and layne his efforts to educate his classmates in the program regarding the symptoms and treatment of hypoglycemia 
despite the fact that it hires approximately of all successful program participants,and that it offered each of lawson classmates employment,csx did not offer lawson the job.ryan testified that lawson was not offered employment because of his very limited work history,which was not solid or verifiable,ex at.although ryan maintained that csx prefers to hire candidates with a high school diploma and a solid,verifiable work history,she conceded that csx sometimes makes exception s and hires conductor trainees who do not have such qualifications.id.at she also acknowledged that csx had no written standards for evaluating applicants at the time of lawson interview and that this situation gave her a certain level of discretion in making job offers.she explained that,in her view,lawson had not provided any additional information that would have justified making an exception to csx preference for a solid,verifiable work history.
not long after learning of csx decision,lawson spoke with ryan by telephone.in that conversation,as the district court recounted,ryan told lawson that his lack of a solid,verifiable work history was the reason for csx decision and that if lawson wanted to go flip hamburgers for a year,csx would reconsider his application.at alteration in original citation omitted.however,ryan later admitted that at the time of its employment decision,csx had in fact not attempted to verify lawson previous employment and that factor had no impact on her decision.see,ex at.
after he was denied a job by csx,lawson made,without success,other efforts to find employment.ultimately,following the filing of this lawsuit,csx hired lawson for the conductor trainee job despite the fact that it still maintained that his work history did not qualify him for the position.lawson has worked for csx in terre haute,indiana,since january.
proceedings in the district court 
lawson filed suit against csx on august,claiming that the company refused to hire him because of his disability,diabetes,in violation of the ada.in its motion for summary judgment,csx argued that lawson was not qualified for the conductor trainee position because he lacked prior employment history evidencing responsibility,safety and dependability,at,and could not demonstrate that csx reason for rejecting him was a pretext for discrimination.csx further argued that,under the standard adopted by the supreme court in sutton united airlines,d,lawson diabetes is not a disability as defined by the ada.
the district court granted summary judgment for csx.the court first held that lawson was not disabled under the act because he could not demonstrate that his diabetes rendered him substantially limited in a major life activity,nor could he provide a record of his having been substantially limited in a major life activity in the past.the district court also held that,even assuming lawson could set forth a prima facie case of discrimination under the ada,summary judgment was proper because csx had provided a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its decision not to hire him and lawson has not shown that csx reason was pretextual.at.lawson then appealed to this court.
discussiona.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the record in the light most favorable to lawson.see gorbitz corvilla,cir.we shall affirm a grant of summary judgment only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.a grant of summary judgment will not be sustained if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.
lawson has employed the methodology set forth in mcdonnell douglas green,d.under this approach,he must show that he is disabled within the meaning of the ada,that he was qualified for the conductor trainee position at csx,that he was subject to an adverse employment action,and that the circumstances surrounding the adverse action indicate that it is more likely than not that his disability was the reason for it.see weigel target stores,cir see also leffel valley fin,cir.if lawson succeeds in demonstrating the elements of a prima facie case,csx must then offer a lawful,nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse action.see silk city of chicago,cir.if csx does so,lawson must rebut that reason by showing that the proffered reason is actually a pretext for discrimination.see id.of course,because lawson appeal here is in response to a grant of summary judgment for csx,he need only show that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to these factors.
establishment of a disability under the ada 
we first examine whether a jury could find that lawson is disabled within the meaning of the ada,such that he could establish the first part of his prima facie case.in an effort to prove that he was disabled under the act definition,lawson contended in the district court that his diabetes substantially limited him in the major life activity of eating.we now address his arguments in this regard.
the ada defines a disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual,a record of such an impairment,or being regarded as having such an impairment.with regard to the first method of demonstrating a disability,whether an individual has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities,the supreme court of the united states has instructed us to address the following inquiries 
first,we consider whether the individual claimed disability was a physical impairment.second,we identify the life activity upon which the individual relies and determine whether it constitutes a major life activity under the ada.third,tying the two statutory phrases together,we ask whether the impairment substantially limited the major life activity.
bragdon abbott,d.
we have no difficulty in determining that lawson diabetes and related medical conditions are physical impairments under the act.as the district court noted,lawson diabetes affects many of the organ systems in his body,including his metabolic,vascular,urinary,and reproductive systems as well as his joints and eyes,and negatively impacts his depression and high blood pressure.at see also j i defining p hysical or mental impairment.
we also conclude that eating is a major life activity as defined by the ada.equal employment opportunity commission regulations interpreting the ada define major life activity by providing a list that includes functions such as caring for one self,performing manual tasks,walking,seeing,hearing,speaking,breathing,learning,and working.i see also sinkler midwest prop.mgmt,cir bragdon,at.citing similarly worded rehabilitation act regulations.such activities need not have a public or economic character to them they must simply be central to the life process itself.bragdon,at.clearly,the ability to eat is integral to one daily existence,as much or more so than the activities listed in the implementing regulations.as a result,we hold that eating constitutes a major life activity for purposes of the ada.see forest city daly,town of north hempstead,cir eating is a major life activity for purposes of ada coverage land baptist med,cir same erjavac holy family health plus,d,same.
the protections of the act only apply,however,when it is demonstrated that the disability of the individual substantially limits a major life activity such as eating.the supreme court has held that,in determining whether a claimed disability is substantially limiting,we must examine the plaintiff condition as it exists after corrective or mitigating measures used to combat the impairment are taken into account.see sutton,at.therefore,in lawson case,we must consider the beneficial effects of his diabetes medication in determining whether his diabetic condition substantially limits his ability to eat.
here,we can not accept the district court conclusion that lawson could be substantially limited in his ability to eat only if his actual physical ability to ingest food is restricted.at.this construction of the statutory phrase substantially limits conflicts with the supreme court recognition that the ada addresses substantial limitations on major life activities,not utter inabilities.bragdon,at.the district court failed to consider the extent of the restrictions imposed by lawson treatment regimen and the consequences of noncompliance with that regimen.in doing so,the court prevented lawson from showing that,although he is not incapable of ingesting food,his diabetes produces a substantial limitation on his ability to perform the basic life function of eating.
the record contains undisputed testimony that,even when taking insulin,lawson ability to regulate his blood sugar and metabolize food is difficult,erratic,and substantially limited,ex at.additionally,lawson can not simply eat when and where he wants to,or exert himself without concern for the effect the exertion will have on his glucose levels instead,he must always concern himself with the availability of food,the timing of when he eats,and the type and quantity of food he eats.id.
moreover,the district court characterization of the impact that lawson diabetes has on his ability to eat,described in its opinion as requiring simple dietary restrictions,at,belies the severity of the restrictions that he must follow if he is to avoid dire and immediate consequences.on a daily basis,lawson must endure the discomfort of multiple blood tests to monitor his blood glucose levels.he also must adjust his food intake and level of exertion to take into account fluctuations in blood sugar.when his blood sugar drops,he must stop all other activities and find the kinds of food that will bring his levels back to normal or he will experience disabling episodes of dizziness,weakness,loss of mentation and concentration,and a deterioration of bodily functions,ex at.lawson physician characterized the measures he must take to manage his disease as a perpetual,and demanding treatment regime requiring continued vigilance.id.at.if lawson fails to adhere strictly to this demanding regimen,the consequences could be dire he could experience debilitating,and potentially,symptoms.this evidence is sufficient for a jury to find that lawson is substantially limited with respect to the major life activity of eating.see,sutton,at.defining substantially limits as meaning considerable or specified to a large degree citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
it is the severity of these limitations on his ability to eat that distinguishes lawson situation from that of other individuals who must follow the simple dietary restrictions that medical conditions sometimes entail.see,weber strippit,cir unspecified dietary restrictions prescribed for treatment of heart disease were moderate limitation on eating,cert.denied,d land,at child with peanut allergy was not substantially limited in eating because allergy impacted her life only a little bit and only prohibited her from eating foods containing peanuts or their derivatives shields vuren,wl,at,person controlling diabetes with diet and exercise alone not substantially limited in ability to eat when only impact involved modifications to diet and eating habits,which were not severe enough ingles neiman marcus group,person who managed diabetes with oral medications and a normal,good,healthy diet with meals at regular intervals was not substantially limited in eating.instead,lawson severe dietary restrictions,and the dangerous consequences that could result from a failure to maintain them,are more analogous to other cases in which the potential for a substantial limitation on the ability to eat was found.see,erjavac,d at issue of fact raised when diabetic,viewed in treated form,must eat constantly to prevent blood sugar fluctuations,must stop all other activities and pursue food when blood sugar drops,and must insulin several times a day gonsalves fredericks tool,genuine issue of fact created when affidavit and deposition testimony produced evidence that diabetic plaintiff had difficulty eating and dizziness and blurry vision when his blood sugar level became high coghlan heinz,genuine issue of fact created when diabetic,viewed in treated form,experienced hypoglycemia,creating debilitating state,that could only be alleviated by eating,rev on other grounds,washington hca health servs.of texas,cir,vacated,d.
these same demands of the regimen and the effects of make this case quite unlike the situation before the supreme court in sutton.the wearing of corrective lenses to neutralize the effects of myopia,at issue in sutton,at,involves none of the coordination of multifaceted factors or the constant vigilance that,according to this record,lawson must demonstrate on a daily basis.moreover,in sutton,the supreme court noted that any negative side effects suffered by an individual resulting from the use of mitigating measures must be taken into consideration.id.at.see also moore hunt transport,cir krocka city of chicago,cir.as we have previously noted,the multiple insulin injections that lawson takes each day can cause symptoms of hypoglycemia,creating a condition where the level of glucose in his blood is too low.when lawson blood sugar is reduced to such low levels,he suffers from symptoms including slur red speech,profuse sweating,paleness,shaking,unsteady walk,and fruity odor breath,ex at.these symptoms will lead to dizziness,weakness,loss of mentation and concentration,and a deterioration of bodily functions if lawson does not eat immediately,ex at.the evidence thus shows that,every day of his life,lawson must deal with the concern that the insulin he injects to treat his illness will itself bring about debilitating symptoms that can only be ameliorated by immediately eating certain foods.
in explaining why mitigating measures should be taken into account in defining an ada disability,sutton indicated that a diabetic whose illness does not impair his or her daily activities,after utilizing medical remedies such as insulin,should not be considered disabled.id.at.this statement does not mean,however,that no diabetic can ever be considered disabled under the ada meaning.such an approach would contradict the court view that whether a person is disabled under the ada is an individualized inquiry based on the particular circumstances of each case.see id.moreover,as we have explained,the particular nature of lawson diabetes,even after treatment,could be said to significantly impair his daily activities,unlike the situation in sutton.
additionally,in davidson midelfort clinic,cir,this court also noted that in determining whether an impairment can be said to substantially limit the major life activity of the individual,a court ought to consider the nature and severity of the limitations,the actual or expected duration of the impairment,and the actual or anticipated impact of the impairment.see id.at citing j.the record before us establishes that lawson impairment is serious and severe.he has a medical history of type i diabetes,he suffers from a number of medical problems,and the very medication that he uses to control his diabetes causes severe symptoms that have potentially consequences.the duration of the illness also seems to be.lawson was diagnosed with type i diabetes soon after birth,a disease that will remain with him throughout his life.with respect to prognosis,skierczynski predicted to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that even with continuous medical treatment and monitoring of his disease,lawson has not been able to properly control his blood sugar levels for several years and his medical condition will continue to deteriorate over time as a direct consequence of his diabetes,ex at.
from all the evidence in the record,a jury could find that the prescribed treatment lawson must take to survive with diabetes causes symptoms that substantially limit the major life activity of eating.therefore,the district court erred in holding that lawson could not establish an issue of fact regarding the first part of his prima facie case under the mcdonnell douglas test.
as we have noted,the ada also defines a disability as a record of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities.see b.we believe that sufficient evidence exists that there is a record that lawson diabetes has limited substantially his ability to work in a broad class of jobs.see sutton,at.
lawson testified that,in his younger years,he was in and out of hospitals quite a bit,ex at.he also indicated that he had frequent insulin reactions that caused him to drop items,get the shakes,headaches,and occasionally pass out.id.skierczynski stated that lawson continues to experience hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia and,indeed,endured a severe hypoglycemic reaction in,when he became confused and briefly lost consciousness,ex at f.the record also contains evidence of numerous chronic or recurring medical conditions symptomatic of lawson diabetes.
additionally,there is evidence that these maladies inhibited lawson ability to maintain any significant employment for a number of years.lawson maintains that soon after his high school graduation,between and,he had to quit his job with a small construction company when he had a serious insulin reaction and could no longer work,ex at.moreover,in august,lawson application for ssdi benefits was granted,and he continued to receive total disability benefits until november.during that period,the social security administration ssa reviewed lawson medical condition every two years and determined that he continued to meet its definition of disability,allowing lawson continually to receive benefits 
we believe that a jury could conclude,from this evidence,that lawson can show that a record exists indicating that his diabetes has limited substantially his ability to work 
important in this determination is lawson receipt of disability payments under the social security act and the facts surrounding that determination.the social security act provides income replacement to an individual who is under a disability,a term defined as an inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.d a.to obtain an award of ssdi benefits,lawson had to demonstrate that he is not only unable to do his previous work but can not,considering his age,education,and work experience,engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy d a.the supreme court has held that evidence of the receipt of ssdi benefits regarding a claimed disability should not be a dispositive factor in ada disability determinations.see cleveland policy mgmt,d.the court also has indicated,however,that an ssa determination of disability can be relevant and significant evidence in showing that a disability exists for ada purposes.see id.at.see also feldman american mem l life ins,cir weigel,at.
more specifically,in cleveland,the supreme court noted that because of differences in the mechanics of the ssa and ada determinations of disability,a person could be considered disabled by the ssa but yet also be a qualified individual with a disability according to the ada.see id.at.yet it also explained that the two acts were similar enough in this regard to require a person,seeking to show that he is qualified to perform a job under the ada meaning,to provide a sufficient explanation as to how this does not conflict with the ssa determination that he was unable to work.id.at.
moreover,some of the differences cited by the court in cleveland between the ssa and ada disability determinations are not applicable to lawson in deciding whether he can satisfy the first prong of the prima facie case.the court noted that the ssa does not take into account the idea of reasonable accommodation in its disability determination,meaning that an otherwise disabled person according to the ssa could be qualified under the ada when such an accommodation is considered.id.at.the reasonable accommodation principle may be relevant at trial regarding the second element of lawson prima facie case,whether he is qualified for the position sought.but see feldman american mem l life ins,cir explaining that the severity of a disability may change over time such that an individual is totally disabled when applying for ssdi,but later is a qualified individual at the time of the employment decision disputed in an ada suit.however,it does not affect the basic definition of a disability according to the two acts.in fact,the language considered by the ssa and the ada in defining disability with regard to the ability to work,without taking into account the ada reference to reasonable accommodation,is somewhat similar.compare d a regarding ssdi benefits,person must demonstrate that he can not engage in any kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy with sutton,at.person disabled under ada if substantially limited in ability to hold a broad class of jobs.
additionally,the court explained that,because the ssa often uses presumptions in its disability findings,particularly by automatically finding that a disability exists if it is one of a number of listed impairment s,a determination that someone is disabled under the ssa administrative rules may not mean that he is also disabled according to the ada more inquiry.id.at.however,although there was uncertainty over this point during oral argument,it appears that lawson diabetes is not a listed impairment under the ssa and that a more individualized determination was necessary to allow his receipt of ssdi benefits.
lastly,the district court noted that lawson brief employment with two companies between and showed that social security determination that lawson should be on total disability is not tantamount to a conclusion that he was substantially limited in his ability to work.at.we do not disagree that lawson employment in these jobs makes it somewhat less likely that he can demonstrate a record of disability during this time period.however,we believe that such limited work activity does not provide sufficient justification to take this question out of the hands of the jury,in light of all of the evidence presented in this case.
lawson receipt of ssa benefits over a period from to,and the factual circumstances surrounding it,constitute significant evidence that his diabetic condition rendered him unable to work in a broad class of jobs during that time.although this evidence is not dispositive of the issue,and is not the only factor upon which we rely in this determination,it gives force to lawson claim that a record of disability exists.lawson evidence,taken as a whole,is sufficient for a jury to find he has a record of diabetes substantially limiting his ability to work.therefore,the district court determination that lawson could not show that he was disabled in this regard under the ada was also in error.this provides another reason why summary judgment was improper on the ground that the first element of lawson prima facie case could not be met.
remaining elements of the prima facie case 
the district court not only determined that lawson claim failed because he could not demonstrate that he was disabled under the ada,but it also noted that it d id not believe lawson has sufficiently established the remainder of his prima facie case.at italics omitted.yet the court provided no discussion of its determination in that regard it explained that,because in its view the case could be decided on the disability prong of the test,it would not attempt to resolve the disputes as to the remainder of the elements of lawson prima facie case.id.despite the lack of specific findings by the district court,we may affirm its grant of summary judgment on any ground supported by the record.see conley village of bedford park,cir.we can not do so here,however,because the record demonstrates that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether lawson can satisfy the remainder of his prima facie case.
the second prong of the prima facie case requires lawson to show that he was qualified for the position of conductor trainee at csx.a determination as to whether a person is qualified for an employment position under the ada involves a inquiry the employee must possess the appropriate educational background,employment experience,skills,licenses,and he must also be able to perform the essential functions of the position held or desired,with or without reasonable accommodation.bay cassens trans,cir quoting app.m see also bombard fort wayne newspapers,cir.csx does not claim that lawson can not handle the physical demands of the conductor position instead it asserts that he can not satisfy the first step of this inquiry because he did not possess a work history evidencing responsibility,safety and dependability.
an employer may define the job in question,in terms of both its essential scope and the qualifications required for it,dalton automotive,cir,as long as such qualifications are and consistent with business necessity,bay,at quoting a b.there is,on this record,a jury question as to whether an employment history demonstrating responsibility,safety and dependability was a genuine requirement for the position of conductor trainee at csx.the record shows that such a work history was not among the prerequisites listed on csx job description for conductor trainee that it provided to interested applicants at cincinnati state.additionally,csx had no guidelines defining this unstated qualification,and the district court noted that the company not infrequently made exceptions to this criterion by hiring persons with limited or unskilled employment experience,applicants whose employment could not be verified,applicants without a high school diploma or ged,and even applicants with criminal records including unresolved felony convictions.at.
moreover,not only has csx submitted the applications of a number of people hired for the conductor trainee position who seem not to have possessed this csx prerequisite,see supra note and accompanying text,but ryan also admitted that it was not unusual for her to hire people who did not have a solid employment background.her description of the variety of exceptions to this requirement calls into question whether it was actually an essential feature for a conductor trainee applicant 
there is an exception here that business ownership can be substituted for employment.work with concurrent volunteer community service can substitute for employment.work while attending college can substitute for employment.acceptable explanations for gaps in employments or layoffs or downsizing also qualifies as an exception if someone has been in school and does have a solid verifiable work history,then we look at their college,what type of school work they been doing 
ex at.ryan went on to describe one applicant who did not have a solid work history but whom she hired because he had done significant volunteer work in high school when questioned whether she asked lawson if he had such volunteer experience,ryan admitted she had not,explaining that it was up to the applicants to sell themselves.id.at.
csx relies upon our decision in holder old ben coal,cir,for the proposition that even though a job qualification may not be published,it may still be a requirement for an employment position.holder was a title vii case involving the question of whether a plaintiff was qualified under the terms of that statute for an unskilled mining position.id.at.there the plaintiff had argued that because the job in question was labeled unskilled,it required no particular qualifications,and thus she was necessarily qualified for the position.see id.we held that,although the defendant had not listed any job requirements for the position,that did not mean that it did not look for certain qualifications in its applicants.see id.however,the decision in that case turned on the fact that the defendant,in hiring unskilled workers,primarily sought persons who had operated mobile equipment or had worked with heavy equipment and consistently sought applicants for unskilled positions with mining related experience,qualities the plaintiff did not possess.id.at.additionally,we explained that the term unskilled worker,in the context of the defendant line of work,was also simply a way for the company to describe a job that was not a skilled position.a skilled position was one that required technical ability,defined as a minimum of six months experience as a dragline operator,shovel operator,machinist,electrician,welder,mechanic,bulldozer operator,overburden driller,or overburden shooter.id.at.we also noted that the evidence fail ed to show that the defendant ever sought or hired anyone with experience comparable to plaintiff.id.at.in contrast to the plaintiff in holder,we believe that lawson has put forward enough facts to create a jury question as to whether csx consistently required applicants to have a responsible,safe,and dependable work history.additionally,he has shown that the company hires persons with employment histories that are not significantly different from the limited experience he possessed 
as to the fourth element of the prima facie case,whether the circumstances surrounding the company decision make it more likely than not that lawson disability was the reason why csx did not hire him,we also believe that a jury question exists on these facts.lawson informed ryan and layne that he was a diabetic,a condition that previously had rendered him unable to work and for which he had been receiving ssdi benefits for a number of years.csx then failed to hire lawson as a conductor trainee,despite the fact that he completed the training program at cincinnati state with a high quiz average and met the listed requirements for the position in the job description that csx provided to the school.the evidence also shows that csx was not a particularly selective employer with regard to its hiring from programs like cincinnati state.indeed,it hired of all successful program participants,and it hired every other member of lawson program class.csx claimed that lawson sparse work history was the reason it did not hire him.however,as we have noted,there is a serious question as to whether such a work history was truly a job requirement for csx,and ryan admission that she had significant discretion in making exceptions to this requirement particularly calls into question the importance of this criterion to the company.
these facts,considered together,could support a jury determination that csx more likely than not refused to hire lawson as a conductor trainee because it knew that he was an diabetic.as a result,lawson has demonstrated a genuine issue of fact with regard to each element of his prima facie case of discrimination.
csx did come forward with a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its refusal to hire lawson.as discussed previously,it claimed that he lacked a prerequisite for the conductor trainee job because he did not have a work history evidencing responsibility,safety or dependability and because he offered csx no reason to make an exception to that rule.lawson must then be afforded the opportunity to demonstrate that this reason was a pretext for discrimination.see reeves sanderson plumbing,d mary honor ctr.hicks,d.lawson may succeed in his demonstration of pretext by offering evidence that csx proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.reeves.at citation omitted.for many of the same reasons why lawson has created a genuine issue of fact regarding the elements of the prima facie case,there is also sufficient evidence to permit a jury to conclude that the reason given by csx as to why it did not hire lawson was pretextual see reeves.at noting that the trier of fact may still consider the evidence establishing the plaintiff prima facie case and inferences properly drawn therefrom on the issue of whether the defendant explanation is pretextual citation and internal quotations omitted.these facts are sufficient to allow a jury to disbelieve csx proffered nondiscriminatory explanation for its action and to believe lawson explanation of intentional discrimination.id.at emphasis and citation omitted.
ultimately,lawson has demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact as to whether discrimination regarding his status as an diabetic was the true motivation for csx employment that made lawson that exceedingly rare employee who passed csx training program for the position of conductor trainee with flying colors,met all of the qualifications csx listed for the position,and yet was not hired by the company.we express no view on whether lawson ultimately will be successful at trial,but we believe the evidence in the record demonstrates that his case deserves to be heard by a jury.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth in this opinion,the judgment of the district court is reversed,an
