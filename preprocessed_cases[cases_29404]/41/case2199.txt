larry rohr appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of his former employer,salt river project agricultural improvement and power district salt river.rohr,who is an type diabetic,brought suit for employment discrimination in violation of the americans with disabilities act ada,et.because the district court erred in concluding that rohr was neither disabled nor a qualified individual under the ada,we vacate the district court order of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
at the outset,we note that on september,while this decision was pending,the ada amendments act of adaaa was signed into law in order t o restore the intent and protections of the americans with disabilities act of,stat.in the adaaa,congress emphasizes that when it enacted the ada in,it intended that the act provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities and provide broad coverage.id.a,stat.at emphasis added.the adaaa rejects the supreme court interpretation of the term disability in sutton united air lines,d,and toyota motor manufacturing,kentucky,williams,d,and thereby expands the class of individuals who are entitled to protection under the ada.id.b,stat.at.indeed,congress signifies that as a result of these supreme court cases,lower courts have incorrectly found in individual cases that people with a range of substantially limiting impairments are not people with disabilities.id.a,stat.at.
although the adaaa,if applicable,would provide additional support for rohr claims in this case,we hold that,even under our case law,rohr provided sufficient evidence that he was a qualified individual with a disability under the ada to survive summary judgment.we therefore need not decide whether the adaaa,which took effect on january,applies retroactively to rohr claims.
background 
rohr job at salt river 
from may to june,rohr worked as a welding metallurgy specialist in the plant technical support group at salt river,which provides utility services to homes in arizona.er.the plant technical support group was composed of specialists in various fields,including welding metallurgy,turbines,boilers and cathodic protection,as well as the quality assurance staff.er.the group objective was to address problems that salt river power plants could not solve on their own.er.for example,if a power plant requested a new welding procedure,the specialists in the plant technical support group would design it.er.the plant technical support group performed audits,reviewed paperwork on the plants to determine whether any applicable code had been violated and responded to inspections.rohr characterizes the group work as mostly support.er.
as a metallurgy specialist,rohr was primarily responsible for overseeing all aspects of salt river welding procedures,maintaining salt river welding manual,training all welding personnel,reviewing and auditing the work of subcontractors,ensuring that all welding procedures complied with applicable codes and specifications,advising salt river on the purchase of new welding equipment,and counseling less experienced welders.er.while he often traveled to individual power plants to perform inspections and to train welders,engineers and welding inspectors er,he claims that the majority of his work was in an office environment.er.
the plant technical support group was rarely required to travel,but occasionally,when outages occurred,when one of salt river generators stopped producing power,borrowed hands were requested.er.over the course of years rohr worked as a borrowed hand at a power station about a dozen times.the parties dispute whether this support role was an essential function of rohr position.er.during an outage,the work of a specialist,such as rohr,could require ten to twelve hours per day in the field,seven days a week.rohr claims,without contradiction,that he had not been assigned to such field work since at least and that major outages had become increasingly infrequent over the last several years er.
rohr diabetes diagnosis 
rohr was diagnosed as an type diabetic in.from that time,the medical necessities of insulin injections,medicine,blood tests and a strict diet have been fixtures of his daily life er.as a result of his diabetes,rohr suffers from chronic high blood pressure,deteriorating vision and occasional loss of feeling in his hands and feet.er.he tires more quickly than he did before the onset of the disease,especially when he drives for long periods of time or is exposed to heat for some length of time.er.
within a few years of the onset of his diabetes,rohr medical condition affected his position at salt river in two respects.first,pursuant to occupational health and safety administration osha guidelines,salt river required all employees who might be required to use a respirator,which included the plant technical support group,to obtain and renew a respirator certification annually this necessitated a yearly medical evaluation.although rohr had successfully renewed his respirator medical certification for at least ten years,in salt river health services department refused to administer the breathilator portion of the test to rohr because of his high blood pressure,which was related to his diabetes.er.when rohr returned on a different day,the health services department again refused to administer the test because his blood pressure was too high.er.as a result,rohr could not complete the medical evaluation and was unable to renew his respirator certification.er.salt river offered no alternative test by which rohr could complete the respirator certification requirement.
second,in august rohr learned that he would be assigned to work on what promised to be a five or project to repair an outage at salt river navajo generating station in page,arizona.er.this was the first time in several years that he had been asked to help as a borrowed hand in the field.er.the assignment prompted him to write his supervisors a letter requesting certain accommodations due to his disease.er.
his letter explained that while his diabetes had been first diagnosed in,he had likely had the disease for a much longer time.it was not until recently,however,that diabetes significantly affected his work and personal life.er.now,his condition was deteriorating despite daily insulin injections,medication and stringent diet,his vision had decreased,his hands and feet sometimes felt numb,and exhaustion made him sick rather than simply tired.sometimes he felt sick for no apparent reason.er.he had to follow a very demanding regimen to manage his diabetes.in addition to daily injections of insulin,he had to test his blood sugar three to four times a day,could not eat large meals or skip meals and needed to snack on something every few hours.er.during travel he had to find a way to keep his insulin refrigerated or chilled.changes in the length of his work day greatly affected his treatment routine.er.because his condition was deteriorating,his doctor had doubled the strength of his medication and increased the units of insulin that he took each day.er.he told his supervisor that his treatment had become his first priority and he had to schedule everything else in his life around it.er.
as accommodations for the efforts required to control his diabetes,rohr requested that he not be required to drive for more than three or four hours at a time,engage in strenuous activities,work more than an eight or shift,work in extreme heat,climb scaffolding or ladders,work around moving machinery,or go on overnight travel.er.these accommodations were necessary,he asserted,because he otherwise would become exhausted,overheated,weak or dizzy due to his diabetes,and travel could exacerbate his condition because it made it difficult to follow his diet and treatment regimen.er.
rohr permanent work restrictions 
a nurse at salt river employee health services department received rohr letter and instructed rohr supervisors to refrain from sending him on travel,including the outage at the navajo generating station,until he could obtain his doctor opinion.er.rohr met with his doctor,stephen dippe.in a note dated august,dippe recommended that rohr not be given overnight assignments and that he avoid becoming over exhausted such as working more than hours a day or being exposed to extreme heat.er.
about a week later,a doctor employed by salt river,timothy woehl,examined rohr and prepared a list of permanent work restrictions 
no rotating shift work.
a workday limited to hours per day.
limitation on thermal stress avoiding prolonged work in high temperature poorly ventilated work areas with preference to prolonged work in environments only sic.
no heavy exertional activities 
no working from unprotected heights and no unprotected climbing.
he should be required to carry with him an immediate source of sugar such as a sugar tablet during working hours.
er.woehl disagreed with the restriction on overnight travel recommended by dippe because he believed it was not travel itself that posed problems but rather the nature of the work that rohr was asked to do during overnight travel assignments.ser.nevertheless,salt river implemented all the requested accommodations,including the travel restriction.
about five months later,on february,woehl reexamined rohr and reported to rohr supervisor that the recommended permanent restrictions remained unchanged.he stated that i t remains my opinion that rohr is physically able to perform the essential functions of his job with the accommodations as outlined.er.on march,rohr supervisors asked woehl to clarify whether the travel restriction was still in effect,and woehl responded that rohr should continue to refrain from overnight travel,even though woehl had previously thought that this restriction was unnecessary.ser.
on march,rohr supervisors and the salt river labor relations department told rohr that his work restrictions were preventing him from performing the essential functions of his job,such as overnight travel to assist as a borrowed hand during outages and travel to conduct inspections and trainings.they presented rohr with three options remain in his position for up to ninety days while he pursued another position within salt river that would be consistent with his work restrictions apply for disability benefits or take early retirement.rohr was given until june,to make his choice.ser er.
rohr requests removal of travel restriction 
rohr then wrote to his doctor,dippe,stating that he did not believe his medical condition prevented him from doing any travel and that salt river had misinterpreted the doctor recommendation to mean that he should refrain from all travel.ser.on april,dippe stated that in his opinion,it is no longer necessary to restrict patient larry rohr regarding any travel that may be associated with his job assignments including overnight stays for multiple days,providing he adheres to the other restrictions currently imposed on him.er.
nearly a week later,woehl informed rohr supervisors that,despite dippe note,he was not in favor of lifting the travel restriction unless dippe could produce medical documentation and an explanation as to why rohr could now travel,since rohr had pled his case against overnight travel at great length.woehl indicated he was concerned that rohr was trying to manipulate dippe and salt river to remove his travel restriction for other than medically necessary reasons.ser.
several weeks later,in a letter dated may,woehl asked dippe to explain how rohr medical condition had materially changed,so that he now could travel safely out of town and overnight.ser.in a letter dated june,dippe explained that even though rohr had to take actos,metformin,glipizide and insulin to manage his diabetes and required ongoing care from a cardiologist,rohr had been fairly stable for quite some time and did not appear to be at risk for hypoglycemia.ser.dippe indicated that overnight travel would pose no problem so long as rohr could monitor his sugar level,take his insulin and medication,maintain his diet and avoid hazardous work.ser.
rohr claims that he would have been able to travel to power plants to perform inspections or conduct trainings,as these activities did not conflict with his restrictions,and that salt river should have permitted him to do so.his restrictions,however,did not permit him to travel to work as a borrowed hand during plant outages,as this type of assignment involved climbing,hot and hazardous environments and long hours.er.he asserts that salt river could have assigned someone else to do such borrowed hand work instead of him,as the work involved being a helper to carry equipment,record data,and the like,and anyone could have done it.er.
on june,rohr informed salt river that he chose the option of applying for disability benefits.he began a leave of absence the next day,and the day thereafter filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging that salt river discriminated against him on the basis of both age and disability.er.salt river informed him that his job protection rights,the period during which his job could not be filled on a regular basis,expired on december.er.
in december rohr filed suit in federal court er.on july,in an unpublished order,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of salt river.rohr timely appeals.
ii.analysis 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we must determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.see gribben united parcel service,cir citing summers teichert son,cir.
the ada prohibits employers from discriminat ing against a qualified individual with a disability,a,and requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified employee with a disability,id.b a.the district court held that rohr was not entitled to ada protections because he failed to raise a material issue of fact concerning whether he had a disability within the meaning of the ada,and because his inability to complete the respirator certification test rendered him unqualified for his position.we disagree with both holdings.
disability 
the ada defines disability,in pertinent part,as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual.diabetes is a physical impairment because it affects the digestive,hemic and endocrine systems,and eating is a major life activity.fraser goodale,cir.whether rohr diabetes substantially limits his eating is an individualized inquiry.see fraser,at.once an impairment is found,the issue is whether rohr diabetes substantially limits his activity of eating.we find that the district court erred in concluding that it did not.
rohr diabetes may qualify as a disability 
to determine whether an type diabetic like rohr is substantially limited in his eating,we must compare the condition,manner or duration under which he can eat as compared to the condition,manner or duration under which the average person in the general population can eat.fraser,at internal quotation marks omitted.the fact that a plaintiff simply differs from the average person in how she performs a major life activity is patently insufficient for a substantial limitation.id.emphasis in original.rather,in deciding whether the impairment is substantially limiting,courts must consider the nature and severity of the plaintiff impairment,the duration or expected duration of the impairment,as well as the permanent or long term impact of the impairment.id.at internal citations omitted rohr must show that his diabetes significantly restricts his eating.id.
at the summary judgment stage,precedent does not require comparative or medical evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding the impairment of a major life activity rather,a plaintiff testimony may suffice to establish a genuine issue of material fact.head glacier northwest,cir.however,t o survive summary judgment,an affidavit supporting the existence of a disability must not be merely and must contain sufficient detail to convey the existence of an impairment.id.at.
finally,we must consider not only whether the symptoms of rohr diabetes substantially limit one of his major life activities,but also whether his efforts to mitigate the disease constitute a substantial limitation.the supreme court directed in sutton that if a person is taking measures to correct for,or mitigate,a physical or mental impairment,the effects of those positive and be taken into account when judging whether that person is substantially limited in a major life activity and thus disabled under the act.at.we therefore consider the effectiveness,side effects and burdens of a plaintiff mitigating measures.id.at.
we conclude that rohr has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his diabetes substantially limits his life activity of eating.the record is replete with statements,both by rohr and his doctors,that to manage his disease rohr is required to strictly monitor what,and when,he eats.rohr stated that these restrictions constrain him every day,whether it a workday,a weekend or a holiday.er.he can not eat large meals or skip meals,and must eat a snack every few hours.er.he must schedule each day blood tests,medications and food intake.er.he sometimes become s weak and dizzy without warning,and only when he eats something do these sensations quickly subside.er.if he fails to follow his diet regimen for more than a meal or two,his blood sugar rises to a level that aggravates his disease.er.while rohr and his wife used to schedule frequent trips during vacation time to go to rocky point or to visit family in utah,they no longer do so because it is increasingly difficult for him to follow his diet during travel.er.rohr stated that overall,c ontrolling diabetes is like being on a chemical roller coaster.er.
the district court oversimplified rohr condition when it opined that if he stays on his medicines and watches what and when he eats the only limitation on his activities are the restrictions recommended by his physicians.er.while it may seem easy to take a pill or shot of insulin,the reality of diabetes,a chronic and incurable disease,is not so simple.for people like rohr,who must treat their diabetes with insulin,the failure to take insulin will result in severe problems and eventually death.see american diabetes association position statement insulin administration,diabetes care.insulin injections themselves can be dangerous.rohr stated in his deposition that it is difficult to determine how much insulin to take,as the necessary amount varies depending on the food and activity level.er.generally,food raises blood glucose levels while exercise and insulin reduce them.but other factors play a role,too,mental stress,illness and injury.to obtain the appropriate balance,rohr must test his blood glucose levels through a finger stick test numerous times a day,and adjust insulin,food and activity level according to the results.er.
if daily insulin injections alone more or less stabilized rohr blood sugar levels,such that any limitation imposed on his diet would be minor,then rohr major life activity of eating might not be substantially limited.see,ingles neiman marcus group,holding that diabetic plaintiff who was merely required to maintain a normal,good,healthy diet was not substantially limited plaintiff condition was substantially controlled with oral medication,and he did not have to take insulin.however,rohr has alleged substantial limitations on his eating in spite of his medicine and insulin.he must snack regularly,plan his daily schedule around his diet,avoid skipping meals and eat immediately when he feels dizzy or.the general population does not have to snack on something every few hours to regulate sugar intake moreover,the general population is not medically required to plan daily schedules around a dietary regimen.er.straying from a diet for more than one or two meals is not a cause for medical concern for most people,and skipping a meal,or eating a large one,does not expose them to the risk of fainting it is simply no answer to say that if he strictly controls his diet he is not substantially limited for rohr,the effort required to control his diet is itself substantially limiting.
in short,rohr has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he is significantly restricted as to the condition,manner or duration in which he can eat,compared to the general population.see fraser,at.indeed,this court and others have found a sufficient showing of a substantial limitation on considerably less evidence than rohr has presented.see,head,at gonsalves fredericks tool,plaintiff statement that he had difficulty sleeping and eating was sufficient to permit a finding that his diabetes substantially limited a major life activity.therefore,a genuine issue of fact exists as to whether rohr has a disability,and summary judgment should not have been granted.
the americans with disabilities act amendments act of 
on september,two months after the parties oral argument before this court,president george bush signed into law the adaaa,which significantly expands the scope of the term disability under the ada.the adaaa became effective on january,and congress did not indicate that it may be applied retrospectively.because we have reached our conclusions separate and apart from the adaaa,we need not determine whether the amendment has retroactive effect.nevertheless,because the adaaa sheds light on congress original intent when it enacted the ada,a brief discussion of the amendment is appropriate.
adaaa calls for broad construction of disability 
the adaaa explicitly rejects several supreme court decisions that defined disability more narrowly than many of the ada original congressional proponents had intended.see,at comm.on educ.labor.beginning in january,disability was to be broadly construed and coverage will apply to the maximum extent permitted by the ada and the adaaa.stat.at.
the adaaa explains that w hile in enacting the ada congress expected that the definition of disability under the ada would be interpreted consistently with how courts had applied the definition of a handicapped individual under the rehabilitation act of,that expectation has not been fulfilled.further,the holdings of the supreme court in sutton united air lines,d and its companion cases have narrowed the broad scope of protection intended to be afforded by the ada,thus eliminating protection for many individuals whom congress intended to protect.stat.at.
adaaa alters supreme court standards for disability 
the adaaa clarifies congress intent with respect to the term disability in three major ways that could affect whether ada protections are extended to persons with diabetes.first,the law makes clear that eating is a major life activity under the act stat.at.second,the adaaa states that the standard articulated in substantially limits means prevents or severely restricts has created an inappropriately high level of limitation necessary to obtain coverage under the ada.stat.at.in this respect,congress has decided that the current eeoc regulations,which define the term substantially limits as significantly restricted,require a greater degree of limitation than the congress had intended,and has instructed the eeoc to revise its definition.id.
third,and perhaps most significantly,the adaaa rejects the requirement enunciated in sutton that whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity is to be determined with reference to mitigating measures.id.the adaaa makes explicit that the substantially limits inquiry shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures such as medication,medical supplies,equipment,or appliances use of assistive technology reasonable accommodations or auxiliary aids or services or learned behavioral or adaptive neurological modifications.id.at.impairments are to be evaluated in their unmitigated state,so that,for example,diabetes will be assessed in terms of its limitations on major life activities when the diabetic does not take insulin injections or medicine and does not require behavioral adaptations such as a s
