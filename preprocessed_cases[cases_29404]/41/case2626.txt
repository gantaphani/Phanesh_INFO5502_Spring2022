nancy harbert plaintiff brought this action against her former employer,healthcare services group,defendant,alleging that defendant wrongfully denied her request for medical leave under the family and medical leave act fmla.defendant had denied her request based on a provision of the fmla which excludes from fmla eligibility any employee who is employed at a particular worksite if the employer employs less than employees within miles of that worksite.
applying a department of labor dol regulation,the district court defined plaintiff worksite as defendant regional office in golden,colorado.because defendant employed more than employees within miles of its golden office,the district court denied defendant motion for summary judgment and,after a bench trial,found in plaintiff favor.defendant filed this appeal,arguing that the relevant portion of the dol regulation defining the statutory term worksite is invalid.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
defendant contracts out housekeeping and laundry services to care institutions.defendant employs approximately employees and has contracts with about care facilities in states.organizationally,defendant is divided into regions,which are composed of multiple districts.each district is made up of individual accounts,which are the care institutions.account managers work at the account to which they are assigned and report to district managers.district managers report to regional managers.in colorado,all district managers and the regional manager have their offices at the same location in golden,colorado.
sunset manor is a facility located in brush,colorado,which is more than miles from golden.in,plaintiff was hired by sunset manor as the housekeeper supervisor,and in her responsibilities were expanded to include the position of laundry department supervisor.in,defendant entered into an agreement to provide housekeeping and laundry services to sunset manor.plaintiff employment with sunset manor was transferred to defendant,and plaintiff became the account manager for defendant sunset manor account.defendant assumed all responsibility for retaining,transferring,or firing plaintiff and also paid her salary and provided her benefits.plaintiff duties,however,remained essentially the same as when she was employed directly by sunset manor.
plaintiff worked out of an office at sunset manor in brush.when plaintiff reported to her district manager,she reported to him at defendant regional office in golden.such reports were almost always by telephone or through the submission of written reports plaintiff went to the golden office only for an occasional district meeting of account managers.sunset manor administrator exercised supervision and control over plaintiff when plaintiff was employed by sunset manor,and this did not change after plaintiff became an employee of defendant.plaintiff believed that she had a job at sunset manor and planned to work there until her retirement at age.
on november,plaintiff injured her right hip in a related automobile accident.plaintiff got permission from defendant to take two periods of leave,and plaintiff began the first period of leave on december.on february,when plaintiff failed to report to work after the expiration of the second period of leave,defendant terminated plaintiff employment.
although defendant had granted plaintiff two periods of leave,defendant denied plaintiff request for leave under the family and medical leave act fmla,et.the fmla requires covered employers to provide eligible employees with up to weeks of medical leave per year for,inter alia,a serious health condition that renders the employee unable to work.id.a d.only those employees whose employer employs at least employees within miles of that employee worksite are eligible for leave under the act.id.b ii.the statutory term worksite is defined in a dol regulation.see a.
defendant denied plaintiff request for fmla leave based on defendant conclusion that plaintiff was not employed at a worksite at which defendant employed or more employees within miles,and that she was therefore ineligible for fmla leave.this conclusion was based on the premise that plaintiff worksite was sunset manor in brush,rather than defendant regional office in golden.during the relevant time period,defendant employed fewer than employees within miles of sunset manor but employed more than employees within miles of its regional office in golden.
plaintiff filed this lawsuit,alleging that defendant wrongfully denied her request for medical leave under the fmla and wrongfully terminated her.defendant moved for summary judgment in part on the ground that the relevant portion of the dol regulation defining the statutory term worksite was invalid.see harbert healthcare servs.group,d.the district court upheld the regulation and denied defendant motion for summary judgment.see id.
after a bench trial,the district court concluded that plaintiff worksite under the applicable regulation was defendant regional office in golden,colorado.because defendant employed more than employees within miles of its golden office,the court held that defendant wrongfully denied plaintiff benefits under the fmla.the district court awarded plaintiff back pay,front pay,liquidated damages,interest,costs,and attorney fees.
in this appeal,defendant concedes that the applicable dol regulation identifies plaintiff worksite as its regional office in golden.defendant argues only that this regulation is invalid,contending that the agency exceeded its authority to implement the fmla.
discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
we first address whether we have jurisdiction to consider the merits of this appeal.on march,the district court entered an order resolving the issue of liability in plaintiff favor and setting forth a formula for the calculation of damages.the court instructed the parties to meet to determine the precise amount of damages and prepare a judgment in accordance with that determination.defendant filed a notice of appeal on april.the district court later entered judgment,fixing damages in the amount agreed upon by the parties and disposing of the case.no new notice of appeal was taken from the subsequent judgment.defendant now wishes to appeal only the issue of liability resolved in the march decision,not the subsequent calculation of damages.
under,we have jurisdiction only over final decisions of the district court.albright unum life ins.of,cir.accordingly,we must determine whether the march only order from which a notice of appeal was a final decision and,if not,whether it became final when the district court subsequently fixed damages and disposed of the case.
whether the march order was a final decision 
for a ruling to be final,it must end the litigation on the merits,and the judge must clearly declare his intention in this respect.firstier mortgage investors mortgage ins,d internal quotations and citations omitted.a final order is one that leave s nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.albright,at internal quotations omitted.as a general rule,the touchstone of a final order is a decision by the court that a party shall recover only a sum certain.id.citing.internal quotations omitted emphasis in original.accordingly,an order that determines liability but leaves damages to be calculated is not final.id.however,pursuant to an exception to the general rule,an order is final even if it does not reduce the damages to a sum certain if the order sufficiently disposes of the factual and legal issues and any unresolved issues are sufficiently ministerial that there would be no likelihood of further appeal.id.at quotations omitted.
for example,in albright unum life insurance of america,the plaintiff had requested in his motion for summary judgment the monthly benefit of of his preinjury basic monthly earnings less other income benefits such as workers compensation and social security disability.id.at quotation omitted.the district court granted his motion but did not address the issue of benefits.id.we stated that both determining the correct amount of monthly benefits and the proper deductions for other income benefits may prove to be complicated and disputed calculations and were not likely to be simply ministerial.id.at.accordingly,we held that the district court order was not final,and we dismissed the defendant appeal.id.at.
in this case,the district court awarded plaintiff back pay,front pay,liquidated damages,interest,costs,and attorney fees.specifically,the district court set total back pay in the amount of,to be reduced by the amount plaintiff has earned since her termination through other employment together with interest on the net amount at the legal rate.the district court set total front pay in the amount of,to be reduced by the amount of compensation plaintiff would earn from conoco until her birthday,calculated at her present rate of earnings per week plus any guaranteed raises or cost of living increases.
the district court then ordered the parties to meet and confer within days from the date hereof to determine the precise amounts to be set forth in the judgment in accordance with the above stated findings and conclusions.the district further directed,if counsel can agree,they shall prepare a judgment in accordance herewith.if counsel are unable to agree,they shall notify the court within the following ten days and the matters not agreed upon will be set for hearing.
the various components of the damages award were not sufficiently fixed to satisfy the standard we set forth in albright.the amount of plaintiff past and future earnings was not determined,and calculation of those amounts could have proven complicated and disputed.for example,nothing in the order indicates whether plaintiff weekly compensation at conoco is fixed or varies,and nothing in the order defines a guaranteed raise or cost of living increase.as such,the process of calculating damages in this case was no more ministerial than it was in albright itself.
moreover,the district court must have contemplated the possibility of a contentious process because it provided in its order that if the parties could not agree on the amount of the award,the disputed issues would be set for hearing.by so providing,the district court did not clearly declar e his intention to end the litigation on the merits in the march order.firstier,at.for these reasons,we hold that the court march decision was not a final decision.
whether the march order became final when the district court disposed of the remainder of the case 
in lewis goodrich,we held that an otherwise nonfinal decision becomes final and appealable if the district court adjudicates all remaining claims against all remaining parties before the appellate court acts to dismiss the appeal on the merits for lack of jurisdiction,cir en banc see also old republic ins.durango air,cir dodd ins,royal ins.of,cir fed.sav.loan ins.huff,cir en banc moore federal practice,at if an order is not certified under rule b,but a notice of appeal is nevertheless filed,any subsequent order of the district court that completely adjudicates the remaining claims is sufficient to validate the otherwise premature notice of appeal.accordingly,a decision that is otherwise nonfinal because it leaves damages unresolved becomes final and appealable if adjudications in the district court precisely fix damages and dispose of the case.motors new chevrolet,cir.
here,subsequent to the notice of appeal,the district court entered a judgment fixing damages.all claims against all parties are now resolved.the district court nonfinal decision therefore became final as a result of the proceedings in the district court.we hold that the notice of appeal filed in this case was effective to confer appellate jurisdiction over the district court march order.see lewis,at motors,at.
defendant challenges only the validity of a,the department of labor regulation defining the worksite of employees.both parties agree that this joint employment provision,if valid,governs this case and that it would lead to a conclusion that plaintiff was a covered employee.we review a district court decision regarding the validity of an agency regulation de novo.see pub.lands council babbitt,cir.
the framework we use to analyze an agency construction of a statute it administers was set forth by the supreme court in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.chevron mandates a inquiry.first,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.because the judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction,it must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent.id.at.to ascertain whether congress had an intent on the precise question at issue,courts should employ traditional tools of statutory construction.id.these tools include examination of the statute text,structure,purpose,history,and relationship to other statutes.see dynamics land,cline,d.
i f the court determines congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute,as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.rather,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.
chevron,at.footnote omitted.the court explained that an agency answer is permissible unless arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute 
the power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left,implicitly or explicitly,by congress.if congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.such legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.sometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit rather than explicit.in such a case,a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.
id.at.internal quotations and citations omitted footnotes omitted.
a.the family and medical leave act fmla 
the fmla was enacted,in part,to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families and to entitle employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers.b.the act entitles eligible employees of covered employers to take up to weeks of unpaid,leave each year because of,among other things,a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.id.a d.
as part of the balance that was struck between the interests of employers and the interests of employees,congress included a small employer exception that excludes from the act coverage employers with fewer than employees.id.a i.a separate exception was granted for small is,a potentially large company with a relatively small satellite office in a particular area.specifically,the statute excludes from coverage any employee whose employer employs less than employees within miles of that employee worksite the provision.id.b ii.according to the house committee report,the provision recognizes the difficulties an employer may have in reassigning workers to geographically separate facilities.i,at.
with these eligibility restrictions,congress recognized that only about to percent of all employees would be covered by the act,at i,at.
b.the fmla regulation defining worksite 
congress granted the secretary of labor the authority to prescribe such regulations as are necessary to carry out the fmla.the regulation at issue in this case,a,defines the worksite of an employee who is jointly employed by two or more employers as follows 
for purposes of determining that employee eligibility,when an employee is jointly employed by two or more employers see,the employee worksite is the primary employer office from which the employee is assigned or reports.the employee is also counted by the secondary employer to determine eligibility for the secondary employer or permanent employees.
id.a.section a states that two entities may be considered joint employers where they both exercise some control over the work or working conditions of the employee.id.a.for example,joint employment will ordinarily be found to exist when a temporary agency supplies employees to a second employer.id.b.in joint employment relationships,the primary employer is the only employer responsible for providing fmla leave.id.c.the primary employer is determined by considering such factors as the authority to hire and fire,the employee,make payroll,and provide employment benefits.id.
in this case,the district court identified plaintiff as jointly employed by both defendant and sunset manor,applied a,and defined defendant as plaintiff primary employer.none of this is at issue in this appeal.what is at issue is whether a is a valid regulation implementing the fmla.
c.the chevron analysis 
pursuant to chevron mandate,we must first consider whether congress expressed a clear intent with respect to the meaning of worksite for an employee who is jointly employed.see at.we conclude that congressional intent with respect to this issue is not sufficiently clear to render the regulation invalid under the first step of chevron.
a fundamental canon of statutory construction is that,unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.perrin united states,d cbc,bd.of governors of the fed.reserve,cir.congress did not define the term worksite in the fmla.however,the common understanding of the term worksite is the site where the employee works.here,the parties do not dispute that plaintiff worked at sunset manor in brush,colorado.under the ordinary meaning of the term,her worksite would be sunset manor in brush.however,under the joint employment regulation,a,plaintiff worksite is defendant regional office in golden,a place where plaintiff went only for occasional meetings of account managers.nonetheless,congress did not expressly define the term worksite in the fmla,and because congress has not directly spoken to the question at issue,we proceed to a analysis under chevron.
under the second step of chevron,we must give controlling weight to the agency regulations unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,at.in light of the deference we owe an agency construction of the statute,this case presents a very close question.however,we conclude that a,as applied to the situation of an employee with a fixed place of work,is arbitrary,capricious,and manifestly contrary to the fmla.we first address the three indicia of congressional intent that lead us to this conclusion,and then consider the made by plaintiff and the secretary of labor.
common meaning of the term worksite 
we concluded above that the agency definition of worksite,as applied to plaintiff,runs contrary to the common meaning of that term.see discussion supra.that the agency definition of plaintiff worksite contravenes the plain meaning of the term worksite is one indicia of congressional intent that militates against deference to the agency construction of the statute under the second step of chevron.
legislative purpose 
courts must guard against interpretations that might defeat a statute purpose.united states,cir quotations and alterations omitted.the agency definition of worksite,as applied to plaintiff,is contrary to the purpose underlying the provision.
as discussed above,congress included a provision in the fmla excluding from the act coverage employers with fewer than employees.a i.however,congress also recognized that even potentially large employers,those with more than employees may have difficulty finding temporary replacements for employees who work at geographically scattered locations.congress therefore determined that if any employer large or small has no significant pool of employees nearby to cover for an absent employee,that employer should not be required to provide fmla leave to that employee.specifically,congress determined that an employer must employ at least employees within miles of the employee worksite.id.b ii.
the house report confirms that the congressional purpose underlying the provision was to remove the burden of providing fmla leave from employers who do not have an abundant supply of temporary replacements in close geographic proximity to the employee requesting leave 
for purposes of determining the size of an employer,there is a geographic limitation of a radius that applies to the aggregation of employees at different facilities.this provision recognizes the difficulties an employer may have in reassigning workers to geographically separate facilities.
an employer ability to replace a particular employee during his or her period of leave will depend on where that employee must perform his or her work.in general,therefore,the congressional purpose underlying the provision is not effected if the worksite of an employee who has a regular place of work is defined as any site other than that place 
for example,if defendant were to grant leave to plaintiff,defendant would have been required to find an employee to cover for plaintiff at sunset manor in brush,colorado.it is undisputed that defendant employed fewer than employees within miles of brush.defendant therefore had no abundant supply of employees who could have covered for plaintiff during her period of leave.defendant,a large employer with geographically dispersed employees,is precisely the type of employer congress intended to protect with its enactment of the provision.
accordingly,a regulatory provision that defines plaintiff worksite as defendant regional office in golden does not effect the congressional purpose underlying the provision.
arbitrary distinction between sole and joint employers 
the challenged regulation also creates an arbitrary distinction between sole employers and joint employers.for example,if the employer is a company that operates a chain of convenience stores,the worksite of an employee hired to work at one of those convenience stores is that particular convenience store.see.if,on the other hand,the employer is a placement company that hires certain specialized employees to work at convenience stores owned by another entity and therefore is considered a joint employer,the worksite of that same employee hired to work at that same convenience store is the office of the placement company.see a.
assuming both employers employ more than employees within miles of their central office but fewer than employees within miles of the convenience store,the employee is ineligible for fmla leave if the employer is a sole employer,the company that owns the convenience store chain but eligible for fmla leave if the employer is a joint employer,the placement company.
accordingly,the joint employment provision creates the possibility that an employer responsibility to provide fmla leave to an employee will depend exclusively on whether that employer is a sole employer or a joint employer.this is true despite the fact that neither employer has an abundant supply of nearby employees to replace temporarily an employee taking leave and,consequently,are both subject to the burden congress tried to alleviate by enacting the provision.see discussion supra section.the effect of the joint employment provision is to require the joint employer to bear that burden even though the sole employer is relieved of that burden.because both types of employers bear the burden the provision was designed to alleviate,there is simply no basis in the statute or in logic for such a distinction we owe no deference to an agency arbitrary construction of a statute.see chevron,at.
in sum,the ordinary meaning of the term worksite,the congressional p
