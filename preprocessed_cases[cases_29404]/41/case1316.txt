after two decades of employment with her county government,dorothy goelzer was fired from her job.her supervisor informed her of the termination decision two weeks before she was scheduled to begin two months of leave under the family and medical leave act fmla.this leave did not mark the first time goelzer was away from work on fmla leave,as goelzer had taken a significant amount of authorized fmla leave during the four preceding years to deal with her own health issues and those of her mother and husband.after she lost her job,goelzer brought this suit and alleged that her employer had interfered with her right to reinstatement under the fmla and had retaliated against her for taking fmla leave.the defendants contend that her supervisor simply decided to hire another person with a larger skill set.the district court agreed with the defendants and granted summary judgment against goelzer.we,however,conclude that goelzer has marshaled enough evidence for this case to reach a trier of fact,including comments suggesting her supervisor dissatisfaction with her use of fmla leave,her positive performance reviews,and the timing of her termination.therefore,we reverse the entry of summary judgment against her.
