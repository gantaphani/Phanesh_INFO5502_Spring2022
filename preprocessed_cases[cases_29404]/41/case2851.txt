appellants mylan laboratories,mylan technologies,and mylan pharmaceuticals,mylan appeal the district court summary judgment upholding the decision of appellee food and drug administration fda.the fda decision granted appellees alza and janssen pharmaceutica,both subsidiaries of johnson and johnson,collectively,alza a period of pediatric marketing exclusivity,pursuant to,following expiration of the final patent for alza brand name transdermal fentanyl system,the duragesic patch,which releases fentanyl,a narcotic analgesic,through the skin to treat chronic pain.mylan contends the fda final approval of mylan abbreviated new drug applications anda to market a generic version of the duragesic patch,granted before the fda issued the decision challenged here,entitled mylan to market its generic product immediately upon expiration of the patent pursuant to j,without regard to pediatric exclusivity.for the reasons set out below,we affirm the district court judgment upholding the fda decision.
this appeal requires that the court consider three separate statutory provisions j,a provision of the amendments to the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,which authorizes a drug manufacturer to submit an anda to the fda to obtain approval of a generic version of a previously approved drug,a amendment to the fdca,which authorizes an extra pediatric exclusivity period following expiration of a drug patent for a patent holder that has satisfactorily conducted pediatric testing of its drug upon the fda request and e,a patent statute,also enacted in the amendments,which sets out the exclusive remedies available in a patent infringement action.we begin with a summary of these three provisions.
applicable statutory provisions 
the anda provision,j,creates an approval for applicants seeking to market generic versions of approved drugs.under this provision the generic applicant need not conduct its own clinical trials if the anda certifies that the generic version is bioequivalent to an approved drug.in addition,the anda must include one of four statutory certifications regarding the approved drug patent status 
i that such patent information has not been filed,
ii that such patent has expired,
iii the date on which such patent will expire,or 
iv that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of the new drug for which the application is submitted 
j a vii i iv paragraphs.if the anda contains a paragraph iv certification,the applicant must,within days of the anda filing,send a notice to the patent holder stating it has submitted an anda with the paragraph iv certification and setting out the factual and legal bases for believing the patent is invalid or will not be infringed.j b.
the anda provision also establishes the effective date for approval of the anda,depending on the particular certification made.
if the applicant makes a certification under paragraph i or ii,the approval may be made effective immediately.j b i.
if the certification is under paragraph iii,the approval may be made effective on the date certified under paragraph iii.j b ii.
if the certification is under paragraph iv,the approval shall be made effective immediately unless the patent holder files an infringement action in the district court within days of receiving the notice,in which event the approval shall be made effective upon the expiration of the period beginning on the date of the receipt of the notice,unless the district court rules on the infringement claim within the period.see j b iii.if the district court issues a ruling during the stay period,the anda approval date is determined by the decision of the district court,or the appellate court if appealed 
the pediatric exclusivity provision,provides an incentive for a drug patent holder to conduct pediatric studies of a drug which the fda believes may have beneficial pediatric use.under the statute,the fda must first request that the drug patent holder conduct pediatric studies if the requested studies are satisfactorily completed and submitted within the time frame,the patent holder is eligible to receive a period of market exclusivity for the drug beyond the patent expiration date.c.the pediatric exclusivity provision expressly addresses the effect of a grant of pediatric exclusivity,depending on the particular certification included in the anda 
a if the drug is the subject of 
i a listed patent for which a certification has been submitted under paragraph ii and for which pediatric studies were submitted prior to the expiration of the patent including any patent extensions or 
ii a listed patent for which a certification has been submitted under paragraph iii,
the period during which an application may not be approved under section j b of this title shall be extended by a period of six months after the date the patent expires including any patent extensions or 
b if the drug is the subject of a listed patent for which a certification has been submitted under paragraph iv,and in the patent infringement litigation resulting from the certification the court determines that the patent is valid and would be infringed,the period during which an application may not be approved under section j b of this title shall be extended by a period of six months after the date the patent expires including any patent extensions.
finally,a patent statute provision,authorizes the following remedies in a patent infringement action 
for an act of infringement described in paragraph 
a the court shall order the effective date of any approval of the drug or veterinary biological product involved in the infringement to be a date which is not earlier than the date of the expiration of the patent which has been infringed,
b injunctive relief may be granted against an infringer to prevent the commercial manufacture,use,offer to sell,or sale within the united states or importation into the united states of an approved drug or veterinary biological product,and 
c damages or other monetary relief may be awarded against an infringer only if there has been commercial manufacture,use,offer to sell,or sale within the united states or importation into the united states of an approved drug or veterinary biological product.
the remedies prescribed by subparagraphs a,b,and c are the only remedies which may be granted by a court for an act of infringement described in paragraph,except that a court may award attorney fees under section.
b.this proceeding 
appellee alza owned patent patent for duragesic.by its terms the patent expired on july.
in july the fda wrote alza requesting that it perform pediatric studies of duragesic pursuant to c.alza submitted the requested studies in november.on january,the fda granted alza a pediatric exclusivity period.
meanwhile,in october mylan filed with the fda an anda to market its generic fentanyl transdermal system pursuant to j with a paragraph iv certification that alza patent was invalid or would not be infringed by mylan marketing of its generic product.as required under j b,on december,mylan sent alza notice of its anda application and certification which alza received on december.on january,the day after notice was received,alza filed a patent infringement action against mylan in the united states district court for the district of vermont.because the action was not brought within the statutory window following notice receipt,there was no automatic stay and,under j b iii,mylan anda was to be made effective immediately.accordingly,on november,the fda granted final approval of mylan anda.
on march,the vermont district court issued a decision holding that t he patent is not invalid and mylan anda filing for a generic version of duragesic infringe s the patent.alza mylan,d.the court therefore enjoined mylan from making,using,offering to sell,selling within the united states or importing into the united states its generic fentanyl transdermal system.d at.regarding mylan anda approval,the court stated simply that the effective date of any approval of mylan anda product shall be no earlier than the date of expiration of the patent family.id.mylan appealed the decision to the federal circuit where it remains pending.
in the meantime,both mylan and alza sought a determination from the fda on whether mylan could lawfully market its generic fentanyl transdermal system when the patent expired or whether mylan was required to wait until the pediatric exclusivity period expired.in two letters dated june,the fda issued its administrative decision.
in the first letter letter,addressed to counsel for both parties,the fda concluded that alza pediatric exclusivity for fentanyl will attach,and thus delay effective approval of mylan anda,so that u nless mylan were to win its patent case on appeal,mylan anda would be eligible for final effective approval no earlier than six months after the patent expires on july.letter at.the fda rested its decision on two key determinations.
first,the fda concluded that the vermont district court order that the effective date of any approval of mylan anda product shall be no earlier than the date of expiration of the patent family,d at,transformed mylan anda approval into an approval with a delayed effective date,which is a tentative approval that can not be made effective until fda issues a letter granting final effective approval.letter at citing b v barr labs.thompson,d.
second,the fda concluded that,when alza patent expired,mylan paragraph iv certification would no longer be accurate and mylan would be required to amend it or,i f mylan refuses to amend its application to change its certification after the patent expires,fda can treat that certification as automatically amended to contain a paragraph ii certification because there is no other proper certification upon expiry.letter at citing ranbaxy labs.fda,d,aff.cir.then,once mylan certification converted to paragraph ii,pediatric exclusivity attaches under c a i,letter at citing ranbaxy,d at,so that the period during which an anda may not be approved shall be extended by a period of six months after the date the patent expires,id.quoting c a i.
in the second letter letter,addressed to mylan only,the fda informed mylan that,in light of the vermont district court decision,the agency hereby rescinds the final approval of anda issued on november,and regards anda as tentatively approved.letter at.the letter again noted that,after the vermont district court order,mylan anda approval had a delayed effective date,which,by fda regulation,constitutes tentative,rather than final,approval.id.citing a accordingly,the fda informed mylan final approval can not be granted earlier than the date of a court decision finding the patents invalid,not infringed or unenforceable,or the expiration date of the patent and any period of pediatric exclusivity granted to the nda holder.id.at noting that mylan anda was subject to alza pediatric exclusivity for fentanyl transdermal system.
on june,mylan filed this action in the district court seeking a determination that the fda revocation of mylan final anda approval was unlawful and an injunction prohibiting the fda from revoking the final approval of mylan anda and from applying alza pediatric exclusivity to mylan anda.mylan thompson,d.in a decision filed august,the district court granted summary judgment in the fda favor,concluding that the agency did not improperly revoke or reclassify its final approval of mylan anda for a generic version of a fentanyl transdermal system to a tentative approval and did not improperly apply alza pediatric exclusivity to mylan anda.d at.mylan appealed the district court summary judgment.
the court reviews the district court summary judgment decision de novo and we may affirm only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.trans union llc fed.trade comm n,quoting gilvin fire,quoting anderson liberty lobby,d quoting.c.we review the fda decision under the administrative procedure act,a.serono labs.shalala,citing troy browner,schering fda,cir.accordingly,we must uphold the fda decision unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.we conclude that the fda decision was none of these.
at issue is the fda application of the statutory provisions summarized above.ordinarily we review an agency interpretation of a statute it is charged with implementing under the familiar and deferential framework of chevron natural resources defense council,d.pharm.research mfrs.of am.thompson.mylan contends,however,that only minimal deference is owed to the fda interpretation of the fdca because it was expressed in letters to the parties and is not embodied in any regulation,much less a regulation that was subject to notice and comment rulemaking.appellants br.at.the fda letter decisions,mylan maintains,are analogous to opinion letters,id.at quoting skidmore swift,and therefore do not warrant deference but are entitled only to respect and even then only to the extent that those interpretations have the power to persuade,christensen harris county,d quoting skidmore,at.at other citations omitted.we are not persuaded by mylan argument and conclude,as did the district court,that the fda decision is entitled to chevron deference 
t he want of notice and comment does not decide the case against chevron deference.barnhart walton,d quoting united states mead,d.indeed,mead pointed to instances in which the court has applied chevron deference to agency interpretations that did not emerge out of rulemaking,id.citing united states mead,at.at citing nationsbank of,variable annuity life ins,d.w hether a court should give such deference depends in significant part upon the interpretive method used and the nature of the question at issue.id.citing mead,at.at.in barnhart the court concluded that the interstitial nature of the legal question,the related expertise of the agency,the importance of the question to administration of the statute,the complexity of that administration,and the careful consideration the agency has given the question over a long period of time all indicate that chevron provides the appropriate legal lens through which to view the legality of the agency interpretation here at issue.id.we reach the same conclusion here.
there is no denying the complexity of the statutory regime under which the fda operates,the fda expertise or the careful craft of the scheme it devised to reconcile the various statutory provisions.further,the fda decision made no great legal leap but relied in large part on its previous determination of the same or similar issues and on its own regulations.see letter at citing b v,barr and ranbaxy letter at citing a.we therefore accord chevron deference to the fda letter decision here,as we have previously done on at least one other occasion.see abbott labs.young,cert.denied,d reviewing under chevron letter decision construing term active ingredient in anda provision,j d i,v id.at edwards,dissenting applying chevron see also barr labs.thompson,d,applying chevron to fda letter ruling 
under the chevron framework,i f congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,we must give effect to congress unambiguously expressed intent but i f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,we ask whether the agency position rests on a permissible construction of the statute.pharm.research,at quoting beverly health rehab.servs.nlrb,quoting chevron,at.at.in applying the fdca provisions to the particular facts here,the fda found two ambiguities.
first,application of the various statutory provisions results in conflicting effective dates for mylan anda.the patent infringement remedy statute,e a,directs that the court deciding the infringement action shall order the effective date of any approval of the drug or veterinary biological product involved in the infringement to be a date which is not earlier than the date of the expiration of the patent which has been infringed,which is precisely what the vermont district court did here,directing that the effective date of any approval of mylan anda product shall be no earlier than the date of expiration of the patent family,d at yet under j b iii,approval of the paragraph iv anda was to be made effective immediat
