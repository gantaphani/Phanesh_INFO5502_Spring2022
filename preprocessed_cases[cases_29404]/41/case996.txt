background 
in,jakubowski graduated from the university of medical sciences in poznan,poland.he unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a medical residency in the united states through the match process,by which hospitals and residency prospects choose each other.however,he obtained a residency position at elizabeth hospital in youngstown,ohio through the scramble process,which allows applicants who were unsuccessful in the match process to find remaining residency positions.in july,he began his residency,but struggled and did not perform well.he was placed in a remediation program in october to improve his areas of weakness,but at the end of his first year,he was informed that elizabeth would not renew his contract for a second year.
recognizing that his clinical and patient skills were weak compared to graduates of american medical schools,jakubowski enrolled at the new york medical college for a program of supervised clinical training.there,he received mixed reviews,with the negative evaluations focused on his lack of communication skills.
after this program,jakubowski looked for a second residency.he again participated in the match process with no success,but found a residency through the scramble process at christ hospital in cincinnati.he began his residency there in july.during an initial orientation,he again received mixed reviews.while he placed in the ninetieth percentile nationally on a medical knowledge exam,he performed poorly on an emotional intelligence exam,and supervising physicians noted his weak communication skills with patients.supervisors identified,social competence,and relationship management as areas of deficiency for jakubowski.additionally,an attending physician,jeffrey morgeson,observed that when working with patients,jakubowski had poor organizational skills,skipped standard procedures in his examinations,and performed procedures incorrectly.
at the conclusion of orientation,diller suspected that jakubowski suffered from a cognitive disorder.diller referred him to linda hartmann for a psychological evaluation,and specifically to determine if he had asperger.diller did not make his suspicions known to other attending physicians at christ hospital.
during jakubowski first night on call after orientation,he was unable to keep up the necessary pace in seeing patients.his supervising physician had to relieve him,and noted that jakubowski could not properly relay instructions between healthcare professionals.during the first week of august,one attending physician,ellis,criticized his performance and recommended that he be placed on remediation.he noted that jakubowski had an average to below average medical knowledge,had difficulty exploring possible diagnoses,did not communicate with the nurses well,and had difficulty answering,and communicating on,the phone.another attending physician,bernheisel,remarked that jakubowski could not be trusted and had given dangerous orders that would have harmed patients if not caught by other physicians.in another instance,jakubowski wrote an unclear order for medication for a patient that,if interpreted and administered literally,would have killed the patient.jakubowski never actually harmed a patient during his residency.
on august,hartmann sent a letter to diller explaining that she suspected that jakubowski had asperger,but she could not be sure without speaking to jakubowski family about his past.
on august,bernheisel informed jakubowski that he had failed his inpatient rotation and he would have to repeat it.
on august,hartmann formally diagnosed jakubowski and informed him that he had asperger.that same day,jakubowski received a letter from diller informing him that he would be terminated from his residency on september.at that time,diller had not yet received hartmann letter explaining her potential diagnosis because it had been lost in office mail.jakubowski met with diller,bernheisel,and another attending physician,jeffrey schlaudecker,that same day and informed them that he had been diagnosed with asperger.
on september,jakubowski attorney sent a letter to christ hospital proposing that it accommodate jakubowski disability with knowledge and understanding.the letter explained that jakubowski could successfully continue his residency if the other physicians and nurses were made aware of his condition and the symptoms and triggers of asperger.jakubowski conceded he would have to improve his communication skills with patients,but insisted that he could do this alone.the parties then met to discuss the proposed accommodation,at which time diller informed jakubowski that christ hospital did not have sufficient resources to comply with the proposal.however,diller offered to assist jakubowski in finding a residency in pathology,a field that requires little or no patient interaction.
jakubowski appealed his termination to the graduate medical education committee at christ hospital.on december,the committee affirmed his termination.
lynda geller,presented expert testimony during discovery that there are many ways christ hospital could have accommodated jakubowski asperger.she also presented evidence of a remediation program that christ hospital had previously offered a struggling resident.the previous resident had difficulty following instructions from other physicians for treatment,adjusting treatment plans as new information was obtained,applying medical knowledge to clinical interactions with patients,and making timely diagnoses.as part of his remediation program,christ hospital paused his rotation for four months,assigned an attending physician to monitor him while he saw patients three mornings a week,assigned a medical faculty member to monitor him one morning a week,assigned bernheisel to work with him and fifteen patients a month,gave him a full day every week to study,and assigned him a personal mentor to improve his medical knowledge.if the resident did not improve in the initial four months,he would be able to continue the remediation for an additional four months.geller opined that this resident shortcomings were similar to jakubowski,and that christ hospital could have offered a similar remediation program to jakubowski.geller testified that her recommendations had nothing to do with patient safety.she did not purport to have any expertise in patient safety,and had no opinion regarding how jakubowski asperger would affect patient safety.geller testimony and observations regarding the previous resident were not available when jakubowski and diller met to discuss accommodations as she was an expert witness obtained later for litigation purposes.jakubowski did not propose a remediation program as part of his proposed accommodation at the meeting with diller.
jakubowski described his condition during discovery,saying that he has trouble communicating his thoughts to people and processing what people communicate to him.he also said he could have trouble gathering data.
a medical expert,jeffery chaudhari,who had previously worked with jakubowski in new york,testified during discovery for christ hospital.he opined that being a physician requires excellent skills in relating to patients and.he also rated jakubowski performance as,and remembered that jakubowski had difficulty relating to colleagues and gathering information from a patient and integrating it.another medical expert who had experience with jakubowski at elizabeth,rudolph krafft,also testified during discovery for christ hospital.he stated that getting information from patients accurately is very important for a physician,and that a physician would be unqualified if he had no ability to pick up on the subtleties of human interaction.
two other physicians at christ hospital,vasyl and martin,evaluated jakubowski with the following descriptions clueless,reports data incorrectly,not trusted,has no concept of his patients,leaves out outpatient information,says yes to things but has not done them,lack of insight,lack of organization,unable to communicate,lack of attention,and presents untruth sic.
donald swikert,director of the family medicine residency program at elizabeth,worked with jakubowski there and also testified during discovery for christ hospital.he recalled that jakubowski exhibited deficiencies that put patients in danger.he also opined that the accommodations recommended by geller would be unreasonable for the following reasons christ hospital would be responsible for freeing up significant time from educational and patient care training for an indefinite period of time and for an indefinite frequency these recommendations would require significant patient care coverage issues by faculty and residents the recommendations would have a significant adverse impact on the program,particularly the training of other residents because they would be pulled from their usual responsibilities and educational opportunities the program would have to significant physician time so as to effectively work with martin jakubowski patients would have to be actively recruited who would be willing to participate in such a remediation program and sixty observed patient evaluations and the subsequent analysis,review and work with martin jakubowski to address the broad scope of deficiencies would take,at a minimum,months to accomplish and would significantly impact the resources available for the training of other residents in the program.furthermore,swikert added that the accommodations proposed by lynda geller,and martin jakubowski do not consider the significant patient care and patient safety concerns.

iii.discussion 
jakubowski claims that the district court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of christ hospital.specifically,he argues that the district court erred by concluding that he was not an otherwise qualified individual pursuant to the disabilities act,the rehabilitation act,and ohio discrimination laws impermissibly weighing evidence and deciding that the proposed accommodations were not reasonable finding that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether christ hospital engaged in a good faith interactive process to accommodate his disability failing to afford reasonable inferences in his favor and incorrectly concluding that christ hospital satisfied its burden of proof regarding the direct threat defense and concluding that the proposed accommodations created an undue hardship.in response,christ hospital claims that no reasonable accommodation existed jakubowski proposed accommodations posed an undue hardship for christ hospital and a direct threat to jakubowski patients christ hospital engaged in the interactive accommodation process in good faith with jakubowski christ hospital decision to terminate jakubowski was based on his poor performance and patient safety and jakubowski concealment of his past,failed residencies at other hospitals was reason enough for him to be terminated.
a.the americans with disabilities act 
as an initial matter,analysis of claims made pursuant to the americans with disabilities act applies to claims made pursuant to ohio revised code and the rehabilitation act.kleiber honda of am,cir citation omitted applying americans with disabilities act analysis to claims made pursuant to ohio revised code doe woodford cnty.bd.of,cir the sixth circuit discusses claims under the american with disabilities act and the rehabilitation act concurrently because the purpose,scope,and governing standards of the acts are largely the same,cases construing one statute are instructive in construing the other quoting mcpherson michigan high school athletic ass n,cir.therefore,the following discussion of the americans with disabilities act applies to all of jakubowski claims.
pursuant to section a of the act,an employer may not discriminatorily terminate an otherwise qualified individual on the basis of his disability.one form of discrimination occurs when an employer fails to make reasonable accommodations to an employee known disability,unless those accommodations would cause undue hardship to the employer.b a.to recover on a claim of discrimination under the act,a plaintiff must show that he is an individual with a disability he is otherwise qualified to perform the job requirements,with or without reasonable accommodation and he was discharged solely by reason of his handicap.monette data,cir.
the district court found that jakubowski asperger was a disability for purposes of the act.this conclusion is not disputed by christ hospital.therefore,the issues on appeal concern whether jakubowski was an otherwise qualified individual for purposes of the act,which,in turn,depends on the interactive accommodation process between him and christ hospital.
reasonable accommodations and otherwise qualified individuals 
jakubowski claims the district court erred by concluding that he was not an otherwise qualified individual.the term qualified individual means an individual who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.essential functions are fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds.n.c onsideration shall be given to the employer judgment as to what functions of a job are essential id.
christ hospital identified communicating with professional colleagues and patients in ways that ensure patient safety as an essential function that jakubowski must be able to perform.based on the uncontroverted evidence in the record,it appears that many healthcare professionals work together to care for a single patient.the ultimate success of that care requires the patient,physicians,nurses,and technicians to communicate clearly with each other,or else,patients could be harmed or even die.furthermore,as the employer,christ hospital identification of these functions as essential should be given some consideration.see.accordingly,we agree that there is no dispute that these functions are essential to the work of a family practice physician residency training program.because jakubowski admittedly had difficulty performing these functions,some kind of accommodations would be necessary for him to continue his work.see id.b a.thus,whether jakubowski was a qualified individual depends on whether he proposed a reasonable accommodation to account for his disability.
jakubowski proposed accommodations and the essential functions of his position 
if a disabled employee requires an accommodation,the employee is saddled with the burden of proposing an accommodation and proving that it is reasonable.monette,at.furthermore,the plaintiff has the burden of proving that he will be capable of performing the essential functions of the job with the proposed accommodation.id.at.reasonable accommodations may include 
making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,job restructuring
