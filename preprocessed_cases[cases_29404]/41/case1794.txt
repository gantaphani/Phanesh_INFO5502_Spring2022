the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc brought this action against stores,alleging that violated the americans with disabilities act ada.the eeoc contends that improperly refused to hire steven bradley because of mobility limitations caused by cerebral palsy.the district court granted motion for summary judgment,concluding that bradley impairment rendered him unqualified for the positions of greeter and cashier and that insufficient evidence existed from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that reasons for not hiring bradley were pretextual.we hold that material facts remain in dispute and therefore reverse.
background 
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the eeoc,the nonmoving party.cerebral palsy limits bradley use of his legs.the condition forces bradley to use forearm crutches for walks and a wheelchair for longer distances.standing for more than to minutes is also difficult for him.with support,however,bradley can walk,climb stairs,and get on and off of a slowly.bradley condition also restricts his third and fourth fingers,as they generally work as a unit and preclude him from using his fourth finger,for example,when typing.his limited hand dexterity,however,does not limit his ability to write,hold things,or complete daily living tasks,such as carrying laundry or groceries or doing his own housekeeping.bradley grip strength is normal,and his arm strength allows him to lift heavy objects even from his wheelchair.
bradley applied for a assistant position at his local in july while he was employed as a proofreader at banta publishing,inc banta on his application,bradley indicated that he was seeking employment,was willing to work from until close during the weekdays,and stated that working on weekends was negotiable.in response to a question on the july application asking whether could contact bradley current employer,bradley checked no,explaining that his employer would fire him if it found out that he was seeking work.did not hire bradley in july.
in early,expanded its store in richmond,missouri,into a supercenter,which required it to hire additional employees.received hundreds of applications for the new positions.to facilitate the hiring process,created a hiring committee,comprised of several new managers,including maxine hicks,to assist in conducting interviews and reviewing applications.the committee screened applications based primarily on work history and availability.if an application made it past the initial screening process,a member of the committee would schedule an interview.the committee member who interviewed the applicant,however,was not necessarily the member who screened the application.
after the initial interview,if the committee member considered the applicant a potential hire,he or she would place the applicant application in a pile so that the applicant references could be checked.store manager david penny normally made all hiring decisions.however,during the transition to a supercenter,personnel manager janet daugherty made the hiring decisions,including whether to conduct a second interview based on the recommendations of the committee member who conducted the initial interview.
in february,bradley submitted an application to work at the supercenter.on the application,he indicated that he was applying for the position of department,was seeking or employment,and was willing to work from to every evening,including saturday and sunday.bradley application indicated that he had completed two years of college.bradley employment history showed that he currently worked at banta as a proofreader and that he had previously worked at ray county fellowship as an administrator.bradley did not answer the application question asking whether could contact his employer.
based on his application and resume,bradley was called in for an interview.he arrived for the interview in his wheelchair,and hicks conducted the interview.hicks questioned bradley about his physical ability to work from his wheelchair and told him that she thought he was best suited for a greeter job.
the store did not hire bradley however,the parties dispute who actually made the decision not to hire bradley.the eeoc cites eeoc investigator michael katz interview notes to support its position that a factual dispute exists as to whether hicks or daugherty made the decision.in his interview notes,katz wrote that hicks indicated that the primary reason for not hiring bradley was the absence of a history of job stability,and a secondary factor in her decision was limits on his availability because working weekends was negotiable.in her deposition,however,hicks stated that she had no idea why bradley was not hired.in contrast,daugherty testified that she was the decisionmaker who decided not to hire bradley for a position.maintains,based on daugherty statement,that daugherty,not hicks,made the decision not to hire bradley.
in her deposition,when asked why did not hire bradley after his february application,daugherty testified that bradley was not hired for a position based on a lot of factors.she stated that the main reason that bradley was not hired was because of his job history,as she was personally aware of jobs that bradley had held in their small town that he failed to list on his application.those jobs included bradley working at a texaco service station texaco,at shirkey leisure acres shirkey,at station casino,and as a police dispatcher.when asked whether she had information that bradley had worked at texaco,shirkey,station casino,and as a police dispatcher at the time she made the decision not to hire him,she responded,i do know.she said that she personally saw bradley working at texaco however,she admitted that she was not sure if in all honesty if he worked at texaco before or after the application.emphasis added.she also admitted that she was unsure whether bradley worked at shirkey or station casino before or after she decided not to hire him.
bradley,however,never worked at station casino he only attended a training course there.in addition,he started working at shirkey in june,after rejected his application.likewise,he began working for the richmond police department as a police dispatcher in august,after rejected his application.finally,bradley only worked at texaco for one day 
in assessing bradley availability,daugherty admitted that she conflated bradley july and february applications.she conceded that she would hire him with the availability listed on the february application.when asked why the availability listed on his february application was still a reason for not hiring him,she replied 
because he was currently still employed at banta.he was there.so you this is just my assumption on it.you figure he works approximately hours a week there.what i was looking for was that would fit that availability,that to would be a person.you add those hours on and you talking hours a week.the availability was there versus this person availability because they did have the job.i felt like they could do it.i felt like this would be a hardship.my opinion.not that he indicated that.i mean i had come to that,my own conclusion there,that that would be a hardship.that did rule him out by any means.
emphasis added.with regard to his july application,daugherty testified that,at the time that bradley submitted his february application,she remembered looking at the july application in which bradley indicated that his hours were negotiable on saturday and sunday.she said she did not have time to fool with somebody that negotiable.while she never pulled bradley july application,she stated that she remembered it when reviewing his february application.a further concern that daugherty had,based on the july application,was bradley indication that could not contact his then current employer,banta,as a reference.bradley,however,did not limit contact of his employer on his february application.
when asked whether there were any other reasons why she decided not to further process bradley application,daugherty replied yes and stated 
one reason was remember way he responded to associates in the store as a customer,typically at the return center.also,we had loss prevention that were suspecting.availability from a previous application which was before this time frame,but typically when someone puts down availability,they will do whatever they can to get their foot in the door,but typically they want to stick with that availability.at the time that we were hiring,his availability was limited from to.we really needed people that had open availability that were able to work anytime,not that there could have been an exception because there could have been.that probably all the reasons.
in a subsequent affidavit,daugherty maintained that she was the decisionmaker who decided not to hire bradley for a position based on his rather specific restrictions on available work hours,work experience,and lack of work experience directly working with the general public or in retail operations.
bradley contacted the eeoc after seeing a news report about a missouri man who had filed a disability discrimination claim against.his intent in contacting the eeoc was to offer his services as a possible witness.after speaking with counsel for the eeoc,bradley was directed to investigator katz.katz interviewed bradley and,based upon that conversation,drafted a charge of discrimination.the charge of discrimination alleged that had denied bradley employment based on his disability.following an investigation into bradley charge,the eeoc filed the instant lawsuit on bradley behalf.
moved for summary judgment,arguing that the eeoc failed to show that bradley was qualified for any available position,including the greeter and cashier positions.thus,attempted to show that no genuine issue of fact existed as to whether bradley was a qualified applicant for either the people greeter position or the cashier position.
according to people greeter job description,a greeter is required to welcome and assist customers as they enter the store provide security ensure customer safety in the greeting area respond to electronic surveillance alarms open doors,whenever possible,for customers when appropriate,such as mothers with small children and the disabled offer customers a shopping cart provide customers with directions when asked offer assistance to customers when appropriate,such as disabled customers ensure that the entrance has safe floor conditions for customers and keep the front entrance clean by,for example,promptly cleaning up spills.the physical demands of the position require the greeter to regularly stand,occasionally lift or move objects weighing up to pounds,and perform tasks involving simple grasping however,will make reasonable accommodations to enable disabled individuals to perform the essential job functions.
cashier job description states that a cashier primary responsibilities are providing excellent customer service by,for example,assisting customers with the bagging and loading of their merchandise maintaining excellent productivity levels by scanning merchandise quickly and accurately ensuring that safe work practices are followed by using proper lifting techniques and using the power grip when scanning merchandise maintaining register security utilizing the customer service manager help if necessary and making change,cashing checks and issuing receipts to customers.the physical demands of the position require the cashier to regularly stand use his or her hands to scan items and manually key prices on the register keyboard perform tasks involving firm grasping have sufficient coordination and frequently lift or move at least and up to pounds.just as with the greeter position,will reasonably accommodate disabled persons so that they can perform the essential job functions.for example,the resource retention guide suggests that a cashier using a wheelchair is a reasonable accommodation 
in support of its motion,relied on the expert testimony of chris fevurly.based on an independent medical examination of bradley,fevurly opined that bradley was not qualified to perform the essential functions of either job.fevurly concluded that bradley can not carry or move objects that require two hands,as he must use one arm at all times to support his weight while standing and both arms to walk with his crutches can not operate a push mower,meaning that he could not operate a device as kent jayne eeoc expert suggested must use his crutches to climb on and off stools and takes considerable time transitioning from a sitting to a standing position falls every other week in a controlled environment using his crutches,and his chances of falling would be daily in a retail environment can not perform prolonged walking and standing,as required by the positions can not perform squatting or crawling and could only kneel for five minutes or less can only perform occasional bending and stooping and has not attempted to perform shifts or work weeks.
in response,the eeoc main expert,vocational rehabilitation consultant kent jayne,concluded that bradley,with reasonable accommodation,could work as a cashier or greeter and would not pose a direct threat in either job.because the job descriptions for both jobs required some mobility and standing,jayne recommended a wheelchair,an ergonomic stool with armrests,a scooter stool,or a lightweight wheelchair as a reasonable accommodation.for the greeter job,jayne opined that bradley would not need an accommodation to verify payment with a handscanner or to move shopping carts or empty trash baskets,although he might do the latter two tasks more efficiently with an electric scooter or similar device.for the cashier job,jayne recommended,inter alia,a wheelchair,which would enable bradley to be upright and reach out horizontally a high stool with armrests for additional balance,if needed a wheelchair narrow enough to fit into the checkstand area removing several inches of the divider to the right of the checkstand to accommodate a regular or electric wheelchair supplying bradley with a handscanner to scan prices on large objects and installing a convex mirror to enable him to spot items under shopping carts.he suggested that,if bradley used a wheelchair or electric scooter,he would pose no greater danger than any customer in a wheelchair or electric scooter,both of which provides to customers for use in their stores.daljeet singh,bradley treating physician,also testified that bradley was in good health and could safely do the tasks involved in the greeter and cashier positions.
expert,fevurly,questioned whether bradley could safely balance while seated on the stool that did not have armrests.he acknowledged,however,that there would be a decreased risk if bradley used a wheelchair,conceding that bradley is very stable in a wheelchair.he also stated that he did not have a huge problem with bradley using a motorized scooter or similar device,as long as he was careful.he concluded,however,that based on his observation,bradley would have to be up on his feet as a cashier and,while he could sometimes use a wheelchair as a greeter,he would still have to get up and do tasks where he is standing probably somewhere between and percent of the time.but,he did admit that bradley would need to bend over and pick up items only infrequently and that,using his wheelchair,bradley can lift and carry heavy objects in a nearly unlimited fashion.
a functional capacity assessment conducted by janet morgan,case coordinator at medical center,revealed that bradley was capable of slow to moderate pace ambulation and stair climbing using canes and able to transition from sitting in a wheelchair to standing with crutch support safely over two days of testing to work overhead from a seat position,to kneel unsupported,and to perform modified materials handling activities while seated in a wheelchair.morgan noted that bradley demonstrated improved function when allowed to modify activities to include wheelchair for mobility.based on her assessment,she concluded that,without accommodation,bradley could not perform the essential functions of the greeter and cashier positions.she indicated,however,that her conclusions do not include consideration of possible task modifications or reasonable accommodation.examples might in
