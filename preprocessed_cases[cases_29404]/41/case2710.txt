neither kato nor palms west disciplined chaparro since he was not a hospital employee.chaparro,however,was disciplined by palms neurosurgery.patterson delivered a disciplinary action form stating that chaparro admitted hugging and kissing in the workplace.the form cautioned that any further contact with,other than strictly professional,would result in his immediate termination.kato presented her findings to the physician advisory committee committee.the committee is not part of the hospital,but oversees ethics issues and provides recommendations to the medical staff committee about doctors who have privileges at palms west.the committee instructed chaparro that even consensual relationships are inappropriate at palms west.

facts leading to resignation 
contends that following her complaint about the november incident,palms west began to impermissibly schedule her and reprimand her for failing to show up for shifts for which she was not apprised.she also reported feeling ignored by supervisors,both in her job capacity and in her request to transfer to the day shift.stated that in light of the investigative report,which she felt downplayed chaparro conduct,she resigned on december,
lawsuit against chaparro and palms west 
brought suit against chaparro alleging assault,battery,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.she later amended the complaint to include claims against palms west for a sexually hostile work environment and retaliation.alleged that the sexual harassment consisted of the five phone calls she received from chaparro in late,chaparro inappropriate comments and touching which began in may,and the november supply room incident.ultimately,and chaparro settled however,the hostile environment and retaliation claims against palms west went to a jury trial.
pretrial,the district court granted motion in limine to preclude the admission of evidence relating to quesada mental health.palms west later moved for summary judgment,arguing that had failed to set forth a prima facie case of sexual harassment or retaliation.it also moved for summary judgment on the issue of whether chaparro was supervisor the district court denied the motion for summary judgment 
as there is no standard jury instruction in the eleventh circuit for whether a supervisor relationship exists,the district court constructed an instruction using relevant case law and administrative regulations.the district court refused to use palm west suggested traditional definition of supervisor because of the unique situation presented by specialty doctors with hospital privileges who are not hospital employees.
during deliberations,the jury delivered two verdicts that were inconsistent with the jury instructions.finally,the jury delivered a third verdict finding palms west liable for the retaliation claim.following a request by palms west to poll the jury,juror indicated that it was not her verdict.deliberations resumed and the district court later delivered an allen charge,after the jury indicated that it had reached a decision but was deadlocked as to damages.following the allen charge,the jury returned two hours later with a verdict in the amount of in damages against palms west on the hostile environment claim,and finding no liability on the retaliation claim.
thereafter,palms west renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law,pursuant to.b,based on failure to state a prima facie hostile work environment claim,or in the alternative,for a new trial,pursuant to rule b and rule,based on the supervisor issue,the jury instruction explaining supervisor,the allen charge,and the ruling excluding quesada mental health history.the district court denied the motions and palms west appealed.
ii.standard of review 
we review a rule motion de novo.chambless,cir.in doing so,we draw all inferences in favor of the party,and affirm the jury verdict unless there is no legal basis upon which the jury could have found for the plaintiff.nebula glass int l,reichhold,cir quoting telecom technical,rolm,cir.
iii.analysis 
title vii prohibits discrimination that alters the terms and conditions of employment.a.an employee can establish a violation against an employer in either of two ways through tangible employment,discharge,demotion,pay decrease,or through creation of a hostile work environment caused by sexual harassment that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of the work.see baldwin blue shield of,cir citing hulsey pride,llc,cir.here,it is the latter scenario that is at issue because did not suffer tangible employment action,palms west may invoke the defense.see ellerth,at.see also faragher,at.
an employer avoids liability under this defense if it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior and the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities it provided.faragher,at.ellerth,at.see also baldwin,at.as an affirmative defense,the defendant bears the burden of establishing both of these elements.see id.citing frederick mgmt,cir.
going to the first element of the defense,the jury found that palms west exercised reasonable care to prevent any sexually harassing behavior in the workplace.because did not this finding,we are only concerned with whether she unreasonably failed to take advantage of palms west sexual harassment policy,and if not,whether palms responded by taking reasonable and prompt corrective action.see sanchez,at.
the dispositive question under this part of the analysis is whether failed to put palms west on notice when she reported the harassing phone calls to stowers,thereby failing to trigger palms west duty to take reasonable and prompt corrective actions until after all of the relevant sexually harassing conduct had occurred.see coates sundor brands,cir describing employee duty to follow employer harassment policy in order to put employer on notice.
contends that because she described the harassing phone calls to stowers,palms west had a duty to follow its own sexual harassment policy procedures.citing to coates,maintains that this court need only look to palms west sexual harassment policy to determine when it would be deemed to have notice of the harassment sufficient to obligate it or its agents to take prompt and appropriate remedial measures.id.at.according to,she reported the phone calls to stowers in early,who,by the terms of palm west policy,was a designated representative for purposes of reporting sexual harassment.therefore,maintains that stowers was required,under the terms of palms west sexual harassment policy,to advise human resources of complaint.because stowers was a designated representative under the sexual harassment policy,argues that palms west was on notice,and that stowers failure to report the complaint to human resources was dispositive of palms west failure to comply with its own policy.this,according to,was all that she needed to show under coates to negate the affirmative defense.
argument assumes that her conversation with stowers was sufficient to reasonably put stowers on notice that the phone calls constituted sexual harassment.according to palms west,and as stowers testified,even though referred to chaparro phone calls as harassing,stowers took this to mean annoying.all that indicated to stowers during the conversation was that chaparro had phoned her late at night on as many as five occasions asking her to meet him for a drink or to have dinner.there is no indication that suggested that any sexually explicit remarks or even sexual innuendos were made during these phone calls.the only information that relayed to stowers was that chaparro had called five times asking her out on dates.suggests that whether this was enough to have put palms west on notice about the harassment was a factual question appropriately submitted to the jury.
in coates,the plaintiff showed her plant supervisor a letter from a that stated from the desk of ernie long,hey sweetheart for minutes of hugging and kissing or for stop loving vickie guarantee.id.at.we found this note was not sufficient to reasonably place the plant supervisor on notice of sexual harassment.id.we noted that the letter was produced in the context of an unrelated work conversation and that the plaintiff did not indicate that her receipt of the note represented a problem about which she was concerned or that required the supervisor immediate attention.id.while genuine issues of fact regarding the supervisor notice may be submitted to the jury,see frederick,at,here it appears that co
