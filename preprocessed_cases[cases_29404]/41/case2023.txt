this case arises out of the merger of two health care providers in nampa,idaho.the federal trade commission ftc and the state of idaho sued,alleging that the merger violated of the clayton act,and state law two local hospitals filed a similar complaint.although the district court believed that the merger was intended to improve patient outcomes and might well do so,the judge nonetheless found that the merger violated and ordered divestiture.
as the district court recognized,the job before us is not to determine the optimal future shape of the country health care system,but instead to determine whether this particular merger violates the clayton act.in light of the careful factual findings by the able district judge,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
a.the health care market in nampa,idaho 
nampa,the city in idaho,is some twenty miles west of boise and has a population of approximately.before the merger at issue,luke health systems,an,health care system,operated an emergency clinic in the city.saltzer medical group,saltzer,the largest independent physician group in idaho,had physicians practicing at its offices in nampa.the only hospital in nampa was operated by saint alphonsus health system,saint alphonsus,a part of the multistate trinity health system.saint alphonsus and treasure valley hospital limited partnership tvh jointly operated an outpatient surgery center 
the largest adult primary care physician pcp provider in the nampa market was saltzer,which had sixteen pcps luke had eight pcps and saint alphonsus nine.several other pcps had solo or small practices.
b.the challenged acquisition 
saltzer had long had the goal of moving toward integrated patient care and reimbursement.after unsuccessfully attempting several informal affiliations,including one with luke,saltzer sought a formal partnership with a large health care system.
in,luke acquired saltzer assets and entered into a professional service agreement psa with the saltzer physicians the merger or the acquisition saltzer received a million payment for goodwill.the initial psa contained hortatory language about the parties desire to move away from reimbursement,but included no provisions implementing that goal.an amended psa,however,contained some incentives.the merger did not require saltzer doctors to refer patients to the luke boise hospital,nor did it require that saltzer physicians use luke facilities for ancillary services.
procedural history 
in november,the private hospitals filed a complaint in the district of idaho seeking to enjoin the merger under clayton act the complaint alleged anticompetitive effects in the relevant markets for primary care physician services,general inpatient services,general pediatric physician services,and outpatient surgery services.the district court denied a preliminary injunction,noting that the psa did not require referrals to luke,minimizing any immediate harm to the private hospitals implementation of the psa was to take place over time and the psa provided a process for unwinding the transaction if it were declared illegal.
in march,the ftc and the state of idaho filed a complaint in the district court seeking to enjoin the merger pursuant to the federal trade commission act ftc act,the clayton act,and idaho law this complaint alleged anticompetitive effects only in the adult pcp market.the district court consolidated this case with the one filed by the private hospitals,and after a bench trial,found the merger prohibited by the clayton act and the idaho competition act because of its anticompetitive effects on the nampa adult pcp market 
the district court expressly noted the troubled state of the health care system,found that luke and saltzer genuinely intended to move toward a better health care system,and expressed its belief that the merger would improve patient outcomes if left intact.nonetheless,the court found that the huge market share of the entity creates a substantial risk of anticompetitive price increases in the nampa adult pcp market.rejecting an argument by luke that anticipated efficiencies excused the potential anticompetitive price effects,the district court ordered divestiture.this appeal followed.

iii.the clayton act analysis 
overview of the clayton act 
the great yankee catcher yogi berra is reputed likely apocryphally to have said that it tough to make predictions,especially about the future.the perils of prediction,economist,june,at yet that is precisely what this case requires.because of the clayton act bars mergers whose effect may be substantially to lessen competition,or to tend to create a monopoly,judicial analysis necessarily focuses on probabilities,not certainties,brown shoe united states,d.this requires not merely an appraisal of the immediate impact of the merger upon competition,but a prediction of its impact upon competitive conditions in the future this is what is meant when it is said that the amended was intended to arrest anticompetitive tendencies in their incipiency.united states phila.bank,d internal quotation marks omitted.
section claims are typically assessed under a framework.chi.bridge iron ftc,cir.the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case that a merger is anticompetitive.see olin ftc,cir discussing how plaintiff establishment of a prima facie case on statistical evidence was the first step in the analysis.the burden then shifts to the defendant to rebut the prima facie case.see am.stores,at citing united states marine bancorporation,d.i f the defendant successfully rebuts the prima facie case,the burden of production shifts back to the government and merges with the ultimate burden of persuasion,which is incumbent on the government at all times.chi.bridge iron,at 
b.the relevant market 
determination of the relevant product and geographic markets is a necessary predicate to deciding whether a merger contravenes the clayton act.marine bancorporation,at internal quotation marks omitted.definition of the relevant market is a factual question dependent upon the special characteristics of the industry involved and we will not disturb such findings unless clearly erroneous.twin city sportservice,charles finley,cir.although the parties agree that the relevant product market in this case is adult pcps,luke vigorously disputes the district court determination that nampa is the relevant geographic market.we find no clear error in that factual finding.
the relevant geographic market is the area of effective competition where buyers can turn for alternate sources of supply.morgan,strand,wheeler biggs radiology,cir alteration omitted quoting oltz peter cmty,cir internal quotation marks omitted.put differently,a market is the group of sellers or producers who have the actual or potential ability to deprive each other of significant levels of business.rebel oil atl.richfield,cir quoting thurman,pay n pak stores,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the plaintiff has the burden of establishing the relevant geographic market.see united states.bank,d.
a common method to determine the relevant geographic market,and the one used by the district court,is to find whether a hypothetical monopolist could impose a small but significant nontransitory increase in price ssnip in the proposed market.see theme promotions,at see also in re se.milk antitrust,cir describing the relevant geographic market as one in which buyers respond to a ssnip by purchasing regardless of the increase dep t of justice ftc,horizontal merger guidelines merger guidelines if enough consumers would respond to a ssnip by purchasing the product from outside the proposed geographic market,making the ssnip unprofitable,the proposed market definition is too narrow.see theme promotions,at.
market definition thus perforce focuses on the anticipated behavior of buyers and sellers.see,rebel oil,at.in the health care industry,insurance companies effectively act both as buyers and sellers.see ftc freeman,cir gregory vistnes,hospitals,mergers,and two stage competition,antitrust.noting that the vast majority of health care consumers are not direct purchasers of health care the consumers purchase health insurance and the insurance companies negotiate directly with the providers,the district court correctly focused on the likely response of insurers to a hypothetical demand by all the pcps in a particular market for a ssnip.
the district court found that a hypothetical nampa pcp monopolist could profitably impose a ssnip on insurers.citing testimony that nampa residents strongly prefer access to local pcps,the court found that commercial health plans need to include nampa pcps in their networks to offer a competitive product.given this dynamic that health plans must offer nampa adult pcp services to nampa residents to effectively compete nampa pcps could band together and successfully demand a ssnip or reimbursement increase from health plans.
luke argues that the district court erred by considering only the current behavior of nampa consumers,not their likely response to a ssnip.luke is of course correct that geographic market definition involves prospective analysis it predicts consumer response to a hypothetical price increase.see ftc tenet health care,cir.but that is precisely what the district court did.the court not only examined present nampa consumer behavior,but also concluded that it would not change in the event of a ssnip.
this determination was supported by the record.evidence was presented that insurers generally need local pcps to market a health care plan,and that this is true in particular in the nampa market.for example,blue cross of idaho has pcps in every zip code in which it has customers,and the executive director of the idaho physicians network testified that it could not market a health care network in nampa that did not include nampa pcps.evidence also indicated that consumers would not change their behavior in the event of a ssnip.experts testified that because health care consumers only pay a small percentage of health care costs out of pocket,the impact of a ssnip likely would not register.similarly,there was testimony that consumers choose physicians on factors other than price.the court was unconvinced by evidence that insurers could defend against a ssnip by steering consumers to pcps 
for similar reasons,there also was no clear error in the district court determination that evidence that of nampa residents travel to boise for pcps did not prove that a significant number of other residents would so travel in the event of a ssnip.those who traveled generally went to pcps near their boise places of employment.thus,the court reasonably found this statistic not determinative of whether other nampa residents would be willing to travel.
c.the plaintiffs case 
once the relevant geographic market is determined,a prima facie case is established if the plaintiff proves that the merger will probably lead to anticompetitive effects in that market.see olin,at see also chi.bridge iron,at.a prima facie case can be established simply by showing high market share.united states syufy,cir see also ftc heinz.however,statistics concerning market share and concentration,while of great significance,a re not conclusive indicators of anticompetitive effects united states dynamics,d see also ftc warner commc ns,cir.thus,plaintiffs in cases generally present other evidence as part of the prima facie case.see dynamics,at o nly a further examination of the particular market its structure,history and probable future can provide the appropriate setting for judging the probable anticompetitive effect of the merger.quoting brown shoe,at see also chi.bridge iron,at noting that market share data was just one element in the government strong prima facie case carl shapiro,the horizontal merger guidelines from hedgehog to fox in forty years,antitrust,noting the trend in merger enforcement to consider factors in addition to market share.
the district court held that the plaintiffs established a prima facie case because of the entity market share ability to negotiate higher pcp reimbursement rates with insurers and ability to charge more ancillary services at the higher hospital billing rates.the court also found that entry into the market has been very difficult and would not be timely to counteract the anticompetitive effects of the acquisition.luke does not challenge the finding we review the others in turn for clear error.
market share 
a commonly used metric for determining market share is the herfindahl hirschman index hhi.see promedica health,ftc,cir heinz,at.hhi is calculated by summing the squares of the individual firms market shares,which gives proportionately greater weight to the larger market shares.merger guidelines.the analysis consider s both the level of the hhi and the increase in the hhi resulting from the merger.id.the merger guidelines classify markets as unconcentrated hhi below moderately concentrated hhi between and or highly concentrated hhi above.id.mergers that increase the hhi more than points and result in highly concentrated markets are presumed to be likely to enhance market power.id.sufficiently large hhi figures establish the ftc prima facie case that a merger is anticompetitive.heinz,at.
the district court calculated the hhi in the nampa pcp market as,and the increase as.luke does not challenge these findings.as the district court correctly noted,these hhi numbers are well above the thresholds for a presumptively anticompetitive merger more than double and seven times their respective thresholds,respectively.see promedica,at noting that a merger with similar hhi numbers blew through those barriers in spectacular fashion.
pcp reimbursements 
the district court also found that luke would likely use its power to negotiate higher reimbursement rates from insurers for pcp services.recognizing that the inquiry is based on a prediction of future actions,see phila.bank,at,this finding was not clearly erroneous.
because luke and saltzer had been each other closest substitutes in nampa,the district court found the acquisition limited the ability of insurers to negotiate with the merged entity.internal correspondence indicated that the merged companies would use this increased bargaining power to raise prices.an email between luke executives discussed pressur ing payors for new directed agreements,and an exchange between saltzer executives stated that i f our negotiations w luke go to fruition,then the clout of the entire network could be used to negotiate favorable terms with insurers.the court also examined a previous acquisition by luke in twin falls,idaho,and found that luke used its leverage in that instance to force insurers to concede to their pricing proposal.
ancillary services 
the district court finding that luke would raise prices in the ancillary services is more problematic.the court found that luke would exercise its enhanced bargaining leverage from the acquisition to charge more services at the higher billing rates.because insurers and providers typically negotiate for all services as part of the same contract,the district court found that luke increased leverage with respect to pcp services would allow it to demand higher fees for ancillary services.
the problem with this conclusion is that the district court made no findings about luke market power in the ancillary services market.absent such a finding,it is difficult to conclude that the merged entity could easily demand anticompetitive prices for such services.perhaps the court was suggesting that luke would engage in tying,a device used by a seller with market power in one product market to extend its market power to a distinct product market.cascade health solutions peacehealth,cir.although various antitrust statutes,including sherman act and,clayton act,and ftc act,address tying,clayton act does not expressly prohibit the practice.a leading antitrust treatise cautions against condemning a merger for potential tying effects as superfluous and overdeterrent.phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law an analysis of antitrust principles and their application areeda.
wholly aside from these conceptual difficulties,the factual underpinnings of the district court conclusion are suspect.the documents cited by the district court merely state that luke hopes to increase revenue from ancillary services,not that it plans to charge higher prices.an increase in revenue could occur in a variety of ways not involving increased prices,such as increased medicare payments or increased volume from saltzer referrals.the district court did not find that saltzer physicians would inappropriately label services as,or that they would force patients to travel to the luke hospital in boise for services that could be provided in nampa.and the court did not identify any past actions that would allow it to predict that luke would act anticompetitively in the future in the ancillary services market.indeed,in negotiations with blue shield,luke did not do so.we thus find that the ancillary services finding is not supported by the record.
the prima facie case 
but absent the ancillary services finding,the district court conclusion that a prima facie case was established is amply supported by the record.section does not require proof that a merger or other acquisition has caused higher prices in the affected market.all that is necessary is that the merger create an appreciable danger of such consequences in the future.hosp.of am.ftc,cir.
the extremely high hhi on its own establishes the prima facie case.see heinz,at united states baker hughes.in addition,the court found that statements and past actions by the merging parties made it likely that luke would raise reimbursement rates in a highly concentrated market.see hosp,at expressing concern that a history of cooperation among hospitals could lead to collusion when a merger caused the market to become more concentrated.and,the court uncontested finding of high entry barriers eliminates the possibility that the reduced competition caused by the merger will be ameliorated by new competition from outsiders and further strengthens the ftc case.heinz,at.
the facts found by the district court are similar to those in other cases in which a prima facie violation of was established.see,chi.bridge iron,at high hhi,limited rivals,high entry barriers,and customer perception lucas auto.eng g,cir reversing summary judgment for defendant because undisputed facts showed high market share and insurmountable barriers to entry ftc.health,cir high market concentration,high entry barriers,and evidence that defendants intended to eliminate competition with the merger am.stores,at high market share,and insufficient evidence of low entry barriers to rebut the prima facie case.the district court did not clearly err in its factual findings,which adequately support its ultimate conclusion that the plaintiffs established a prima facie case that the acquisition is.
d.the rebuttal case 
because the plaintiffs established a prima facie case,the burden shifted to luke to cast doubt on the accuracy of the government evidence as predictive of future anticompetitive effects.chi.bridge iron,at.the rebuttal evidence focused on the alleged procompetitive effects of the merger,particularly the contention that the merger would allow luke to move toward integrated care and reimbursement 
the post merger efficiencies defense 
the supreme court has never expressly approved an efficiencies defense to a claim.see heinz,at.indeed,brown shoe cast doubt on the defense 
of course,some of the results of large integrated or chain operations are beneficial to consumers.their expansion is not rendered unlawful by the mere fact that small independent stores may be adversely affected.it is competition,not competitors,which the act protects.but we can not fail to recognize congress desire to promote competition through the protection of viable,small,locally owned business.congress appreciated that occasional higher costs and prices might result from the maintenance of fragmented industries and markets.it resolved these competing considerations in favor of decentralization.we must give effect to that decision.
at.similarly,in ftc procter gamble,the court stated that p ossible economies can not be used as a defense to illegality.congress was aware that some mergers which lessen competition may also result in economies but it struck the balance in favor of protecting competition,d.
notwithstanding the supreme court statements,four of our sister circuits the sixth,eighth,and eleventh have suggested that proof of efficiencies could rebut a clayton act prima facie case.see promedica,at heinz,at tenet,at.health,at the ftc has also cautiously recognized the defense,noting that although competition ordinarily spurs firms to achieve efficiencies internally,a primary benefit of mergers to the economy is their potential to generate significant efficiencies and thus enhance the merged firm ability and incentive to compete,which may result in lower prices,improved quality,enhanced service,or new products.merger guidelines see also oliver williamson,economies as an antitrust defense revisited,sometimes a merger will result in real increases in efficiency that reduce the average cost of production of the combined entity below that of the two merging firms.however,none of the reported appellate decisions have actually held that a defendant has rebutted a prima facie case with an efficiencies defense thus,even in those circuits that recognize it,the parameters of the defense remain imprecise.
the status of the defense in this circuit remains uncertain.a quarter of a century ago,we rejected an efficiencies defense in rsr ftc,cir.rsr,however,involved an argument that the merger would allow the defendant to compete more efficiently outside the relevant market.id.more recent cases focus on whether efficiencies in the relevant market negate the anticompetitive effect of the merger in that market.see.health,at.even after rsr,several district courts in this circuit have suggested that there could be such a defense.see,united states bazaarvoice,cv who,wl,at,united states oracle,d,but see california am.stores,finding that rsr barred an efficiencies defense,rev on other grounds,rev on other grounds,d.
we remain skeptical about the efficiencies defense in general and about its scope in particular.it is difficult enough in cases to predict whether a merger will have future anticompetitive effects without also adding to the judicial balance a prediction of future efficiencies.indeed,even bork,a sharp critic of clayton act enforcement actions,see,robert bork and wade bowman,the crisis in antitrust,colum,rejected the efficiencies defense,calling it spurious because it can not measure the factors relevant to consumer welfare,so that after the economic extravaganza was completed we would know no more than before it began,robert bork,the antitrust paradox a policy at war with itself.judge richard posner has regularly expressed similar views.see richard posner,antitrust law ed.i said back then that there should be no general defense of efficiency.i still think this is right.it is rarely feasible to determine by the methods of litigation the effect of a merger on the costs of the firm created by the merger.richard posner,antitrust law an economic perspective i would not allow a generalized defense of efficiency.frank easterbrook,the limits of antitrust,n either judges nor juries are particularly good at handling complex economic arguments.
nonetheless,we assume,as did the district court,that because of the clayton act only prohibits those mergers whose effect may be substantially to lessen competition,a defendant can rebut a prima facie case with evidence that the proposed merger will create a more efficient combined entity and thus increase competition.for example,if two small firms were unable to match the prices of a larger competitor,but could do so after a merger because of decreased production costs,a cou
