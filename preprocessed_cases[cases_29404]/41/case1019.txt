robert kyle kyle was years old when he was terminated from his position as a supervisor for laminent manufacturer formica corporation on march.at the time of his termination,kyle suffered from morbid obesity and related conditions.he filed an application for social security disability benefits ten months later on january.at his hearing,the administrative law judge alj found that his complaints were not entirely credible,but determined,nonetheless,that kyle was not able to perform any past relevant work.the alj determined further,however,that kyle had acquired skills from his past relevant work that were transferable to other occupations existing in significant numbers in the national economy.the alj specifically relied on the opinion of vocational expert ve george parsons,phd,who stated that kyle acquired past relevant work skills,especially supervisory skills,that would transfer to other jobs.based on this finding,the alj determined kyle was not disabled for social security purposes.kyle request for review was denied by the appeals council of the social security administration appeals council,and he filed a civil action in the federal district court.
the district court issued an order affirming the appeal council decision,finding that the alj did not make an error prejudicial to kyle.because this court concludes that the alj had substantial evidence to make a finding that kyle had acquired past relevant work skills that would transfer to other jobs,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
kyle was born on march,and completed the grade.on march,in his seventeenth year of employment at formica corporation and his eleventh year as a supervisor,kyle was terminated.kyle suffered from morbid obesity,his weight ranging from pounds.according to primary care physician pcp john capurro,and orthopedic surgeon,michael lawhon,his diagnoses prior to included low back pain,hypertension,fluid retention,cardiomegaly,degenerative joint disease djd in both knees,a medial meniscus tear in his left knee,osteoarthritis,and chondromalacia 
for ten months after he was terminated,kyle looked for another job,but never worked again.he applied for disability in january.
his medical records between and reveal that,after he was terminated from his job,he also developed degenerative changes in his lumbar spine,lumbago spinal stenosis,and recurrent perianal abscesses.he underwent ten days of physical therapy for low back pain in march and thirteen days in the winter.he received a single steroid spinal injection in march.
in a may,report,consultant christopher wright,described kyle as a massively obese man who ambulates with a normal gait,and who is comfortable in both the sitting and standing positions.wright diagnosed kyle with morbid obesity,chronic back pain,left knee pain and elevated blood pressure,but found kyle able to do moderate amounts of sitting,ambulating,standing,bending,kneeling,pushing,pulling,lifting and carrying heavy objects.
a june,physical residual functional capacity assessment rfc,completed by jerry mccloud,noted that kyle could stand or walk six hours per day,sit for six hours a day,and do unlimited pushing and pulling.the neurological exam was normal,although an of the knee showed degenerative arthrosis,and an of the spine showed degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.
kyle pcp capurro,prepared a july,work assessment report concluding kyle had djd,degenerative disc disease ddd,and hypertension.capurro found kyle could sit for no more than hours per day and could never climb,balance,stoop,crouch,kneel,or crawl.
in january,dana bussing,prepared a rfc diagnosing facetogenic versus discogenic lower back and bilateral knee osteoarthritis with a poor prognosis.she reported that kyle had pain after standing or walking for five minutes,but he did not complain of pain while sitting.she noted that his symptoms would rarely be severe enough to interfere with the concentration needed to perform simple work and concluded that he could sit for minutes without having to get up.
procedural background 
kyle applied for social security disability insurance benefits on january.in various written submissions,kyle told the agency that for over ten years he supervised employees at formica,had authority to hire and fire them,and was responsible for making sure the production goals were achieved.
a hearing was held regarding his application on january,before an administrative law judge alj in cincinnati,ohio.
testimony of robert kyle 
kyle testified that,initially,he was a finishing process operator with formica.his job was to carry,flip,and sand or cut pound sheets of formica.he used regular hand tools and micrometers kyle went into management in with the title supervisor in trim and sand.even after becoming a manager,kyle was up and around his workers.for example,kyle showed the foremen how to pass the material through the machine and responded when he was called regarding a machine that was not working properly.he wrote production,safety and accident reports,and also sometimes helped lift and carry the sheets of formica.
kyle testified that a new supervisor came the year before kyle was terminated.the supervisor wanted more numbers but kyle,having done it for years,knew the supervisor way was not going to work.despite this,kyle still got the job done.kyle continued to receive assignments,complete his paperwork,and,although he might go around the way to do it,achieved the same outcome.kyle production numbers were good or better than anybody else.i did have no safety issues.one day,the supervisor called him in and said they were going to terminate him.he was essentially fired.
kyle told the alj he could not perform his former job as a supervisor because he could not stand,climb around the machines,or handle materials like he did before.he testified that he could,however,perform a paperwork job at a desk if he were allowed to stand up and walk around every minutes or so.he testified that he sent out resumes and searched for jobs for ten months after he was terminated.he sought both management positions and regular hourly work.while he received interviews,he never worked again.
with respect to physical exertion,kyle testified that he climbed three steps to get into his home,but was fine once he got in.he could walk about feet before he needed to rest.
testimony of reviewing medical advisor wayne wheeler.
wheeler testified that kyle suffered from morbid obesity,lower back pain,perianal abscesses and knee pain.in wheeler opinion,kyle rfc limited him to sedentary work where he would never bend or stoop,could sit for six hours,and had to have easy access to the job.since kyle already climbed three stairs to get into his home,climbing that to get to his job would be reasonable,but any more than that would be a challenge.
testimony of vocational expert george parsons,phd 
the ve testified that kyle previous job of finishing process operator,laminate would have dictionary of occupational titles dot number and would be classified as medium work with an svp of since there was no dot number for kyle job as a laminate supervisor,the ve concluded that the dot jobs that most closely fit the laminate supervisor job were the jobs of general production supervisor dot number,light work,svp of,making it skilled and supervisor of coating machines dot number,light work,svp of,making it also skilled.according to the ve,the hypothetical man confined to the activities wheeler described could not perform his past relevant work.
ve testimony that kyle had transferable supervisory skills 
the ve testified that kyle skills were his ability to interact with others to get the production job done.the ve also stated that,while kyle used various micrometers and other types of tools in his work and had general knowledge of machines and machine operations,the supervisory part of kyle job made it skilled.specifically,the ve testified 
a now the skills are obviously inaudible.he supervised people so,you know,based upon that are skills that are his ability to interact with others to get production done,and as he stated he you know,they have to use various micrometers and other types of tools in order to be able to finish their work,and this,this general knowledge of machines,machine operations is what you he did.but it really,it really the supervision of people that makes it skilled.
the alj asked the ve whether kyle could perform other jobs to which his skills would transfer without significant vocational adjustment the ve offered the opinion that,if kyle could get into the building,he could perform other jobs at the sedentary level without significant vocational adjustment,such as an expediting clerk,shipping and receiving clerk,and sedentary supervisor positions.when questioned by the alj,the ve testified as follows 
q could he perform other jobs to which his skills would transfer without significant vocational adjustment given that rfc.
a well,here the problem i got with that testimony.i,i think there are other jobs.i mean he could be an expediting clerk.he could work as a shipping and receiving clerk.he could do those kinds of things at the sedentary level,but within that limitation was the entrance and exit egress separate to a company,and i have no way of knowing if he have to climb three stairs or not climb three stairs.
q well,he climbing three stairs going into his house.
a i know but i have no way of knowing within the plant if he have to climb but i can tell you that i think he could perform work as an inspector,as an expediting clerk,and in shipping and receiving,and i think he could go sedentary supervisor positions 
the ve further testified that kyle skills could transfer to those positions even if products other than formica were involved,and further,kyle testified that he had looked for those kind of jobs.the ve responded to the alj question in this regard as follows 
q well,could his skills transfer to those jobs with the 
a oh,yeah,yeah,the same thing.it just different products.i mean,you know,as he said he looked for those kind of jobs.
the ve offered his opinion that kyle success supervising in the past supported the conclusion that kyle had supervisory skills.when questioned by kyle attorney,the ve testified as follows 
q i mean given,given that and his education,which is not even a high school diploma does he have the skills to do the paperwork that required at these production supervisor jobs at toyota and these other companies 
a well,yeah,he,he obviously demonstrated the ability to do the work.i mean he did it.now as i stated his advantage was he learned the job,so that was an advantage for him particularly in formica where they have laminates and coatings,because he knew those.
q but in these other production supervisor jobs he does no longer have that advantage.
a correct,but that i,i do have any mean obviously he has the ability to relate to people.he ran people.he did i he was beating production quotas,so he obviously knows how to do it.now his style may be different than somebody else,and i ca testify to that,but obviously he can.
ve testimony that jobs to which kyle could transfer were consistent with the dot 
the ve testified as to four dot jobs which existed in significant number and to which kyle skills could transfer.he stated that there were supervisory jobs in cincinnati,and of those,are in the sedentary category.the ve stated that there were local general supervisor jobs,local inspection jobs,local expediting clerk jobs,and shipping and receiving jobs that kyle could do.specifically,the ve testified in response to questioning by the alj as follows 
a yeah,i giving you,first line,supervisor production which is the job he had inaudible.
q all right.
a hundred in the local economy,nationally.dot number representative inspection,local economy.nationally dot number representative.expediting clerk,local economy.nationally,representative dot number.last job,shipping and receiving clerk,local economy.nationally dot number.
thereafter,the alj asked the ve if the jobs he testified about were suitable to kyle skills and consistent with the dot.the ve testified that they were 
the alj decision 
the alj determined that kyle was not disabled.in her decision,the alj found that kyle was unable to perform any past relevant work.she found that kyle was years old as of his disability onset date january and considered a younger individual age.she found,further,that kyle became an individual closely approaching advanced as of february,the day before his birthday she found kyle had a limited education,and,based on the ve testimony,that kyle had skilled past relevant work as a supervisor,work that had an svp of and required the skills of interacting with others and supervising their work,knowledge of machines and machine operations,knowledge of tools,and paperwork skills,including performance appraisals of employees and writing reports in general she determined that,based on the grid part,subpart p,appendix,kyle had transferable skills.specifically,she held that,considering kyle age,education,work experience and residual functional capacity,kyle had skills that were transferable to other occupations with jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy.
the alj relied on the ve testimony that the skills kyle acquired through his past relevant work would be transferable.she relied on the ve testimony that kyle could perform the sedentary job of inspector,of which there were jobs in the local economy the sedentary job of expediting clerk,of which there were jobs in the local economy the sedentary job of production supervisor,of which there were jobs in the local economy or the sedentary job of clerk,of which there were jobs in the local economy.the alj determined that the ve testimony was consistent with the dot,as set forth by the requirements of ssr and that such numbers constituted a significant number of jobs.
based on these findings,the testimony of the ve,and the record as a whole,the alj concluded that kyle acquired work skills from past relevant work that were transferable to other occupations with jobs existing in significant numbers.the alj held,accordingly,that kyle was not disabled under the framework of rule from february,until march,the date of her decision and not disabled under the framework of rule from march,through february.
the appeals council denied kyle request for review on january,making the alj decision the final decision of the commissioner of social security commissioner.
kyle then filed a civil action in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio,seeking a reversal of the alj findings.the magistrate judge recommended that the decision of the commissioner be affirmed,and the district court adopted that recommendation.kyle now appeals.
