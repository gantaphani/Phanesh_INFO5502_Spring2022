appellant shauna saenz saenz appeals the district court grant of summary judgment on her family medical leave act fmla claims against harlingen medical center harlingen.saenz contends that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment on the grounds that saenz failed to comply with harlingen fmla notice procedure.although this is a close question,we agree that the district court erred when it held saenz to harlingen heightened procedure,and,further,we conclude that saenz provided the minimum required notice under fmla default requirements.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand.
factual procedural background 
the court must view the facts developed below in the light most favorable to the party.united fire cas.hixson,cir.saenz was hired by harlingen on december.in june,saenz was diagnosed with partial complex epileptic seizures.saenz seizures cause her to lose consciousness and,hence,become unable to perform her duties.in light of her condition,saenz requested intermittent fmla leave for her seizure condition.harlingen,by way of its administrator,the hartford,granted saenz request in a letter dated august.the letter informed saenz that she was approved for intermittent leave for a serious medical condition for the period from july,to july.the letter also stated that saenz had to contact harlingen by calling the hartford no later than two days after each time she took leave pursuant to her intermittent leave request.the letter warned that failure to provide the necessary notice could result in the loss of her protection under the fmla.saenz availed herself of this grant of intermittent leave nine times between july,and december.in each instance,she properly sought and received approval for her leave within the prescribed period and received an approval notice.all of the correspondence approving her various requests for leave included the following warning please remember that it is your obligation to contact the hartford no later than days after your leave date to report each date and time that you are absent from work relating to your intermittent fmla leave.saenz supervisor,amy flores flores,testified that she personally informed saenz every time saenz sick that saenz needed to indicate whether her absence was related to her condition and that saenz needed to contact the hartford.
on december and,saenz missed work due to her seizure condition.saenz promptly contacted the hartford,reported her absences,and received an approval notice shortly thereafter.saenz again missed work on december and january.the circumstances of this bout of illness differed significantly from the seizure issues causing saenz absence only a week before.on december,rhonda galloway galloway,saenz mother,found saenz hallucinating and disoriented at her house.galloway determined that saenz could not work that day and contacted saenz supervisor,flores.galloway told flores about saenz symptoms and that she would not be able to work.flores asked galloway to call house supervisor debbie morturi morturi and advise her of saenz absence.flores then removed saenz from the work schedule and informed saenz supervisor that saenz would not be reporting for work.
per flores request,galloway contacted morturi.morturi recommended that galloway take saenz to harlingen emergency room.galloway then brought saenz to the hospital and reported her condition to the doctors on duty.notably,morturi personally came and visited saenz while she was in the emergency room.
a psychiatrist was brought in to meet with galloway and saenz.during that meeting,the psychiatrist recommended that saenz be transferred to the mcallen behavioral center for evaluation and treatment.due to saenz incapacity,galloway sought and received a court order permitting the transfer.saenz testified that she has little recollection of the events of december and.after three days,saenz was released from the mcallen behavioral center.she was prescribed several medications and instructed to seek additional evaluation and treatment at another facility,tropical texas,as soon as she could arrange an appointment.she went to her mother home and resided there in her care until at least january.
on the day of saenz discharge,galloway again contacted flores galloway told flores about saenz treatment at the harlingen emergency room and mcallen behavioral center galloway also informed flores that saenz needed to be taken off the schedule for a while,but she could not tell flores when saenz would be able to work again.flores reminded galloway that saenz was required to contact the hartford,and she asked galloway to have saenz contact her as soon as she was able.flores then removed saenz from the work schedule for the time period of december,through january.flores wrote an s on the schedule where saenz would have been required to work to indicate saenz was sick.
also on december,flores received an email sent from saenz work email address requesting paid days off for december and.the reason for the request stated that saenz had been in the hospital.saenz counsel conceded at oral argument that saenz was the originator of the december email.flores attempted to contact saenz by telephone following her receipt of the email on at least two separate occasions,but she was unable to reach her.
some time between january and january,saenz went to meet with a psychiatrist at tropical texas she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression.in total,she was absent from work on december,and,as well as january and,due to this second illness.
saenz called the hartford regarding her absences on january.during that call,she told the hartford about her diagnosis for bipolar disorder and depression and her stay at the mcallen behavior center.saenz then requested approval for intermittent fmla leave for her newly diagnosed condition.by letter dated january,the hartford began processing a new request for intermittent leave on saenz behalf and requested the submission of medical certification documents.the hartford processed her request in the same way it had addressed her request six months earlier.
saenz also received a letter from harlingen dated january.in it,harlingen informed saenz she was being involuntarily terminated from harlingen medical center effective immediately due to her approved absences.the letter explained that saenz had been required to contact the hartford on january,days following her release.after her termination,saenz made no effort to furnish the medical certification documentation requested by the hartford in its january letter.
saenz sued harlingen and medcath incorporated medcath in state court the defendants removed the case to federal court and then moved for summary judgment.in an order dated july,the district court granted the motion for summary judgment as to medcath on the grounds that saenz failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether medcath was a covered employer under the fmla.the july order expressly held over all questions relating to harlingen to be addressed in a subsequent order after additional briefing.in an order dated august,the district court granted summary judgment as to harlingen on all remaining claims.saenz timely filed her notice of appeal on august,
ii.standard of review 
a grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.bolton city of dallas,cir.the inquiry is limited to the summary judgment record before the trial court.martco.wellons,cir.the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,matsushita indus.zenith radio,and the movant has the burden of showing this court that summary judgment is appropriate.celotex catrett.summary judgment is appropriate where the competent summary judgment evidence demonstrates that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.bolton,at see.c.a genuine issue of material fact exists if a reasonable jury could enter a verdict for the party.anderson liberty lobby.
iii.discussion 
the instant case presents two interrelated issues.first,we must consider whether the district court erred when it relied upon our decision in greenwell state farm mut.auto.ins,cir,to conclude that saenz was required to comply with harlingen heightened fmla notice requirements.second,dependent upon the outcome of that inquiry,we must decide whether saenz provided adequate notice in keeping with harligen procedures or the more relaxed default fmla standard.we address each issue in turn 
whether the district court erred in its conclusion that saenz was required to comply with harlingen fmla procedures 
citing saenz nine prior uses of fmla leave,the district court concluded that saenz knew she was required to contact the hartford within two days of her absence and,hence,her failure to do so forfeited her protections under the fmla.the district court concluded that this outcome was required by our decision in greenwell state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.greenwell addressed a different situation than our case and,thus,is factually distinguishable.we conclude that the district court erred in strictly enforcing harlingen fmla procedures on the facts of this case.
the district court found that saenz had extensive knowledge of harlingen fmla procedures by way of her earlier absences.relying on this undisputed knowledge and saenz history of unexcused absenteeism presumably absences other than the absences,the district court cited greenwell for the proposition that saenz can be held to her employer protocol before she will be found to have provided sufficient,timely notice of an condition.greewell does not paint with so broad a brush.in greenwell,an employee with a history of both fmla and unexcused absenteeism contacted her employer when she was required to miss work due to an injury to her child.at.as the injury was not foreseeable,the employee had not been able to give advance notice of her absence.id.the employee received verbal approval for her absence when she called into work.id.when she returned to work,the employee refused to complete the necessary fmla paperwork,and the employer subsequently terminated her.id.the court,faced with greenwell affirmative refusal to comply,enforced the employer policy because greenwell had actual knowledge of the policy and offered no persuasive reason to justify setting it aside.
the instant case is different from greenwell for three reasons.first,the greenwell court took exception to greenwell failure to provide enough information for the employer to realize she was requesting fmla leave as that court noted,greenwell never mention ed a medical condition or made a request for fmla leave when she contacted her employer to say she would need to miss work.greenwell,at.in the instant case,harlingen had an abundance of information.saenz mother contacted harlingen on three separate calls to flores and one to morturi.she conveyed enough information to morturi to cause morturi to suggest saenz be taken to the emergency room.morturi visited saenz in the hospital and saw her condition first hand.flores conceded in her deposition that she was told about the transfer to mcallen behavioral center for additional medical treatment and the need for treatment.unlike the employer in greenwell,harlingen was not left to wonder what sort of medical problem caused saenz absence or whether that problem qualified for fmla leave.harlingen extensive involvement in saenz treatment provided information far in excess of the minimums demanded by the greenwell court.
second,unlike in greenwell,we can not conclude on this record that saenz affirmatively refused to comply with her employer procedure.the greenwell court was extremely concerned with greenwell affirmative refusal to comply with her employer requirements the greenwell court noted that greenwell decision to not fill out the fmla form also deprived her employer of the opportunity to determine that the leave qualifies under fmla.id.at emphasis added second alteration in original.in fact,the sharing of the informational burden discussed at that point by greenwell and raised by harlingen counsel at oral argument actually cuts against harlingen.here,there is evidence in the record that saenz made three efforts to contact harlingen through her mother and then complied with the heightened company policy nine days later before missing any work other than the days taken off the calendar by flores on december.
finally,saenz knowledge alone of her employer fmla procedures does not justify holding her to a heightened standard.the greenwell court justified imposing the employer special heightened standards for two reasons.first,greenwell admitted to consciously refusing to follow her employer procedures.greenwell,at.on this limited summary judgment record,we have no such refusal.second,in greenwell no persuasive reasons for straying from the employer fmla procedures existed id.at.the court noted that greenwell conceded her son condition had not been severe,the family physician had no record of the incident because it was not a major incident,and,more generally,greenwell never conveyed sufficient information for the employer to make an initial determination of fmla qualification.id.saenz has made no similar concessions and there is at least some evidence in the record to support her argument that she was suffering from a severe psychiatric episode.she was hospitalized.she was placed under a judicially created guardianship for several days.she was released into her mother care until january much of this information was conveyed contemporaneously by way of her mother and morturi personal visit to allow harlingen to make an initial fmla qualification determination.
as such,greenwell does not support holding saenz to her employer specific procedures on the record here presented.we recognize that the summary judgment record is thin,and harlingen may yet find evidence supportive of applying a heightened notice requirement.at the very least,however,saenz has raised a fact issue as to whether the facts of this case support application of a heightened standard.
this conclusion does not end our inquiry,however,because if she failed to comply with the fmla itself in giving notice,harlingen may still have been entitled to summary judgment.thus,we examine whether saenz contacted harlingen as soon as practicable herself or by way of an agent to provide enough information to allow harlingen to recognize she was taking fmla leave as required by the fmla regulations.
whether saenz adequately provided fmla notice under 
the fmla more relaxed notice requirements are codified within the fmla and.in light of the requirements set forth in the applicable regulations and viewing the facts in the light most favorable to saenz as the party,we find that saenz provided satisfactory notice by way of galloway calls to flores and morturi on december,morturi presence in the emergency room,and galloway call to flores on december.
the fmla requires only that an employee contact her employer and state that leave is needed as soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case.a b.an employee need not expressly assert rights under the fmla or even mention the fmla.id.once an employee meets this low threshold,she is merely required to respond to reasonable employer inquiries for additional information.
on december,galloway contacted flores to inform her that saenz would not be able to work due to a severe medical condition involving hallucinations and disorientation.galloway then contacted morturi and provided the same information.morturi was sufficiently alarmed by galloway description to encourage her to bring saenz to harlingen own emergency room.morturi then personally observed saenz receiving treatment in the hospital where saenz and morturi worked.galloway again called flores on december and informed her that saenz had missed work on december because saenz had been in the emergency room and that she had been sent to another hospital due to the condition galloway had described to her on december.she also informed flores that she needed to remove saenz from the schedule because saenz was still suffering from the same condition and required additional treatment.galloway did not provide an anticipated dura
