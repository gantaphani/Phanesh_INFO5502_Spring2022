background 
dollar general appeal presents a purely legal the fmla prohibits retaliation against an employee exercise of fmla accordingly the factual background of the case has little bearing on the outcome of this appeal.as a result,we provide only a brief recitation of the underlying facts.
in,bryant began working for dollar general as a senior programmer analyst in its financial marketing department.in,bryant was diagnosed with type ii diabetes,high blood pressure,and a heart condition,and bryant supervisors were aware of her conditions.in early,dollar general assigned bryant to the distribution center transaction project dct project,a project that was running behind schedule and missing deadlines.joint appendix at trial tr.at.
in early may,bryant completed paperwork for fmla leave shortly afterward,dollar general began a disciplinary process against her,allegedly for her involvement in an office argument in late april.bryant took fmla leave from may to and from may to may,and dollar general fired her on may.bryant testified in a deposition and at trial that,at the time dollar general fired her,a supervisor commented on her health problems,stating that b ecause of your health,i do think you can do the job.at trial tr.at.
in october,bryant filed this lawsuit,claiming that dollar general had violated the americans with disabilities act ada and the fmla.in august,the district court granted dollar general motion for summary judgment on bryant claims under the ada and her claim for harassment under the fmla,but denied the motion as to bryant claim for retaliation under the fmla.
a trial on bryant fmla retaliation claim occurred from october,to november.at the conclusion of the parties proofs,dollar general made an oral motion for judgment as a matter of law.dollar general argued that the relevant statutory section of the fmla,does not prohibit retaliation against the exercise of fmla leave.at tr.of oral argument arguing that the statute only specifically deals with discrimination against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by this subchapter quoting a.dollar general noted that a regulation,c,expanded somewhat on and that the regulation says an employer is prohibited from discriminating against employees or prospective employees who have used fmla leave.at quoting c.dollar general counsel continued,stating that l ooking at the regulations,again it just prohibits discrimination against an employee who has used fmla leave.bryant testified that the first time she exercised rights under fmla,took fmla leave,was on may of.at.dollar general then argued that the question then becomes whether the fact that she took six days off is enough to leave a jury a question of fact as to whether her termination was the result of taking that leave.and the defendant position is that it is not.at trial tr.at.
the district court denied dollar general motion,stating that it a jury question for the jury to determine whether there is that required causal connection between the adverse is,her the fact that she took time off under the family and medical leave act.at.
dollar general asserted its statutory interpretation claim again in argument about the jury instructions.dollar general stated its position that the jury instruction 
should read that instead of for having exercised rights,it should say for taking leave under the family and medical leave act.
the source for that,again,as i explained during the rule motion,is the statute itself does not provide for a retaliation claim such as the one being brought.the statute only provides for a retaliation claim when an individual has opposed practices.
and the,cfr,section c.that is the source for this particular part of the claim.and the first sentence says,an employer is prohibited from discriminating against employees or prospective employees who have used fmla leave.it does not say for exercising fmla rights.
and so we asking again that the instructions and the claim mirror the language of the regulation.
at trial tr.at quoting c see also at trial tr.at requesting again that consistent with the regulations,we would ask that rather than exercising their rights that that be taking leave.the district court declined to make dollar general proposed change to the jury instructions and,after the district court instructed the jury,dollar general again stated its position regarding the language of the statute,namely that there should be no instruction,because the fmla does not provide for a retaliation claim under these circumstances.the only circumstance is when an individual an opposition clause,like under title vii.and that the only issue covered by the fmla.at trial tr.at.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of bryant on the claim and awarded her in damages dollar general made no motions.following the district court entry of judgment on november,dollar general timely appealed.
in may,bryant filed a motion in our court to dismiss dollar general appeal for lack of jurisdiction.in june,dollar general filed a response,and bryant then filed a reply.on july,a panel of our court filed an order referring bryant motion to dismiss to the merits panel.
ii.analysis 
bryant motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction 
in her motion to dismiss dollar general appeal,bryant argues that dollar general failure to renew its rule motion for judgment as a matter of law deprives our court of jurisdiction under the supreme court decision in unitherm food systems,d.dollar general responds by arguing that bryant reads unitherm too broadly and that in any event our court has jurisdiction to consider dollar general statutory interpretation argument through its objections to the jury instructions or by construing its motion as one brought pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure h,which permits a defendant to raise at trial the defense that the plaintiff has f ail ed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.h.we agree with dollar general and deny bryant motion to dismiss because dollar general objections to the jury instructions support our jurisdiction in this case.
dollar general principal argument on appeal is that the fmla does not prohibit an employer from firing an employee because that employee took leave.dollar general repetition of this argument in challenging the jury instructions suffices to preserve the issue for our review.that dollar general also made this argument in a rule motion for judgment as a matter law and then failed to renew that motion is therefore inconsequential,even if we were to accept bryant reading of unitherm 
as stated above,dollar general repeatedly challenged the jury instructions,adopting the same basic position it took in its oral motion for judgment as a matter of law and arguing that there should be no instruction,because the fmla does not provide for a retaliation claim under these circumstances.the only circumstance is when an individual an opposition clause,like under title vii.and that the only issue covered by the fmla.at see also at.we review jury instructions as a whol
