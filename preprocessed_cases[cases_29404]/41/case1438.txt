this is a suit for medical malpractice,governed,so far as relates to the appeals,by illinois law.a jury awarded the plaintiff million.both parties defendant arguing that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law,the plaintiff arguing that he was entitled to a larger damages award.the plaintiff appeal is academic on the view we take of the case.
shirley johnson,a woman in her fifties weighing pounds,had a severe allergic reaction to peanuts while eating at a chinese restaurant.her husband drove her to the nearby provena immediate care center.immediate care centers,also called clinics,provide or minor emergency services to patients on a basis.webmd,www.webmd.com a to zguides better care at lower costs do i need to go to the emergency room visited june.when they arrived,at about,a nurse from the center saw that johnson,slumped in the passenger seat of the car and already comatose,was having serious difficulty breathing and her skin was turning blue.walter drubka,a physician at the center,was summoned.he immediately diagnosed anaphylactic shock and instructed his staff to call,inject johnson with epinephrine johnson did not have an epipen with syringe loaded with epinephrine that persons with serious food allergies are supposed to have with them at all times,and fetch him his equipment for treating a patient whose airway is blocked,a common consequence of anaphylactic shock.the equipment included an ambu bag,which is placed over the patient face and forces oxygen into her lungs,and an endotracheal tube that is put through the patient throat into her trachea,a procedure called intubation.
a team of five paramedics employed by the defendant came on the scene at,three minutes after the johnsons had arrived at the center.with some difficulty because of johnson weight they removed her from the car and carried her to the ambulance which took two minutes,meanwhile being briefed by drubka,who was using the ambu bag on her without success.standing medical orders smos issued pursuant to state health regulations for the guidance of paramedics and others who provide emergency medical treatment authorize a physician at the scene to take control of the patient.drubka told the paramedics that johnson had to be intubated immediately,and he offered to do so,but they declined his offer and said we take care of it from here.they denied at the trial that he made such an offer,but we must take the facts as favorably to the plaintiff as the record permits.one of them,corneliuson,had performed numerous least twice as many as more recently than drubka,who had performed his last one a year and a half earlier and who unlike corneliuson was unaccustomed to working in the crowded confines of an ambulance.
other paramedics in the group went to work administering intravenously to johnson,benadryl,a medicine that like epinephrine fights anaphylaxis.they did not try to administer epinephrine itself even though the standing medical orders call for it to be administered first,in a case of anaphylactic shock,and benadryl second.
corneliuson could not intubate johnson because johnson jaws were clenched shut.the paramedics administered intravenously a drug called versed to loosen her jaws.the record does not indicate when they had clenched.drubka had managed to insert an oral airway a device for preventing the tongue from blocking the patient johnson mouth while she was slumped in her car,so her jaws could not have been clenched then.as johnson was being transferred from car to ambulance,she fell off the gurney being used to carry her,owing to her weight,and the airway fell out.the paramedics put her into the ambulance and one of them inserted another oral airway into her mouth.that was at and it was at some unknown point after that that her jaws clenched,preventing corneliuson from intubating her until the versed took effect.
the fact of clenching is critical and so we note that the plaintiff does not take issue with the statement in the defendant brief filed first that after ambu bagging johnson,corneliuson attempted to open her mouth to intubate,but found her mouth was clenched shut.the plaintiff brief states that versed was administered to shirley johnson because her jaw muscles needed to be relaxed.had johnson jaws not been clenched,there would have been no reason to give her versed.the plaintiff does not argue that the paramedics gave it to her unnecessarily,and this implies that her jaws were indeed clenched.in any event,with immaterial exceptions,judges do not interrogate factual assertions made by a party unless his opponent contests them.herzog village of winnetka,cir.
the standing medical orders to which we referred state that if the drug first used to sedate the patient so that she can be intubated does work within a minute,another drug,etomidate,should be administered forthwith.instead of doing that the paramedics gave johnson further doses of versed.with the ambulance now moving because the paramedics were eager to get johnson to a hospital emergency room,a second attempt at intubation failed,but a third at least the paramedics thought it had approximately.
the ambulance arrived at the emergency room some three minutes later and thus about minutes after the paramedics had first arrived at the immediate care center.the staff of the hospital emergency room quickly discovered that the endotracheal tube was in johnson esophagus rather than her trachea.with some difficulty a doctor johnson properly.but by this time,and possibly a good deal earlier,she had suffered severe,irreversible brain damage precipitating her into a vegetative state in which she remained until she was pronounced dead some two and a half years later.her medical expenses exceeded million.the estate did not sue the chinese restaurant though johnson had before going there to eat asked the restaurant staff whether its food contained peanuts and had been told it did not,but did sue provena,the owner of both the hospital and the immediate care center,and drubka,along with the paramedic service.the jury exonerated all but the last.ironically,provena,though it was a defendant,is the most likely beneficiary of the verdict.the johnsons were not well to do and in all likelihood could not have paid the huge hospital bill.
illinois emergency medical services systems act provides that a licensed emergency medical services provider,such as the defendant paramedic service,who in good faith provides emergency medical services in the normal course of conducting their activities,or in an emergency,shall not be civilly liable as a result of their acts or omissions in providing such services unless such acts or omissions constitute willful and wanton misconduct.ilcs a.the purpose of thus exempting emergency medical providers from liability for mere negligence is to encourage emergency response by trained medical personnel without risk of malpractice liability for every bad outcome or unfortunate occurrence.emergency situations are often fraught with tension,confusion,and as here,difficult physical locations for giving medical care.emergency personnel must not be afraid to do whatever they can under less than ideal circumstances.gleason village of peoria heights,d,see also bowden cary fire protection district,d,brock anderson road ass n,d.
at common law,rescuers were fully liable for any negligence committed by them in the course of the rescue.nelson union wire rope,jackson city of joliet,cir illinois law if you do begin to rescue someone you must complete the rescue in a nonnegligent fashion even though you had no duty of rescue in the first place.this made sense when the intervention of an incompetent worsened the patient condition or precluded intervention by a competent rescuer.cuyler united states,cir stockberger united states,cir.but it had a tendency as the illinois cases emphasize to deter even competent rescuers from volunteering their services,since if the rescue failed they might face a lawsuit.jennings southwood.the problem is especially acute if,as in a case such as this,the rescuer can not seek restitution for the benefit conferred by a successful rescue.nevertheless if the negligence system operated
