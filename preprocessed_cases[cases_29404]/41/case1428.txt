mary rios squibb brought this action against her former employer,memorial medical center memorial,claiming violations of the americans with disabilities act ada or act and the illinois workers compensation act iwca.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of memorial on the ada claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the iwca state law claims.squibb now appeals the grant of summary judgment on the ada claims.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
squibb began working for memorial in as a certified nurse assistant and remained there after obtaining her license as a registered nurse.between and,squibb sustained three back injuries in the course of her duties.each injury occurred when she had attempted to lift or move a patient.while recovering from her first injury,squibb had certain temporary lifting restrictions and an attendant corrective surgery.eventually,she was released to work without restrictions.
after the third back injury in,she again required surgery and a significant recovery period.prior to the surgery,her physician,stephen pineda,placed her on several restrictions.she was not to lift in excess of pounds,push or pull,sit or stand for extended periods,or bend or stoop.in april,following a surgery in december,she was returned to work.she could lift no more than pounds and could work for only four hours each day.squibb stated in her deposition that she sometimes was required to push a wheelchair while on,but that she generally did not return to patient care duties and received help with patient lifting whenever necessary.during this period she received an additional temporary assignment within her restrictions.
squibb gradually was advanced to working five days per week and was permitted by her physician to return to patient care.however,the lifting restriction initially remained in place,and,accordingly,she remained in temporary,clerical,positions until august.unhappy with her inability to work in a patient care nursing capacity,squibb requested a further release.pineda loosened her lifting restriction to allow lifts of up to fifty pounds,but informed her that she likely had reached maximum improvement.her restriction would be permanent.
with this additional release on the lifting restrictions,squibb was transferred to a temporary rn position.by december,however,the restriction was confirmed to be permanent,and memorial was notified.memorial,in turn,communicated to squibb that she would have to look for a permanent position that would accommodate her permanent restrictions because she would no longer be held in temporary assignments.squibb characterizes this communication as a termination memorial claims she was placed on leave.at the end of january,squibb filed an eeoc charge in which she claimed that she was terminated because of her disability in violation of the ada.
in january,squibb underwent a functional capacity evaluation fce required by memorial to assess her physical abilities before another appropriate position could be found for her.the results of the fce revealed that squibb could kneel,crouch,stand or sit continuously,that she could twist frequently and that she could bend occasionally.at c.her lifting maximum in the test was roughly pounds,but she could do this only rarely.id.in continuous lifting or carrying,she was limited to roughly pounds.she could push and pull upwards of fifty pounds rarely,but,again,the fce revealed that,on a continuous basis,she would be limited to significantly lighter loads of about pounds.the written text accompanying the fce stated that squibb was in a d econditioned state which limited her material handling and climbing abilities.id.at b.it otherwise reported that she was currently functioning at a light physical demands level,well under the permanent restriction placed on her by her physician.id.
following this test,which concluded that her abilities do not match the physical demands of a registered nurse at memorial,squibb began working as a patient placement coordinator,a position which she was told would fit her physical limitations.in the approximately three months that she held the position,between february and may,she claims that she twice was asked to perform duties outside her restrictions.she missed several days of work for reasons during this period and she provided physicians notes for these absences.she received lukewarm performance ratings in this position,and,apparently in response to her absences,memorial placed her on administrative leave lasting until april.
squibb brought the present action at the end of april,but her employment odyssey with memorial continued.in june,squibb provided another letter from pineda that stated that she could return to light duty with exact limits to be determined by another fce.memorial responded by asking whether the lifting restrictions remained in place at squibb request,no additional medical information was provided.
she applied for additional positions in the field of local medical review policy,for which she believes she was qualified,and for one additional position recommended by memorial human resources personnel as a clinical case manager.memorial eventually filled one of the local medical review policy positions with an employee it contends had more relevant experience it eliminated the additional position without filling it.memorial offered squibb the clinical case manager position,but she declined because she believed the job requirements to be outside her physical restrictions.in january,memorial terminated squibb for failure to return from leave when offered the clinical case manager position.
district court proceedings 
squibb complaint against memorial alleged that memorial had violated the ada at various times during her employment relationship.the bases for her claims were essentially that memorial failed to reasonably accommodate her disability wrongfully terminated her in december because of her disability or perceived disability,and terminated her again in january because she refused a position that she was physically unable to perform because of her disability refused to hire her for either of the two local medical review policy positions because of her disability refused to hire her for the local medical review policy positions in retaliation for her january eeoc charge and for filing the instant lawsuit in april and terminated her in january,also in retaliation for her charge and her lawsuit.she also alleged that she was wrongfully discharged in violation of the iwca in december and january.
memorial moved for summary judgment on all claims.the district court granted that motion on the ada claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the iwca claims.the court ruled that squibb was not disabled squibb was not a qualified individual with a disability because no reasonable accommodation would allow her to perform the essential functions of the patient care rn positions she sought and squibb had not produced direct evidence of discrimination in support of her retaliation charge nor had she met the requirements of a prima facie case under the indirect method.squibb timely appeals the entry of judgment against her.
discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,here,squibb.timmons motors,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with any affidavits,show that there is no genuine issue of material fact,and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.once the movant has met this burden,in order to survive summary judgment,the nonmoving party must make a sufficient showing of evidence for each essential element of its case on which it bears the burden at trial.celotex,at.the nonmoving party can not succeed by resting on its pleadings it must provide evidence on which a jury could reasonably find in its favor.anderson liberty lobby,d.
squibb claims that memorial violated the ada by failing to reasonably accommodate her disability,failing to hire her because of her disability or perceived disability and terminating her because of her disability or perceived disability.the ada prohibition on employment discrimination provides,
no covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures,the hiring,advancement,or discharge of employees,employee compensation,job training,and other terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.
a emphasis added.a plaintiff seeking to avoid summary judgment must demonstrate that there is at least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he is disabled,whether he can perform the essential functions of the position,and whether he has suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability.kupstas city of greenwood,cir.
the ada defines disability as a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of the individual b a record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment.squibb claims that she has a disability,either under subsection a,because she has an impairment that substantially limits major life activities,or under subsection c,because memorial regarded her as having such an impairment.the district court determined that there were no material facts in dispute,and squibb was not disabled as a matter of law.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to squibb,her restrictions and memorial own fce demonstrate that her back injuries limit her movement and her physical strength in a number of ways.she can not lift objects over pounds she can not bend or twist continuously she struggles,in varying degrees,with pulling,pushing and climbing 
to determine whether her back condition,with its attendant physical consequences renders squibb disabled for purposes of the statute,we ask whether it substantially limits her in any major life activity.the regulations provide that an individual is substantially limited in such activities if she is unable to perform such an activity or is s ignificantly restricted as to the condition,manner or duration under which she can perform it,as compared to an average person in the general population.j whether a particular impairment substantially limits a major life activity is a,individualized inquiry.kampmier emeritus,cir.squibb claims to be limited in her ability to work,sleep,care for herself,walk,sit and engage in sexual intercourse,all of which she identifies as major life activities we consider each in turn.
squibb claims that,because of her back injury,she is substantially limited in the major life activity of working.this court previously has held that working is a major life activity and the parties have not asked the court to reconsider that conclusion see kupstas,at i,j.in order to be substantially limited in the major life activity of working,the regulations require that the individual be significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training,skills and abilities.j i.a demonstrated inability to perform a single,particular job does not render an individual substantially limited in the major life activity of working.id.
we previously have expressed doubt that an inability to lift more than ten pounds,which in turn restricts an individual employment opportunities in jobs,could constitute a disability within the meaning of the statute.see mays principi,cir noting that,although not raised by the parties,the court did not wish to endorse by its silence the view that a nurse whose back injuries restricted her lifting to a maximum of ten pounds was disabled within the meaning of federal disability law see also id.at the physician who determined the severity and duration of her back injury thought she could return to her job as a nurse.the number of americans restricted by back problems to light work is legion.they are not disabled.contreras suncast,cir holding that an individual who was unable to lift in excess of pounds for a long period of time,unable to engage in strenuous work,and unable to drive a forklift for more than four hours a day was not substantially limited in the major life activity of working.
these decisions find support in the direction provided by the supreme court when a plaintiff claimed disability limits her employment opportunities 
to be substantially limited in the major life activity of working one must be precluded from more than one type of job,a specialized job,or a particular job of choice.if jobs utilizing an individual skills but perhaps not his or her unique talents are available,one is not precluded from a substantial class of jobs.similarly,if a host of different types of jobs are available,one is not precluded from a broad range of jobs.
sutton united air lines,d emphasis added.
as both the eeoc regulations and sutton explicitly state,squibb inability to work any longer in her nursing job of choice,patient care nursing in a general services hospital,does not demonstrate that she is substantially limited in the major life activity of working.
in an attempt to fit within the supreme court description,squibb contends that her limitation precludes her from performing all nursing positions involving patient care.she claims that this preclusion demonstrates that she is significantly restricted in performing a class of jobs.however,as we have stated,a class of jobs is the job from which a claimant was disqualified,as well as all other jobs utilizing similar training,knowledge,and skills within the geographical area to which the claimant has reasonable access.eeoc rockwell int l,cir quoting j i modification in original.squibb is a professional woman holding a license in nursing we therefore must consider her working limitations in the context of other persons possessing similar training,skills and abilities and the manner of jobs open to them.see j i.in support of her claim,she notes that memorial website only advertises patient care nursing positions and that memorial is the largest nursing employer in the area.despite this submission,she nevertheless further submits evidence that memorial itself has available nursing positions,including patient care nursing positions,for which all of the duties fall within her physical abilities.see appellant br.at on the basis of this record,therefore,squibb certainly has not raised a triable issue of fact as to whether her back condition substantially limits her ability to work.squibb evidence on this point does not cross the minimum threshold for demonstrating that she can not perform a class of jobs not only has she failed to produce evidence of the range of care nursing positions that persons with her training could perform,within her restrictions,her evidence demonstrates that she may perform certain positions in the particular job of patient care nursing she seeks.a person can not demonstrate that she is significantly limited in performing a class of jobs when her own evidence demonstrates that there are jobs within the broad parameters of her professional calling that she can perform without restriction.accord brunko mercy,cir stating that a nurse with a pound lifting restriction was only precluded from performing a narrow range of jobs by her limitations and,therefore,was not substantially limited in the major life activity of working.
squibb further maintains that,because of her condition,she is unable to perform all medium and jobs she claims this demonstrates that she is restricted from performing a broad range of jobs in various classes.to determine whether an individual is precluded,by reason of their impairment,from performing a broad range of jobs in various classes,we consider the job from which a claimant was disqualified,as well as all other jobs not utilizing similar training,knowledge,and skills within the geographical area to which the claimant has reasonable access.rockwell int l,at quoting j ii a,c emphasis added modification in original.squibb blanket contention that she can not perform anything other than a job does not demonstrate that she is significantly restricted in performing a broad range of jobs.she has submitted no evidence of the range of jobs available in her geographic area that would fall within her physical restrictions,even if they would not make use of her particular skills.accordingly,this basis for her claimed limitation on the major life activity of working suffers from a failure of proof.
because squibb has not produced evidence sufficient to create a triable issue of fact regarding whether her back condition significantly restricted her ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes,she has not demonstrated that she is substantially limited in the major life activity of working.
squibb claims that,due to her back pain,she is unable to sleep for longer than three to four hours per night and,therefore,is substantially limited in the major life activity of sleeping.although this court has indicated that sleeping is a major life activity,scheerer potter,cir,we have required evidence that the limitations on sleeping claimed by the plaintiff are sufficiently prolonged,severe and to warrant classification as a disability,burks wisconsin dep t of,cir.we have considered the extent to which a claimed lack of sleep contributes to a decreased functional level in determining whether the severity of the sleep deprivation at issue rose to the level of a disability.see id.squibb generalized assertions that she is unable to sleep for substantial periods of time,unsupported by any additional evidence,medical or otherwise,and unenhanced by claims that this lack of sleep affects her daytime functions,are insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact on her claim that she is disabled because of the limitations on her ability to sleep 
squibb also claims to be substantially limited in the major life activity of caring for herself.see i identifying caring for oneself as an example of a major life activity.in support of her claim,squibb relies on her own statements that she has difficulty with the specific activities of zipping or buttoning her clothing in the back,brushing the back of her hair,and that she is limited in her ability to do household tasks such as cooking,cleaning and grocery shopping,although she performs certain of these tasks on occasion.in light of the tasks she admittedly can perform driving,bathing,brushing her teeth,dressing herself,we must conclude that,as a matter of law,the limitations she claims do not demonstrate that she is prevent ed or severely restrict ed,toyota motor,kentucky,williams,d,from caring for herself.see holt grand lake mental health,cir noting that an individual who sometimes has difficulty eating and must chew her food thoroughly or it will become lodged in her throat,can not cut her own fingernails or toenails,can dress herself,but sometimes must ask for help when buttoning her clothes had not raised a genuine issue of fact as to whether she was substantially limited in the major life activity of caring for herself.
squibb next contends that she is substantially limited in the major life activities of sitting and walking.she specifically claims that she is unable to sit for more than thirty minutes at a time and that her difficulties walking were noticed and documented in an by one of her supervisors.other than stating that she walks with difficulty,she does not identify any specific as time or her ability to walk.the only additional evidence relating to her abilities in these functions contained in the record,the fce,specifically finds that she can sit or stand continuously.even taking squibb contentions regarding her ability to walk or sit at face value,her assertion that she needs breaks every thirty minutes does not compare to the claims this court has held should survive summary judgment.see,eeoc sears,roebuck,cir reversing summary judgment for employer where employee evidence showed she could walk no more than one block.on this record,a trier of fact could not conclude rationally that squibb is substantially limited in the major life activities of sitting and walking.
squibb finally contends that she is substantially limited in the major life activity of sexual relations.
the supreme court has ruled that sexual reproduction is a major life activity.bragdon abbott,d.although this court has recognized that it could be inferred from bragdon that engaging in sexual relations constitutes a major life activity,it has deferred the question.see scheerer,at.we do so again here,because,even if we concluded that sexual relations is a major life activity,squibb has not demonstrated sufficient evidence of her limitation to prevent summary judgment on this issue.see contreras,at e ven if we assume that engaging in sexual relations is a major life activity,contreras has not substantiated his claim of sexual difficulties with any documentation or testimony beyond a general assertion that the frequency with which he has relations has decreased.we previously have held that a plaintiff own conclusory assertion of reduced ability to engage in intercourse is insufficient to create a genuine issue of triable fact.id.squibb claim suffers the same deficiency.although her own deposition testimony states that she has been unable to engage in sexual relations for two years due to her back pain,she has provided no other evidence of her claimed sexual limitation neither is any difficulty easily inferred from the minimal restrictions placed on her physical activity by her physician or from the physical limitations revealed by the fce on continuous activities in an eight hour working day.
in any event,as we have noted elsewhere,it is unclear in what manner a plaintiff employer would accommodate a disability that restricted the plaintiff ability to engage in sexual relations.scheerer,at even if he could provide such evidence,scheerer fails to explain in what fashion the postal service could reasonably accommodate his diabetes in the context of symptoms of sexual dysfunction.we agree with our colleagues in the eighth circuit that,to the extent an ada discrimination claim centers on a request for a workplace accommodation,there must be some causal connection between the major life activity that is limited and the accommodation sought.nuzum ozark auto,cir rejecting the plaintiff claim that his inability to hug could be the basis for an ada claim against his employer,because even if the plaintiff were held to be disabled by virtue of the hugging limitation,it would not save his claim since he seeks an accommodation from his employer,which must be related to the limitation in question.
in addition to her claims that she suffers from an impairment that qualifies as a disability under the statute,squibb also claims that memorial regarded her as substantially limited in the major life activities of walking and working.
this court recently has clarified that,in order to proceed under the regarded as prong of the ada,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the employer believed that the employee had an impairment that substantially limited one or more major life activities.see kampmier,at.if the condition that is the subject of the employer belief is not substantially limiting,and the employer does not believe that it is,then there is no violation of the ada under the regarded as prong of the statute.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.squibb claims that the hospital had notice of her difficulties with patient care nursing related to lifting and,therefore,moved her to an unassigned nursing position rather than staff nursing in addition,memorial employees had noticed and reported her difficulties walking to a supervisor.however,squibb claims essentially rest on memorial knowledge of her claimed disabilities.she has not presented any evidence that suggests that memorial beliefs about her limitations exceeded the scope of her actual limitations.as we already have concluded,the impairments she claims do not,on their own accord,rise to the level of substantial limitations in the major life activities of walking or working.therefore,
