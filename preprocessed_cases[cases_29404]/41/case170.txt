plaintiff leanne engelhardt appeals the dismissal of her claim for wrongful termination under the family medical leave act,et the fmla.we affirm because defendant richards spr employed fewer than people within miles of its nashua facility,and defendants genuine parts gpc and spr together,defendants are not integrated entities under the fmla.thus,engelhardt was not an eligible employee under a.
spr,a subsidiary of gpc,is an office supplies wholesaler headquartered in smyrna,georgia.gpc is a corporation,and operates an auto parts retailing business under the name genuine parts napa auto parts,based in atlanta,georgia.
spr adopted gpc personnel policies on attendance,sexual harassment,substance abuse,corporate conduct and network security.many of spr handbooks,benefits brochures,information sheets,registration forms and paycheck stubs carry the gpc logo or letterhead instead of,or in addition to,spr logo.spr employees are eligible to participate in employee health insurance,life insurance,k,and pension plans.gpc also issues spr payroll checks.spr pays an administrative fee and reimburses gpc for all benefits and wages paid to spr employees.
spr hired engelhardt as a customer service representative at its nashua distribution facility in february and terminated her on december.she had missed work the previous day and a half without authorization to care for her daughter who had attempted suicide.this was the third time that she had missed work for that reason.
engelhardt filed this lawsuit in the district court claiming that her termination,among other things,was in violation of the fmla.the district court granted summary judgment on the basis that,pursuant to a,englehardt was ineligible for fmla benefits because spr did not employ the requisite number of people at its nashua facility see engelhardt richards,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.engelhardt argued that gpc and spr ought to be considered a single,integrated employer under c because of the overlap in the substance and administration of their employment policies,and the implication suggested by spr documents that gpc controlled spr human resource and labor practices.the district court rejected the argument,which otherwise would have counted gpc nashua employees toward fmla eligibility.see id.englehardt appeals this determination.
the only issue before us is whether the district court erred in granting defendants summary judgment motion on the basis that spr and gpc are not integrated employers within the meaning of c.we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.see,cir.we will affirm the dismissal if,after construing all reasonable inferences in engelhardt favor,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and gpc and spr are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the parties agreed at oral argument there were no disputes of material fact.thus,the question is strictly a legal one whether,based upon the record,spr and gpc are integrated entities.
the fmla provides eligible employees of covered employers up to twelve workweeks of unpaid leave in any period in order to tend to certain familial obligations,such as caring for a loved one who has a serious health condition.see,a.it is unlawful for any employer to interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise,any right provided under the fmla,and the act provides for a private right of enforcement,see a.the parties agree,at least arguendo,that engelhardt daughter depression and suicide attempt amount to a serious enough condition to qualify for fmla protection.
pursuant to its authority under the fmla,see,the department of labor the dol has promulgated regulations which set forth the eligibility requirements for both employers and employees.a defines eligible employees and requires that the employee 
be employed at a worksite where or more employees are employed by the employer within miles of that worksite.
a defines covered employers,
any person engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce,who employs or more employees for each working day during each of or more calendar workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year.
normally the legal entity which employs the employee is the employer under fmla a corporation is a single employer rather than its separate establishments or divisions.c.however,a subsidiary is treated differently,as there is a strong presumption that a parent corporation is not the employer of its subsidiary employees.lusk foxmeyer health,cir citation omitted.our task is to clarify how to distinguish between an entity that is a division of,and therefore part of a corporation,and one that is a subsidiary and therefore a separate entity.in radio television broadcast technicians local broadcast service of mobile,d per curiam,the supreme court articulated the integrated employer also,the single employer test in the labor relations context to determine when an entity is sufficiently related to one legal employer to subject it to liability.the dol subsequently codified the above general rule and the exception in its fmla regulations 
where one corporation has an ownership interest in another corporation,it is a separate employer unless it meets the joint employment test discussed in,or the integrated employer test contained in paragraph c of this section 
separate entities will be deemed to be parts of a single employer for purposes of fmla if they meet the integrated employer test.where this test is met,the employees of all entities making up the integrated employer will be counted in determining employer coverage and employee eligibility.a determination of whether or not separate entities are an integrated employer is not determined by the application of any single criterion,but rather the entire relationship is to be reviewed in its totality.factors considered in determining whether two or more entities are an integrated employer include 
i common management 
ii interrelation between operations 
iii centralized control of labor relations and 
iv common ownership.
c and footnote added.
engelhardt contends that the integrated employer test is met because spr admits having adopted some of gpc employment policies and gpc administers spr employee benefits programs.she also points to documentary evidence which are purported to be gpc forms.it includes,for example,the separation notice she signed before her termination the employee attendance policy forms the code of corporate conduct form the sexual harassment policy form and the employee benefits packages,along with the accompanying brochures,information sheets,and election and acknowledgment forms many of these documents were on gpc letterhead or were stamped with the gpc logo and the cover letter for the benefits forms even addressed engelhardt generically as dear gpc employee.moreover,englehardt paychecks were processed through gpc and bore gpc and spr logos.
in romano international,cir,a title vii case,we determined that a flexible approach which considered all four integrated employer factors was appropriate,with special emphasis on whether the parent exerts an amount of participation that is sufficient and necessary to the total employment process,even absent total control or ultimate authority over hiring decisions.id.citing armbruster quinn,cir.
while placing emphasis on the centrality of control over labor relations makes sense for imposing liability on affiliated entities in an employment discrimination case,romano,at,we think that,here,the four factors merit equal consideration given the plain language of c.however,our analysis of the four factors should be informed by certain economic concerns.this is because the exception is an economic one rooted in protecting small businesses,and the purpose of the integrated employer test is to ensure that a defendant has not structured itself to avoid labor laws.see papa katy,cir.
while we do not doubt that gpc relationship with spr extends beyond mere absentee ownership,the issue is whether gpc controls enough facets of spr business and operations,such that it has not maintained its economic distinctness.
we find support for our framing of the issue in the fmla.the general p
