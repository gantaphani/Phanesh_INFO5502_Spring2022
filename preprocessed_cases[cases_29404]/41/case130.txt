this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment in a diversity action.suzanna sensing,who suffers from multiple sclerosis,brought suit against her former employer,outback steakhouse outback,and her manager,charles kozmits,collectively,the appellees,alleging handicap discrimination in violation of the massachusetts statute.laws ch.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees.sensing timely appealed.after careful consideration,we reverse.
background 
outback operates a nationwide group of steakhouse restaurants,including one located in peabody,massachusetts,where the events related to this appeal took place.kozmits was the managing partner of the peabody outback during the relevant period.sensing was employed at the peabody outback restaurant from march until may.initially hired as a hostess,sensing was soon promoted to the position of takeaway.a takeaway at outback takes down customers orders by telephone,does various order preparation work,packages the orders,and delivers the orders to customers waiting in the parking lot sensing twice won employee of the month awards as a takeaway.
in december,sensing,a diabetic,was also diagnosed with an episodic,form of multiple sclerosis ms.ms is a disease affecting the central nervous system.during the disease aggravated state,known as a or exacerbation,persons suffering from the disease experience a worsening of neurologic function,which may include numbness in extremities,difficulty with muscular control affecting activities such as walking,grasping,and balancing,increased fatigue,and emotional lability.can last from a few days to two months or longer.these episodes are followed by partial or complete recovery periods remissions,during which persons with ms can function similarly to persons.sensing discussed her medical diagnoses and her symptoms with her at outback,including key employee erin ray,a member of outback management who was in charge of scheduling workers shifts 
in november,sensing experienced her first major ms.the episode was extremely debilitating sensing was bedridden,unable to walk or feed herself without assistance.during the,sensing was granted a medical leave from her position at outback.at the end of the month sensing ms symptoms improved and she returned to work at outback in a light duty position,performing tasks such as answering telephones and filling out gift certificates.sensing condition continued to improve during this period,though she still had some symptoms and admits to an episode in december when she had to leave work early.
in february,sensing informed kozmits that she wished to return to her previous takeaway role.she provided a note from her neurologist,timothy kelliher,stating that she could resume duties as tolerated,and kozmits cleared her to resume her normal takeaway shifts.from until april,sensing worked regularly as a takeaway.during this period sensing experienced no physical symptoms of ms that impaired her performance,and was able to perform her job in all respects with only minor,accommodations 
sensing experienced a minor recurrence of her ms symptoms in early april,when she began to experience some numbness.during her shift on april,sensing felt unwell and became emotional at work.when ray asked sensing what was wrong,sensing said she had been unable to feel her legs for the past few weeks.ray said that she should go home,but sensing replied that she could not because she needed the money.nevertheless,after arranging to have the remainder of her shift covered and securing her manager approval,sensing went home early.
although she intended to work her next scheduled shift on april,sensing woke up that day again feeling unwell.sensing spoke to ray by telephone and told ray that while she could work if needed,she was still experiencing leg cramps.ray suggested that sensing take that shift off as well because another worker could cover her duties.sensing made clear,however,that she wished to return for her next shift,scheduled for april.
on april,just before sensing scheduled work shift,kozmits telephoned her and told her not to report to work that night and that her shift had been covered.sensing told him that she was fine to work and was planning on coming to work.kozmits responded that he was not comfortable with her coming back to work that night because of the liability,that she should take the vacation she had previously scheduled for early may,get her medications in order and then call him back.sensing was upset and surprised by the decision.she called ray to indicate that she was capable of working and needed the shifts.sensing also asked ray for the fax number for outback so she could fax a new note from her doctor.
the following day,april,sensing visited kozmits at the restaurant and repeated that she was capable of working and desired to return to work.she presented kozmits with the new note from kelliher,which stated that she could return to work without restrictions.kozmits responded that he had serious questions about whether sensing could continue her job as a takeaway and stated that he did not believe that sensing doctors know what going on.kozmits again expressed concerns about liability,stating that he could not have sensing falling in the restaurant because it would cost the restaurant two to three hundred thousand dollars.sensing stated that she was no more of a liability than anyone else,but kozmits disagreed.kozmits said that he would have to contact his corporate superiors for guidance on how to handle the matter.
on april sensing called and left a message for kozmits to call her.kozmits returned her call on april.sensing told kozmits that she had canceled her planned vacation and wished to return to work.kozmits again indicated that he would have to wait for instructions from outback corporate office in tampa,florida,before scheduling sensing for work and that he would get back to her.
sensing called outback again on may and left a verbal message with a asking for kozmits to call her,but kozmits never returned her call on may,sensing again telephoned kozmits at the restaurant and repeated her request to be put back on the work schedule.she stated that she really wanted to get back on the work schedule because she needed the money kozmits replied that he had placed a second call to the corporate office and would let her know as soon as he heard back.later that day,sensing faxed kozmits the following message 
dear charles thank you for the brief chat this morning.as we discussed i really need an answer today regarding my takeaway shifts.i am planning on returning to my normal takeaway schedule on and would like to pick back up this saturday,unless i hear otherwise.i need to work and can not drag this on any longer.thank you,suzanna.
shortly after this fax was sent,kozmits called sensing back.he stated that before sensing would be allowed to return to work as a takeaway,she must submit to an independent medical examination ime,at the company expense and by a physician of their choosing,to determine whether she could safely perform that job he indicated that while the ime was being set up,outback might be willing to schedule sensing for light duty work.this light duty work would be paid at approximately half the hourly rate of the takeaway role and involve approximately the number of hours per week.sensing told kozmits that she did not know if she could financially manage doing the light duty work,but recalls not giving kozmits a firm answer because she wanted to discuss the financial effects of doing so with her husband.kozmits told sensing that he would look for a physician to do the ime and would get back to her with the details as soon as he found a suitable physician to examine her.sensing agreed,and said that she would wait to hear back from him regarding the examination 
after consulting with her husband,sensing concluded that she could not afford to take the light duty position and that it made more sense for her to apply for unemployment.on may,sensing filed for unemployment.in sensing deposition testimony,when asked why she did not agree to take a position while waiting to hear about the ime,she responded it made more sense for me to apply for unemployment than to work three or four hours a to three hours a day for the shift they were talking about.after the may conversation,sensing also contacted an attorney and did not make further contact with kozmits directly.nor did kozmits make further contact with sensing.
kozmits alleges that after several days passed without communication from sensing,he concluded that sensing had come to realize that she was no longer capable of performing the takeaway position and had decided to abandon her job kozmits never contacted sensing to confirm his conclusion that this was her intention.though in his deposition kozmits could not identify the exact date upon which he reached the conclusion that sensing had abandoned her position,he did explain sensing absence from work on may as the result of her abandoning the job.and in july,when sensing acquaintance contacted kozmits to inquire about sensing employment status under the guise of requesting a reference,kozmits stated that sensing was ineligible for rehire,which,as he explained in his deposition,was due to his belief that sensing abandoned her job.in july outback removed sensing from its list of active employees.it is undisputed that kozmits never called sensing back about the ime.
in her deposition,sensing stated that while she made no further personal contact with outback after may,her attorney sent a letter to outback on her behalf on may which requested that she be returned to work.in discovery,sensing certified that the letter was sent 
since may,sensing has held two jobs one at a subway sandwich shop,and one at an arts and crafts store named paint the rainbow.she states that she is capable of work,but due to childcare works only part time.
procedural history 
on august,sensing filed a handicap discrimination charge with the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad alleging handicap discrimination in violation of.laws ch.she alleged that she is a qualified handicapped person who was demoted,terminated or constructively terminated by the appellees from her takeaway position because of her status as a person with ms,or,alternatively,because she was regarded as handicapped by her employer.she also alleged that appellees failed to reasonably accommodate her handicap.
sensing later removed the matter to massachusetts superior court pursuant to of.laws ch,where,in addition to disability discrimination,she also alleged defamation and breach of contract.appellees eventually removed the case,on diversity grounds,to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.a.following discovery,appellees moved for summary judgment,which,on may,the district court granted as to all counts.sensing outback steakhouse of,d.plaintiff appeals the grant of summary judgment as to her discrimination claim only.

applicable law 
sensing claim is brought under massachusetts general laws ch,which prohibits discrimination in employment against qualified persons with a disability.the provision states in pertinent part 
it shall be an unlawful practice f or any employer to dismiss from employment or refuse to hire,rehire or advance in employment or otherwise discriminate against,because of his handicap,any person alleging to be a qualified handicapped person,capable of performing the essential functions of the position involved with reasonable accommodation,unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation required would impose an undue hardship to the employer business.
laws ch,chapter.a qualified handicapped person means a handicapped person who is capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job,or who would be capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job with reasonable accommodation to his handicap.laws.ch.the term handicap means a a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities of a person b a record of having such impairment or c being regarded as having such impairment.laws.ch.pursuant to chapter,mcad has published guidelines to effectuate the purposes of the statute.see.laws ch,the guidelines represent the mcad interpretation of chapter,and are entitled to substantial deference,even though they do not carry the force of law.bay transp.auth.comm against discrimination,internal quotation marks omitted.
notably,chapter is considered the massachusetts analogue to the federal americans with disabilities act ada.whitney greenberg,rosenblatt,kull bitsoli,cir applying the same analysis to evaluate discrimination claims brought under both chapter and the ada.the definitions of disability under the ada and handicap under chapter,for example,are virtually identical.compare with.laws ch,see also carroll,at whitney,at.as a result,t he supreme judicial court of massachusetts sjc has indicated that federal case law construing the ada should be followed in interpreting the massachusetts disability law.whitney,at quoting ward.health research,cir see also carroll,at noting that the state has looked to federal case law to assist in interpreting its statute russell cooley dickinson,explaining that the sjc look s to the federal cases decided under the ada as a guide to the interpretation of chapter labonte hutchins wheeler,noting that because massachusetts employee discrimination law closely mirror s the ada the sjc look s toward federal courts to see how they have addressed the issue wheatley am,case law under other federal statutes,such as the rehabilitation act,has also been regarded as instructive.see cox new england,explaining,in discussing the rehabilitation act,that b ecause of the similarity between the federal and state statutes,the federal cases are most helpful in the resolution of cases involving,which prohibits employment discrimination against qualified handicapped persons.
furthermore,in applying chapter to employment discrimination claims,the supreme judicial court of massachusetts uses a framework along the lines of mcdonnell douglas green,d.see matthews ocean spray cranberries,see also tobin liberty mut.ins,cir.under that framework,sensing must first make a prima facie case of disability discrimination,see,at,by establishing that she suffers from a disability or handicap that she was nevertheless able to perform the essential functions of her job,either with or without reasonable accommodation,and that her employer took an adverse employment action against her because of,in whole or in part,her protected disability.carroll,at.if sensing establishes her prima facie case,the burden then shifts to defendants to articulate a legitimate,reason for their employment decision and to produce credible evidence to show that the reason advanced was the real reason.tobin,at citing,at.finally,if defendants offer such a legitimate reason,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to produce evidence to establish that defendants justification is mere pretext,cloaking discriminatory animus.id.citing,at.
the parties disagree as to whether sensing has established a prima facie case.we begin our analysis there.
prima facie case 
appellees argue that sensing can not prove the first or third elements of her prima facie case.we consider each element in turn.
handicapped 
although the district court did not reach this issue,appellees argue that we can affirm summary judgment on the independent ground that sensing can not establish she suffers from a handicap within the meaning of chapter not all physical or mental impairments constitute a handicap under the massachusetts statute,but rather,as noted above,a defines handicap as a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities.see.laws ch,a.appellees emphasize that a medical diagnosis,without more,is insufficient to establish a handicap under chapter rather,the extent of the limitation in terms of the plaintiff own experience is determinative.city of new bedford.comm against discrimination,quoting carroll,at.appellees argue that sensing essentially conceded in her deposition testimony that her ms condition did not substantially limit one or more of her major life activities,by stating that with the exception of her one major,her ms had not restricted her in any meaningful way.thus,appellees argue that sensing has effectively forfeited the claim that she is handicapped within the meaning of the statute.
we note that sensing position that she was only limited in major life activities during the periods of her episodic ms condition is not inconsistent with being handicapped within the meaning of chapter.see cargill harvard,finding no dispute as to whether plaintiff with rheumatoid arthritis was handicapped within meaning of chapter although pain was intermittent and periods of remission or stabilization did occur nonetheless,we need not decide this issue.whether or not sensing can establish that she is actually handicapped within the meaning of a,sensing argues,and we agree,that she may separately be found handicapped under c on account of being regarded by her employer as having such impairment.
to satisfy the first prong on the basis of being,sensing must produce evidence that regarded her as having an impairment which she did not have,or mistakenly perceived that a impairment substantially limited her in a major life activity.carroll,at see also murphy united parcel,d a person is regarded as disabled within the meaning of the ada if a covered entity mistakenly believes that the person actual,nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities.drawing all reasonable inferences in sensing favor,we conclude that sensing has a reasonable expectation of proving that she was handicapped.
based on the evidence in the summary judgment record,it would be reasonable to infer that kozmits perceived sensing as handicapped,as suffering from a physical impairment that substantially limited her in a major life activity.see city of new bedford,at.ms undoubtedly constitutes an impairment.see mcad guidelines ii a defining impairment,inter alia,as a disorder affecting one or more of a number of body systems labonte,at affirming liability in favor of plaintiff with ms on her claim under that she was terminated because of her handicap b including ms in representative list of disorders and conditions constituting physical impairments for purposes of the ada it is undisputed that,at least by late fall,kozmits was aware of sensing diagnosis.moreover,chapter defines the term major life activities as including such functions as caring for one self,performing manual tasks,walking,seeing,hearing,speaking,breathing,learning and working.laws ch.here,appellees include in the record affidavits from sensing coworkers,who express concern about sensing ability to perform her job quickly and safely,concerns which they allegedly brought to kozmits attention.the record also contains evidence that kozmits was concerned about sensing falling on the job as a result of her ms condition,a concern that he expressly articulated to sensing as his reason for not allowing sensing to return to work in the takeaway position.from the fact that kozmits questioned sensing ability to perform her job without falling,it is reasonable to infer that kozmits doubted not only sensing ability to work in her particular job,but also her ability to work in a broad class of jobs that would have required her to be on her feet.see american airlines,cir describing requirement that a plaintiff must show significant restriction as to either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes,and not impairment as to a single,specific job to establish impairment in major life activity of working.moreover,these concerns suggest that kozmits doubted sensing ability to carry out other major life activities,besides working,such as walking and performing manual tasks.see.laws ch.on these facts,there is sufficient evidence that kozmits regarded sensing as suffering from an impairment that substantially limited major life activities.thus,a jury could reasonably conclude that sensing satisfied the first element of her prima facie discrimination claim.
otherwise qualified 
although not conceding the issue,appellees do not contend that sensing failed to make out a triable issue of material fact as to the second prong of the prima facie case of disability discrimination.we agree that sensing has raised a genuine issue as to whether she was able to perform the essential functions of her job,either with or without reasonable accommodation.carroll,at.an essential function is a fundamental job dut y of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires.ward,at alteration in original quoting laurin providence,cir.
sensing has proffered sufficient evidence to permit a jury to find that despite her handicap,she was nevertheless able to perform the essential functions of the takeaway job,at least with reasonable accommodation.such evidence includes three doctor notes from sensing physicians stating that she could return to the takeaway position,the latter two indicating that she could do so without restriction.also,sensing deposition testimony indicates that she adequately performed the essential functions of the takeaway position for a year following her ms diagnosis and for the ten weeks following her first major with only minor,accommodations.appellees have certainly put forth conflicting evidence,including affidavits from sensing outback,that call into question sensing ability to perform the essential functions of the takeaway job adequately and safely,particularly in the months following her major.nevertheless,crediting sensing account,as we must on summary judgment,we hold that sensing evidence is sufficiently strong to support a verdict in her favor,precluding the entry of summary judgment against her.
adverse employment action 
in order to establish the final prong of her prima facie case,sensing must show that she suffered an adverse employment action as a result of her handicap.tobin,at.it was on the basis of this element that the district court granted summary judgment,concluding that sensing had not produced evidence sufficient to make triable an essential element of her claim of handicap discrimination,namely,that she was constructively discharged.sensing,d at.discharge,however,constructive or otherwise,is not the only adverse employment action that can satisfy this element,nor the only one alleged by sensing.rather,an adverse employment action,for purposes of chapter has been broadly defined to include any material disadvantage in respect to salary,grade,or other objective terms and conditions of employment.maccormack boston edison,with respect to a reasonable accommodation claim,the third prong of the prima facie case can be satisfied by a showing that the employer despite knowing of the employee alleged disability,did not reasonably accommodate it.carroll,at.
sensing has put forth three alternative claims that could,if substantiated,support a finding of an adverse employment action.first,she argues that appellees actually or constructively discharged her because of her status as a person with ms by removing her from their work schedule and making it impossible for her to comply with the condition it imposed for restoration to work.second,she argues that even absent a finding of discharge,appellees actions nevertheless amounted to discriminatory adverse employment actions within the meaning of the statute.third,sensing argues that the appellees failure to accommodate her disability constituted an adverse employment action.
only the first of these theories was directly addressed in the district court opinion.however,appellees are not entitled to summary judgment on this issue if a reasonable jury could conclude,based on the facts in the record construed in the light most favorable to sensing,that sensing could satisfy the third prong under any one of these theories.we hold that a jury could so find under either of the first two theories,and thus,the district court erred in holding that sensing failed to make out a prima facie case.
sensing contends that the evidence on the summary judgment record is sufficient to establish that she was actually discharged from her takeaway position at outback.although she does not allege that she was formally terminated from her position,she claims that outback effectively ended her employment when it removed her from the work schedule and rejected her multiple requests to return to work.sensing made clear that she was willing to comply with outback condition that she undergo an ime,and it was outback actions in failing to contact her with the information she needed to undergo that exam that ensured that sensing could never satisfy the condition and thus,would never return to her job.it is therefore a reasonable inference,sufficient to sustain a jury finding,sensing argues,that these actions amounted to a dismiss al from employment because of her handicap.laws ch.outback,in turn,argues that the undisputed evidence shows that it was sensing who chose to abandon her job in favor of collecting unemployment and pursuing a lawsuit when it reasonably requested that she submit to an ime and offered her interim light duty work.
although the issue of whether an employee has suffered an adverse employment action such as a termination is usually straightforward,sometimes the evidence is unclear and the question must be submitted to the jury.for example,in macgregor mallinckrodt,the plaintiff,macgregor,was passed over for promotion and rejected her employer offer of an alternate position,which macgregor concluded was not suitable.see,cir title vii gender discrimination case.after macgregor communicated her rejection of the alternative position,her supervisor distributed a memo to company employees stating that macgregor was leaving the company.id.the court noted that the employee rejection of the new job does not necessarily indicate that the employee has resigned.id.at.the court concluded that there was conflict over whether the employee quit or was fired after having received an alternative offer of employment.id.accordingly,the court held that a jury could have reasonably found that macgregor suffered an adverse action.id.at.
we find this to be a similar case where the circumstances resulting in sensing no longer being employed by appellees are far from clear.appellees rely on sensing statements,in her deposition,that it made more sense for her to apply for unemployment than to take the offer of light duty work and that she did not call kozmits back after may,but instead,contacted a lawyer,as constituting undisputable evidence of job abandonment.we disagree that this conclusion is compelled by these facts.
at summary judgment,sensing sworn statement at deposition establishes that during her may conversation with kozmits,sensing indicated that she was willing to undergo the requested ime,that kozmits told sensing that he would locate an approved physician and contact her with the information once he obtained it,and that sensing replied that she would wait to hear from him.although sensing did not follow up with kozmits directly regarding the exam,we can not conclude that her failure to do so constitutes abandonment where sensing was expressly instructed to await contact from kozmits.moreover,although sensing did not personally contact outback after may,the fact of sensing numerous contacts with kozmits between april and may,in which she made clear that she wanted to retain her takeaway position,weaken any conclusion that sensing abandoned her job.
nor does the fact that sensing applied for unemployment conclusively indicate job abandonment.to qualify for unemployment benefits under massachusetts law an individual need only show that despite being capable of and available for work,she is not performing any services during the particular weeks for which she seeks compensation.see lebeau comm r of of employment and training,citing.laws ch,a,r.thus,the fact that sensing applied for unemployment benefits is consistent with sensing version of the having been entirely cut from the work schedule against her will and being unable to afford the much lower paying alternative of light duty work,sensing sought unemployment benefits to support herself during the intervening period,while she waited to hear from kozmits regarding the information she needed to undergo the ime.relevant to the plausibility of sensing version is the fact that unemployment benefits are generally unavailable in massachusetts to one who voluntarily abandons her employment nor does the fact that sensing contacted a lawyer undisputedly indicate job abandonment.suspecting,as sensing testifies in her deposition,that outback was trying to push her out,a jury could reasonably conclude that sensing sought legal consultation about her rights,while at the same time hoping to retain her position,should outback allow her to do so.this possibility is underscored by the letter to this effect sent by sensing attorney to outback on may indicating sensing continued desire to be restored to the takeaway position.yet even after receiving this letter,neither kozmits nor anyone at outback contacted sensing with the information she needed to actually undergo the requested ime.
a jury may ultimately conclude that sensing was not terminated by appellees but rather,that she abandoned her position.but we find sensing evidence to be sufficiently strong and cognizable for a jury to find that appellees effectively terminated sensing by denying her the possibility of returning to work.see,at.in light of these disputed facts,it remains for a jury to determine which version of the facts is most compelling.id 
b.other adverse employment action 
sensing alternatively argues that even if outback actions in,inter alia,denying her requests to be restored to the work schedule are not found to amount to a termination,a question as to which we conclude there exists a material factual dispute,outback conduct nevertheless amounts to other adverse employment action,that satisfies the third prong of carroll.we agree.
under,adverse actions consist of a defendant action to discharge or expel but also,to otherwise discriminate against the plaintiff.mole of.thus,sensing can satisfy the third element of her prima facie case by raising a genuine issue as to whether appellees took adverse employment action against her,other than termination.carroll,at.such other adverse employment actions may include disadvantag ing her in respect to salary,grade,or other objective terms and conditions of employment.maccormack,at see also blackie,at including demotion,reduction in salary and divestment of significant responsibilities as examples of adverse employment actions.massachusetts c ases have employed the phrase adverse employment action to refer to the effects on working terms,conditions,or privileges that are material,and thus governed by the statute,as opposed to those effects that are trivial and so not properly the subject of a discrimination action.king city of boston.determining whether an action is materially adverse necessarily requires a inquiry.blackie,at.
the record establishes that appellees removed sensing from the work schedule after she missed only one and a half covered shifts,offering her in the alternative a light duty position with substantially reduced salary,hours and responsibilities.these actions disadvantaged sensing with respect to the terms and conditions of her employment,see maccormack,at,and amounted to far more than mere trivial inconveniences.see king,at noting that materially adverse employment action requires more than trivial,subjectively perceived inconveniences.citations omitted.rather,although the demotion was intended to be temporary,in light of the fact that months went by without sensing being scheduled for work or contacted regarding the ime that could allow her to return to work,we hold that sensing has adduced sufficient facts to establish that outback actions were nevertheless materially adverse.gu boston police,cir listing demotions and disadvantageous transfers or assignments as examples of material changes in working conditions see also burlington northern santa fe ry.white,d holding that potentially indefinite suspension of employee from work without pay could constitute materially adverse employment action,even where employer awards full backpay for the entire period,and that reassignment of responsibilities could constitute materially adverse employment action,even absent demotion.
finally,having concluded that a reasonable jury could find that appellees terminated sensing or otherwise committed adverse employment actions against her,we also hold that sensing has put forth substantial evidence that these adverse actions were taken,at least in part,because of her actual or perceived handicap.see dartt.such evidence includes kozmits explicitly citing his fear of liability for outback as a result of sensing falling at work,his statement that he was not comfortable with sensing working and his instruction that sensing tend to her medication before returning to statements leading up to kozmits decision to indefinitely remove sensing from the work schedule 
having made out sufficient evidence as to each element,we hold that sensing has stated a prima facie claim of handicap discrimination under chapter.
reason and pretext 
because we hold that sensing has put forth sufficient evidence to establish her prima facie case,we move to the second and third steps of the framework.under the second prong,appellees must offer a reason for the employment action in question.che.bay transp.authority,cir.they have.appellees assert a legitimate interest in safety that was furthered by removing sensing from the work calendar and requesting that she submit to an ime.chapter itself refers to the permissibility of job qualifications consistent with the safe performance of the particular job and here,the affidavits from sensing coworkers,questioning sensing ability to perform her job safely,provide evidence supporting appellee purported legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason.moreover,the mcad guidelines contemplate the permissibility of medical examinations,at least in some circumstances,such as,where there is evidence of a job performance or safety problem 
in order to comply with federal law,medical examinations inquiries must be job related and consistent with business necessity.for example,employers may conduct medical examinations make inquiries concerning the ability of the employee to perform functions,or where there is evidence of a job performance or safety problem.
mcad guidelines v f citing c and eeoc,technical assistance manual on the employment provisions i of the ada at hereinafter eeoc manual.at least one court has held that employers may,consistent with chapter,require an employee returning from medical leave to submit to an examination to determine competency for work.see white city of boston,no.civ,wl,aff by white city of boston,issue not raised on appeal.thus,outback requiring sensing to submit to an ime and the accompanying temporary demotion,if in fact motivated exclusively by legitimate and immediate concern about sensing ability to perform the takeaway job safely,would constitute a permissible justification under chapter.tobin,at.
this brings us to the third and final prong under which sensing must present evidence to rebut defendant explanation and show that the adverse employment action was actually the result of discriminatory animus.che,at.evidence that the employer stated reasons are pretextual can be sufficient for a jury to infer discriminatory animus.id.to pass summary judgment,sensing must present evidence to at least create a genuine issue about this material fact.she has done so here.
a reasonable jury could find that kozmits removal of sensing from the work schedule was predicated,at least in part,on impermissible discrimination,as sensing alleges,rather than a permissible legitimate concern about her ability to perform the job safely a jury might reach this conclusion by finding,for example,that appellees had insufficient justification for removing sensing from the work schedule for reasons of safety alone.while it is true that appellees have provided affidavits from sensing coworkers that call into question sensing ability to perform her takeaway job safely,sensing had also been evaluated at least three times by her own physicians and provided outback with three notes confirming their expert medical opinions that she could,in fact,perform the takeaway job.had appellees questioned whether these physicians had an adequate basis for their opinions,they could have contacted the physicians directly,but chose not to do so.appellees also did not require sensing to undergo an ime after her return from a month long medical leave in november,but did so on this occasion after sensing missed only one and a half shifts.moreover,kozmits stated concern that sensing could cost the restaurant thousands of dollars of liability if she were to fall may be interpreted as speculation as to risk of future injury,a prohibited form of discrimination under the mcad guidelines,rather than legitimate concern about sensing present ability to safely perform the essential functions of her job finally,the fact that outback never contacted sensing to provide her with the information necessary to actually undergo the ime,as kozmits promised to do,coupled with kozmits arguably unreasonable,unverified assumption,within days of his conversation with sensing,that sensing was abandoning her job,raises a question as to whether appellees actually sought to allow sensing to return to work,provided she could do so safely,or whether the articulated concerns about safety were actually,the real reasons for her removal being discriminatory animus.
ultimately,c redibility determinations,the weighing of the evidence,and
