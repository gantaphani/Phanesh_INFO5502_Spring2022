plaintiff lance jett,who fractured his right thumb while housed in california state,brought this action against prison doctors,penner and douglas peterson,and warden cheryl pliler,alleging defendants violated his constitutional rights by being deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs in violation of the eighth amendment and violated california government code by failing to ensure he timely saw an orthopedist to set and cast his fracture as directed by the initial physician aftercare instructions.jett appeals the district court order adopting the magistrate judge findings and recommendation to grant defendants summary judgment motion.
we have jurisdiction over this timely appeal and hold the district court erred in adopting the magistrate findings and recommendations because jett provided sufficient evidence,including medical slips,a letter,and a grievance,to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether penner failure to see jett prior to december,was deliberate indifference jett provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate the existence of a triable issue of fact as to whether penner,conduct was deliberately indifferent to jett need to have his fractured thumb set and placed in a permanent cast jett presented sufficient evidence to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether peterson and warden pliler were deliberately indifferent to jett condition because jett is entitled to an inference that these individuals received the letters jett wrote and sent via institutional mail advising of his fractured thumb and need to see an orthopedist and jett stated a cause of action under california government code because this statute requires medical care to be summoned for an inmate who needs immediate medical care to have a fractured bone set and cast.because we reverse the district court summary judgment ruling and conclude jett presented sufficient evidence to go to trial on these causes of action,we need not address jett contention the magistrate discovery and scheduling orders effectively denied him the opportunity to take depositions.
