stella was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of months,to three years of supervised release,and to pay a special assessment and restitution.she appeals,arguing that the district court committed error in enhancing her sentence under for abuse of a position of trust,in enhancing the sentence because there were vulnerable victims under b,and in its choice as to how to group the offenses,which also resulted in an enhancement.there was no error and we affirm the sentence.
the undisputed facts before the district court at sentencing are drawn from the report psr and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.see,united states arbour,cir.
stella obtained her nursing license from the massachusetts board of licensing in nursing in and went to work for lgh.stella worked on,a nursing floor primarily occupied by patients recovering from surgery.as an rn at lgh,stella had some independent responsibilities for caring for her patients,which included ensuring they received proper treatment,recording her own assessments of patients condition on their charts,and keeping doctors informed of patients progress.she also had unsupervised authority to provide her patients with prescribed medication as needed and was expected to challenge doctors chosen prescriptions when she considered them inappropriate.
stella was also entrusted with access to the floor locked meds room,which contained prescription drugs and other controlled substances,by being given an electronic badge required to open the room door and keys to the cabinet in which controlled substances were kept.
between september and december,stella stole controlled substances from lgh for her own use.she took drugs from the locked cabinet.she also took vials of the pain medications meperidine hydrochloride demerol and morphine sulfate in patients analgesia pca pumps replacing saline solution in the vials to conceal her theft.she also tampered with controlled substances in the meds room locked cabinet,emptying vials of morphine sulfate with a hypodermic needle,injecting herself with the contents,refilling the empty vial with saline,and restoring the vial to its original packaging.
in one instance,stella removed a fentanyl patch from a patient,cut off part of the patch,and the altered patch to the patient chest in another,she administered a used patch to a patient while keeping the new patch for herself.
as a result of stella tampering,affected drugs were often left with less than percent of their active,ingredients.a ny patient who might have received one of the vials would not have received adequate pain medication and would therefore have continued to suffer pain.psr.
in september,lgh began to investigate suspected tampering with controlled substances on.the hospital implemented various security procedures to prevent further tampering and met individually with each nurse on the floor.nurses were informed of substance abuse programs provided by the hospital and warned that lgh willingness to support whoever was responsible for the incidents would expire on october.stella did not,at that point,come forward,and the tampering continued.
by december,suspicion had focused on stella.in two separate interviews with federal agents from the food and drug administration on december and of that year,stella denied taking any drugs from the hospital.on the afternoon of december,she contacted the agents and scheduled a meeting for the following day.at that meeting,stella admitted responsibility for the drug tampering and executed a written confession.
on august,a grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging stella with four counts of tampering with a consumer product,a counts one,three,five,and seven,four counts of obtaining controlled substances by deception and subterfuge,a counts two,four,six,and eight,and two counts of making false statements,a counts nine and ten.on january,stella pled guilty to counts one through four and seven through ten.the district court granted the government motion to dismiss the remaining two counts on january.
at the sentencing hearing on november,both sides submitted sentencing memoranda challenging aspects of the psr recommended guideline calculations.the district court used the version of the sentencing guidelines and applied,which governs tampering with consumer products involving a risk of death or bodily injury and has a base offense level of.the court then heard arguments on four disputed calculations grouping of offenses and enhancements for a victim serious bodily injury for vulnerable victims,and for abuse of a position of trust.
the district court agreed with the psr recommended separate grouping of counts one through four,which involved stella tampering with vials in the locked meds room,and counts seven and eight,which involved the incident in which stella cut off part of a patient fentanyl patch.the district court considered the purpose of,reasoning that if there are harms directed at different recipients of harm,the normal rule would not be to group those counts together.because the victims of counts one through and the individual patients who might have received diluted different than the identified victim of counts seven and eight,the court determined that those counts should be grouped separately.the court further held that the obstruction of justice counts should not be grouped separately but instead should be included as a enhancement to each of the two groups.
the district court also applied the vulnerable victim enhancement under b to both groups of counts.the court explained that both the identified victim of the incident and the patients put at risk by stella dilution of medication were people who were vulnerable by reason of their illnesses and the need for medication to the harm that would be done by being given adulterated pain medication.
finally,the district court found that stella offenses merited a further enhancement under for abuse of a position of public trust,noting that it was unnecessary to address whether there was an abuse of private trust 
after a reduction for stella acceptance of responsibility,stella final adjusted guideline level was thirty,which corresponded to a suggested sentencing range of to one hundred months imprisonment.the district court ultimately sentenced her to a sentence of two concurrent month terms of imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release and required her to pay a special assessment and restitution.
we review claims of sentencing error in the application of the guidelines on a sliding scale.pure issues of law,such as interpretations of the guidelines,are reviewed de novo findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and there is a continuum between those two poles.united states sicher,cir see also united states mcelroy,cir.
enhancement for abuse of a position of trust 
the district court found that stella had abused a position of public trust because stella had received the special license for medical personnel to handle highly controlled medications and then in fact had abused that license 
t he seriousness of the offense is not to be minimized.not only did it have real effects on real people,and in some cases very substantial and serious effects,it also was an abuse of the position that is entrusted by the community in people who are licensed to deal in controlled substances.
it involved a course of conduct over a period of time,which meant it was not isolated impulsive choices,but reflects deliberation and conscious choice.
we evaluate the conclusion against the text of the relevant guideline,which provides i f the defendant abused a position of public or private trust in a manner that significantly fac
