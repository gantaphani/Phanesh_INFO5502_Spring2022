background 
prudential discontinues brown ltd benefits 
brown worked for hunt as a truck driver and enrolled in the plan.hunt sponsored the plan and served as plan administrator.pursuant to a group insurance contract with hunt,prudential insured the plan and served as claims administrator.prudential,not hunt,was responsible for processing claims,determining eligibility,and paying benefits under the plan.
in august,brown stopped working for hunt due to neck,back,and left knee pain.she made a claim for ltd benefits under the plan.in september,prudential awarded brown ltd benefits based upon her left knee condition.prudential found brown met the plan definition of disabled,unable to perform the material and substantial duties of one regular occupation due to injury.brown was a lifelong trucker,and her knee pain made it impossible for her to continue driving a truck.
in june,prudential discontinued brown ltd benefits.the plan definition of disabled changes after the first year of payments.the plan states after months of payments,you are disabled when prudential determines that due to the same injury,you are unable to perform the duties of any gainful occupation for which you are reasonably fitted by education,training or experience.prudential determined that,even though brown knee pain prevented her from returning to work as a truck driver,there were other jobs she could perform.
prudential informed brown it had obtain ed and review ed information about her medical condition,daily activities,and education,experience,and other occupations she would be qualified to perform.prudential explained that,b ased on its clinical reviews,the medical documentation supports that brown had sedentary work capacity and was limited to lifting up to ten pounds,stooping and bending was generally to be avoided,and sitting and standing could be alternated as needed.prudential indicated one of its vocational rehabilitation specialists had determined brown was employable as a semiconductor bonder,a surveillance system monitor,a food checker,or an assembler.
prudential notified brown of her right to an internal administrative appeal of its decision in writing within days.prudential required any appeal to state the reasons for disagreeing with its decision and to contain supporting evidence,including c opies of therapy treatment notes,a ny additional treatment records from physicians,a ctual test results,and any other written comments,documents,records,or information related to her claim.prudential informed brown of her concomitant right to receive,upon request and free of charge,reasonable access to,and copies of,all documents,records and other information relevant to her claim.
brown requests information from prudential and hunt 
in june,brown called prudential and indicated she wanted to appeal.one of prudential representatives told brown she needed to explain in writing why she disagreed with prudential decision,but brown never did so.instead,brown requested a copy of the plan from prudential and,through her attorney,sent hunt and prudential a series of letters requesting a wide variety of information.brown asked hunt for copies of all employee welfare or pension plans in which she had enrolled and copies of all summary plan descriptions,annual reports,and amendments thereto.brown asked prudential for a copy of the plan and a complete copy of the administrative record.brown also requested prudential provide her all plan documents,internal guidelines,and administrative precedents upon which prudential had relied when deciding to discontinue her ltd benefits,as well as the names and addresses of all individuals who reviewed her personal health information.
at prudential request,hunt sent brown a copy of the plan summary plan description and wrap document,a description of the various benefits available to hunt employees.hunt sent brown copies of summary plan descriptions and benefit booklets for every plan in which she had enrolled while working for hunt.prudential otherwise ignored brown requests.thereafter,brown sent prudential another letter through her attorney,in which she demanded a response within ten days.absent a response,brown stated she would assume prudential had no intention of responding to her letter,and would take appropriate action.prudential again failed to respond to brown request for information.
in january,brown attorney called prudential and asked whether brown had filed an administrative appeal.prudential informed brown attorney that brown had not filed a written appeal.prudential contends brown deadline for filing such an appeal expired in late november.
in february,brown attorney reminded hunt he had previously requested certain documents from hunt,but did not receive certain information.brown attorney requested all relevant documents under the pertinent regulations,including but not limited to claims manuals.on march,hunt mailed the administrative record to brown hunt did not send any claims manuals.

count for benefits 
brown contends the district court erred in dismissing count i,her claim for ltd benefits under a.brown maintains she was not required to exhaust her administrative remedies because it was futile to do so brown stresses prudential repeated failures to provide her with the administrative record and the other documents she requested would have forced an appeal in the blind.prudential and hunt maintain brown failure to file a written appeal is fatal to count hunt argues it can not be held liable on count i in any event,because it is the plan administrator and not the claims administrator.
exhaustion of administrative remedies 
erisa exhaustion requirement finds its genesis in,which provides 
in accordance with regulations of the secretary of labor,every employee benefit plan shall 
provide adequate notice in writing to any participant whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied,and 
afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.
on its face,only imposes an affirmative duty upon plans to provide plan participants with appropriate notice and does not contain an express requirement that employees exhaust contractual remedies prior to bringing suit.wert liberty life assurance of boston,cir citing conley pitney bowes,cir.nonetheless federal courts have universally construed to require exhaustion.see id.at kinkead sw.bell.sickness accident disability benefit plan,cir stating federal courts have uniformly concluded exhaustion is required under erisa see,midgett.group int l long term disability plan,cir recognizing,i n this circuit,benefit claimants must exhaust before bringing claims for wrongful denial to court quoting galman prudential ins.of,cir.where a claimant fails to pursue and exhaust administrative remedies that are clearly required under a particular erisa plan,her claim for relief is barred.id.quoting layes mead,cir.
this judicially created exhaustion requirement serves important purposes.back danka,cir.it enables an employer,or its plan,to obtain full information about a claim for benefits,to compile an adequate record,and to make a reasoned decision.id.the process is of substantial benefit to reviewing courts,because it gives them a factual predicate upon which to proceed.id.
the exhaustion requirement is not absolute.when an plan fails to comply with its antecedent duty under to provide participants with notice and review,aggrieved participants are not required to exhaust their administrative remedies before filing a lawsuit for benefits under a.see wert,at concluding prior cases recognized exhaustion was not required when notice in compliance with a plan was not provided to a claimant or when the available review procedures neither complied with erisa fiduciary review requirements nor applied to the specific claimants see,back,at holding claimant was not required to exhaust when the plan failed to provide notice.nor are plan participants required to exhaust if doing so would prove futile.see union pac.beckham,cir recognizing the futility exception in the context of the accrual of an erisa action wilczynski lumbermens mut.cas,cir declaring a plaintiff failure to exhaust administrative remedies is excused where exhaustion of internal remedies would be futile.
at first glance,brown attempt to except her case from erisa exhaustion requirement would appear to fail.brown mistakenly labels her argument as a futility argument.the futility exception is plan participant must show that it is certain that her claim will be denied on appeal,not merely that she doubts that an appeal will result in a different decision.zhou guardian life ins.of,cir quoting lindemann mobil oil,cir.because brown has not proffered any facts to show prudential certainly would have denied her claim had she given prudential written notice of her intention to appeal,the futility exception is inapplicable here.
we must take care,however,to refrain from focusing on the facial label brown places upon her argument while ignoring its substance.see,wardair.dep t of revenue,d considering the substance of preemption argument despite the parties failure to label it properly liquidation comm of banco intercontinental,renta,cir similar united states wheeler,cir similar.although couched in terms of futility,the gravamen of brown argument in the district court and this court is simply this prudential failure to comply with its duty under to afford brown a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review excuses her failure to exhaust.more specifically,brown argues prudential failure to respond to her requests for the administrative record and other documents absolves brown failure to file a timely written appeal of prudential decision to discontinue her ltd benefits.we choose to analyze the substance,and not the label,of brown debate.
when stripped of its futility label,brown argument is a winner.prudential failure to comply with its duty under to provide brown with a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of prudential decision to discontinue her ltd benefits excuses brown failure to exhaust before bringing suit under a.without the administrative record and other requested documents in hand,brown was unable fully and fairly to prepare her appeal.
one of the purposes of is to provide claimants with sufficient information to prepare adequately for any further administrative review or for an appeal to the federal courts.see dumond centex,cir richardson cent.states,se.sw.areas pension fund,cir stating and its regulations were intended to help claimants process their claims efficiently and fairly.to the extent the statute is ambiguous,disclosure requirements should be construed broadly,because erisa is remedial legislation and should be liberally construed to effectuate congress intent to protect plan participants.see starr metro,cir.
prudential failures to respond deprived brown of sufficient information to prepare adequately for further administrative review or an appeal to the federal courts.brown did not know the identity of critical persons,including the medical and vocational experts who determined she was not disabled and who calculated her residual functional capacity.see,lafleur.health serv.and indem,cir holding an insurance company denied a claimant full and fair review in part because it did not identify the board certified urologist whose advice was obtained on behalf of the plan in connection with claimant adverse benefit determination.brown did not have access to prudential methodologies or reports.she had no opportunity to challenge prudential bald assertion she had the residual functional capacity to work as a semiconductor bonder,a surveillance system monitor,a food checker,or an assembler.grossmuller int l union,united,aero.agric.implement workers of,uaw,local,cir identifying the persistent core requirements of full and fair review as including knowing what evidence the relied upon and having an opportunity to address the accuracy and reliability of that evidence.
it must be emphasized the plan required brown to do much more than simply file a written notice of appeal to exhaust her administrative remedies.brown was required to state the reasons why she disagreed with prudential decision provide medical evidence or other information to support her position,such as copies of her treatment notes and medical test results submit other written comments,documents,records,or information related to her claim.in other words,unlike a court of law,brown was required to mount a detailed challenge to prudential decision at the moment she appealed.yet prudential deprived brown of meaningful information necessary to do so.
