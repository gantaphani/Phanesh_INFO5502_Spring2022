kimberley white sought disability insurance benefits under title ii of the social security act ssa,claiming that her bipolar disorder and severe depression have rendered her unable to work.an administrative law judge alj determined that white was entitled to disability benefits for only a limited period of time between and.the district court affirmed the alj determination on appeal.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
white claim for social security disability benefits originally alleged that white was unable to work due to both physical and mental disabilities.her appeal,however,pertains exclusively to the alj finding that she was not disabled due to mental impairments either before november,or after july.white alleged physical impairments are thus omitted from the discussion that follows.
history before november,
the first medical documents in the record reflecting white mental impairments come from edward merkel,an obstetrician and gynecologist who examined white after she had a child in october.shortly after giving birth,white reported problems with her sleep,mood,and appetite.in december,white reported that she had good days and bad days,and that she believed she had postpartum depression.but merkel thought that her symptoms did not support white.instead,merkel opined that white had the blues.many months later,in october,white reported that she had lost her job and that her boyfriend had both physically and verbally abused her.the doctor notes from february indicate that counseling appointments were arranged to help white deal with her psychosocial family problems.
in march,white reported to merkel that she had trouble sleeping,was always tired,found no joy in anything,and was agitated.white said that her boyfriend continued to be verbally abusive and that she was unable to leave her noxious home environment because she could not support herself or obtain adequate housing.merkel notes reflect that white had family problems,and that he prescribed her a sleep aid as well as zoloft an antidepressant.white declined the sleep aid,however,because she did not want to be sleepy around her abusive boyfriend.she subsequently reported that her mood improved on zoloft,but that the drug wore off by dinner time.
in may,white reported that she was living with her parents and that there was significant tension in her home life,but that her boyfriend was improving his ability to control his temper and substance abuse.she was diagnosed with psychosocial family problems as well as depression.her zoloft prescription was renewed.
white told merkel in july that she had stopped taking zoloft after her mood and social situation had improved.an august progress report,however,noted that her zoloft prescription had been refilled.her dosage was later increased in september.white continued to complain about stress in january and told merkel that she was engaged in a custody battle over her daughter.
in addition to the preceding treatment records from merkel,the record contains documents from white family physician,david margolis.one such report shows that margolis prescribed paxil an antidepressant for white in february and noted that white showed signs of anxiety.margolis notes from march,april,and may all reflect that white complained of depression.in august,white told margolis that she was concerned that she was unable to control her anxiety disorder with the medications that had been prescribed for her.margolis advised her to pursue psychiatric evaluation and counseling.none of the documents from this time period indicate that white was unable to function due to her depression.
despite being advised to undergo a psychiatric examination several times up to and including august,the record indicates that white did not actually obtain such an evaluation until november of that year.in that month,white began to attend psychiatric treatment sessions at a behavioral healthcare center called hegira programs.white was recommended for admission to traditional outpatient services and was diagnosed as having major depressive disorder.one of her treating physicians considered bipolar disorder as another possible diagnosis.the attending hegira programs physician noted during white initial visit that she was tearful during the session,had poor sleep,had gained approximately pounds in the last year,admitted to mood swings,had poor anger management,and had poor.white was evaluated using the global assessment of functioning gaf test,receiving a score of between and.
gaf examinations measure psychological,social,and occupational functioning on a continuum of status from to,with lower scores indicating more severe mental limitations.the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan has usefully described a gaf score as 
a subjective determination that represents the clinician judgment of the individual overall level of functioning.it ranges from superior functioning to persistent danger of severely hurting self or others,persistent inability to maintain minimal personal hygiene,or serious suicidal act with clear expectation of death.a gaf score of indicates some impairment in reality testing or communication,speech is at times illogical,obscure,or irrelevant or major impairment in several areas such as work or school,family relations,judgment,thinking or mood.a gaf of to means that the patient has serious symptoms or any serious impairment in social,occupational,or school functioning,no friends,unable to keep a job.a gaf rating of to signals the existence of moderate difficulty in social or occupational functioning.
edwards barnhart,d,citations,brackets,and quotation marks omitted.
white underwent five further sessions at hegira programs in which physicians noted depression,sleep disturbance,a flat affect,and tearfulness.therapist notes from november,also state that white had shown some improvement,had a brighter affect,and expressed a willingness to let go of her using boyfriend.but the notes continued to reflect ongoing depression and sleep disturbance.
white sought further psychiatric help and underwent an evaluation at hegira programs in december.a worksheet from that month shows that white was anxious and depressed and that she had problems sleeping.the same form states that she had a moderate limitation on functioning.but the report also says that her memory was good,her psychomotor ability was only minimally limited,and that her mood only minimally limited her overall functioning.white was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and once again received a gaf score of between and.
during her next therapy session later that month,white was tearful,depressed,and had not refilled her prescription the record does not identify the prescription that she failed to refill at the time.the therapist concluded that white was making little progress because she did not want to end her codependent relationship presumably with her boyfriend.
in january,a psychiatrist at hegira programs noted that white was not experiencing any adverse side effects from certain medications that she had been prescribed,but that she was not feeling any better either.white was prescribed another antidepressant to improve her sleep.in february,white was discharged from hegira programs with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder and was assigned a gaf score of.the discharge report states that white had made little progress and had not complied with instructions regarding her medications.a document from the cherry hill internal medical associates indicates that,as of may,her medications generally were not working well,but that paxil worked better than the others.her depression was,however,under moderate control.
history between november,and july,
white began treatment at john health system eastwood clinic beginning on november.she reported having symptoms of depression since she was a teenager,including feelings of helplessness,hopelessness,guilt,disturbed sleep,fatigue,and exhaustion.white reported that her symptoms were exacerbated when she moved back in with her boyfriend and that she returned to reside with her mother after living with him for only a month.the record does not state when white returned to live with her boyfriend.white reported episodes of anxiety,irritability,insomnia,and good days of normal functioning,but also bad days with extreme difficulty getting out of bed and problems motivating herself to care for her daughter.
a november,report reflects that white was feeling better even though she had not been sleeping well.another report from december states that white has applied to a couple places for jobs.making good progress.that same month,however,white was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.by,white said that she had enrolled in a school to complete her general equivalency diploma ged and had applied for a job.she nevertheless still had bouts of depression as well as vomiting and diarrhea from her medication.
notes from her eastwood clinic therapist from late january show that white was once again very upset and tearful throughout the session.in february,white reported trouble sleeping.but white had improved mood stability later that february.she also agreed with the bipolar disorder diagnosis,stating that she has had lifelong problems with mood instability,insomnia,and impulsiveness.even though her mood had stabilized on a new medication,white still had sleep difficulties and admitted to suicidal ideation on her bad days.in april,white appeared cheerful and more energetic,explaining that she had been going to school to complete her ged and that she had gone on a first date.
by may,however,notes from an eastwood clinic therapist reported that white was feeling down,tired,and sad,and that she was having crying spells.the treating therapist opined that white might be going through another depressive episode.white was very depressed,extremely emotional,and tearful during the may therapy session.her therapist opined that white appeared very tired,had a significant disturbance in her activities of daily living,and had another depressive episode.a later may therapy session report shows that white was feeling depressed,was tearful,felt very empty,and that her life was very stressful.
white visited preeti venkataraman,a psychiatrist who was not a staff member at the eastwood clinic,near the end of may.venkataraman concurred with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder and depression and assigned white a gaf score of between and.in july,venkataraman restated these conclusions.white gaf score was in august.in september,white had high anxiety,rigid thinking,and her treating therapist recognized her behavior and belief system as problematic.white also reported anxiety in october and was assigned a gaf score of,but said that she was having up to three good days a week.
basivi baddigam,also a psychiatrist,examined white in october on behalf of the michigan state agency charged with evaluating white claim for social security benefits.baddigam noted that white described having episodes of mania and depression and mood swings for years.white reported that her manic episodes typically lasted for one to two days,and her depressive episodes lasted from a few days to a month.she also recounted that,during her depressive episodes,she was not able to get out of bed,take care of her basic needs,or socialize,and that she felt exhausted and cried a lot.white was again diagnosed with bipolar disorder and assigned a gaf score of.later that october,white status was reported as stable and her gaf was evaluated at.
a psychiatrist who worked for the social security administration state agency,tien,reviewed white claim file in november.tien completed a psychiatric review technique form reflecting that white was mildly limited with regard to activities of daily living,that she had mild difficulties in maintaining social functioning,and that she had moderate difficulties in maintaining concentration,persistence,or pace.white file also showed,according to tien,that she was moderately limited in her ability to carry out detailed instructions,maintain attention and concentration for extended periods,set realistic goals,or make plans independently of others.tien concluded that white was capable of performing a wide range of simple,unskilled tasks in a regular work environment.
a form from january notes that white status was stable,her gaf was assessed between and,and that sleep was still a problem.an eastwood clinic progress report from later that month shows that white reported poor sleep and that she was afraid of her.in february,white status was improving and her mood was better,but her gaf was still set between and,she still had sleep problems,and she reported problems coping.
in march,white symptoms included psychomotor retardation.she said that she was not doing well,and her counselor encouraged her to write when she felt paralyzed.her mood was stable and her gaf was rated by venkataraman as between and.in april,white reported feeling overwhelmed.
treatment notes from may indicate that white status was improving.they also show,however,that white reported struggles with functioning.another set of may treatment notes state that white had increased motivation for intimacy and felt ready to date.but later that may white reported again feeling overwhelmed.
on july,venkataraman filled out a worksheet for white,which purportedly described white ability or inability to work.venkataraman opined that white had poor to no ability to deal with the public,deal with work stresses,function independently,maintain attention and concentration,deal with changes in a routine work setting,or understand,remember,and carry out complex and detailed job instructions.the same document defines poor as n o useful ability to function in this area.but venkataraman also concluded that white had a fair ability to follow work rules,relate to coworkers,use judgment,interact with supervisors,understand,remember,and carry out simple job instructions,maintain personal appearance,behave in an emotionally stable manner,relate predictably in social situations,and demonstrate reliability.a fair ability is defined in the form as the ability to function that is seriously limited,but not precluded.
venkataraman filled out an affective disorders assessment form on the same date,which concluded that white suffered from sleep disturbance,decreased energy,difficulty concentrating or thinking,easy distractibility,and paranoid thinking.the form further opined that white had marked restrictions on activities of daily living and difficulty maintaining social functioning,extreme difficulty maintaining concentration,persistence,or pace,and four or more episodes of decompensation.marked restrictions,according to the form,are impairments that seriously interfere with the ability to function independently,appropriately,and effectively up to of the time.although the form included sections for comments or elaboration,the doctor left those portions blank.on july,venkataraman noted that white had shown improvement,but still considered her to have a gaf of between and.
history after july,
therapist notes from august describe white as being overwhelmed,but also said that she was doing better living in her mother basement.in september,white was described by a therapist as underfunctioning.white also stated that anything beyond the most basic things she does is too much for her.
venkataraman reported that white status was deteriorating and that her gaf remained at as of september.in october of the same year,a therapist noted that white was continuing to assert herself about her disability claim and that she was unmotivated to get out of her bed except to care for herself and her animals.the same therapist notes state that she is making progress.
in november,white said that other people were asking too much of her.white status was described as critical a designation that is not explained in the record and she was found to be focused on the negative aspects of her circumstances.also in november,venkataraman reported white condition as stable and that she had a gaf of at that time.therapy notes from december said that white,although continuing to have difficulty with her mood,was doing well.
procedural background 
white was years old when she applied for disability insurance and supplemental security income benefits in june.she claimed to be disabled as of december,due to bipolar disorder and severe depression.her application was initially denied,and white requested an administrative hearing in response to the denial.at the hearing,the alj evaluated white personal testimony as well as that of vocational expert ve james fuller.
white testified that she has a ged.as for her work history,she reported that her most recent job lasting more than three months involved both shipping and receptionist duties,adding that the position required her to lift up to pounds occasionally,pounds frequently,and to walk or stand on a constant basis.she stated that the last time she had worked was during a stint at a pharmacy in.before the pharmacy job,she had worked at target stocking shelves and cashiering for a total of two months.
white attributed her inability to work more than a few weeks at a time to anxiety,sleeplessness,and depression.she added that,before her work as a target stock clerk,she had worked briefly as a receptionist,a sales clerk,and as a warehouse worker.white quit the warehousing position to work at target for better hours.she was discharged from target after exhibiting symptoms of anxiety and depression.white testified that,during her stint as a warehouse worker,she missed work because of depression.she admitted,however,that she was still capable of gainful employment when she quit.
white said that she first sought mental health treatment in the summer of.she reported that a psychiatrist initially diagnosed her as having a compulsive disorder,but that she was rediagnosed because the prescribed medication failed to improve her condition.white stated that she was subsequently prescribed paxil by margolis.she began psychiatric treatment at the eastwood clinic in.white explained that her condition was marked by lethargy,racing thoughts,anxiety,agitation,and the inability to focus.she alleged that her condition had worsened since due to medication changes,noting that her bad days outnumbered the good ones.white said that cerapro eased her symptoms of paranoia and that propanol helped her control the jitters.she reported that,in addition to her mental conditions,she suffered from endometriosis that required yearly surgery.white admitted that on her good days she was able to function,but doubted that she could both work and take care of her daughter.
ve fuller also testified during the hearing.he was asked to opine on the availability of jobs for someone sharing white basic characteristics and functional limitations.to that end,the alj posed the following hypothetical question 
assume that our hypothetical claimant needs work that is in a relatively clean setting,she needs a low stress environmental and i am defining low stress as one where there is no requirement to work with the general public,nor in close contact with.our hypothetical claimant also needs simple repetitive type work or sic because of a moderate limitation in their ability to maintain attention and concentration due to mental impairment.there is moderate limitation in their ability to understand and then to carry out detailed instruction due to a mental impairment.if you assume that,what jobs would our hypothetical claimant be vocationally qualified to perform 
the ve opined that a person with the above limitations could perform a limited number of light,unskilled assembling,packaging,and inspection jobs,finding that jobs for each position existed in the regional economy.he found that approximately additional positions existed for each job listing at the sedentary exertional level and an addition at the medium level,adding that he limited his findings to unskilled work based on the hypothetical limitation of simple repetitive work.but the ve also said that if the hypothetical individual had poor or no ability to deal with work stresses,maintain attention and concentration,and function independently,all gainful employment would be precluded.
in light of white medical records and the testimony provided at the hearing,the alj found that,although white conditions of bipolar disorder and depression along with other conditions not relevant to this appeal were severe impairments based on the regulations contained in c,none of them were considered to be disabilities per se pursuant to the commissioner regulations.this finding required the alj to consider whether white could perform work that she had done in the past.the alj determined that white could not do so.nevertheless,the alj found that white retained the following residual functional capacity rfc from december,to november,and since july,
l ight exertional work in a relatively clean environment in a low stress setting.low stress setting means no work with the general public or in close contact with.the work must be unskilled to allow for moderate limitations in an ability to maintain concentration for extended periods and to carry out detailed instructions due to pain and depression.
despite this finding,the alj found that white was disabled from november,to july.the alj observed that,during this period,white experienced marked restrictions.but the alj found that,before and after the closed period of disability,white was capable of a limited range of light work,including the jobs of assembler,packager,and visual inspector.
the alj also determined that white allegations of ongoing disability were not fully credible,finding that,despite the presence of a mental impairment,the medical record only shows that it was severe for a closed period of time before it responded well to psychotropic medications and therapy.noting the november mental residual functional capacity assessment finding by tien that white could perform simple,unskilled work,the alj determined nonetheless that treating records supported her determination of the closed period of disability.
white requested that the social security appeals council review the adverse portion of the alj decision.after the appeals council affirmed the alj ruling,white filed a civil action against the commissioner in federal district court,seeking judicial review of the alj decision.the commissioner filed a motion for summary judgment,which was assigned to a magistrate judge for study.in his report and recommendation r r,the magistrate judge concluded that the alj reasonably found that white psychological problems were exacerbated by interpersonal conflicts and housing arrangements before the closed period and that her condition had improved after that period.the magistrate judge also found that the alj was entitled to reject the opinion of white treating physician venkataraman on the basis that it stood at odds with therapy notes as well as other portions of the record.moreover,the magistrate judge determined that the alj adverse credibility determination was not patently wrong,and that the hypothetical question to the ve properly accounted for all of white mental deficiencies.the district court adopted the magistrate judge r r in july.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review and legal framework 
we exercise de novo review of district court decisions in social security cases.valley comm r of soc,cir.the commissioner conclusions must be affirmed absent a determination that the alj failed to apply the correct legal standards or made findings of fact unsupported by substantial evidence in the record.g see also preslar sec y of health human,cir we will affirm the secretary decision to deny benefits as long as the secretary applied correct legal standards in reaching the decision,and as long as the secretary findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.richardson perales,d citation omitted.
this means that administrative findings 
are not subject to reversal merely because substantial evidence exists in the record to support a different conclusion.the substantial evidence standard presupposes that there is a zone of choice within which the secretary may proceed without interference from the courts.if the administrative decision is supported by substantial evidence,a reviewing court must affirm.
felisky bowen,cir citations omitted.even if supported by substantial evidence,however,a decision of the commissioner will not be upheld where the social security administration fails to follow its own regulations and where that error prejudices a claimant on the merits or deprives the claimant of a substantial right.bowen comm r of soc,cir.
to receive disability benefits under the ssa,an applicant must be disabled within the meaning of the act.individuals are disabled under the ssa if they are unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.a a.
an individual shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but can not,considering his age,education,and work experience,engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy,regardless of whether such work exists in the immediate area in which he lives,or whether a specific job vacancy exists for him,or whether he would be hired if he applied for work.
the preceding statutory requirements have been distilled into a regulatory framework that sets forth a sequential analysis used to determine whether a particular applicant for disability benefits is indeed disabled.this court has summarized the framework as follows 
the claimant must first show that she is not engaged in substantial gainful activity.next,the claimant must demonstrate that she has a severe impairment.a finding of disabled will be made at the third step if the claimant can then demonstrate that her impairment meets the durational requirement and meets or equals a listed impairment.if the impairment does not meet or equal a listed impairment,the fourth step requires the claimant to prove that she is incapable of performing work that she has done in the past.finally,if the claimant impairment is so severe as to preclude the performance of past work,then other factors,including age,education,past work experience,and residual functional capacity,must be considered to determine if other work can be performed.the burden shifts to the commissioner at this fifth step to establish the claimant ability to do other work.
foster halter,cir see also a i v.
in addition to the analysis outlined in,the commissioner has promulgated regulations governing evaluations of the severity of mental impairments.see kohler astrue,cir citing.these regulations require application of a special technique at the second and third steps of the framework.id.citations omitted.because white does not contend on appeal that the alj failed to properly apply the special technique,however,further elaboration of these regulations is unnecessary.
disability finding 
the alj determined that white bipolar disorder and depression were so severe that they rendered her disabled between november,and july.but the alj found that white was able to work and was therefore not disabled either before or after those dates.white contests the adverse aspects of the alj decision.
the alj finding that white was not disabled prior to november,is supported by substantial evidence 
white maintains that the alj determination that she could work prior to november,is not supported by substantial evidence.the overall thrust of her argument is that there is no material difference between the severity of her mental impairments before november,and the time during the closed period when white was deemed disabled.if she was disabled during the closed period due to her bipolar disorder and depression,white contends,she must have been disabled before november.the alj finding to the contrary,white argues,is thus erroneous.
but we are not persuaded by white argument that there is no material difference in the record before and after november.the difference is subtle,but it exists.prior to november,there is little indication that white mental impairments,even though severe,rendered her unable to engage in substantial gainful activities.white indeed mentioned feeling depressed and sleepless during this earlier period of time.but her treating counselors and physicians also noted,for example,that her intellectual functioning was average,her memory was normal,and that she had fair judgment and insight and good impulse control.another treatment note from this time period states that her memory was good,that she had adequate judgment,and that her ability to concentrate was only moderately impaired.moreover,her psychomotor activities were considered only minimally limited.
this is all notably better than her mental condition during the closed period.treatment records from that time frame show that she suffered from debilitating guilt,significant psychomotor retardation,and s ignificant disturbance of or changes in patterns of sleep,appetite,or activities in daily living.white also reported feeling paralyzed during the closed period,which marks another material difference from the,time frame.a fair reading of the medical record from white treating sources thus supports a finding that white had a severely not completely condition during the,time period.
the administrative record also exposes a significant and unexplained gap in treatment between her withdrawal as a patient at hegira programs in may and the commencement of treatment at the eastwood clinic in november.we recognize that aljs must be careful not to assume that a patient failure to receive treatment evidences a tranquil mental state.for some mental disorders,the very failure to seek treatment is simply another symptom of the disorder itself.see astrue,cir listing cases recognizing that a mentally ill person noncompliance with treatment can be the result of the mental impairment itself and,therefore,neither willful nor without a justifiable excuse citations,internal quotation marks,and brackets omitted.but in this case there is no evidence in the record explaining white failure to seek treatment during this gap.a reasonable mind might therefore find that the lack of treatment during the,time frame indicated an alleviation of white symptoms.see richardson perales,d describing the standard citation omitted.
white nevertheless asserts several specific objections to the alj findings.she accuses the alj of cherry picking treatment notes that paint her condition in a positive light,while ignoring more troubling aspects,such as white repeated expression of depression,her tearfulness,and her consistently low gaf scores.white also notes that the alj finding presupposed an unsupported diagnosis of white depression as situational,caused primarily by various personal problems as opposed to her mental disorders.
this last objection is not wholly without merit.the alj should not have labeled white depression during the,time frame as situational because there is no basis in the record for concluding that white depression was primarily caused by her personal problems as opposed to her mental disorders.see reasonable inferences may be drawn,but presumptions,speculations and suppositions should not be substituted for evidence.a person personal problems and his or her mental disorders can not always be so neatly disentangled.but the alj inappropriate characterization of the causes of white condition is irrelevant because the clinical records themselves,such as those describing white psychomotor abilities,support the alj finding that white retained the ability to work before november.
this leaves white accusation of cherry picking.but we see little indication that the alj improperly cherry picked evidence the same process can be described more neutrally as weighing the evidence.white has not persuasively shown that the alj erred in conducting this difficult task.
the alj finding that white was not disabled after july,
in addition to challenging the november,start date of the close
