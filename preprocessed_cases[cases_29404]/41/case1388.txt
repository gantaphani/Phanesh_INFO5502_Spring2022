rush university medical center believes that it has not received all of the medicare payments to which it is entitled for fiscal year.after an unduly prolonged administrative process,the secretary of health and human services resolved numerous contested issues against the medical center.on judicial review under f,the district court made a decision mostly favorable to the secretary position.wl,dist.lexis.
unfortunately,it is impossible to tell from the judgment who won what.it reads 
it is hereby ordered and adjudged that plaintiff,rush university medical center motion for summary judgment is granted in part and denied in part the defendant,michael leavitt motion for summary judgment is granted in part and denied in part.civil case terminated.
unless the plaintiff loses outright,a judgment must provide the relief to which the winner is entitled.that motions have been granted is beside the point.see,waypoint aviation services sandel avionics,cir foremost sales promotions,director,batf,cir reytblatt denton,cir.
despite.b,which requires district judges to review and approve any judgment other than one implementing a jury verdict,awarding a sum certain,or denying all relief,this judgment was drafted and entered by a deputy clerk.for more than years this court has been urging the district judges of this circuit to enter proper judgments.otis chicago,cir en banc,and bethune plaza,lumpkin,cir,are two examples among many.see also,properties unlimited,cendant mobility services,cir buck digital communications,cir.
some district judges turn each decision over to a deputy clerk,who either fails to enter a judgment many a case peters out with a minute order but nothing resembling a rule judgment or uses the last paragraph of the opinion as a template for drafting and entering a judgment without judicial input.when the disposition is simple,a clerk interpretation is apt to be satisfactory.but when the disposition is complex,the clerk who is not a lawyer is at sea and disinclined to venture an independent interpretation.then we get things like this document,which says that the judge has granted one or more motions in part but does not even try to specify what matters the consequence of the judicial ruling.nothing but review by a judge,as rule b demands,will yield a satisfactory judgment when the outcome is complicated.
sometimes it is easy to infer the disposition,and then the appeal may proceed despite technical shortcomings.see bankers trust mallis,d.but nothing is particularly easy about this litigation,which involves multiple issues.in the course of addressing more than a dozen disputes,the district judge concluded that the controversy could not be resolved fully without a remand to the agency.the agency had declined to compensate the medical center for the costs of resident physicians participating in some fellowship programs,which the agency thought had not been approved by the appropriate bodies.concerned that some of the programs might have been approved,but that the medical center had been confused by the documentation requirements,the court directed the agency to give the medical center another opportunity to complete worksheet for some participants in some of the programs.which participants and programs,and what are the agency marching orders on remand the document did not say.
at this court urging,the parties returned to the district court and obtained a more informative judgment.a new appeal has been filed.the second judgment,which the parties drafted for the district judge signature,is itself barely adequate.it says that the agency must allow the medical center to submit documentation for the costs of services furnished by residents in up to thirteen fellowship programs.more detail would have been appropriate,but this vagueness does not make the judgment,though it would prevent any motion to hold the agency in contempt if it does not understand its duties the same way the medical center does.
the remand creates a second problem with appellate jurisdiction.remand usually signifies that a decision is not final.who wins,and how much,can not be known until activity on remand has been finished.but the supreme court has held that a remand to an agency is final when the proceedings may end without further,if the private claimant prevails,the agency can not obtain judicial review of its own decision even when that decision has been compelled by a judicial decision with which the agency disagrees.unless the issues can be addressed in court while the agency deals with the remand,they might never be open to appellate review.that makes the district judge decision effectively final.see forney apfel,d sullivan finkelstein,d.forney and finkelstein arose from the social security program,but in edgewater foundation thompson,cir,we concluded that they are equally applicable to medical providers suits seeking reimbursement under the medicare program.the sort of remand ordered by the district judge is one that might well conclude without a return to court,so the decision is appealable.although a decision that is final only because the agency may be unable to obtain review after its own action on remand might be thought to justify immediate review only at the agency behest,forney concluded that any decision final from the agency perspective also is final from the private litigant,and that principle controls here.
the first cluster of appellate issues arises from d f i i,which provides that hospitals serving a significantly disproportionate number of patients receive additional medicare payments.the statute and regulations treat persons eligible for care under the medicaid program as patients for this purpose.at the outset of this disproportionate share program,it was unclear how persons covered by states programs would be classified.some hospitals and some of the medicare program fiscal intermediaries equated patients to medicaid patients others did not.a regulation issued in december,and effective january,provides that patients do not count among the patients for the purpose of this program.we call it a regulation,though it is actually program memorandum.the parties treat this document as if it had the status of a regulation we do likewise without deciding whether that is correct.
periods before calendar year are covered by a grandfather clause which the parties call the hold harmless rule.hospitals that classified patients with medicaid patients in cost reports filed before october,or took administrative appeals based on that theory,are entitled to the benefit of classification.others are not.the manual instructs fiscal intermediaries 
where,for cost reporting periods beginning before january,a hospital filed a jurisdictionally proper appeal to the prrb provider reimbursement review board on the issue of the exclusion of these types of days from the medicare dsh formula on or after october,reopen the settled cost report at issue and revise the medicare dsh disproportionate share hospital payment to reflect the inclusion of these types of days as medicaid days,but only if the hospital appealed,before october,the denial of payment for the days in question in previous cost reporting periods do not reopen a cost report and revise the medicare dsh payment to reflect the inclusion of these types of days as medicaid days if,on or after october,a hospital added the issue of the exclusion of these types of days to a jurisdictionally proper appeal already pending before prrb on other medicare dsh issues or other unrelated issues.you are to continue paying the medicare dsh adjustment reflecting the inclusion of general assistance or other health program,charity care,medicaid dsh,waiver or demonstration population days for all open cost reports for cost reporting periods beginning before january,to any hospital that,before october,filed a jurisdictionally proper appeal to the prrb specifically for this issue on previously settled cost reports.
emphasis in original.the idea is that any hospital that added a claim based on patients must have been trying to take advantage of the grandfather treatment,which was first announced on october.only claims that predate the announ
