background 
rena heino,age,applied for dib and ssi on december.she alleged a disability onset date of march,stating that she could not work because of migraine headaches,obesity,fibromyalgia with severe pain,a torn rotator cuff in her left shoulder,asthma,osteoarthritis in the hips and knees,and knee problems due to her weight and injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident.when she applied for dib and ssi,heino was tall and weighed pounds,down from a high of pounds.her past surgeries included a gastric bypass and knee replacement.she reported that her migraine headaches occurred several times a week and previously required hospitalization for several days.the social security administration ssa denied heino benefit claims,and heino filed a request for a hearing before an alj.
following a hearing,the alj found that heino had a history of obesity for which she underwent gastric bypass surgery in.according to the alj,heino lost much weight after the surgery as intended but unfortunately gained it back due to stress at home.the alj also noted that heino suffered from subacromial bursitis and had a dislocated left shoulder from a car wreck in december.heino had been treated with an acromioplasty in march.in may,she had normal strength in the shoulder,but a few weeks later she had decreased strength and range of motion but no complaint of pain.a magnetic resonance imaging gave no indication of a tear or impingement.in july,heino received an injection of xylocaine and depo medrol for pain with apparently good results.
heino also injured her left knee in the december car wreck and reinjured the knee during a subsequent fall.because the knee showed substantial cartilage degeneration,heino underwent a full knee replacement in july.heino recovered well and,by december,was walking two miles three to four times daily.in march,she had to undergo a surgical knee treatment under anesthesia due to increasing pain.
additionally,heino has bronchial asthma that is controlled with inhalers.she also has complained of headaches,including migraines.according to the alj assessment of the medical record,heino migraine headaches are infrequent.the medical evidence indicated that heino has degenerative disc disease in the cervical and lumbar spine.but examining physicians have deemed her muscle strength in her arms and legs,motor strength,and reflexes normal.heino also has emotional impairments.she has a history of situational depression that was exacerbated by the birth of twins,for whom she is the sole caregiver.she also has a history of stress disorder.
the alj noted that heino impairments are severe,limiting her to the performance of low stress work,and that she has only fair ability to handle complex work.but the alj nonetheless concluded that she is only mildly restricted in her activities of daily living and has mild difficulties maintaining concentration,persistence and pace.
the alj characterized heino description of her limitations as follows 
heino testified that she could lift less than pounds and that she could not carry a gallon of milk,which weighs about eight pounds.she indicated that she could walk one or two blocks but that she could not negotiate stairs.she stated that she used a walker and that when shopping would need to sit and rest at least once.she indicated that she could stand for only a couple of minutes and that her knees were not stable.it was her testimony that she could sit for a maximum of minutes and that because of her weight she could not sit comfortably in a chair.she reported that she could bend,stoop and squat to some degree but not when her back went out.she indicated further that she could reach with her left arm,did not have a good enough grip to allow her to open jars and experienced stiffness and soreness in her fingers when typing on a computer.she alleged problems with pushing,pulling and reaching as well.
in her description of her mental capabilities,the claimant testified that she had poor short term memory resulting in difficulty remembering the various tasks that she needed to do.she alleged that her pain caused difficulty with her concentration and that she could not stay focused and complete tasks.she denied any difficulty relating to the people with whom she had contact at work but admitted that she did have arguments with her husband,apparently regarding her children.she has entertained thoughts of harming herself and at times has taken too much medication,allegedly because of her pain.she spoke as well of post traumatic stress disorder related to abuse as a child and to an abandonment disorder as an infant,with anxiety attacks multiple times each week.
gary cromer,a medical consultant with the disability determination services of iowa,found that heino could meet the exertional demands of light work.cromer found that she could climb,balance,stoop,kneel and crouch occasionally.he concluded that heino could reach only occasionally with her left arm and that she had no other problems with manipulation.he also opined that heino did not have any visual,communicative or environment limitations.
claro palma treated heino for pain and completed a residual functional capacity rfc assessment on october.palma opined that heino could walk less than one block at a time and could sit for minutes at a time and for a total of about two hours in an workday and could stand for minutes at a time and for a total of less than two hours in an workday.he opined that she would have to walk about for five minutes every minutes and would need to be allowed to shift positions at will from sitting,standing or walking.he stated that at times she would need to take unscheduled breaks during the day.he also concluded that she could lift less than pounds and then only occasionally.s he was significantly limited in repetitive reaching,handling and fingering,could stoop for of an day but could not crouch at all.
the alj discounted palma conclusion of significant limitations,noting that palma own treatment records did not support his opinions.the alj observed that the treatment records indicated that 
as of january,the claimant had normal motion in all joints except for the left hip and both knees and only mild pain.in addition,she did not have any difficulty with normal daily activities except for getting into and out of an automobile,running errands and shopping,which caused problems but which she could still do.
raja junaid,a psychiatrist,assessed heino rfc.the alj characterized junaid conclusions as follows 
heino would probably be absent from work more than three times a month because of her impairments or treatment and overall,that she had only fair ability to function.more specifically,he felt that she had fair ability to remember procedures,maintain attention for two hours at a time,maintain regular attendance,be punctual,work without special supervision,work in proximity to others without being unduly distracted,accept instructions,respond appropriately to criticism,get along with,respond appropriately to work changes,deal with normal work stress and be aware of normal hazards and take appropriate precautions.junaid indicated further that the claimant had fair ability to do or skilled work if she took her medication.he noted as well that she had fair ability to interact with the general public,adhere to basic standards of neatness and cleanliness and travel in unfamiliar places and good ability to maintain socially appropriate behavior and use public transportation.the most significant limitation indicated by junaid is that the claimant is limited in her ability to tolerate stressful work.
the alj found that some of heino limitations mentioned by junaid were not supported by his treatment records.for example,junaid opined that heino would be absent from work three or more times a month,but there is no reference in his treatment records
