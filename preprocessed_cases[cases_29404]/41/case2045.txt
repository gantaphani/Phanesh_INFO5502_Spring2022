john crowley appeals from the district court decision granting summary judgment and dismissing his pro se claim that his civil rights were violated because the named defendants,robert bannister,daniel sussman,dwight neven,pat diliddo,tamiia grisham,and jane balao cledera,were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs,in violation of the eighth amendment of the united states constitution.crowley,now represented by counsel,raises the following issues on appeal whether we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal under whether the district court abused its discretion in failing to comply with rule m of the federal rules of civil procedure in dismissing the complaint against sussman whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the merits in favor of bannister whether the district court abused its discretion in denying his request for leave to amend his second amended complaint and whether the district court should have been required to advise him of his rights under rule d of the federal rules of civil procedure.
we conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of bannister because crowley failed to submit evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether bannister was deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs.we also affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of warden neven and nurses grisham,diliddo,and balao cledera because crowley expressly waived his appeal against them in his reply brief.we vacate the clerk entry of judgment in favor of sussman because the district court abused its discretion in failing to comply with rule m.we also vacate the district court decision denying crowley request for leave to amend his second amended complaint to name additional defendants.we remand with instructions to comply with rule m with respect to sussman and to allow crowley leave to amend his second amended complaint.
crowley,acting pro se,filed his initial complaint in the district court on february.the district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice following its initial review under.crowley then filed his first amended complaint.before any action was taken by the defendants or the district court with respect to the first amended complaint,he filed a second amended complaint,in which he alleged a action for deliberate indifference of a serious medical need against sussman bannister,the director of the medical department at the nevada department of corrections ndoc high desert state prison hdsp warden neven,the warden at hdsp and three nurses,grisham,diliddo,and balao cledera.
in his second amended complaint,crowley set forth the following allegations nurse grisham was the intake nurse upon his arrival at hdsp.she informed him there were only two pill calls at the facility and changed his lithium prescription from three doses to two without the prior approval of a doctor.sussman never met with him and did not properly screen his medical file or review nurse grisham alteration to his prescription.his cellmate informed nurse diliddo of his bizarre behavior and unresponsiveness on may,but she refused to treat him.nurse balao cledera delayed six hours in providing him medical care after his cellmate informed her of his behavior on may,even though she knew he was suffering from an overdose.bannister and warden neven were responsible for the operation of hdsp medical unit and knew that the nurses regularly changed the patient prescriptions,even though they were not qualified to do so and had not received prior approval from a doctor.
crowley claimed that these alleged actions resulted in his hospitalization and ongoing mental and physical side effects.he also requested leave to amend the second amended complaint with names of defendants when they are learned.
on april,the district court issued a screening order based on its initial review of the second amended complaint under.it directed nevada attorney general to advise the court within days whether she could accept service for the named defendants.with respect to any defendant for whom she could not accept service,the district court ordered her to file,under seal,the last known address es of those defendant s and also directed crowley to file a motion requesting the issuance of a summons and specifying a full name and address for such defendant.it further ordered that s ervice must be completed within one hundred twenty days from the attorney general service of a statement that she will not be able to accept service for the defendant.
crowley copy of the screening order was returned to the district court as undeliverable on may.the district court docket indicates that the order was not remailed,as n o other address was available for crowley at that time.
seven days later,on may,crowley notified the district court that he was now residing at the lovelock correctional center lcc.the notice was dated may.the district court docket does not reflect that its screening order was thereafter mailed to the lcc address.
the attorney general accepted service on behalf of all defendants except for sussman.she declined to accept service on behalf of sussman because daniel sussman is not an employee nor has he ever been an employee of the ndoc.the attorney general did not provide sussman last known address.
the attorney general filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint and,in the alternative,a motion for summary judgment on behalf of all defendants,except for sussman.in support of the motion,the attorney general provided crowley medical records,as well as declarations from defendants and other ndoc staff.
crowley medical records reveal the following facts crowley is an inmate who has a history of bipolar disorder,delusions,parkinson disease,and hypertension.during crowley initial imprisonment at lcc,he was administered milligrams of lithium in the morning and afternoon and milligrams of lithium in the evening.on april,he was transferred to hdsp.during intake,nurse richard orden reviewed his chart and referred him to psychological services.that same day,sussman changed crowley prescription for lithium to be administered twice daily in milligram doses.although the frequency of the doses was altered from three to two doses per day,the total daily amount of milligrams stayed the same.
on may,a floor officer notified the medical staff regarding crowley unusual behavior.when nurse cordero responded,she was advised by his cellmate that crowley had eaten soap the night before and had no appetite for food.she noted that he was verbally responsive,but was also slow in his response,confused,staring blankly,jerking,and eating tissue paper.she determined he should be admitted to the infirmary and that his lithium level should be checked.
crowley was admitted to the infirmary by the telephone order of holmes.when admitted,he responded to questions and obeyed simple commands,but was shaking.his blood was drawn to test his lithium level.
crowley spent the following day in the infirmary and was attended to by nurses grisham and balao cledera.upon examining crowley on may,a doctor ordered that he be transferred to the emergency room at valley hospital based on a diagnosis of probable lithium toxicity.at the hospital,he was treated for lithium toxicity and dehydration secondary most likely due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,a concentrating defect which can produce polyuria,an excessive or abnormally large production passage of urine.he was discharged three weeks later.
defendants argue that warden neven and bannister were not liable under because their declarations and crowley medical records reflected that his medication was changed by a doctor,not a nurse,and that,even if nurses were allowed to change a patient medications at hdsp,neither directed,approved,or knew of such a policy.regarding nurses grisham,diliddo,and balao cledera,defendants argue that the medical records and other evidence established that crowley had incorrectly identified their roles in his medical care and that the medical care they did provide crowley did not reflect willful indifference.
the district court issued a minute order informing crowley of his rights under rules and of the federal rules of civil procedure,as required by this court decisions in klingele eikenberry,cir,and rand rowland,cir en banc.the court order advised crowley,inter alia,that if evidence is submitted with a motion to dismiss and considered by the court,then the motion will be treated as a motion for summary judgment and that if the court grants summary judgment,then judgment may be entered against him and this lawsuit will end without trial.in addition,it instructed crowley that to oppose a motion for summary judgment 
he must set out specific facts in the form of admissible evidence such as affidavits,declarations,depositions,answers to interrogatories,or properly authenticated documents as provided in rule e,that contradict the facts shown in the defendant declarations and documents and show that there is a genuine issue of fact for trial.
crowley opposed the motion for summary judgment,contending that e ven if his recollection of who did what on what day is impaired,the facts remain that he suffered severe lithium toxicity and he had to be hospitalized.he did not submit any evidence in support of his opposition.instead,he requested the opportunity to amend any issue the district court deemed unclear or in dispute.
the district court granted summary judgment with respect to all defendants,except for sussman.it concluded that crowley failed to produce any admissible evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact that bannister knew of the alleged constitutional violations.regarding his claims against nurses grisham,diliddo,and balao cledera,it concluded that crowley failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding their alleged liability because the uncontroverted evidence and undisputed facts reflected that he had improperly identified them in his second amended complaint as the persons responsible for a deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs,and that the level of care they did provide him,as evidenced by the medical records,can not state a claim for deliberate indifference to crowley serious medical needs.with respect to all defendants,except for sussman who was not a party to the motion,the district court also concluded,alternatively,that these defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because there was no clearly established law that would have put them on notice that their conduct was unlawful.
the same day the district court issued its order granting summary judgment in favor of bannister,warden neven,and nurses diliddo,grisham,and balao cledera,the clerk entered judgment also dismissing this action against sussman.crowley timely appealed.in addition to filing his notice of appeal,crowley lodged a proposed third amended complaint against bannister,holmes,walsh,and nurses orden and cordero.
represented by counsel on appeal,crowley argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because the evidence would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that sussman and bannister acted with deliberate indifference to his medical needs,the district court abused its discretion in denying his request for leave to amend his second amended complaint,and the district court failed to advise him that he could request that it defer considering defendants motions until after discovery.he expressly waived any challenge to the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of warden neven and nurses diliddo,grisham,and balao cledera in his reply brief.
crowley filed a timely notice of appeal.we have jurisdiction to review final decisions of the district court under.neither party addressed our jurisdiction in view of the fact that the district court granted summary judgment to fewer than all the named defendants.nor did the parties address whether a district court is empowered to enter judgment against a party that was never served.because we are required to raise issues concerning our appellate jurisdiction sua sponte,united states ex rel.shutt cmty.home health care,cir,we asked the parties to file supplemental briefs regarding our jurisdiction to hear this appeal.in response to our request,crowley now asks that we dismiss his appeal and remand because the district court decision was not final for purposes of conferring jurisdiction under.we disagree.

the district court order granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants who had been served,and the parties do not dispute that the only remaining defendant,sussman,was never served.nothing in the district court order suggests that further adjudication was contemplated,and the clerk entered judgment in favor of all defendants that same day,finally disposing of the action against all defendants.see distrib.agency nationwide mut.ins,cir had the court entered a separate final judgment subsequent to the dismissal order,we would be confident the court intended no further action in this case.crowley subsequent lodging of a proposed third amended complaint occurred at the same time that he filed a notice of appeal he did not name sussman as a defendant in that complaint.we are persuaded that we have jurisdiction to review this appeal.
even though the district court grant of summary judgment was a final order,we can not reach the merits of crowley claims against sussman,as he was never served with the complaint and summons.a federal court is without personal jurisdiction over a defendant unless the defendant has been served in accordance with.travelers cas.sur.of am.brenneke,cir quoting benny pipes,cir.w hether personal jurisdiction can be exercised is a question of law reviewable de novo when the underlying facts are undisputed.id.citing fdic british am.ins,cir.

the parties do not dispute that crowley failed to serve sussman therefore,the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over sussman and should have proceeded under rule m to dismiss the complaint against sussman without prejudice.rule m provides that 
if a defendant is not served within days after the complaint is filed,the court on motion or on its own after notice to the plaintiff must dismiss the action without prejudice against that defendant or order that service be made within a specified time.but if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure,the court must extend the time for service for an appropriate period.
