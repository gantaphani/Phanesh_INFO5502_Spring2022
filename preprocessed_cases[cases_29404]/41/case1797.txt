gary rittenhouse filed for benefits with unitedhealth group long term disability insurance plan unitedhealth,which is insured by a policy from aig life insurance company.the plan,purchased by his employer,is governed by the employee retirement income security act of,et.after aig denied his claim and appeal,rittenhouse sued under.on for summary judgment,the district court granted rittenhouse and denied unitedhealth,awarding him attorney fees and costs of action,per g.unitedhealth appeals.this court reverses and remands.
rittenhouse began losing his hearing in the late.tests by roger mc gargill in august showed that rittenhouse had word recognition in his right ear and in his left ear.rittenhouse physician,patrick mccarville,referred him to britt thedinger,a specialist,who tested him on april.these tests showed word recognition in the right ear and in the left.nonetheless,thedinger described rittenhouse hearing loss as moderate to severe,predicting it will continue to slowly deteriorate.thedinger concluded that rittenhouse is totally disabled and could never return to work.after a general physical on may,mccarville described his hearing loss as very severe.thedinger examined him on july his last day of work,finding no change since april.
rittenhouse began as vice president of business development for a subsidiary of unitedhealth group in july.after overseeing the elimination of his unit,he was laid off on july.on october,rittenhouse submitted a claim for longterm disability benefits to aig.mccarville and thedinger signed attending physician statements that he is totally disabled.aig also received a letter and statement from mc gargill.he opined that a person in rittenhouse condition would have difficulty hearing on the phone,as well as hearing and understanding speech at a distance of more than to feet and not having the speaker face him when the speaker is speaking in a normal voice.mc gargill noted that even with hearing aids rittenhouse still has difficulty in the presence of any background noise,on the phone,and especially with women.he added that this difficulty is compounded when he is not able to see the speaker face and can not lipread.nevertheless,mc gargill indicated on the statement that rittenhouse is not totally disabled.
rick snyder,a medical consultant aig hired to review the claim,spoke with thedinger in march.in a letter summarizing the conversation,thedinger agreed that rittenhouse has excellent speech discrimination overall,and that with appropriate accommodations,he should function at a level that would allow him to perform his occupational duties.aig denied rittenhouse claim on april,deciding that he is not disabled under the policy.
promptly appealing,rittenhouse submitted a personal statement a disability waiver for charges from his life insurance company stating that he is totally disabled a letter from the social security administration denying his claim for disability benefits,but acknowledging that your condition prevents you from doing your past job and,the results of another hearing test from june.he offered to undergo more tests,but aig never acted on this offer.robert levine reviewed the entire file for aig,concluding,as of july,there were no changes in the claimant condition that would prevent him from continuing to perform the essential duties of his occupation as a vice president for business development.based on this report,aig denied rittenhouse appeal on august.aig told him its decision was final and a lawsuit was his only recourse.over the next five months rittenhouse sent aig additional documents,repeatedly requesting his file be.aig refused to consider the documents or the file.rittenhouse sued in may.
this case presents several issues the correct standard of review in the district court the admissibility of the documents rittenhouse produced after his appeal was denied the motions for summary judgment and,the award of attorney fees.
the district court reviews de novo a denial of benefits in an erisa case,unless a plan administrator has discretionary power to construe uncertain terms or to make eligibility determinations,when review is for abuse of discretion.see king hartford life accident ins,cir en banc.here,the district court reviewed aig decision de novo,because the court did not find the explicit language necessary to require a heightened standard of review.see mckeehan cigna life ins,cir we require explicit language in the policy or in other plan documents to trigger the erisa deferential standard of review.this court reviews de novo the district court determination of the standard of review.see farley.blue cross blue shield,cir.
rittenhouse argues that discretion can not be granted to aig because the record does not establish that it is the administrator.erisa requires administrators periodically to furnish beneficiaries with a summary plan description spd,b.unitedhealth refers to a spd that includes the full insurance policy,a benefits handbook,and an integrated disability management agreement.the district court declined to consider these documents,discounting them as unreliable.even if the court had considered the handbook and the management agreement,neither document is dispositive.the handbook identifies unum as the insurer and administrator,never referring to aig.the management agreement,although apparently prepared for aig and unitedhealth,is not signed by either.instead,the district court designated as the spd a statement of erisa rights.this document identifies unitedhealth care services,as the policyholder and the administrator,leading rittenhouse to assert,the plan administrator is unitedhealth care services.
the insurance policy directs beneficiaries to submit their claims to aig,which rittenhouse did on an aig form.aig alone adjudicated the claim from the beginning,over a period.the attending physician statements were made on aig standard forms,and rittenhouse doctors forwarded his medical records to aig,per aig request.rittenhouse addressed all letters and supporting documents to aig,and all correspondence to him came on aig letterhead,signed by a representative of that company.he authorized the social security administration to release benefits information to aig.he never corresponded with unitedhealth care services,he did request that an employer statement be completed and sent to aig by unitedhealth group.it is clear from the whole record that aig is the plan administrator.
the question remains whether aig decision should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.the insurance policy is rife with ambiguous language that unitedhealth cites as evidence of a grant of authority to aig.the policy says that disability benefits will be paid when we aig determine that proof of your ltd claim is satisfactory.because it is relatively easy for an insurer to use unambiguous language when its group policy will serve as an erisa plan a policy containing ambiguous claims submission language commonly used in contexts is presumed not to confer discretion on the administrator.walke group long term disability,cir.
the district court relied primarily on the spd.but the policy and the summary plan description jointly constitute the plan documents.ross rail car am.group disability income plan,cir see also firestone tire rubber bruch,d a denial of benefits challenged under a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.emphasis added.the triggering language may appear in a plan document other than the spd.
the the heading allocation of authority states,we aig reserve full discretion and authority to manage the group policy,administer claims,and interpret all group policy terms and conditions.this triggers review.see mcgarrah hartford life ins,cir policy gave administrator full discretion and authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe and interpret its terms and provisions.delta disability survivorship plan marshall,cir plan gave administrative committee the discretionary authority to interpret and construe the plan,and decide
