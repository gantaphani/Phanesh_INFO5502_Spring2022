these matters are before the court on appellants petitions for panel rehearing and for rehearing en banc.the petitions for rehearing are denied.
the petitions for rehearing en banc were transmitted to all of the judges of the court who are in regular active service as required by.as no member of the panel and no judge in regular active service on the court requested that the court be polled,those petitions are also denied.
a revised panel opinion is attached to this order.
defendants dan anderson,robert lahue,and ronald lahue were convicted by a jury for violations of the medicare antikickback act act,b,which criminalizes any remuneration knowingly and willfully offered,paid,solicited,or received in exchange for medicare or medicaid patient referrals,and violation of the conspiracy statute.see united states anderson,d.in ruling on defendants objections during trial and denying their motions for a new trial,the district court concluded the jury instructions on the act correctly utilized the at least in part or one purpose standard rule d e of the federal rules of evidence contemplates statements made pursuant to a lawful common plan,which justified the court admission of over sixty documents under the rule two variances between the indictment and the evidence at trial did not prejudice defendants right to a fair trial and it correctly denied defendants request to provide judicial immunity to selected witnesses in light of this circuit case law and no indication the government engaged in a deliberate attempt to distort the process.see anderson,d at.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm.
background 
as a guide,the individuals discussed in this opinion can be broken down into three groups.first,osteopathic physicians robert and ronald lahue the lahues served as the principals in blue valley medical group blue valley,a specialized medical practice providing care to patients in nursing homes and other residential care facilities.see mcclatchey,at anderson,d at.second,baptist medical center baptist,a kansas city,missouri hospital,employed 
anderson,dan president,chief executive officer 
eckard,tom director of geriatric services 
flynn,dixie director of geriatric and gerontology services 
grim,sarah director of alternative care services 
grimes,deborah director of geriatric services 
keel,ronald vice president 
mcclatchey,dennis senior vice president,chief operating officer 
mcgrath,kevin vice president 
probst,gerard chief financial officer 
see mcclatchey,at anderson,d at.third,attorneys ruth lehr and mark thompson represented baptist at various times during the course of the alleged conspiracy.see mcclatchey,at anderson,d at.
in the early,the lahues were faculty members at university hospital,where they referred,admitted,and treated their patients.see anderson,d at.in,the lahues sought an increase in salary from university hospital in return for their continued patient referrals,in light of a competing offer from baptist for to per year for the same patient referrals.see id.at.university hospital declined their request.see id.
in,baptist entered into a contract contract with the lahues making them of gerontology services.mcclatchey,at see anderson,d at.by this time,the lahues had approximately patients in the kansas city metropolitan area and a correlatively large number of hospital referrals.see anderson,d at.probst testified the negotiations were backwards establishing the fee first and only then agreeing to the services the lahues would provide in,from his and anderson,mcclatchey,and keel perspective,were grounded in the hospital receiving patient referrals mcclatchey,at.probst described the resulting arrangement as unlike any he had seen in twenty years,and one with the highest request for an annual consulting fee that i had experienced or had been involved with.
the arrangement evolved into a consulting contract in between baptist and the lahues agreement.see anderson,d at.the agreement stated baptist desires to obtain the professional services of the lahues to assist it and its affiliate organizations in the development and maintenance of a comprehensive geriatrics program,including medical education of health care professionals,quality of care standards,and philosophical and promotional matters relating to the care of the aged.the lahues duties under the agreement included clinical instruction,training,and information to baptist professional staff,including the adult health care services clinic clinic,emergency services,social services,the medical staff in general,and the hospital administration instruction and training to the family practice residents and medical students consultation relating to the development of geriatrics programs and the expansion and utilization of baptist services for the aged and assisting in the completion of applications or reviewing patient care data for grants and studies relating to the medical care and institutional treatment of the aged.
pursuant to the contract and the agreement,baptist paid annually to each of the lahues from to,with the exception of when the lahues each received.see mcclatchey,at anderson,d at anderson directed those payments.see anderson,d at.when the payments began,blue valley referred massive numbers of patients to baptist,with a corresponding halt in referrals to university hospital.see anderson,d at.blue valley referred of baptist hospital admissions and over of the volume in its clinic,which made it baptist largest referral source.
grim,baptist director of alternative care services from to,testified that anderson made it clear to her the baptist blue valley relationship was a business deal in which baptist would pay money to blue valley in return for patient referrals and told her he was very protective of the baptist blue valley relationship,because,in her words,baptist was going to get patients.it was about occupancy.grimes,baptist director of geriatric services from approximately to,testified she was not aware of the contract,which purportedly made the lahues co directors of gerontology services.
in the summer of,the lahues approached anderson for help in managing their practice.see mcclatchey,at anderson,d at.anderson placed one of baptist employees,thomas eckard with blue valley soon thereafter,but kept him on the baptist payroll.see mcclatchey,at anderson,d at.although eckard official title was director of geriatric services for baptist,he worked at blue valley and effectively acted as blue valley manager.mcclatchey,at.
based on his discussions with anderson and mcclatchey,and others,eckard understood his primary job responsibility was to maintain baptist relationship with blue valley in order to ensure the continued flow of patients to the hospital.see anderson,d at.eckard remained on the baptist payroll and worked at blue valley in this capacity for approximately eight years.see id.
anderson and the baptist management team were aware blue valley never compensated baptist for eckard management services.drawing on his career in the health care industry,anderson testified he was not aware of any situation that identical to what we had with blue valley medical group and tom eckard.mcclatchey testified it was a relationship.
eckard described the services provided by the lahues pursuant to the contract as minimal to none.anderson,d at,quoting eckard testimony.indeed,with anderson approval,the relationship changed to a consulting agreement in,because the lahues did not perform their duties under the contract.id.at.however,this change did not significantly affect the amount of services the lahues provided to baptist.numerous witnesses testified that the lahues performed very few actual services in return for the substantial annual sum they were paid.id.at.
for example,eckard testified his observations over the eight and years of the valley relationship revealed the lahues did not provide the enumerated services in the agreements on a routine basis.specifically,eckard testified the lahues never operated the clinic only went on rounds with the clinic staff four or five times provided very little medical education and training to baptist personnel spent very minimal amounts of time meeting with baptist emergency room personnel on issues other than patient care only met with the emergency room nurses two or three times and trained baptist family practice residents just a few times.
grimes sent mcclatchey the following memorandum on march,
the blue valley contract,effective june,stipulated scheduled activities to be carried out through the year see enclosed.as of this date only one activity,quarterly staff meetings,has been implemented.i feel that it is in baptist medical center best interest to promptly implement the activities as outlined in the contract.
see anderson,d at.
flynn,baptist director of geriatric and gerontology services from to,had operational responsibility for the clinic and met weekly with anderson,who she characterized as very knowledgeable regarding the clinic and its operation.she testified the lahues did not provide her any administrative consulting regarding supervision,budgeting,policy and procedure development,or standard of care development for the clinic.further,all the clinical development work was performed by flynn and others the lahues only made recommendations as to the types of clinics to be created.
regarding the services listed in the agreement as those sought by baptist from the lahues,flynn testified the lahues did nothing to develop a comprehensive geriatrics program at baptist she did not observe them providing any medical education to health care professionals they had very limited contact with the physicians who treated their patients at baptist and did not contribute regarding quality of care issues.turning to the lahues enumerated duties in the agreement,flynn testified she neither observed nor knew of the lahues providing appropriate clinical instruction and training to the professional staff at baptist performing rounds with baptist personnel providing instruction or training to the baptist family practice residents developing geriatric programs or expansion and utilization of baptist services and developing grants or studies.most importantly,none of the baptist management team ever asked her whether the lahues provided the required services.she also testified she would not have budgeted any money for the services the clinic received from the lahues.in summary,she stated i felt more like i was working for them rather than them being available to me,and,had she known about the payments to the lahues per year,she stated i would have been alarmed.
in late,mcgrath learned from robert lahue that he and ronald lahue were not performing some of the services listed in the agreement.see mcclatchey,at.further,mcgrath received documentation the lahues provided consulting for only approximately two hours per week.see id.at.mcgrath discussed this information with anderson,mcclatchey and thompson,and expressed his concern the two hours per week did not justify the fees baptist was paying the lahues.see id.at.anderson,mcclatchey,and thompson neither disputed the accuracy of nor told mcgrath the lahues were performing other services not reflected in this documentation.
nonetheless,the payments from baptist to the lahues continued.during and,when it appeared the relationship with the lahues might soon end,anderson worked to develop a strategy to replace the blue valley patients but did nothing to replace the lahues consulting services.see anderson,d at.as stated by the district court in its ruling on the defendants motions anderson knew the payments he directed were more than fair market value for consulting services,that the services specified ultimately proved to be not entirely bona fide,and that the services specified were not sufficiently being performed.id.
the lahues and baptist benefitted greatly from their relationship.the lahues received over million from baptist as a result of the various contracts and eckard unreimbursed salary,and baptist received over million from medicare for services rendered to blue valley patients.
with eckard assistance,blue valley entered into similar arrangements or contracts with four other hospitals from to,joseph medical center paid blue valley over and received over million from medicare from to,deaconess medical center paid blue valley and received over million from medicare from to,bethany medical center paid blue valley over and received over million from medicare and from to,alexian brothers hospital paid blue valley and received over million from medicare.see anderson,d at.around,liberty hospital refused the lahues offer to enter a similar arrangement or contract.see id.at.

b.baptist executives anderson,mcclatchey and keel as well as attorneys lehr and thompson were each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the act with the lahues and six other hospitals,and one substantive count of violating the act.see anderson,d at.the lahues were each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the act with baptist and six other hospitals,seven substantive counts of violating the act,and a false claims conspiracy count in violation of.see id.robert lahue was also charged with threatening a witness in violation of.see id.
at the close of the government case,the district court granted the attorneys motions for acquittal ruled the government failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate that any defendant but the lahues participated in a conspiracy extending to the six other hospitals severed the false claims and witness tampering counts as improperly joined pursuant to.b and dismissed one of the substantive counts against the lahues on statute of limitations grounds.see id.at.
on completion of a trial,the jury convicted anderson on both charges convicted mcclatchey on both charges acquitted keel on the basis of his statute of limitations defense convicted ronald lahue of the conspiracy charge and four of the substantive charges of violating the act and convicted robert lahue of the conspiracy charge and six of the substantive charges of violating the act.see id.the district court granted mcclatchey motion for judgment of acquittal or,in the alternative,a new trial,and granted ronald lahue motion for acquittal as to the substantive count charging him with a violation of the act with regard to alexian brothers hospital.see id.at.
the district court sentenced anderson to months imprisonment,a fine,a special assessment,and three years supervised release sentenced ronald lahue to months imprisonment,a fine,a special assessment,and three years supervised release and sentenced robert lahue to seventy months imprisonment,a fine,restitution,a special assessment,and three years supervised release.
there are four issues on appeal.all three defendants raise the following two issues whether the district court adopted an improperly broad construction of the act,thereby erroneously instructing the jury under a one purpose test which effectively criminalized innocent conduct and whether the district court erred in admitting numerous statements under a joint venture theory,thereby violating.d e and defendants constitutional right to confrontation.anderson and robert lahue raise the third issue whether the district court erred in failing to grant a new trial based on prejudicial variances between the indictment and evidence at trial.finally,the lahues raise the fourth issue whether the district court abused its discretion by refusing to grant use immunity to twelve proposed defense witnesses who invoked the fifth amendment and refused to testify after the government identified them as unindicted in this case.
before the government filed its consolidated brief in this appeal,another panel of this court published its opinion resolving the government appeal of the district court judgment of acquittal and the alternative grant of a new trial for mcclatchey.see mcclatchey,at.this court reversed the district court judgment and order,and remanded with instructions to reinstate the jury verdict against mcclatchey.see id.at.this opinion is critical to our resolution of the first and third issues on appeal here,as we will detail in those sections of our discussion.see infra part,
iii.discussion 
jury instruction on and construction of the act 
defendants claim the applicable jury instructions on the for anderson and instruction for the incorrect and warrant a new trial.specifically,they challenge the at least in part or one purpose standard applied in these two instructions.in other words,they argue a defendant should not be convicted under the act when his offer,payment,solicitation,or receipt of remuneration was motivated merely in part to induce or in return for referrals rather,they suggest conviction is only appropriate when the motivation to induce or in return for referrals was the defendant primary purpose.
in their opening before the mcclatchey panel published its correctly noted this was an issue of first impression in this circuit,and argued for the rejection of the one purpose standard enunciated by the third circuit in united states greber,cir,cert.denied,d.defendants argued the one purpose standard was inappropriate because i t converts a criminal statute passed with a specific deter and punish abusive practices that threaten the integrity of federally funded health care prohibition of all arrangements,no matter how slight,that implicate patient referrals emphasis in original as a policy matter,it will destroy highly beneficial health care arrangements statutory construction principles require a narrower interpretation of the act the department of health and human services,charged by statute in to promulgate regulations defining conduct not subject to the act prohibitions,did not provide any authoritative interpretation of the act as it applied to relationships during the term of the charged conspiracy and it leads to unduly confusing jury instructions and courts should utilize the actual language of the act instead.finally,anticipating this court potential agreement with greber,defendants argued the one purpose standard renders the act unconstitutionally vague by vesting undue discretion in government officials to decide what is legal and what is illegal.
in mcclatchey,this court rejected mcclatchey same argument that the district court improperly instructed the jury it could convict him if remuneration was paid at least in part to induce patient referrals.mcclatchey,at,emphasis added.we held instruction accurately informed the jury of the applicable law,because a person who offers or pays remuneration to another person violates the act,so long as one purpose of the offer or payment is to induce medicare or medicaid patient referrals.id.at emphasis added.we recognized t he only three circuits to have decided this issue have all adopted the one purpose test.id.citing cases from the third,fifth,and ninth circuits.our decision to adopt the one purpose test rested upon our review of,and agreement with,the sound reasoning of the third circuit in greber.id.in this appeal,the government claims defendants challenges to instructions and are foreclosed by the stare decisis effect of mcclatchey,the act as construed by mcclatchey is not void for vagueness under due process,and,therefore,defendants are not entitled to a new trial based on the jury instructions.we agree with the government 
we are bound by the precedent of prior panels absent en banc reconsideration or a superceding contrary decision by the supreme court.in re smith,cir per curiam,cert.denied,d.in this case,defendants petition for initial hearing en banc on this issue was denied,and the supreme court has not decided a case on the act since our mcclatchey decision.see order filed august.accordingly,mcclatchey is controlling authority and we must conclude instruction accurately informed the jury of the law applicable to anderson.
similarly,we conclude the reasoning underlying the mcclatchey holding applies equally to remuneration solicited or received in return for medicare or medicaid patient referrals.see united states meyers,cir the precedent of prior panels which this court must follow includes not only the very narrow holdings of those prior cases,but also the reasoning underlying those holdings,particularly when such reasoning articulates a point of law.see also mcclatchey,at citing the ninth circuit opinion in united states kats,cir adopting the one purpose standard kats,at adopting the one purpose standard and affirming the defendant conviction for receiving kickbacks in exchange for referral of medicare payments.as a practical matter,if we held otherwise,we could illogically be faced with a case in which the is deemed to violate the act,but the is not.accordingly,we conclude instruction accurately informed the jury of the law applicable to the lahues.
we turn to defendants due process challenge to our one purpose interpretation of the act as unconstitutionally vague,which is the only unresolved issue after mcclatchey and our above conclusions.when reviewing a statute alleged to be vague,courts must indulge a presumption that it is constitutional,and the statute must be upheld unless the court is satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the legislature went beyond the confines of the constitution.united states day,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.under settled law,a broadly worded statute can be sufficiently clarified by a narrowing,authoritative interpretation to fend off a vagueness challenge.dirks sec.
defendants appear to argue this court one purpose interpretation of the act is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to them.as a preliminary matter,we hold their facial challenge is prohibited.see united states gaudreau,cir.facial challenges are permitted when the statute threaten s to chill constitutionally protected conduct and in some instances on review.id.at.in this case,defendants have not argued,nor do we perceive,that the act threatens to chill constitutionally protected conduct and this is not a situation.see id.at.accordingly,we must examine the act,as applied in this case,for vagueness in light of the conduct with which defendants are charged.see id.
t he doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.kolender lawson,d.the same facets of a statute usually raise concerns of both fair notice and adequate enforcement standards.hence the analysis of these two concerns tends to overlap.the supreme court,however,while recognizing the second concern as more important,continues to treat each as an element to be analyzed separately.gaudreau,at.we evaluate each element in turn 
regarding fair notice,o ne to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness.day,at addressing the defendant vagueness challenge to a federal criminal statute quotation marks and citations omitted.in this case,the evidence produced at trial clearly demonstrated defendants negotiated and entered consulting contracts in an attempt to camouflage an underlying agreement to exchange remuneration for patient referrals.therefore,defendants conduct is the very conduct contemplated by the act,and they can not successfully challenge the act for vagueness as to fair notice.see id.at.
specifically,the record shows the following about the baptist lahues relationship the lahues entered negotiations with baptist,because university hospital refused to acquiesce to their demand for an increased salary in return for continued patient referrals the contract and agreement established a fee of per year from baptist to the lahues baptist and the lahues resolved the fee before discussing an arrangement to justify it from anderson perspective,these negotiations were grounded in the hospital receiving patient referrals,and he told grim the baptist blue valley relationship was a business deal in which baptist would pay money to blue valley in return for patient referrals and once baptist began the payments,blue valley referred massive numbers of patients to baptist with a corresponding halt in referrals to university hospital.
further evidence substantiates this was a scheme.for instance,the record on whether the lahues fulfilled their commitments under the contract and agreement and anderson knowledge thereof reveals grimes was unaware of the contract,which purportedly made the lahues of gerontology services,and she documented the lahues failure to fulfill all but one of the activities required of them in the agreement as of march flynn testified the lahues did nothing required of them in the agreement from to,and intimated anderson knew this because he was very knowledgeable about the clinic operations in late,mcgrath met with anderson and discussed a robert lahue statement that he and ronald lahue were not performing some of the services listed in the agreement,and b documentation reflecting the lahues consulted at baptist for only two hours per week and eckard testified the lahues provided minimal to no services under the contract,and failed to provide the enumerated services in the agreement on a routine basis,if at all.
finally,we note the evidence supports the following conclusions although anderson controlled whether the payments would continue,he did not stop them when he learned the services were neither entirely bona fide nor performed by the lahues,and the payments were more than fair market value for consulting services and when it appeared the relationship might end in,anderson worked to develop a strategy to replace the blue valley patients,but did nothing to replace the lahues consulting services.we therefore conclude the evidence produced at trial demonstrated defendants knew their conduct,which was clearly a scheme,was prohibited by the act.accordingly,their vagueness challenge as to fair notice must fail.see day,at.
regarding the adequacy of enforcement standards,d ue process requires that legislation state reasonably clear guidelines for law enforcement officials,juries,and courts to follow in discharging their responsibility of identifying and evaluating allegedly illegal conduct.gaudreau,at.where the legislature fails to provide such minimal guidelines,a criminal statute may permit a standardless sweep that allows policemen,prosecutors,and juries to pursue their personal predilections.kolender,at.quoting smith goguen,d.a statute is unconstitutionally vague if its language and construction by the courts vest authority in law enforcement officers,prosecutors,and juries to assign their own subjective meaning to an element of the offense.see kolender,at.gaudreau,at 
even if defendants understood the illegality of a scheme under the act,they claim the act is unconstitutionally vague because it encourages arbitrary enforcement.defendants argue prosecutors and agency officials may choose to proceed criminally against virtually anyone in the health care community under the one purpose test,which they describe as having limitless reach.specifically,they claim the one purpose test 
makes virtually every arrangement between a hospital and a physician unlawful,because the hospital executive will always have patient referrals in mind,at least to some degree 
in other words,in the context at least,according to the district court,all conduct is illegal unless the department of health and human services has expressly,or through an advisory dispensation,made a specific act legal.
we disagree for two reasons.
first,the act explicitly prohibits any remuneration knowingly and willfully offered or paid to induce,or solicited or received in return for,medicare or medicaid patient referrals.see b.defendants fail to point to any language in the act or the one purpose test that vests authority in law enforcement officers,prosecutors,and juries to assign their own subjective meaning to an element of the offense.we do not perceive any such problem,and conclude a fair reading of the act provides reasonably clear guidelines for law enforcement officials,juries,and courts to evaluate and discern illegal conduct.see gaudreau,at.moreover,it is the application of the act to defendants by law enforcement officials we review in an as applied examination,defendants may not generalize beyond the conduct with which they are charged.see id.at.as noted above,the evidence produced at trial shows defendants clearly participated in a scheme.thus,enforcement of the act as applied to defendants was not arbitrary or discriminatory.see united states corrow,cir our analysis of the fairness issue infuses our disposition of the second vagueness concern,the potential for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement,cert.denied,d.
second,defendants argument ignores the actual instructions given in this case.the district court instructed the jury that 
anderson can not be convicted merely because he hoped or expected or believed that referrals may ensue from remuneration that was designed wholly for other purposes.likewise,mere oral encouragement to refer patients or the mere creation of an attractive place to which patients can be referred does not violate the law.
the district court further instructed the jury that 
robert lahue and ronald lahue can not be convicted merely because they received remuneration wholly in return for services and also decided to refer patients to the hospital.likewise,mere referral of patients because of oral encouragement or because of a belief that the place to which patients are to be referred is attractive does not violate the law.
this application of the act by the district court clearly allows business relationships between a hospital and physician where the motivation to enter into the relationship is for legal reasons entirely distinct from the collateral hope for or decision to make referrals.see mcclatchey,at.accordingly,contrary to defendants assertion,the act,as applied in this case,does not make all conduct illegal when a hospital executive or physician has referrals in mind.
in summary,under the controlling authority of mcclatchey and for the other reasons articulated herein,we conclude the district court correctly instructed the jury on the act.we hold the act,as applied to defendants,is not unconstitutionally vague.accordingly,defendants are not entitled to a new trial on this issue.
rule d e of the federal rules of evidence 
rule d e of the federal rules of evidence excludes from the hearsay prohibition statement s by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.d e.
in order for statements to be admissible under rule d e,the proponent of the evidence must establish,by a preponderance of the evidence,that a conspiracy existed the declarant and the defendant were both members of the conspiracy and the statements were made during the course of,and in furtherance of,the conspiracy.
united states williamson,cir.citations omitted,cert.denied,d.
defendants claim the district court erroneously admitted over sixty documents under rule d e.specifically,they challenge the district court conclusion that the word conspiracy includes a lawful common plan,and therefore argue documents related to such a plan are inadmissible.the government argues the district court correctly determined rule d e contemplates any common plan or enterprise,whether legal or illegal,in which the declarant and anderson or the lahues jointly participated.in the alternative,the government claims any error in admitting the documents under rule d e was harmless.
we conclude the admission of these disputed documents constitutes harmless error see united states jones,cir while we review evidentiary rulings by considering the record as a whole,deference to the trial judge is heightened when reviewing rulings on hearsay questions.this court applies a harmless error standard when reviewing trial courts rulings on hearsay objections resting solely on the federal rules of evidence.united states perez,cir en banc before considering whether remand is appropriate for an alleged rule d e error,this court should assume the challenged statements were inadmissible and then assess whether their admission was harmless error.in applying the harmless error standard,we must first resolve whether defendants objection to the documents rested solely on the federal rules of evidence.on appeal,defendants argue the admission of these documents violated their sixth amendment right to confrontation.however,the government claims defendants did not raise this confrontation clause argument to the district court,and waived it on appeal by failing to claim the district court committed plain error by not raising the issue sua sponte.
w here a confrontation clause objection is not explicitly made below we will not address the constitutional issue in the absence of a conclusion that it was plain error for the district court to fail to raise the constitutional issue sua sponte.united states perez,cir en banc.defendants do not respond to the government argument in their reply brief,and,as the government claims,they do not argue the district court committed plain error in failing to raise the constitutional issue sua sponte.for this reason,we deem the issue waived.see united states hardwell,holding issue waived when party failed to make any argument or cite any authority to support his assertion,reh g granted in part on other grounds,cir.accordingly,we are left to review only a hearsay objection,which we review under the nonconstitutional harmless error standard.see perez,at.
a nonconstitutional harmless error is one that does not have a substantial influence on the outcome of the trial nor does it leave one in grave doubt as to whether it had such effect.jones,at.a conclusion that an alleged error is harmless completes our review of a hearsay objection.see id.at.the background section of this opinion is supported by witness testimony and exhibits to which there is no objection on appeal in other words,it was constructed without any reference to the disputed documents.see supra part i.our review of the disputed documents,coupled with the overwhelming evidence of defendants guilt of the charged offenses revealed in the background section,convinces us that the admission of the disputed documents did not substantially influence the trial outcome and does not leave us in grave doubt as to whether they had such effect.see supra part.accordingly,even if the district court erroneously admitted the disputed documents,we hold their admission constituted harmless error.
finally,defendants claim the district court failed to require the government to identify the declarant of the hearsay statements being admitted into evidence over the objection of the defense.however,they fail to identify the specific statements the district court allegedly admitted in error,or even meet our requirement of providing citations to the record where these statements may be found.see fed.a a tenth cir.c,a.due to these failures,this court can not even attempt to assess the merits of their argument.the issue of the admissibility of this evidence is therefore waived on appeal.mcclatchey,at.
anderson and robert lahue claim certain variances between the indictments and case presented at trial substantially prejudiced their right to a fair trial.in its ruling on their motions for a new trial,the district court stated the court agrees with the defendants that there were two variances in this case.the first was the variance the court recognized at trial when it narrowed the count one conspiracy.the second was the variance with respect to the government failure of proof as to the lawyer defendants.anderson,d at.
more specifically,the other hospitals variance represents the government failure to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate that any defendant but the lahues participated in a conspiracy extending to the six hospitals other than baptist.see id.at.the attorney defendants variance reflects the acquittal of lehr and thompson at the close of the government case.see id.despite these variances,the district court denied the motions for a new trial.see id.at.on appeal,anderson claims these two variances entitle him to a new trial,while robert lahue argues the attorney defendants variance entitles him to a new trial 
whether a variance between an indictment and the case presented at trial is sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a new trial is a question of law a new trial is only necessary,however,if the variance substantially prejudiced the defendant right to a fair trial.mcclatchey,at.in mcclatchey,this court faced the same two variances at issue here,concluded neither variance substantially prejudiced mcclatchey right to a fair trial,and reversed the district court decision to grant mcclatchey motion for a new trial.see id.at.because mcclatchey,anderson,and the lahues were tried together,the government argues the law of the case doctrine forecloses our review of this issue and requires us to hold insufficient prejudice existed to require a new trial defendants claim the mcclatchey panel did not have a complete record and based its decision on factually erroneous conclusions,and,accordingly,we should find the law of the case doctrine does not control and revisit the issue.we hold the law of the case doctrine controls the other hospitals variance issue,and,in combination with the invited error doctrine,also controls the attorney defendants variance issue.
the law of the case doctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.united states alvarez,cir.quotation marks and citations omitted,cert.denied,d.furthermore,when a rule of law has been decided adversely to one or more codefendants,the law of the case doctrine precludes all other codefendants from relitigating the legal issue.united states aramony,cir,cert.denied,d.as a rule of practice and not a limit on a court power,
we will depart from the law of the case doctrine in three exceptionally narrow circumstances 
when the evidence in a subsequent trial is substantially different 
when controlling authority has subsequently made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such issues or 
when the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.
alvarez,at.
as to the other hospitals variance,anderson does not argue any of these three exceptions apply.in addition,he claims mcclatchey was in all relevant respects identically situated to anderson.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of anderson motion for a new trial on the basis of the other hospitals variance in light of mcclatchey and the law of the case doctrine.see mcclatchey,at holding any variance caused by the narrowing of the conspiracy charge did not substantially prejudice mcclatchey.
as previously noted,defendants undertake the formidable task of attempting to convince us the mcclatchey decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice as to the attorney defendants variance.alvarez,at.specifically,they claim the panel partly based its decision that the attorney variance did not prejudice mcclatchey on the erroneous premise that the jury was not informed that the district court had acquitted the attorney defendants and therefore could not conclude he must have been guilty because the court had not acquitted him too quoting mcclatchey,at.however,they do not cite any case law in which such an argument prevailed.see alvarez,at o ur own research indicates that while courts may often pay lip service to the clearly injustice exception,they rarely,if ever,invoke it.
we acknowledge defense counsel informed the jury of the attorney defendants acquittal during closing arguments,but this does not make the mcclatchey decision either clearly erroneous or even remotely work a manifest injustice for the following reasons.although defendants call this a crucial point,they acknowledge it was only one of several reasons why the mcclatchey panel held mcclatchey right to a fair trial had not been substantially prejudiced due to this variance.see mcclatchey,at.here,defendants raise the same claims as did mcclatchey,but do not challenge the mcclatchey panel other reasoning.therefore,defendants themselves limit our review to this one claim of error regarding the jury knowledge of the attorney defendants acquittal.
focusing on this sole error,we conclude the jury awareness of the district court acquittal of the attorney defendants did not substantially prejudice their right to a fair trial in light of the invited error doctrine.the invited error doctrine prevents a party from inducing action by a court and later seeking reversal on the ground that the requested action was in error.united states edward,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.the mcclatchey panel correctly determined the district court did not inform the jury of the attorney defendants acquittal in its jury instructions.see mcclatchey,at.instead,the jury was so informed by defendants counsel during their closing arguments as a result of the following events.
toward the end of its closing argument,the government stated the evidence in this case has been that the attorneys were well aware that this was a paying for patients deal and worked to develop agreements that covered up that fact.on completion of the government argument,the district court recessed the proceedings and heard from anderson counsel about this statement.counsel argued this statement opened the door to allow defense counsel to present to the jury the acquittal of the attorney defendants.the district court agreed and stated you may tell the jury that the two lawyer defendants were acquitted by order of the court.defendants counsel each took advantage of this ruling.
in his closing argument,anderson counsel claimed the acquittal of the attorney defendants created reasonable doubt as to his client guilt 
in this case the quality of the government prosecution creates reasonable doubt.and that what the jury system is set out to do is to correct these abuses.
for instance,the last argument that was made to you by the government in this case had to do with the attorneys.and she said that they were knowing participants in participants that this was a scheme to pay sic patients and that they drafted sham agreements.
well,folks,these two lawyers have been acquitted by the court.they were acquitted here because the court found that there was no evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that these lawyers had done anything.and yet the government stood up here in argument,and despite the fact they had been acquitted,and told you that those lawyers had,in fact,been knowing participants in crime and that just not right.
that in itself should create a reasonable doubt as to all the other defendants in this case,particularly the baptist defendants.
now the attorneys have been acquitted in this case.if they not guilty and anderson relied upon what they said,does does that affect anderson specific intent in the case he can not have the specific intent to violate the law if those lawyers,who are not guilty,advise him appropriately,which they did.
robert lahue counsel similarly argued 
now,one other thing that treadway spoke about were some of the defenses that we have presented to you,and that is the defense of good faith.and all of the witnesses,all of the evidence is clear,that all of the defendants relied on the attorneys who were acquitted in this case and relied on attorneys for other hospitals to process and review and prepare these agreements to make them legal and appropriate.the evidence is uncontroverted about that.nobody ever never had an attorney come in here and said they took my agreement and changed it,took it out and changed it or modified it.you never had that.
these attorneys were acquitted.and the testimony of all the witnesses the hospital witnesses who employed the attorneys and witnesses concerning the doctors activities who said the doctors knew about and relied on the advice of the attorneys that are now acquitted and found not guilty.and so there is good faith here,no doubt about it.
obviously,neither counsel believed their statements would prejudice defendants right to a fair trial.in other words,they did not believe the jury would interpret the district court acquittal of the attorney defendants,along with the continued prosecution of anderson and robert lahue,as a signal the court believed defendants were guilty.indeed,counsel affirmatively sought the opportunity to argue about the acquittal of the attorney defendants,rather than object to the government argument and have it stricken along with an instruction from the court for the jury to disregard the argument.we conclude the invited error doctrine applies and no prejudice was suffered,because defendants argument on appeal is a complete reversal from the position they sought to and did assert during closing argument.see john zink zink,cir holding the invited error doctrine precluded review of appellants argument on appeal that was directly contradictory to its position in the district court.
finally,defendants fail to explain,as they must in order to prevail,how the application in this appeal of the ruling in mcclatchey would work a manifest injustice.see alvarez,at.indeed,as discussed in mcclatchey,the district court told the jury that the charges against the attorney defendants have been removed from your consideration and are no longer before you for decision,and instructed them do not concern yourself with these developments and do not speculate about them.see mcclatchey,at.t his court presumes that the jury followed the district court instructions and therefore did not speculate as to the reason why the charges against the attorney defendants had been removed from its consideration.id.citing united states ailsworth,cir,cert.denied,d as a result,we do not perceive a manifest injustice resulting from the application of the mcclatchey ruling on the identical attorney defendants variance issue raised in this appeal.
accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of defendants motion for a new trial on the basis of the attorney defendants variance in light of mcclatchey and the law of the case and invited error doctrines.see id.at e ven if the district court acquittal of the attorney defendants created a variance between the allegations in the indictment and the case presented at trial,this court is unconvinced that such a variance substantially prejudiced mcclatchey.
use immunity 
in a argument,the lahues claim the district court abused its discretion by refusing to grant use immunity to twelve proposed defense witnesses who invoked the fifth amendment and refused to testify at trial.first,the lahues argue the government is guilty of prosecutorial misconduct,because it allegedly engaged in a plan to unduly distort the process by identifying these twelve individuals as unindicted leading them to believe,in the pretrial setting,they faced potential criminal prosecution,which caused them to invoke the fifth amendment and refuse to testify claiming,near the end of the trial,the government did not perceive them as criminally culpable and confirming,prior to sentencing in this case,it would not subject any of the unindicted to criminal charges.second,the lahues argue this prosecutorial misconduct authorized the district court to grant these twelve witnesses use immunity,and its refusal to do so constitutes an abuse of discretion.
in response,the government claims it appropriately listed these individuals as unindicted for rule d e purposes.it argues t he defendants offer no facts of discriminatory use of immunity by the government to gain a tactical advantage,and offer no facts that the government forced any witness to invoke the fifth amendmen
