plaintiff james daugherty appeals from the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of his former employer,defendant sajar plastics,on his claims under the americans with disabilities act ada,the ohio civil rights act ocra,ohio,and the family and medical leave act fmla,et.for the reasons stated below,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
in july,james daugherty began working for sajar plastics,sajar as a maintenance technician.sajar manufactures plastic injection molding components for use in the medical and banking industries.according to the job description issued by sajar,the general function of the maintenance technician position is to maintain buildings and equipment in satisfactory condition and make repair s as necessary.the maintenance technician performs a variety of,hydraulics,pneumatics,welding,pipe fitting,troubleshoots and repairs all plant equipment,performs repairs on manufacturing facilities and office areas including plumbing,light fixtures,electrical,mechanical,in addition to the use of hand and power tools,the position requires the operation of dangerous machinery such as bandsaws,milling machines,power tools,forklift trucks,welders,drill presses,and overhead cranes.the physical demands of the job require medium to heavy strength level,frequent standing and walking,hours a day,hours at a time,and frequent stooping,bending and kneeling,and climbing,occasional work in confined,tight or awkward spaces.
daugherty experienced a back injury sometime in the that quieted but then flared up again in and,while he was working at sajar.daugherty physician,peter franklin,prescribed increasing doses of oxycontin and duragesic.when daugherty first began to take the medication,he experienced disorientation and dizziness.he received a reprieve from dangerous electrical work,during which time he developed a tolerance for the medication and no longer experienced these side effects.while at sajar,daugherty suffered from unpredictable episodes of increased back pain that temporarily rendered him unable to perform his job duties.he requested and always was granted intermittent fmla leave,ranging from approximately two days to two weeks.
daugherty alleges that his supervisors at sajar expressed frustration about his intermittent leave time and unexpected absences related to his back problem.according to daugherty,human resources director ronald alexander purportedly told him in october that he faced the choice of either taking disability retirement or losing his job.
in november,daugherty requested and received an fmla leave of more significant duration one to two months.contemporaneously with his leave request,daugherty presented sajar with a note from franklin indicating that he would be able to return to work approximately two months later,on january.daugherty alleges,however,that before taking his leave,alexander warned him that if i took that fmla for that period of time,there would not be a job waiting for me,when i returned.alexander disputes this claim.
shortly after daugherty took this fmla leave,sajar experienced a layoff.along with positions in other departments,sajar needed to lay off one maintenance worker.daugherty had the least seniority of the maintenance technicians,but because he was on fmla leave,he was not laid off immediately.at the end of december,however,human resources manager ranae cozzone notified daugherty that he would be placed on layoff status effective january,the day he was scheduled to return from leave.he was informed by management that he had been selected for layoff because he was lowest in seniority.daugherty neither disputes that the layoff was legitimate nor that he was the least senior maintenance technician.
in february,sajar experienced an upturn in business and thus needed to hire another maintenance technician as soon as possible because of the increased workload.alexander directed cozzone to recall daugherty.alexander made daugherty return to work contingent upon a physical examination by richard altemus,a physician used by sajar on a routine referral basis to perform drug screenings and and examinations on february,altemus examined plaintiff and,in a letter to cozzone written on that same day,he opined 
in summary,daugherty appeared fit with no apparent problems pertinent to his joints or back.he had no problems with the rigors of the physical examination.however,there were current medication patches affixed to his back and several residual stains of previous patches.the patient was forthcoming with his admission of daily oxycontin oral medication and daily duragesic fentanyl transdermal medications.both of these medications are class ii narcotics.
in my opinion,daugherty would be able to successfully complete the duties commensurate with the job description provided me.but,because of the significant medication taken on a daily basis both in type and strength,i do not feel comfortable in approving this man reemployment at this time.the analgesics may mask the symptoms of a reinjury thus exacerbating his current disease or,more importantly,the amount of medication may cause an impairment of perception or judgment which might lead to an injury to himself or others.
in his deposition,altemus further explained that he based his recommendation on the potential side effects of daugherty medications,his physical impairment,and sajar policy applicable to narcotics as well as illegal drugs.altemus testified that he ascertained the risks posed by daugherty medications by considering dosage levels,documentation in the physicians desk reference pdr,the possible interaction between the oxycontin and duragesic patches,and daugherty job description.according to altemus,based upon daugherty dosage levels,the pdr cautioned that either narcotic could impair his ability to operate heavy machinery,and further stated that individuals who combine oxycontin and other narcotics could experience other dangerous side effects,such as profound sedation or coma.altemus also opined that when oxycontin is taken with other opiates,the individual may demonstrate syncope or a sudden loss of blood pressure and you drop.considering these factors,altemus concluded that plaintiff was physically unable to perform those duties consistent with his job description because of excessive medication that may mask symptoms and may impair judgment.
alexander and cozzone decided that daugherty medications placed sajar at risk of liability for injury to daugherty or his coworkers.cozzone nonetheless called daugherty and advised him that if he could provide documentation regarding a reduction in his medications,the company would take a look at it.approximately two weeks later,daugherty supplied sajar with a brief note from franklin stating,to whom it may concern daugherty is stable on long term opoid sic management for chronic pain and is able to do the same work he has been doing on this medication in recent years.the note neither addressed the amount of medication daugherty was taking nor indicated that the dosage had been reduced.
on march,daugherty called cozzone and informed her that his physician had reduced his medication dosages.when cozzone asked him to submit written confirmation from franklin,daugherty refrained from doing so upon the advice of his attorney.on march,cozzone sent a letter to daugherty advising him that sajar needed a note from his physician on or before april,confirming the reduction in his medication otherwise,we will assume that you have no interest in returning to sajar plastics and you will not be eligible for any immediate opens sic that may occur.no such note was forthcoming from plaintiff or his physician.consequently,in a letter dated april,alexander informed daugherty that sajar had filled a maintenance position,which had opened between april and april,with another technician 
as of this date,we still have not seen a note from your physician.however,on or about april,you called our offices and left a voice mail message with ranae cozzone and requested her to call your doctor direct for the information which we asked you to obtain.
please understand,this office has requested twice,that you provide us with specific information relating to your medical condition.we are not going to gather this information for you.
as i t stands currently,this office has no information which changes your employment status.in fact,you were to supply this office with the above mentioned information on or before april.here it is april,and you still have not provided anything to support your claim that you are able to return to work.since our request to you for information from your doctor,an opening has occurred during the period of april,and april.since you did not respond to our request in a timely fashion,we filled the position.if you want to be available for the next opening,i would suggest you supply this office with the requested information.
daugherty never supplied the requested information.in accordance with the terms of sajar employee handbook,because daugherty did not return to work within six months of being placed on layoff status,his employment was terminated.on may,daugherty filed a charge of discrimination with the ohio civil rights commission and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.the eeoc issued a right to sue letter to daugherty dated september.
on november,daugherty filed a complaint in ohio state court,alleging disability discrimination under the ada and ocra and retaliation under the fmla.the case was removed to federal district court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.sajar thereafter moved for summary judgment on all counts pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.
on november,the district court issued an opinion and order granting sajar motion and dismissing all claims.daugherty sajar plastics,cv,wl.the district court concluded that daugherty failed to adduce sufficient proof that he was either disabled or regarded as disabled by sajar within the meaning of the comparable provisions of the ada and ocra and,therefore,dismissed the state and federal disability discrimination claims.regarding daugherty claim of retaliatory discharge under the fmla,the district court assume d plaintiff has presented enough evidence to show an issue of fact as to whether a prima facie case has been established,but concluded that sajar asserted legitimate reasons for its adverse decisions,which daugherty then failed to show were pretextual in nature.daugherty,wl at.the court dismissed daugherty claim under the fmla and entered judgment in favor of sajar on all claims.daugherty now timely appeals.

daugherty first challenges the summary judgment entered against him on his disability discrimination claims under the ada and the ocra.in light of the fact that ohio disability discrimination law parallels the ada in all relevant respects,we apply the same analytical framework,using cases and regulations interpreting the ada as guidance in our interpretation of the ocra.wysong dow chemical,cir city of columbus civil serv.comm mcglone,ohio.our analysis of daugherty ada claim also resolves his state law discrimination claim.hedrick western reserve care,cir.
the ada prohibits discrimination by a covered entity against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures,the hiring,advancement,or discharge of employees,employee compensation job training,and other terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.a a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ada requires that a plaintiff show he or she is disabled otherwise qualified for the position,with or without reasonable accommodation suffered an adverse employment decision the employer knew or had reason to know of the plaintiff disability and the position remained open while the employer sought other applicants or the disabled individual was replaced.macy hopkins county sch.bd.of,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
where a plaintiff,like daugherty,seeks to establish a prima facie case by means of circumstantial evidence,we apply the framework of mcdonnell douglas green,d.id.at.the plaintiff burden at the summary judgment stage is merely to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action under circumstances which give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.id.there are various ways by which plaintiffs may establish a prima facie case,and not rigid requirements that all plaintiffs with similar claims must meet regardless of context.id.at emphasis omitted.
it is well settled that not every physical or mental impairment constitutes a disability under the specific parameters of the ada.toyota motor,williams,d bryson regis,cir.the ada defines a disability as a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such an individual b a record of such impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment.a c.see also ohio a.if an employee condition does not meet one of these categories even if he was terminated because of some medical condition,he is not disabled within the meaning of the act.the ada is not a general protection for medically afflicted persons.nese julian nordic constr,cir.
the district court in the present case found that daugherty failed to demonstrate adequately that he suffers from a substantially limiting,impairment,as defined by a.on appeal,daugherty does not further pursue this issue and thus waives his claim that sajar discriminated against him on the basis of an actual disability.harris bornhorst,cir.our review is therefore confined to daugherty contention that sajar illegally regarded him as disabled,under the alternative definition of disability set forth in c.
the prong of the ada protects employees who are perfectly able to perform a job,but are rejected because of the myths,fears and stereotypes associated with disabilities.gruener ohio cas.ins,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.individuals may be regarded as disabled when an employer mistakenly believes that an employee has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities,or an employer mistakenly believes that an actual,nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more of an employee major life activities.id.quoting sutton united air lines,d.in either case,it is necessary to show that the employer entertains misperceptions about the employee.id.
daugherty alleges that sajar mistakenly regarded him as substantially limited in the major life activity of working we have acknowledged that proving such a claim takes a plaintiff to the farthest reaches of the ada and is a question imbedded almost entirely in the employer subjective state of mind.ross campbell soup,cir.in addition to the unique hurdles posed by the psychological component of a claim when the major life activity at issue is working,the statutory phrase substantially limits takes on special meaning in this context and imposes a stringent standard,requiring proof that the employer regarded the employee as significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training,skills and abilities.the inability to perform a single,particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.swanson of cincinnati,cir quoting j i.see also sutton,at.citing j i and noting that one must be precluded from more than one job,a specialized job,or a particular job of choice.consequently,
proving the case becomes extraordinarily difficult.not only must a plaintiff demonstrate that an employer thought he was disabled,he must also show that the employer thought that his disability would prevent him from performing a broad class of jobs.as it is safe to assume employers do not regularly consider the panoply of other jobs their employees could perform,and certainly do not often create direct evidence of such considerations,the plaintiff task becomes even more difficult.yet the drafters of the ada and its subsequent interpretive regulations clearly intended that plaintiffs who are mistakenly regarded as being unable to work have a cause of action under the statute.whether the employee is such a plaintiff lies in the question of whether the employer regarded him as substantially limited from performing a broad class of jobs.
daugherty submits that in the context of summary judgment,he has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether sajar misperceived his back condition and related medication use as significantly restricting his ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs.he argues that,despite franklin medical opinion that he would be fit to return to work without restrictions on or about january,sajar viewed him as unable to work,as evidenced primarily by altemus flawed medical evaluation purportedly recommending that daugherty should not perform any job that entailed the use of heavy machinery.daugherty,however,misconstrues the substance of altemus evaluation,and we are not persuaded that the evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact in terms of the relevant ross inquiry.
altemus did not,as daugherty claims,express the viewpoint that daugherty was significantly restricted in his ability to perform a broad range of jobs.rather,altemus concluded,based upon plaintiff daily dosage of oxycontin and fentanyl and the possible dangerous side effects of these drugs cited in the pdr,that there was a high risk of impairment and ensuant injury while operating the dangerous machinery that was an integral function of sajar maintenance technician position.in his february,letter to sajar,altemus opined that daugherty would be able to successfully complete the duties commensurate with the job description provided me.but,because of the significant medication taken on a daily basis both in type and strength,i do not feel comfortable in approving this man reemployment at this time.emphasis added.the letter indicates that,based upon his concerns about the risk of impairment that daugherty medication levels posed with respect to operating dangerous machinery,altemus viewed plaintiff as being unfit to perform the essential functions of one particular technician at sajar.altemus deposition testimony likewise reflects that he did not consider daugherty to be broadly unsuited for other positions beyond that of maintenance technician for sajar 
q.so would it be accurate to say that you concluded that somebody who was taking this level of medications would,per se,be unable to perform this particular job 
no,that not the gist of this at all.the gist is that he could do the job however there is no way to tell what the next day would be.he does not have to give you all or nothing.you do know when your perception is going to be.
q.so would it be safe to say that anybody who is taking these medications,you would exclude from this job because of that 
absolutely.and it would even have to be these medications.
emphasis added.in response to questions from plaintiff counsel,altemus further explained 
q.what aspect of the job did you feel prevented him from being able to safely perform it 
a.the fact that his job description says that he has to work with power tools,milling machines,forklift truck s,bandsaws,welders,drill press,and overhead cranes.any one of those can kill you.
q.so eliminating those would have made it acceptable for him to continue in the job 
i do know.it would depend on what the description would be of his job,if you eliminated all those.
as this testimony makes clear,altemus assessed daugherty medical condition and capabilities only within the boundaries of the job description pertaining to sajar maintenance technician position.
independent of altemus medical evaluation,which does not substantiate daugherty contention that the doctor found him to be substantially limited in the major life activity of working,there is no evidence that sajar decisionmakers who interacted directly with,alexander and that he was unable to undertake a broad class or range of jobs due to his back condition.from his own perspective,alexander,who had the ultimate authority to terminate plaintiff employment,testified that t he way i interpreted altemus opinion was the medication he was taking was making him unsuitable for employment,doing and performing the function of his job.emphasis added.both alexander and cozzone informed daugherty that if his medication levels were reduced or the medication eliminated completely,sajar would consider recalling him for the next available maintenance technician position.they therefore asked for documentation from daugherty physician confirming either a reduction in dosage or elimination of these narcotics altogether,but daugherty failed to comply with sajar request,despite indicating in his march,statement to cozzone that franklin had already reduced the doses.
in sum,the evidence shows,at most,that sajar believed that daugherty back condition and current medication levels precluded him from performing the dangerous machinery functions required of the particular job of maintenance technician at sajar,but did not regard him as unable to perform a broad class or range of jobs in the maintenance field or other categories of employment.such evidence does not suffice to establish a prima facie discrimination claim under the ada and ocra that implicates the major life activity of working.sutton,at.see also schuler supervalu,cir affirming dismissal of ada claim brought by prospective employee with epilepsy where evidence showed that defendant employer determined only that the plaintiff is precluded from performing the functions necessary to a specific job in its warehouse,but there was no evidence to suggest that the defendant viewed the plaintiff as unable to perform other manual labor positions or even other warehouse positions.eeoc hunt,cir affirming summary judgment as to claim under the ada where the defendant employer refused to hire certain applicants for truck driving positions because they used a category of medications known to have side effects that might impair driving ability,and the record only shows that the defendant saw the applicants as unfit to perform a job for which they were seeking applicants,driving,and not a class or broad range of other truck driving jobs.
we therefore affirm the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of sajar with regard to daugherty state and federal disability discrimination claims,in light of daugherty failure to demonstrate adequately that sajar regarded him as disabled from the major life activity of working.
in his second assignment of error,daugherty argues that the district court erred in dismissing his fmla retaliation claim.we agree.
under the fmla,a qualifying employee is entitled to up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave each year if,inter alia,the employee has a serious health condition that makes the employee unable t
