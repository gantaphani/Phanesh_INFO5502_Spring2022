petitioners crockett colleries,and the hartford accident and indemnity company hereafter crockett appeal the decision of the benefits review board of the united states department of labor brb affirming an award of black lung benefits to respondent james barrett.the brb found that crockett petition for review failed to comply with the requirements set forth in b.it therefore refused to review the merits of crockett petition and summarily affirmed the decision of the administrative law judge alj.on appeal,crockett seeks an order requiring the brb to review the alj decision or,in the alternative,an order reversing the award of benefits.we conclude that the brb erred in finding that crockett petition was insufficient to trigger review.we nevertheless affirm the award of benefits because the alj correctly applied the law and his factual findings were supported by substantial evidence.
james barrett,who worked in a coal mine for years,suffers from a variety of respiratory ailments.in,he filed an application for benefits under the black lung benefits act,et.that first application was denied.he stopped working in the coal mines in.he filed a second application for black lung benefits in.the office of workers compensation programs preliminarily awarded benefits.at crockett request,the department of labor referred the matter to an alj for a formal hearing.the alj held a hearing on january,and issued an order denying barrett application for black lung benefits on april.
in denying the application,the alj relied heavily on dahhan report.dahhan had concluded that there was insufficient objective data to justify the diagnosis of coal workers pneumoconiosis.at.twelve of thirteen readings of were negative for pneumoconiosis.dahhan opined that barrett respiratory problems resulted not from coal dust exposure but from cigarette smoking.dahhan also concluded that barrett was not totally disabled.the alj rejected the conflicting opinion of glen baker,who had concluded that barrett had pneumoconiosis due to coal dust exposure and was totally disabled as a result.baker stated that barrett problems could all be due to cigarette smoking or could be due to a combination of cigarette smoking and coal dust exposure.he noted that coal dust exposure can cause the types of problems suffered by barrett.he also stated that barrett significant history of exposure to coal dust probably contributes to some extent in an undefineable proportion to his pulmonary complaints.at.
barrett wrote a letter to the brb requesting a review of the alj decision and order.the brb construed the letter as a pro se appeal.on may,the brb issued a decision vacating the alj order and remanding the case for additional findings.on remand,in a decision and order issued november,the alj found that barrett was,in fact,entitled to black lung benefits.this time,in reliance on baker well reasoned and well documented opinion,the alj concluded that barrett had legal pneumoconiosis due to coal mine employment and was totally disabled as a result.
crockett filed a petition for review with the brb.the brb,however,held that it had no basis on which to review the alj decision because crockett had failed to comply with the federal regulation set forth in b requiring crockett to brief with specificity the alleged errors in the alj decision.the brb therefore affirmed the alj decision without reaching the merits of crockett petition for review.
crockett has now appealed the brb order,arguing that the brb erred in finding that crockett petition was insufficient to trigger review.crockett seeks an order requiring the brb to review the alj award of benefits or,in the alternative,an order reversing the award of benefits.barrett and the director of the office of workers compensation programs of the department of labor maintain that the brb properly refused to review the merits of the case.in the alternative,they argue that we should affirm the alj decision because it was supported by substantial evidence.
in reviewing an alj decision and order,the brb is authorized to hear and determine appeals raising a substantial question of law or fact.b.the alj findings of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.id.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.ramey kentland elkhorn coal,cir internal quotation omitted.
in reviewing a decision of the brb,our task is limited to correcting errors of law and ensuring that the board adhered to the substantial evidence standard in its review of the alj factual findings.creek coal,bates,cir.the brb legal conclusions are reviewed de novo.id.
crockett first challenges the brb determination that crockett petition for review failed to comply with the requirements set forth in b.that regulation provides,in pertinent part 
each petition for review shall be accompanied by a supporting brief,memorandum of law or other statement which specifically states the issues to be considered by the board presents,with appropriate headings,an argument with respect to each issue presented with references to transcripts,pieces of evidence and other parts of the record to which the petitioner wishes the board to refer a short conclusion stating the precise result the petitioner seeks on each issue and any authorities upon which the petition relies to support such proposed result.
in sarf director,owcp,wl,the brb held that a party challenging an alj decision must do more than merely recite evidence favorable to his case he must also say why the alj decision was wrong.
the brb found that crockett had failed to adequately brief with specificity the errors allegedly made by the alj.it held as follows 
in challenging the above findings,employer contends generally that the evidence of record is not sufficient to establish entitlement to benefits.however,the board is not authorized to undertake a de novo adjudication of the claim.to do so would upset the carefully allocated division of authority between the administrative law judge as,and the board as a reviewing tribunal.see a sarf director,owcp,wl,blr,cox benefits review board,blr,cir fish director,owcp,blr.as we have emphasized previously,the board circumscribed scope of review requires that a party challenging the decision and order below address that decision and order with specificity and demonstrate that substantial evidence does not support the result reached or that the decision and order is contrary to law.see b sarf,blr at cox,at,blr at slinker peabody coal,blr,fish,blr at.a petitioner who fails to comply with the requisite regulations provides the board with no basis to reach the merits of an appeal.id.
in this case,the employer generally asserts that the administrative law judge erred in the weight he accorded baker opinion.employer brief at.employer,however,fails to adequately brief with specificity any error made by the administrative law judge in his evaluation of the evidence or in his application of the law pursuant to part.thus,as employer has failed to adequately raise or brief any issues arising from the administrative law judge award of benefits,the board has no basis upon which to review the decision.thus,we decline to review the decision and order of the administrative law judge and we affirm the administrative law judge award of benefits.see sarf,blr at.

on appeal,crockett maintains that the arguments presented in its petition for review were no less concise than the arguments presented by barrett in his earlier appeal.according to crockett,the brb unfairly applied different standards of review to the two petitions.any difference in treatment by the brb,however,is attributable solely to the fact that crockett was represented by counsel and barrett was not.federal regulations provide that when a party is unrepresented by counsel,the requirements set forth in b may be waived by the brb.see e when a party appears pro se the board may,in its discretion,waive formal compliance with the requirements of this section and may,depending upon the particular circumstances,prescribe an alternate method of furn
