lisa cox appeals the district court order upholding the social security commissioner denial of her application for disability insurance benefits.cox argues that as a result of procedural errors and ambiguous medical evidence,the administrative law judge alj determination that she was not disabled was not premised on substantial evidence.we affirm.
cox contends that she has been qualified for disability benefits since december,because anxiety,mental retardation,and a respiratory impairment prevent her from working.at the time of the alj decision,cox was years old.according to her social security administration disability form and testimony,she reported having received a tenth grade education and having attended special education classes.she attempted to receive a ged,but was unsuccessful.she also asserted that she had worked full time,on and off,as a certified nurse aide cna from to,although she acknowledges that she never received special job training or attended a trade or vocational school,and had reported earnings averaging approximately a year during that period.
cox has had a chronically tumultuous home life.she testified that she was molested by her father from the age of nine to sixteen,and as a result has difficulty concentrating,handling stress,and dealing with people.she has three children,and she still lives with and takes care of her daughter,who suffers from severe mental impairments.she informed a psychiatrist that she had been married three times to abusive men,that she receives no child support from her children father,and that she has had to care for various other family members.
in april,angela mckinness,an advanced practice nurse,diagnosed cox with insomnia and generalized anxiety disorder.nurse mckinness prescribed medication to help cox with these issues.on may,mary ellen ziolko performed a consultative psychological evaluation.ziolko described cox affect and mood as depressed and anxious.an administration of the wechsler adult intelligence scale indicated that cox had full scale,verbal,and performance iq scores in the mid to.these results were considered valid.ziolko summary report and diagnosis,however,made facially conflicting statements concerning cox status.although she reported that cox intellectual functioning falls in the mild retardation range she also indicated in her evaluation of adaptive functioning that there did not appear to be significant limitations in two or more areas of adaptive behavior.adaptive behavior appeared more consistent with borderline intellectual functioning than mental retardation.
cox was subsequently treated by mohammed for her depression,anxiety,and insomnia.periodically adjusted cox medication in response to her needs.at various points,noted that the treatment appeared to be yielding positive results,but cox tumultuous family life and manipulative daughter often resulted in the return of depressive episodes.the record indicates that diagnosed cox with mild depression and dependent personality traits.cox testified that she suffers from anxiety attacks two to three times a week,does not have her anxiety and depression completely under control even with medication,and would cry if criticized in a work environment.she stated that she is routinely subject to crying spells and constantly thinks of her experience as a victim of molestation.nevertheless,she acknowledged that she was not plagued by most of these problems when she worked as a cna at a nursing home and her children were younger.she left that job in order to take care of her children.
after reviewing the entirety of the record,the alj found that although cox iq scores were within the range of mild mental retardation,because of both her ability to perform a wide variety of daily activities and ziolko conclusion that her adaptive functioning was more consistent with borderline intellectual functioning,cox did not have an impairment listed in,or medically equal to,those set forth in the federal regulations furthermore,the alj found that her subjective complaints were not borne out by the record and were not fully credible.after the alj determined cox residual functional capacity rfc,he posed hypotheticals to the vocational expert ve consistent with cox rfc.the ve indicated that an individual with cox rfc who can perform functionally light work could work as a bench assembler or small products assembler.accordingly,the alj concluded that cox lacked a cognizable disability as defined in the social security act.
on appeal,cox contends that the alj erred by not seeking clarification from ziolko,whose report contradicted itself by indicating that cox had mild retardation while simultaneously concluding that she had borderline intellectual functioning inconsistent with mild retardation failing to recontact and nurse mckinness to determine how they believed her depression and anxiety affect her ability to work and asking the vocational expert hypothetical questions that did not include all of the relevant details of cox residual functional capacity,thereby rendering the answers unreliable.
it is not the role of this court to reweigh the evidence presented to the alj or to try the issue in this case de novo.loving dep t of health human,cir.instead,we review the alj decision to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.id.substantial evidence is less than a preponderance,but enough that a reasonable mind might accept it as adequate to support a decision.cox apfel,cir.our review extends beyond examining the record to find substantial evidence in support of the alj decision we also consider evidence in the record that fairly detracts from that decision.id.at.if,after conducting this review,we find that it is possible to draw two inconsistent positions from the evidence and one of those positions represents the secretary findings,we must affirm the decision of the secretary.siemers shalala,cir alteration in original quoting robinson sullivan,cir.
the alj considered cox impairment by conducting the familiar evaluation set forth in a g.under the regulations,the alj determines whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity whether the claimant impairments are so severe that they significantly limit the claimant physical or mental ability to perform basic work activities whether the claimant has impairments that meet or equal a presumptively disabling impairment specified in the regulations whether the claimant rfc is sufficient for her to perform her past work and finally,if the claimant can not perform her past work,the burden shifts to the commissioner to prove that there are other jobs in the national economy that the claimant can perform given the claimant rfc,age,education and work experience.see cox apfel,at.cox claims of error relate to steps three and five.
mental retardation 
the alj found that substantial evidence supported the conclusion that cox mental impairments did not meet or equal the listed requirements for mental retardation.we agree.for cox purposes,to qualify as presumptively disabled due to mental retardation,substantial evidence must support the presence of a valid verbal,performance,or full scale iq of through and a physical or other mental impairment imposing an additional and significant limitation of function,whose onset had occurred by age.pt,subpt.p,app,c maresh barnhart,cir describing the c requirements.
