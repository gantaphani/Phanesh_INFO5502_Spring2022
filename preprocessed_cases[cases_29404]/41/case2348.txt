gordon stout appeals the district court judgment affirming the social security commissioner commissioner denial of his applications for disability insurance benefits dib and supplemental security income ssi under titles ii and xvi,respectively,of the social security act.stout contends the administrative law judge alj improperly disregarded lay testimony regarding his inability to work we have jurisdiction under.because the alj failed to discuss competent lay witness testimony favorable to stout,we reverse the district court judgment and remand.
stout filed his current claims for dib and ssi in february,alleging disability primarily due to back and mental impairments with an onset date of april.the social security administration denied these claims initially and upon reconsideration.stout requested a hearing.
at his hearing in february,stout sister,udena stout udena,testified that stout impairments negatively affect his ability to work.additionally,the alj received into evidence a letter from stout,jay vasquez,with whom stout worked for approximately fifteen years.similar to udena testimony,vasquez described stout inability to work without certain accommodations.during a supplemental hearing in march,a vocational expert ve testified.in response to the alj hypothetical,the ve opined that stout could perform one of his previous jobs and other jobs in the national economy.
in his decision,the alj found stout able to perform his past relevant work as a vine pruner and,therefore,not disabled within the meaning of the social security act.the appeals council denied stout request for review,making the alj decision the commissioner final decision.see.stout sought judicial review in the united states district court for the district of oregon,which affirmed the commissioner decision.stout timely appeals.
we review de novo the district court affirmance of the commissioner final decision.webb barnhart,cir.we will uphold the commissioner denial of benefits if the commissioner applied the correct legal standards and substantial evidence supports the decision.id.at.
to medically qualify for benefits under the social security act,a claimant must establish the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.d a.in assessing whether a claimant is disabled,the alj follows a,sequential evaluation process 
step one is the claimant presently engaged in substantial gainful activity if so,the claimant is not disabled.if not,proceed to step two.
step two is the claimant alleged impairment sufficiently severe to limit his or her ability to work if so,proceed to step three.if not,the claimant is not disabled.
step three does the claimant impairment,or combination of impairments,meet or equal an impairment listed in,pt,subpt.p,app.if so,the claimant is disabled.if not,proceed to step four.
step four does the claimant possess the residual functional capacity rfc to perform his or her past relevant work if so,the claimant is not disabled.if not,proceed to step five.
step five does the claimant rfc,when considered with the claimant age,education,and work experience,allow him or her to adjust to other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy if so,the claimant is not disabled.if not,the claimant is disabled.
on appeal,stout challenges the alj findings at steps four and five at step four,the alj determined stout most stout could still do despite his limitations.see.finding that stout had various physical restrictions and a limited capacity for teamwork and required,two to three step tasks which are fairly repetitive,the alj concluded stout could perform a wide range of light unskilled work,and the inclusive sedentary level work.see a b,a b.
based upon stout rfc and the ve testimony,the alj found stout able to perform his past relevant work as a vine pruner.consequently,the alj concluded stout was not disabled within the meaning of the social security act.see b if we find that you have the rfc to do your past relevant work,we will determine that you can still do your past work and are not disabled,b same.
stout contends the alj erred in finding he could perform his past relevant work and other work in the national economy.specifically,he argues the alj erred in rejecting without comment the lay witness testimony of his sister,udena,and,jay vasquez.the commissioner concedes error but argues it was harmless.we disagree.
in determining whether a claimant is disabled,an alj must consider lay witness testimony concerning a claimant ability to work.see dodrill shalala,cir d e,d e.indeed,lay testimony as to a claimant symptoms or how an impairment affects ability to work is competent evidence and therefore can not be disregarded without comment.nguyen chater,cir citations omitted.consequently,i f the alj wishes to discount the testimony of lay witnesses,he must give reasons that are germane to each witness.dodrill,at see also lewis apfel,lay testimony as to a claimant symptoms is competent evidence that an alj must take into account,unless he or she expressly determines to disregard such testimony and gives reasons germane to each witness for doing so.citations omitted.
here,the alj was required to consider and comment upon the uncontradicted lay testimony,as it concerned how stout impairments impact his ability to work.both udena and vasquez testified,consistent with medical evidence,about stout inability to deal with the demands of work.after explaining stout has problems accomplishing even simple tasks,vasquez,who worked with stout for fifteen years as both his boss and,provided the following example i would have stout clean out the tool trailer and ask him to label nails,nuts,bolts,and screws.ten minutes later i would come back and he would be throwing things on the ground,becoming frustrated with the simplest of tasks.similarly,udena testified that simple,monotonous tasks easily frustrate stout,so much so that,when something does go just right,he goes into a rage,blindly throwing things and sic.
moreover,both witnesses explained stout uncommon need for supervision to perform uncomplicated tasks.for instance,udena testified that for stout to keep focused on the job at hand,someone must watch over him.while she stated stout could handle simple jobs,such as pick ing up stuff in the yard,she further clarified why he needs supervision to accomplish such jobs mentally he would tend to stray from what he supposed to be doing,find interest in other things,wander off,and probably explore the area.likewise,vasquez stated that,for stout to accomplish even menial labor,he requires constant supervision.
although the ve specifically testified that a need for literal,constant supervision would not be acceptable in competitive employment,save for one passing reference to udena testimony about stout general behaviors,the alj decision wholly fails to mention udena or vasquez testimony about how stout impairments affect his ability to work.therefore,the alj erred.see nguyen,at.
conceding the alj silent disregard of the lay testimony contravenes our case law and the controlling regulations,the commissioner requests we disregard the error as harmless.the commissioner argument echoes,if not recites verbatim,the district court harmless error analysis,which it began by reasoning that udena testimony suggests stout has always had intellectual deficits,depression,and episodes of behavior.yet,stout has been able to engage in substantial work activity in the past.as to vasquez testimony,the court reasoned that he worked with stout for fifteen years and,w hile it took effort,stout was able to engage in substantial gainful activity while suffering from his current impairments.because the district court found t he medical evidence establishes that nothing has changed,it concluded there was no reason to overturn the alj decision.
we note that two considerations caution,if not preclude,us from adopting these justifications for embracing harmless error here.first,the alj,not the district court,is required to provide s
