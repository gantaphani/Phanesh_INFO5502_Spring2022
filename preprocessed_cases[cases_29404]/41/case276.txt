this is an appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york carol bagley amon,chief judge in an action involving the alleged fraudulent alteration of evidence by the defendants,john fusto,then a special assistant attorney general with the medicaid fraud control unit mfcu of the new york state attorney general office,and jose castillo,then an with the mfcu,during the course of mfcu investigation of the plaintiff,leonard morse.
the defendants suspected that morse,a dentist with a practice in brooklyn,new york,was perpetrating medicaid fraud by submitting false billing to medicaid.during the course of their investigation,the defendants conducted an audit of morse billings and created spreadsheet summary charts containing the billing details of eight of his patients.those charts were later presented to a kings county,new york,grand jury.based in part on that evidence,morse was indicted by the grand jury on one count of grand larceny in the first degree and eleven counts of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree.although morse was later acquitted of all charges,as a result of the prosecution,he lost his dental practice and sustained other injuries.
after his acquittal,morse filed the instant action against the defendants in federal district court in brooklyn alleging that the defendants deprived him of his constitutional right to a fair trial by intentionally manipulating the information contained on the spreadsheet summary charts before they were presented to the grand jury in order to create the false impression that morse billed medicaid for dental services that he did not provide.
a jury rendered a verdict in his favor,and the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law under.or,in the alternative,a new trial under.the district court concluded that one of the factual bases underpinning morse claim was not sufficiently supported by the evidence to have been properly considered by the jury in reaching its verdict,but nonetheless denied both of the defendants motions.
on appeal,the defendants principally contend that their conduct was not clearly prohibited by the constitution,and that they are therefore entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law.the defendants also assert that the district court should have ordered a new trial pursuant to the rule because the court decided as a matter of law that one of the three factual bases upon which morse allegation that the defendants false ly or fraudulently altered documents rested lacked a legally sufficient basis in the evidence.
we reject these challenges.as the district court held in a careful,detailed,and persuasive opinion,morse fusto,cv,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,the actions of the defendants upon which morse bases his claims were the knowing creation of false or misleading evidence by a government officer acting in an investigative capacity.we have held that such activity by a government official qualifies as an unconstitutional deprivation of the victim rights.this right was,moreover,clearly established at the time of the defendants conduct.the defendants are therefore not entitled to qualified immunity.see buckley fitzsimmons,immunity for prosecutors performing investigative functions is not absolute.we also conclude that the defendants waived their rule argument and are therefore not entitled to a new trial despite the district court conclusion that one of the three factual bases for the jury conclusion as to liability was insufficiently substantiated by the evidence presented at trial.
background 
the investigation and prosecution of morse 
in,the mfcu initiated an investigation into the professional financial affairs of morse,a dentist,then practicing with another dentist in the park slope neighborhood of brooklyn as dental,the defendant john fusto,then a special assistant attorney general with the mfcu,was assigned to the case,as was the defendant jose castillo,then an mfcu.as part of the investigation,the defendants audited morse patient billings,creating summaries of the billings designed to highlight those they considered suspicious.they also interviewed morse patients,inquiring into the professional services that he had rendered to them and the related billings for those services.
the investigation drew to a close in late.in march,fusto presented to a kings county grand jury evidence of morse allegedly unlawful billing practices.in the course of the grand jury proceedings,fusto called castillo as a witness to testify about a billings analysis that castillo had prepared which,according to the defendants,showed that through illegal billing,morse had unlawfully obtained some million from new york state medicaid.several of morse former patients also testified that he had not performed denture work for them,despite billings that appeared to indicate otherwise.finally,and central to the present case,fusto presented two exhibits,denominated in those proceedings as exhibit and exhibit,to the grand jury.they contained spreadsheet summary charts purporting to detail the billings associated with eight of morse patients.the summary charts contained the following fields 
client identification number denominated cin number 
patient last name 
patient first name 
amount paid 
date of service 
invoice number 
julian date 
procedure code 
procedure description 
fusto called linda deluca,a dentist,to testify as to her opinion of the legitimacy of the billings based on the summaries contained in these exhibits.deluca testified that the billings struck her as unusual and excessive.
on april,the grand jury returned an indictment charging morse with one count of grand larceny in the first degree in violation of new york penal law section and eleven counts of offering a false instrument for filing in violation of new york penal law section.the charges were predicated on morse alleged theft of million from medicaid and his alleged submission of false written statements to the computer sciences corporation,a fiscal agent of the state of new york,with intent to defraud the state of new york,respectively.
morse was acquitted of these charges after an august bench trial before kings county supreme court justice john walsh.despite his ultimate acquittal,morse suffered serious financial,reputational,and emotional harm as a result of the indictment and trial.
the action commenced against the defendants 
on november,following his acquittal,morse initiated the instant action in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,asserting claims of,inter alia,false arrest,malicious prosecution,and denial of the right to a fair trial.on november,the defendants moved for partial summary judgment under.b.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on the malicious prosecution and false arrest claims,but denied it with respect to the fabrication of evidence claim morse spitzer,cv,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,as corrected.on february,the parties proceeded to trial before a jury on the fabrication of evidence claim.
at trial,morse focused his fabrication of evidence claim on the billing spreadsheet summaries labeled exhibits and that castillo and fusto had prepared during the investigation.morse argued that the defendants knowingly created the billing summaries to create the false impression that he had billed medicaid for services that he had not in fact rendered.he pointed to three examples of allegedly false or misleading assertions of facts included in these summaries 
the stacy rodriguez triple billing claim the billing summary for patient stacy rodriguez included nine entries,each purportedly representing a distinct procedure performed on the same day,even though records show that morse billed medicaid for only three such procedures.
the edwin gonzalez super patient claim the billing summary for patient edwin gonzalez contained the billing details for services rendered to three different patients,all named edwin gonzalez.the records with respect to those three patients were merged and aggregated to look as though they belonged to one super patient.
the tooth number problem for all of the patients listed in the billing summaries,a tooth number field was excluded from the spreadsheet.this created the impression that morse billed medicaid repeatedly for the same procedure when in fact morse was billing per tooth for a procedure performed on different teeth of the same patient.
at the close of trial,the jury was given a verdict sheet which asked whether,based on a preponderance of the evidence,each defendant was liable for creating false or fraudulently altered documents,consisting of the allegedly fraudulent documents,knowing that such information was false or fraudulent,and,if so,whether that evidence was material to the grand jury decision to indict.verdict sheet at.
the court also instructed the jury as to the defendants requisite state of mind 
plaintiff must show that the defendants acted knowingly or with reckless disregard.an act is done knowingly if it is done voluntarily and deliberately and not because of mistake,accident,negligence or other innocent reason.an act is done with reckless disregard if it is done in conscious disregard of its known probable consequences.the plaintiff does not need to show that the defendants specifically intended to deprive him of a constitutional right.
jury inst.at 
the court defined false and fraudulent as follows 
a document is false if it is untrue when made and was known to be untrue when made by the person making it or causing it to be made.a document is fraudulent if it is falsely made with intent to deceive.deceitful or the deliberate concealment of material facts may also constitute false or fraudulent information.
id.the court also instructed the jury that false or fraudulent evidence was material,if it was likely to influence the grand jury decision to indict.id.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of morse based on its finding that both defendants knowingly created false or fraudulently altered documents.verdict sheet at.the jury awarded morse in compensatory damages for past lost earnings for future lost earnings and for pain and suffering.verdict sheet at.it further awarded morse in punitive damages of which was against fusto,and the remaining of which was against castillo id.in response to the question on the verdict sheet,have defendants,john fusto and jose castillo,proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the billing summaries were created in connection with the preparation for the presentation of evidence to the grand jury,and not earlier as part of the investigation,the jury answered no.verdict sheet at.
post judgment motions 
after the jury rendered its verdict,the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law jmol pursuant to,or a new trial pursuant to,or a reduction in the damage award.the defendants argued that they were entitled to jmol with respect to liability on three grounds first,the contents of the spreadsheet summary charts were facially true and thus could not have been reasonably found to be either false or fraudulent second,the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity and third,the defendants are entitled to absolute immunity.
the district court concluded that as a matter of law,the stacy rodriguez page was not a false or fraudulently altered document that can support a fabrication of evidence claim.morse,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court nonetheless denied the motion for jmol and upheld the general verdict,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court explained that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury verdict that the edwin gonzalez page and the omission of tooth numbers constituted false or fraudulently altered evidence,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
addressing the defendants assertion that they were entitled to qualified immunity,the district court concluded that ricciuti transit,cir and its progeny undoubtedly establish that qualified immunity is unavailable on a claim for denial of the right to a fair trial where that claim is premised on proof that a defendant knowingly fabricated evidence and where a reasonable jury could so find,wl,at,dist.lexis,at internal quotation marks omitted.
with respect to the defendants absolute immunity argument,the district court noted that although a prosecutor preparations for the initiation of judicial proceedings or for trial are protected by absolute immunity,a prosecutor investigatory functions that do not relate to an advocate preparation for the initiation of a prosecution are not entitled to absolute immunity,wl,at,dist.lexis,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting buckley,at.the court also explained that t he official seeking absolute immunity bears the burden of showing that such immunity is justified for the function in question,and that,in this case the jury was entitled to simply disbelieve fusto and castillo testimonies regarding when they created the allegedly fraudulent documents,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
finally,the court rejected the defendants motion for a new trial as to liability under,and granted the defendants motion for a new trial with respect to damages unless morse elected to accept a remitted compensatory damage award of and a remitted punitive damage award of,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.morse accepted the remittitur.
the defendants appeal from the district court denial of qualified immunity and from its declining to order a new trial despite its conclusion that one of the factual bases offered in support of morse claims lacked sufficient evidentiary support 
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court ruling on a motion for jmol pursuant to,applying the same standard as the district court.cash cty.of erie,cir.the standard for judgment as a matter of law is the same as for summary judgment under.cobb pozzi,cir.accordingly,a district court must deny a motion for judgment as a matter of law unless,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,the evidence is such that,without weighing the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise considering the weight of the evidence,there can be but one conclusion as to the verdict that reasonable persons could have reached.id.alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
that standard places a particularly heavy burden on the movant where,as here,the jury has deliberated in the case and actually returned its verdict in favor of the.cross transit,cir.in such circumstances,a court may set aside the verdict only if there exists such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture,or the evidence in favor of the movant is so overwhelming that reasonable and fair minded persons could not arrive at a verdict against it.brady wal mart stores,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
ii.qualified immunity 
qualified immunity protects public officials performing discretionary functions from personal liability in a civil suit for damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.lore city of syracuse,cir internal quotation marks omitted.whether qualified immunity applies turns on the objective legal reasonableness of the action,assessed in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time it was taken.pearson callahan,internal quotation marks omitted.as we explain in greater detail below,a right is clearly established if it would be clear to a reasonable public official that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.lore,at.
the defendants argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law.first,they assert that they had no constitutional duty to include all material information in the spreadsheet summaries.they rely principally on united states williams,and united states regan,cir,for the proposition that prosecutors may properly give presentations to the grand jury in seeking an indictment,and that they are further entitled to keep relevant and material information even outright exculpatory evidence from the grand jury.appellants br.emphasis omitted.second,the defendants contend that the omissions involved in creating the billing summaries are not analogous to the fabrication of evidence prohibited under zahrey coffey,cir,a decision heavily relied upon by the district court.third,they maintain that in any event,their omission of some details from the summary spreadsheets did not violate clearly established law that would have served to warn them that their conduct was unconstitutional.
a.the constitutional duty of a prosecutor 
it is axiomatic that the grand jury sits not to determine guilt or innocence,but to assess whether there is adequate basis for bringing a criminal charge.williams,at.it has therefore always been thought sufficient to hear only the prosecutor side.id.this means that the suspect under investigation by the grand jury has never been thought to have a right to testify or to have exculpatory evidence presented.id.at.the defendants argue that the jury finding that they deliberately kept information from the grand jury therefore does not establish a constitutional violation.
notwithstanding the legally permissible nature of grand jury proceedings,everyone possesses the additional and distinct right not to be deprived of liberty as a result of the fabrication of evidence by a government officer acting in an investigating capacity.zahrey,at.this right was violated,morse contends,when the defendants knowingly created false or misleading billing summaries that were determined to be material to the grand jury decision to indict.
we conclude that the omissions in this case were properly considered under the rubric of zahrey,under which government officials may be held liable for fabricating evidence through false statements or omissions that are both material and made knowingly.in zahrey,the plaintiff,a police officer,brought suit against an assistant united states attorney named martin coffey,for conspiring to manufacture false evidence against the plaintiff.coffey influenced the testimony of a prospective federal grand jury witness and attempted to pressure and bribe another witness to falsely implicate zahrey.id.at.the same witness thereafter falsely testified against zahrey.id.at.we concluded that the prosecutor behavior violated zahrey right not to be deprived of liberty as a result of the fabrication of evidence by a government officer acting in an investigating capacity.id.at.
here,the jury found that by making material omissions in the billing summaries,the defendants in effect falsified them,and they did so knowingly and as part of their investigation.morse argues that this finding places his case on all fours with zahrey,requiring us to affirm the judgment of the district court.we agree.
as we have observed,false information likely to influence a jury decision violates the accused constitutional right to a fair trial,because to hold otherwise,works an unacceptable corruption of the function of the trial process.ricciuti,at quoting united states agurs.information may be false if material omissions render an otherwise true statement false.for example,in manganiello city of new york,cir,we affirmed a verdict against a police officer who was found to have misrepresented the evidence to the prosecutors,or failed to provide the prosecutor with material evidence or information,or gave testimony to the grand jury that was false or contained material omissions,while knowing that he was making a material misrepresentation or omission or giving false testimony.id.at internal quotation marks omitted,emphasis added.the manganiello court acknowledged that the integrity of the judicial process can be unlawfully compromised by a government official submission of information to a jury that implicates the accused based in part on material omissions.
the defendants ask us to distinguish manganiello from the instant case on the basis that manganiello involved a claim against a police officer and not a prosecutor.but we find nothing in manganiello to suggest a distinction between prosecutors acting in their investigative capacity and police officers acting in theirs,at least in the circumstances presented by the case at bar.to the contrary,the supreme court has observed that w hen a prosecutor performs the investigative functions normally performed by a detective or police officer,it is neither appropriate nor justifiable that,for the same act,immunity should protect the one and not the other.buckley,at internal quotation marks omitted.and we have recognized that prosecutors and police officers are equally responsible for preserving the function of the trial process.ricciuti,f d at see also napue state of,stating as a general rule that a state may not knowingly use false evidence,including false testimony,to obtain a tainted conviction.
alternatively,the defendants ask us to distinguish manganiello because it involved both affirmative misrepresentations and misleading omissions,without directly addressing the distinction between the two.but manganiello does not suggest that deliberate omissions of material facts are qualitatively different from affirmative misstatements,or that omissions alone can not support a successful section action for using fabricated evidence to deprive a plaintiff of his constitutional rights.nor do we see any reason to distinguish the two under the circumstances of this case.indeed,both threaten the integrity of the judicial process by injecting it with falsity provided by officers of the state whose official status gives the misinformation a special aura of reliability.
as the district court observed,other areas of law make no legal distinction between misleading statements or omissions and affirmative falsehoods.morse,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.see,criminalizing knowingly and willfully falsif ying,conceal ing,or cover ing up by any trick,scheme,or device a material fact,to the federal government b prohibiting,under the securities laws,mak ing any untrue statement of a material fact or omit ting to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading 
the defendants complain that t he threat of liability for incomplete or record or transaction summaries will potentially paralyze prosecutors investigations and preparations for the grand jury.appellants br.this would indeed be a matter of grave concern if it were so.but we foresee no significant barriers to the pursuit of successful prosecutions that would result from the defendants liability in this case.it ought not to be difficult,even for the most of prosecutors,to avoid misconduct of the scope and seriousness of that in which the defendants engaged creat ing false or fraudulently altered documents,verdict sheet at,in the course of their performance of investigatory functions,morse,wl,at,dist.lexis,at knowing that such information was false or fraudulent,verdict sheet at,where false is defined as untrue when made and known to be untrue when made by the person making it or causing it to be made and fraudulent as falsely made with intent to deceive,jury instr.at,emphasis added.it does not seem to us to be a danger to effective law enforcement to require prosecutors and their aides to abide by these rules even when pursuing the most complicated of cases with the utmost determination.
defendants remaining arguments in favor of qualified immunity 
we find the defendants remaining arguments in favor of qualified immunity also to be unpersuasive.the defendants assert that the district court requirement to present evidence as it is,not in an altered form that presents an inaccurate picture of the character of the evidence,morse,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,was impossible because there were no paper billing claims to present in their original form and thus no coherent way for defendants to present the database in raw form without selecting from the over fifty fields contained in the database.appellants br.it is plainly true,as the defendants point out,that a summary of evidence to be useful,to summarize at all is necessarily selective.appellants br.but as we have tried to make clear,the constitutional violation in this case was not the summarization of data,it was the manipulation of data to create false or misleading documents,knowing that such information was false or misleading
