university of pittsburgh university brought suit against david townsend,ronald nutt,cti molecular imaging,cti,and cti pet systems,cps collectively,defendants,claiming that defendants misappropriated the university rights and interests in a type of technology that the university alleges was collaboratively invented at its campus over a period of several years.the university complaint,as amended,asserts that defendants,either individually or collectively,breached certain contracts,tortiously interfered with contractual relations,breached fiduciary duties,misappropriated or converted proprietary interests and rights,engaged in an unlawful conspiracy,committed fraud and misrepresentations,and were unjustly enriched by their actions.defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that the university claims were by the applicable statutes of limitations.in response,the university filed a motion for partial summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants and dismissed the complaint.on appeal,the university calls upon us to reverse the district court and hold that its claims were timely filed under the pertinent statutes of limitations.for the following reasons,we affirm.
factual background 
a working relationship between defendants david townsend and ronald nutt arose in the,when nutt served as of cps and townsend was employed as a faculty member at the university of geneva.their collaboration revolved primarily around positron emission tomograph pet imaging,a process by which diagnostic images are created based on the detection of radioactive isotopes injected into a patient prior to a scan.in,townsend and nutt formulated the idea of integrating a pet imaging scanner with a computerized axial tomograph ct scanner,which incorporates special equipment to obtain image data from different angles around a patient body,and then uses computer processing to show a of body tissues and organs.
to formalize their collaboration,townsend entered into a written consulting agreement with cps on october.effective from the date of signing until september,the agreement contained a provision assigning all of townsend intellectual property rights to cps.this provision reads in pertinent part as follows 
all inventions,all patents,and all materials for which copyright protection may be obtained which are made,developed,discovered,composed,or conceived by employees and consultants in the course and scope of their employment by cti which relate in any way to cti actual or planned business,interests,or investigations are the sole property of cti,unless specifically disclaimed by cti in writing.each employee and consultant is obligated to promptly bring these inventions,patents,and materials to management attention.cti continues to have ownership rights to these inventions and materials,even after an employee or consultant terminates employment with cti.
ja.following the expiration of the consulting agreement,townsend signed a second yearlong consulting agreement on may.this second agreement also contained the foregoing provision.at the same time that townsend served as a consultant to cps,the university recruited him to serve on its faculty as an associate professor of radiology.townsend joined the university faculty on september,and was tendered a formal engagement letter dated october.included with this letter was a copy of the university faculty handbook,and one of the sections in this publication set forth the university policy on patents.the policy provides,in pertinent part,as follows 
ii.title to patents 
a.the university claims ownership and control of the worldwide patent rights that result from activities of its faculty,staff,and students.university faculty and staff shall include all persons who hold any official faculty or staff relationship to the university,with the exception of those persons who render their services to the university on a gratuitous basis.this exception does not include faculty who are members of professional corporations affiliated with the university,even though the faculty may receive all or part of their compensation from the professional corporation.the inventor will normally receive percent and the university percent of the net financial returns from the sale,licensing,or other transfer of such patent rights 
patent rights resulting from research grants,contracts,fellowships,or other such arrangement,are controlled by the terms of those agreements,but as between the university and faculty members and staff accepting such grants,section a shall govern 
university procedure for patents 
ii.b.an assignment of all worldwide rights,title and interest by the inventor s to the university in the development and improvements therein will be obtained prior to initiating any patentability evaluation,search,patent application,or other legal costs.
ja.while this provision expressly relates only to patents,the handbook specifies that trade secrets or,although not patentable,are subject to the same policies as patentable inventions.additionally,the handbook concludes with the following disclaimer 
this h andbook is prepared for the information of the membership of the faculty of the university of pittsburgh.the handbook for faculty is not intended to be a complete statement of all university faculty and academic policies.the policies and practices described are subject to change by the university.they are not to be considered or otherwise relied upon as terms and conditions of employment and the language used in this h andbook is not intended to create a contract between the university of pittsburgh and its employees.
ja.townsend remembers receiving the letter and the handbook as an enclosure,but does not recollect actually reading through the contents of the handbook.
at the time of townsend hiring,the university indicated that it was aware that townsend was collaborating with cps,but the university neither asked townsend to provide a copy of the consulting agreement nor sought information from townsend about the terms of the agreement.townsend,however,claims that he disclosed his consultant status to the university upon completing the requisite forms.in a form dated in,townsend indicated that he served as a paid consultant with cps,and on a form,townsend responded affirmatively to the question,are you or a member of your immediate family the inventor of any technology for which an invention disclosure has been filed or which is being developed or evaluated in connection with your research activities ja.upon further elaboration,townsend wrote on the form that a n application has been filed for a patent on the scanner.the application was filed by cps.ja.
after commencing his position at the university,townsend asked cps to forward any salary received under his consulting agreement directly to the university.notwithstanding this payment arrangement,the university financial officers did not recognize the monthly payments from cps as stemming from the consulting agreement but instead designated the payments as gifts to the university.
several years later,in,townsend applied for and was awarded a grant from the national institutes of health nih covering the period from july,to june.upon expiration of this grant,townsend sought funding for a continuation grant from the nih,which he successfully obtained on june.this second nih grant covered the period from april,to march.both grant applications identified townsend as the principal investigator for the project,entitled a combined pet and ct tomograph for clinical use.the grant applications further identified nutt as one of several consultants on the project.included among the materials in support of the first grant application was a letter from nutt to townsend dated october,stating,as you know,one of the most important parameters in my decision to enter into a joint agreement to develop a tomograph with you and the university is that you have already demonstrated the ability to initiate,direct and complete an important joint pet tomograph development with cps.id.despite the fact that townsend was the recipient of the grant,pursuant to guidelines governing federal research grants,the money was directed to the university.
in september,the university drew on a portion of the nih grant funds to purchase a pet scanner from cps.although the university initially bought this device for use in the prototype,nutt recommended that the university use the device clinically,as part of its work with patients,until the prototype design was finalized.when cps asked the university to return the scanner in december for use in the prototype,the university refused.cps therefore used its own funds to purchase another pet scanner.that is,no grant funds were ultimately used in the purchase of the pet scanner that became part of the first prototype.the prototype was completed and fully functional in early february,and was initially housed at cps facilities in knoxville,tennessee.the device was later installed at the university in april.
at this time,townsend sought permission to work for part of the year at cps in knoxville and discussed this possibility with david gur,vice chairman of the university department of radiology and townsend supervisor.although gur was initially concerned that townsend work in knoxville might create problems with respect to intellectual property rights arising from the collaboration,gur ultimately allowed townsend to work from cps knoxville office in exchange for a promise by cps to pay a portion of townsend salary to the university.
prior to departing for knoxville,on july,townsend followed the protocol delineated in the university policy on patents and submitted to the university an invention disclosure statement for an invention termed a combined pet and ct tomograph for clinical use.the statement identified townsend and nutt as the and cps as a potential licensee.the form included a formal assignment clause,in which faculty were requested to assign any invention to the university.townsend,however,did not complete this section and was never asked to assign any interest in the scanner to the university.reed mcmanigle,an official with the university office of technology management,stated that he was not concerned when townsend failed to execute the assignment clause because he believed that the university rights in the invention had been established by the agreement i negotiated with townsend and nutt on behalf of cps and summarized in the june letter to gur.id.moreover,in mcmanigle experience,it is not uncommon for a written assignment from an inventor to be provided after the invention disclosure and closer to the licensing stages.id.
on july,the university technology transfer committee approved the filing of a patent application on the ct tomograph townsend identified in the invention disclosure statement.two days later,on july,mcmanigle sent a letter to gur to confirm that the office of technology management was quite comfortable with townsend evolving relationship with cps,and has no objections to the commencement of townsend in residence research relationship with cps.id.the letter further provided that townsend would remain a university employee during the period of his research in knoxville and that any new inventions in which townsend is at least a,will be owned in part by the university.id.
after townsend began his work in knoxville,the university and cps entered into a research agreement in august,whereby cps paid the university to perform patient scans as part of the clinical validation process of the prototype.the agreement contained a contingency clause providing that it became effective only upon intellectual property issues being satisfactorily resolved by the university of pittsburgh office of technology transfer,siemens,and cps.id.despite the existence of this language,the university received payment for the patient scans it performed utilizing the prototype,although the parties never finalized the intellectual property issues surrounding the technology.
in october,pitts britain,a law firm serving as patent counsel to cps,filed a provisional patent application for the combined scanner with the public health service division of the department of health and human services.the application listed townsend and nutt as the inventors and included a form entitled statement claiming small entity status cfr f b independent inventor.id.this form included the following paragraph 
ja.pitt britain sent a copy of the provisional application to mcmanigle.thereafter,pitt britain filed three patent applications,all of which listed townsend and nutt as inventors and cps as assignee but were silent with respect to the university.
in november,the university acted pursuant to the act,c which relates to the receipt of federal funds for research,to elect title to the scanner.despite this election of title,cps began to develop commercially the scanner,and the first model was installed at the university medical center in august.subsequently,cps sold scanners on the commercial market at prices ranging from million to million.
in november,the university requested that townsend terminate his relationship with cps and join its competitor,general electric.when townsend refused,he simultaneously stepped down as director of the university pet facility and permanently resigned from the university faculty on january.two months prior to his resignation from the university,townsend signed a royalty agreement with cps,in which he assigned his patent rights in the scanner to cps in exchange for a royalty rate of per unit sold.at the close of,townsend had collected in royalty payments pursuant to this agreement.
procedural history 
the university initially filed suit against defendants in the united state district court for the western district of pennsylvania.the case was transferred pursuant to a to the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee,where the university filed an amended complaint on april.the parties consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge.
in its amended complaint,the university asserted the following claims against defendants townsend breached his employment contract,including the rights and obligations under the university patent policy cps breached its obligations to the university as set forth in its research agreement of august and the parties related oral agreements cps tortiously interfered with the university contractual relations with townsend nutt tortiously interfered with the university contractual relations with townsend and cps townsend and cps breached their fiduciary duties to the university defendants misappropriated and converted the university proprietary interests and rights defendants participated in a civil conspiracy defendants engaged in fraud and misrepresentation and defendants were unjustly enriched.the university sought a declaratory judgment,injunctive relief,and money damages.defendants moved for summary judgment,and the university,in turn,filed a motion for partial summary judgment.
in a opinion,the district court granted the defendants motions for summary judgment and denied the university motion for partial summary judgment.the district court first conducted a analysis and explained that when a case is transferred pursuant to a,the receiving court must apply the choice of law of the transferring court.accordingly,given that the matter arose under diversity jurisdiction,the court determined that pennsylvania law governs the contract,and tort claims in the action.with respect to the applicable statutes of limitations,the court found that,pursuant to pennsylvania law,the university tort claims are subject to a statute,while the university contract claims are subject to a statute.
applying these statutes of limitations,the court first stated that ascertaining whether a statute of limitations has expired is generally a question of law to be resolved by the court rather than a.accordingly,the court addressed whether the various tolling doctrines raised by the university,including the discovery rule,the doctrine of fraudulent concealment,and the doctrine,acted to preserve the timeliness of the university action.the district court determined that the discovery rule was inapplicable and that neither the doctrine of fraudulent concealment nor the doctrine were triggered because the university was unable to identify any affirmative,independent acts of concealment on the part of defendants.
accordingly,the court dismissed all of the counts in contract and tort set forth in the university amended complaint.the university timely appealed.

statutes of limitations 
on appeal,the parties do not dispute that the statute of limitations for tort actions and the statute of limitations for contract actions provided for under pennsylvania law apply to all of the counts enumerated in the amended complaint.rather,the central question concerns the timeliness of the university actions in tort and contract against defendants.the university argues that the district court erred in holding,as a matter of law,that when defendants filed the small entity form in november,the university was put on notice that defendants had not assigned their interests in the scanner to it and therefore could have maintained an action in contract and tort at that time.according to the university,the fact that defendants did not list the university on the small entity form as an organization to which they had agreed to assign,grant,convey,or license or were under an obligation under contract or law to assign,grant,convey,or license any rights in the invention did not necessarily put it on notice rather,the university contends,t he small entity form equally could have been disclosing nothing more than that cps was an organization to which i am under contract or law to license any rights in the invention.given this alternative reading of the small entity form,the university claims that a could reasonably conclude that defendants only assigned their interests to cps in,when defendants executed a royalty agreement expressly mentioning the assignment to cps.and if were the date on which the statutes of limitations began to run,the university maintenance of an action against defendants on july,would be timely.
the law provides otherwise.pursuant to the pennsylvania judicial code,limitations periods are computed from the time the cause of action accrued.c.pennsylvania courts have found a cause of action to accrue when the plaintiff could have first maintained the action to a successful conclusion.fine checcio,citing kapil ass of.state coll.and.faculties.in other words,the applicable clock starts running as soon as the right to institute and maintain a suit arises.fine,at.this time frame reflects the general rule that a party asserting a cause of action is under a duty to use all reasonable diligence to be properly informed of the facts and circumstances upon which a potential right of recovery is based and to institute suit within the prescribed statutory period.kingston coal felton min.moreover,m istake,misunderstanding,or lack of knowledge in themselves do not serve as defenses to the running of a statute.fine,at.

against this statutory backdrop,we now turn to the university arguments on appeal.at the outset,we reject the university argument that the district court incorrectly treated the issue of the statute of limitations as a matter of law,rather than fact.it is under pennsylvania law that w hether the statute of limitations has run on a claim is generally a question of law for the trial judge.devine hutt.thus,the university attempt to cast as error the district court own disposition of the statute of limitations issue,without allowing it to proceed to a,is unsubstantiated.
additionally,we agree with the district court conclusion that november marks the date on which the statutes of limitations began to run.as both the district court and defendants point out,several factual circumstances indicate that the university did not exercise reasonable diligence upon receiving information that townsend may have intended not to assign his interests in the scanner to the university.for example,it is undisputed that,at the time the university recruited townsend to serve as a member of its faculty,the university was aware of a working relationship between townsend and cps but never took steps to inquire further about the nature of this relationship or how it might affect the intellectual property rights surrounding townsend inventions.moreover,as soon as townsend formally joined the faculty,the university began receiving payments from cps pursuant to the consulting agreement between townsend and cps.the university,however,failed to investigate the basis of its receipt of these payments.instead,the university simply characterize
