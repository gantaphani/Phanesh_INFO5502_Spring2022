background 
daley is an employee of marriott corporation,a subsidiary of marriott.daley is a participant in the plan,which is and sponsored by marriott and governed by erisa marriott is the administrator of the plan,and as such,under the plan it has the sole and absolute final discretion to determine eligibility for plan benefits,to construe the terms of the plan,and to resolve any factual issues relevant to benefit eligibility or benefit enrollment.pursuant to an agreement with marriott,empire performs administrative and services for the plan.
under the terms of the plan,outpatient visits are fully covered,subject to a.such coverage,however,is subject to a maximum of thirty visits and a lifetime maximum of visits.
in,daley began receiving outpatient treatment for an unspecified condition.in and,she incurred claims exceeding the maximum of thirty visits.empire denied those claims and daley appeals of those claims on the basis that daley visits exceeded the maximum.daley argued that nebraska parity law.to,prohibited the plan from imposing any limits on coverage the plan,through empire,took the position that the nebraska parity law does not apply to the plan because the law is preempted by erisa.
daley decided not to pursue an optional appeal of her denied claims to marriott.instead,on january,daley filed a complaint against the plan and empire for breach of contract under state law and breach of fiduciary duty under erisa,based on the plan failure to provide coverage in accordance with the nebraska parity law.
daley made three attempts to amend her complaint to add marriott as a defendant.first,on august,daley filed a motion to add marriott as a defendant.the magistrate judge denied the motion,citing daley failure to comply with rule of the local rules of the united states district court for the district of nebraska,which requires the moving party to attach a proposed amended pleading to the motion then,on december,daley filed another motion to amend her complaint seeking to add marriott as a defendant,to expand the timeframe of denied claims to,and to add an allegation of untimely notices of those additional claim denials.the magistrate judge denied this motion because the proposed amended complaint attached to the motion failed to reference marriott,the party daley intended to add as a defendant finally,on january,daley filed a motion to reconsider the denial of her motion to amend and attached a corrected proposed amended complaint which substituted marriott as a defendant in place of the plan,expanded the timeframe of denied claims,and added an allegation of untimely claim denials.the magistrate judge construed the motion as a renewed motion for leave to amend and denied it 
the plan and empire moved for summary judgment,arguing that erisa preempts the nebraska parity law.on june,the district court granted the motion,concluding that daley claims were based on a state law that,as applied to erisa plans,is preempted by erisa.see daley marriott health plan.june,daley i.
meanwhile,on february,daley filed a lawsuit against marriott in its capacity as plan administrator daley ii.the complaint in daley ii is the same as the complaint filed in daley i,except in the following respects marriott,as opposed to the plan and empire,is the named defendant in daley ii the daley ii complaint contains an allegation of additional claim denials based on the limit since the filing of daley i and the daley ii complaint contains an allegation of untimely notices of those additional claim denials.marriott moved to dismiss daley ii based on the doctrine of res judicata.on june,the district court granted the motion on res judicata grounds and alternatively held,like the district court in daley i,that daley failed to state a claim because her claim relied on a state law that,as applied to erisa plans,is preempted by erisa.
daley now appeals the district court adverse grant of summary judgment in daley i.she also appeals the district court dismissal of daley ii.
ii.discussion 
daley argues that the district court erred in holding that the nebraska parity law is preempted by erisa because erisa preemption is a question of federal law involving statutory interpretation,we review the district court decision de novo.blue cross blue shield mary,cir.
before addressing daley argument that erisa does not preempt the nebraska parity law,we must explain the analytical framework of erisa preemption.erisa comprehensively regulates employee pension and welfare plans.baxter lynn,cir.to meet the goals of a comprehensive and pervasive federal interest and the interests of uniformity with respect to interstate plans,congress included an express preemption clause in erisa for the displacement of state action in the field of private employee benefit programs.wilson zoellner,cir internal quotations omitted.accordingly,erisa broadly preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan governed by erisa.a.
however,erisa contains an exception to the general rule of preemption,which is referred to as the savings clause.under the savings clause,a state law that regulates insurance is saved from erisa preemption.b a erisa deemer clause,in turn,exempt s erisa plans from state laws that regulat e insurance within the meaning of the savings clause.fmc holliday,d.the effect of the deemer clause is that erisa plans are exempt from state regulation insofar as that regulation relate s to the plans.id 
daley cites three cases in support of her argument against erisa preemption of the nebraska parity law express scripts,wenzel,cir holding that missouri statutes regulating some aspects of how missouri hmos provide prescription drugs through network pharmacies regulate insurance and,therefore,fall within erisa savings clause rush prudential hmo,moran,d holding that illinois statute requiring hmos to provide independent medical review of certain claim denials is saved from preemption because the statute regulates insurance within the meaning of erisa savings clause and miller,d holding that two kentucky laws are saved from preemption because they regulate insurance within the meaning of erisa savings clause.relying on these cases,daley argues that the nebraska parity law is saved from erisa preemption.ultimately,daley argument is fatally flawed because it ignores the significance of the deemer clause in cases where erisa plans are concerned.see prudential ins,at the movants argument here fails because it ignores the application of the deemer clause to erisa plans,a in miller,but the controlling issue in this case with regard to the plaintiff erisa plan.
whether the nebraska parity law is saved from preemption is not the determinative issue.because the law relates to an erisa employee benefit plan,erisa deemer clause exempts marriott plan from application of nebraska parity law.see fmc,at.in addition,because of the deemer clause,the nebraska parity law can not regulate the plan indirectly through empire.see prudential ins,at the supreme court has noted repeatedly that because of the deemer clause,statutes that indirectly regulate erisa plans are not saved from preemption to the extent such statutes apply to plans
