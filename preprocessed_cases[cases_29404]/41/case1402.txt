backgrounda.
maclin began working for ameritech in.by june,she had been promoted to area manager,a management position that has a salary and bonus potential in what ameritech refers to as the mt market zone.in january or february of,maclin accepted a demotion in lieu of being laid off she became a manager with a salary and bonus potential in the mu market zone.at ameritech,an employee salary and bonus potential is determined by her pay grade,not her title.the mu market zone is one step below the mt pay grade accordingly,it has a lower salary range and a smaller potential bonus.
in fall,maclin participated in developing what later became known as bid central,a new group at ameritech.while bid central was being developed,it called its employees implementation engineers.later,once the group became formalized,employees in the mu pay grade at bid central became known as complex bids managers.when maclin was transferred to bid central,she remained a manager with a salary in the mu market zone.
bruce gregory became maclin supervisor around october.gregory assigned maclin to the team lead role in the group.on october,maclin official title at bid central became area manager of complex bids this assignment as team lead and the change in title did not change her salary or bonus potential she remained in the mu market zone.although maclin was not management and was not in the mt market zone when she was team lead,she did have administrative and supervisory duties that other complex bids managers in the mu market zone at bid central did not have.
maclin was injured in a car accident in december.she took a medical leave of absence that began on december,approximately two months after she became the team lead at bid central.on december,gregory appointed dave gentilini,a white male,as interim team lead in maclin absence while maclin was still on medical leave,however,gregory decided to make gentilini the permanent team lead.in discussions with the human resources department,he stated that he had seen performance problems with her work,including incomplete or incorrectly performed assignments and mishandled projects.he also stated that gentilini had performed exceptionally well in the position and that,by the time maclin returned to work,gentilini had held the position more than twice as long as she had held it.
gregory also changed the nature of the team lead role during maclin absence.during maclin tenure as team lead,gregory had been working with other departments at ameritech to establish bid central and had relied on the team lead to act as a focal point for the concerns of the other complex bids managers.by the time maclin returned to work in june,however,bid central was no longer in its formative stages.the team lead role lost its administrative duties and the other bids managers began reporting directly to gregory rather than the team lead.in the modified team lead position that gentilini held,none of the other complex bids managers reported to him.he also never performed the administrative duties that maclin had performed before her leave,such as approving time sheets and reimbursement forms.
maclin was not assigned to the modified team lead role when she returned from her medical leave.about a month before she returned to work,her title was changed officially to complex bids manager.the change did not affect her salary range and bonus potential she remained in the mu salary range where she had been before her leave.she did not possess the additional supervisory and administrative responsibilities she had held before her absence,but neither did gentilini possess those duties in the modified team lead position.
ameritech compensation guidelines list several factors that determine whether,and in what amount,a pay increase will be awarded and the amount of that award.one factor is the employee current salary compared to that salary grade target range.the guide also contains a matrix for determining the combined salary increase and bonus payment that an employee may receive.the matrix considers two factors current salary relative to that salary level range,and the employee performance evaluation.an employee like maclin,with a salary in the top third of her salary range who met,but did not exceed,her supervisors expectations,may receive a combined raise and bonus not to exceed two percent of her salary.an employee like gentilini,with a salary in the middle to lower end of the mu range who performed exceptionally well,qualifies under ameritech system for a larger combined raise and bonus.
in,ameritech awarded bonuses and pay raises based on the employee performance in.it awarded maclin a pay increase and a lump sum bonus.her combined pay raise and bonus exceeded the total that,according to ameritech compensation guidelines,she should have received for that year.gentilini received a combined pay increase and bonus of of his salary,an amount within the range prescribed by ameritech compensation guidelines for a person with his salary and performance review.even after the raises were given,however,gentilini was paid less than maclin.he and two other members of bid central also were given an additional discretionary bonus that maclin was not awarded.
maclin brought this action against ameritech on april.she claimed that,in violation of the americans with disabilities act ada,et,ameritech had failed to reasonably accommodate her disability.she also claimed that ameritech had demoted her from the team lead position because of her disability,in violation of the ada,and because of her race and gender,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et.finally,she claimed that ameritech had discriminated against her on the basis of her disability,race and gender when ameritech set her pay raise and when it denied her a discretionary bonus.maclin did not allege any violation of the family and medical leave act,et.
after discovery,maclin and ameritech filed for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to ameritech on each of maclin claims.maclin timely appealed.

ada claims 
maclin contends that she is disabled and that ameritech discriminated against her on the basis of this disability.the district court determined that maclin was not disabled as that term is defined by the ada.because a plaintiff seeking to avoid summary judgment must demonstrate that there is at least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she is disabled,squibb,at,the court granted summary judgment to ameritech on all of maclin ada claims.
