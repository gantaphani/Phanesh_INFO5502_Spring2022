was arrested in august.prior to the return of an indictment,counsel for asked the district court for a psychological evaluation and hearing pursuant to b to determine whether her client was competent to stand trial.the district court granted counsel motion and ordered an evaluation of at the detention center where he was then incarcerated.the evaluation was conducted on october,by juan sosa,a licensed clinical psychologist.sosa determined that was incompetent to stand trial,and that his amenability to treatment was questionable due to his low level of intellect.
on november,a magistrate judge conducted a competency hearing at which attorney stipulated that her client was incompetent to stand trial.the magistrate judge subsequently ordered,pursuant to d,to undergo psychiatric evaluation at a medical center for federal prisoners for a period not to exceed four months.
in january,was transferred to the mental health department of the federal medical center in butner,north carolina,where he was evaluated by staff psychiatrist bruce capehart,as well as staff psychologist carlton pyant and psychological intern candyce shields.referring to his report,capehart testified that suffered from a psychotic disorder,not otherwise specified,and that his iq scores fell in approximately the first percentile rank,meaning that about percent of the population would score higher than he did on an iq test,supp.vol.i,tr.at hereinafter cited as tr.like sosa,capehart stated that was incompetent to stand trial,but he further opined that would likely attain competency if treated with antipsychotic medication.capehart reported that had been advised of his diagnosis and the recommended treatment but had consistently refused medication.
following receipt of capehart report,the government moved under sell,d,for an order permitting involuntary medication in order to render competent to stand trial.the district court conducted a hearing on the government motion on september.
in their testimony at the sell hearing,sosa and capehart stated that exhibited delusional thinking characteristic of a psychotic disorder,and that he was incompetent to stand trial.specifically,both doctors testified that believed he could not be facing federal immigration charges because he was employed as a federal runner by the united states government and had either some form of dual citizenship or was a citizen of the united states of mexico,which he described as a single country comprised of canada,mexico and the united states.tr.at.both doctors opined that these delusional beliefs were deeply ingrained,and that had little or no insight into his diminished mental capacity.
both doctors further agreed in their reports and their testimony that,in addition to being delusional,functioned intellectually within the range of borderline deficiency.sosa reported that nonverbal iq score of and a verbal iq score of,placed him within a percentile ranking of,which sosa explained indicated borderline intellectual deficiency.id.at.based on cognitive testing conducted several months after sosa testing,capehart reported an even lower nonverbal iq score,placing in the first percentile,which capehart characterized as falling within the very poor range.
finally,both doctors reported that psychosis did not present a danger to himself or others.specifically,capehart testified at the sell hearing that during his four months at the federal medical center,
was very pleasant.he never gave anyone any trouble.the nurses never had anything unusual to say about him,except that whenever they asked him about what was on his mind,he would talk about being a runner with the marshals service and the united states of mexico and so forth.but other than that,he was a very pleasant person to have.he gave us no management problems at all.
the opinions of the two doctors diverged,however,on whether medication would render competent to stand trial.capehart opined that medication would lessen the effects of psychotic disorder and permit him to be educated as to the charges against him,the role of the court,and how to assist his attorney in his defense.tr.at.without medication,capehart stated that was unlikely to obtain competency because his disorder was not amenable to alternative forms of treatment.id.at.sosa,on the other hand,opined that low intellectual functioning was a substantial factor contributing to his incompetence,and therefore medication would have little or no effect.id.at.
the doctors also disagreed as to whether the benefits of antipsychotic medication would outweigh the possible health risks.capehart acknowledged the possibility of adverse side effects,especially given the paucity of knowledge relating to medical history,but he thought they would be relatively mild and controllable.he testified that the likelihood would be rendered competent through medication justified the risk.sosa disagreed,as did a second witness introduced by the defense at the sell hearing,abraham fiszbein,a licensed psychiatrist,who did not examine but was familiar with the details of his diagnosis.fiszbein testified that twenty percent of patients suffering from delusions do not respond to antipsychotic medication.moreover,the likelihood that a patient delusions are untreatable increases if the patient,like,is over forty years old.fiszbein further testified that the brains of patients with low intellectual functioning are more sensitive to any medication,and thus administering regular dosages to such patients could cause something that is almost like being intoxicated with medication.tr.at.
the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting the government motion and permitting involuntary medication.appealed.
it is law that possesses a significant liberty interest in avoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.washington harper,d.in,however,the supreme court recognized in sell the right of the government to seek involuntary medication of a defendant who,even after months of hospitalization,is found incompetent to stand trial,d.prior to sell,the government could request an order of involuntary medication only upon a showing that the defendant was dangerous to himself or others,see harper,at.
the court stated in sell that instances of involuntary medication of a defendant solely to render him competent to stand trial should be rare and occur only in limited circumstances.at.in light of this admonishment,the court set forth the inquiry a district court must undertake before granting a motion for involuntary medication.
first,the court must find that important governmental interests are at stake second,the court must conclude that involuntary medication will significantly further those concomitant state interests third,the court must conclude that involuntary medication is necessary to further those interests and f ourth,the court must conclude that administration of the drugs is medically appropriate,in the patient best interest in light of his medical condition.
id.at.emphasis in original.
although the court did not set forth the government burden of proof on each of these four prongs,we have since held in bradley,at,that sell first important governmental interests are at reviewed de novo,as is the second involuntary medication will significantly further those state interests.see id.we said the remaining two sell factors,which depend on factual findings,are reviewed for clear error.id.given the vital constitutional liberty at stake,id.at,we held that the district court must find all necessary facts by clear and convincing evidence,id.see also united states gomes,cir.
on appeal,contends that before considering the sell factors,the district court was required by this court opinion in united states morrison,cir,to make preliminary findings regarding dangerousness to himself or others and the government failed to show by clear and convincing evidence a need for treatment sufficient to overcome his protected interest in refusing it.we address each issue in turn.
as we have previously noted,the supreme court made clear in sell that orders permitting forcible medication based solely on the need to render an incompetent defendant competent to stand trial should be rare and occur only in limited circumstances.at.one means of rendering a sell order rare is to first conduct a harper inquiry to determine whether the defendant may be involuntarily medicated because he presents a danger to himself or others.if a district court may order involuntary medication based on the harper inquiry,then there is no need to consider a sell order.as we recognized in morrison,the court implicitly favored involuntary medication on harper dangerousness grounds over involuntary medication merely on sell incompetence grounds and directed courts,when appropriate,first to consider the applicability of harper before turning to sell.see united states white,cir united states,cir morrison,at.
in the present case,no suggestion was ever made that a harper inquiry was appropriate or necessary,no doubt because there is no evidence that might present a danger to himself or others.because dangerousness was never an issue,the district court was not obligated to perform a harper inquiry before it performed its sell inquiry.our opinion in morrison does not hold to the contrary.unlike,the defendant in morrison was charged with a crime that was fundamentally violent in nature,namely,the transmission of communications threatening to kill or injure other people.morrison,at.more importantly,no evidence was presented showing morrison was not dangerous.instead,the evidence focused entirely on his competence to stand trial.under those circumstances,we held the district court must first consider whether morrison could be involuntarily medicated under harper before it considered whether he could be medicated under sell.id.at.here,all parties expressly stated that did not present a danger to himself or others.accordingly,there was no need for the district court to perform a harper inquiry or make harper findings.
also contends the government failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that its interest in medicating him outweighed his constitutionally protected interest in refusing medication.this claim essentially challenges the district court factual findings and conclusions of law regarding the nature and weight of the governmental interests at stake,the appropriateness of medicating,and the likelihood that medication will render him competent to stand trial.
the sell hearing here was conducted prior to the publication of our decision in bradley,and the record reveals uncertainty as to the nature and extent of the government burden of proof.the government argued it should be held to no more than a preponderance of the evidence standard,tr.although the district court did state that it would be surprised if the standard were a preponderance,the court never stated on the record what burden it was applying.id.at.more importantly,the court did not set forth a standard in its written opinion ordering involuntary medication.
as to the first sell factor,the district court stated that reentry after being previously deported following conviction for an aggravated felony is a serious crime,and hence the government possesses an important interest in the timely prosecution of valenzuela puentes,vol.i,doc.at.the court further stated that in order to ensure a fair trial must be competent,that is,able to assist his attorney in his own defense.id.
as to the second factor,the court concluded that administration of the drugs is substantially likely to render competent to stand trial,noting that capehart specifically so testified.the court also pointed to both capehart and fiszbein testimony that they regularly prescribe antipsychotic medication to delusional patients,and said that failed to show he may be particularly susceptible to developing any serious side effects.id.at.
as to the third factor,the court held an order permitting involuntary medication was the least intrusive,necessary means of furthering the government interest in prosecuting.the court cited capehart testimony that was unlikely to respond to other forms of treatment,and that a contempt of court order requiring to him to accept medication would be insufficient.thus,forcibly medicating is the only way the government can restore him to competency.id.at.
finally,the court held that administering antipsychotic medication to was in his best medical interests.although recognizing the scant knowledge relating to medical history made it unclear whether he will exhibit any side effects as a result of taking medication,the court noted that both capehart and fiszbein regularly prescribe antipsychotic drugs to treat patients with the same psychosis as valenzuela puentes.id.the court further stated that 
t hough neither doctor could guarantee that the drugs would completely eliminate valenzuela puentes delusions,the court finds that administering antipsychotic medication to valenzuela puentes is in his best medical interests because the medicine could potentially cure his psychosis or at least allow him to more ably assist counsel in his own defense.
we turn first to whether the district court erred in its conclusion that the government has a significant interest in involuntarily medicating.as we stated in bradley,it is law that the government interest in bringing a criminal defendant to trial is fundamental in nature.at citing illinois allen,d brennan,concurring.moreover,the government has an important interest in maintaining the integrity of the criminal justice system.as the second circuit said in gomes,at,going ahead with a criminal trial with a certifiedly delusional defendant advancing a possibly delusional defense is not an option in our system.in sum,the government has an important interest in prosecuting defendants for serious crimes with which they are charged and in ensuring their mental competence for the duration of their prosecutions.
argues that in his case the government interest is lessened,claiming the crime with which he was charged is not a serious crime because n o specific intent is required n o victims are involved n o threatening or violent conduct is involved and t ypically no one is put in danger or at risk except the defendant himself when an individual illegally reenters the united states.aplt.br.at.under the circumstances of this particular case,we are not persuaded.whether a crime is serious relates to the possible penalty the defendant faces if convicted,as well as the nature or effect of the underlying conduct for which he was charged.see bradley,at no contest as to seriousness of charges faced by defendant where he faced possible imprisonment for up to fifty years united states evans,cir defendant faced a serious charge with a statutory maximum punishment of ten years incarceration for threatening to murder a federal judge.see also united states,cir charge of illegal reentry after having been deported following conviction for an aggravated felony where defendant faced a possible prison term of twenty years a serious charge for purposes of the speedy trial act.if convicted on the charges against him,faces a statutory maximum prison term of twenty years,although if he pleads guilty he will likely be sentenced within the guideline range to a term of to months,or between six to eight years.aplt.br.at.we consider a maximum sentence of twenty years and a likely guideline sentence of six to eight years sufficient to render the underlying crime serious.this is particularly so given long criminal history.docum
