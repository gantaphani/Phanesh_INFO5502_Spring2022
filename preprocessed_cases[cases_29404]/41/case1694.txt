background 
rai,a corporation that provides residential services to disabled individuals who can not live independently or without supervision,hired buboltz in,as a direct service provider dsp.as a dsp,buboltz was responsible for providing service and support to meet the needs of the residents in rai homes part and parcel of a dsps responsibilities is providing transportation to the residents.when,however,rai hired buboltz,it knew that she was legally blind,and acknowledged,in writing,that the transportation requirement did not apply to buboltz.
buboltz worked at rai for nearly five years without incident,other than minor problems,such as giving a disabled person his medicine three hours late.in,however,officials at rai became concerned with buboltz job performance.specifically,laure verdoes,rai lifestyle specialist,whose job it was to assess the quality of rai services,and apparently,its compliance with government regulations,observed buboltz doing the following touching the crotch of a resident to see if the resident had urinated on herself holding documents upside down during an attempt to read them taking a long time to read and failing to realize the presence of verdoes,who was in the same office.verdoes reported her observations and attendant concerns,which ultimately made their way to sharon leppla,buboltz supervisor.leppla,however,disclaimed these observations,and stated she had no worries with buboltz.
despite leppla reassurances,approximately two months after verdoes expressed her concerns,managers at rai told buboltz that she could no longer dispense medication or work alone with the residents.upon learning of these restrictions,buboltz requested a meeting to discuss rai concerns.at the meeting,leppla stated that rai made the changes to buboltz job because of concern that the licensing agencies may have a problem with her eyesight.buboltz responded,i have,like,numerous devices that i can use.rai also told buboltz that she was responsible for informing her of her new job restrictions.as a result of the job restrictions,other dsps expressed frustration with buboltz,causing her to feel stressed and anxious about her job.
after rai reduced buboltz job requirements,it told buboltz that she would have to work every other weekend,which she had never done since being hired in.buboltz was the only dsp who had not previously worked weekends.this change in scheduling initially increased buboltz hours however,rai later reduced buboltz hours when it stopped consistently scheduling her for weekday shifts also,after rai reduced buboltz job requirements,leppla met with buboltz and held a performance discussion.this was the first such discussion in buboltz history at rai.the discussion resulted in a negative performance evaluation.approximately one month after the performance discussion,buboltz submitted a resignation letter,which became effective on august.
four months after buboltz resignation,on december,after buboltz obtained a letter from the equal employment opportunity commission,she filed suit against rai in federal district court alleging disparate treatment and failure to accommodate claims.as to buboltz disparate treatment contentions,the district court concluded buboltz failed to make out a prima facie case of discrimination because she failed to show she had suffered an adverse employment action.anent buboltz failure to accommodate argument,the district court ruled that rai satisfied its duty to make reasonable accommodations.buboltz challenges both rulings.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.cherry ritenour sch,cir.in doing so,we apply the same standard as the district court,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and giving that party the benefit of all inferences that may reasonably be drawn.id.a moving party is entitled to summary judgment if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
buboltz disparate treatment claims 
buboltz asserts a disparate treatment claim under both the ada and the rehabilitation act.both the ada and the rehabilitation act prohibit employers from discriminating against a disabled individual qualified for a job because of the disability of such individual.a.our cases interpreting these acts are interchangeable accordingly,we apply the same analysis to both claims.wojewski rapid city reg l,cir.to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination,a plaintiff must show that she was disabled,that she was qualified to do the essential job function with or without reasonable accommodation,and that she suffered an adverse action due to her disability.eeoc stores,cir.
here,only the third prong of buboltz prima facie she suffered an adverse at issue.buboltz contends she did rai disagrees.specifically,buboltz argues that rai took the following adverse actions against her it eliminated essential functions of her job,namely administering medicine and working alone with the residents it tripled her work hours and it constructively discharged her.
an adverse employment action is a tangible change in working conditions that produces a material employment disadvantage.thomas corwin,cir.termination,cuts in pay or benefits,and changes that affect an employee future career prospects are significant enough to meet this standard,as are circumstances amounting to a constructive discharge.higgins gonzales,cir.changes in intangible employment conditions may also constitute an adverse employment action.see meyers.health human,cir.nevertheless,not everything that makes an employee unhappy is an actionable adverse action.montandon farmland,cir internal quotations omitted discussing an unlawful retaliation claim in the context of title vii.for example,a job reassignment involving no corresponding reduction in salary,benefits,or prestige is insufficient to establish an adverse employment action.id.additionally,minor changes in duties or working conditions,even unpalatable or unwelcome ones,which cause no materially significant disadvantage do not satisfy this prong.higgins,at see also harlston mcdonnell douglas,cir holding job changes that amount to nothing more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities are not adverse actions.
buboltz first contention,that rai decision to remove two of her essential functions constituted an adverse action,fails.rai decision to remove buboltz duty of administering medicine did not have a material disadvantage to buboltz,as it comprised little of her time and did not likely hamper her future at rai rai decision to require buboltz not to work alone with residents was also not an adverse action.although buboltz argues this restriction prohibited her from providing direct care to the residents,she fails to show what direct care she was precluded from providing.indeed,buboltz admits that this restriction was superfluous when the home was triple staffed,which it almost always was.moreover,an alteration of job responsibilities,like the elimination of the duty to dispense medications or work alone with residents,does not constitute an adverse action.harlston,at.in sum,buboltz first contention fails.
buboltz next argues that rai requirement that she work every other weekend,when rai had not required her to do so over the past five years,constituted an adverse action.dsps,as an essential function of their job,are required to work hours as required and scheduled.all the other dsps at rai worked sc
