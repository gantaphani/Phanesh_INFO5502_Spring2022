this case is about the responsibility of a public school district to provide an education to a student afflicted with rett syndrome,which is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by normal early development followed by loss of purposeful use of the hands,distinctive hand movements,slowed brain and head growth,gait abnormalities,seizures,and mental retardation.see national institute of neurological disorders and stroke,rett syndrome fact sheet.htm css print visited april,rett syndrome fact sheet.the student parents,michael and diane ross,believed that high school district failed to provide their daughter,lindsey,who suffers from rett syndrome,with the free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment to which she is entitled under the individuals with disabilities education act idea.an independent hearing officer held a lengthy hearing and upheld the district placement of lindsey.both the district and lindsey parents then turned to the district court,which granted summary judgment to the district on all counts.
shortly after the district court issued its opinion in this case,lindsey and her parents filed a second lawsuit against the district and its director for special education.as we explain in the companion opinion issued today in ross ii,the district court dismissed most of the claims in the second case on the basis of claim preclusion it dismissed some supplemental state claims without prejudice.while we appreciate that lindsey parents sincerely believe that her best interests would have been served better under a different plan,we conclude that the district court in both cases correctly held in favor of the school authorities and we therefore affirm.
in approaching this kind of case,a district court must take as the basis of its decision the administrative record that the independent hearing officer compiled it then has the discretion to admit additional evidence to supplement the record.i c.once the record is complete,the court is to base its decision on the preponderance of the evidence and to grant such relief as it determines is appropriate.id.the supreme court has interpreted this to require the initial reviewing is,the district make an independent decision based on the preponderance of the evidence.see bd.of educ.of the hendrick hudson cent.sch.dist.rowley,d.at the same time,the court must give due weight to the determinations made during the state administrative process.id.the rowley court emphasized that the provision that a reviewing court base its decision on the preponderance of the evidence is by no means an invitation to the courts to substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which they review.id.see patricia bd.of educ.of oak park,cir.
rowley described the reviewing court task as follows 
a court inquiry in suits brought under e is twofold.first,has the state complied with the procedures set forth in the act and second,is the individualized educational program developed through the act procedures reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits if these requirements are met,the state has complied with the obligations imposed by congress and the courts can require no more.
at.we have interpreted this to mean that we should review the administrative record and the district court findings of fact deferentially.we will reverse only if those findings are clearly erroneous.see heather state of wisconsin,cir.we review questions of law,as usual,de novo.like the district court,we must refrain from imposing our own notions of sound educational policy for those of the responsible school authorities.id.at.we note as well that at the administrative level,the supreme court has held that the burden of proof in a hearing challenging an educational placement decision is on the party seeking relief.see schaffer ex rel.schaffer weast,d.in this case,the parties seeking relief in the form of a different placement for lindsey were lindsey and her parents under schaffer,they had the burden of proof.
victims of rett syndrome are almost all female,because it is caused by mutations on a gene found on the x with the damaged gene usually die shortly after birth.see rett syndrome fact sheet.the severity of any given person disease varies.the district court described lindsey condition as follows 
lindsey is nonverbal and suffers from apraxia,an inconsistent ability to control the body and limbs.she has,however,a higher level of motor functioning than the majority of girls with rett syndrome among other things,lindsey can swim,ski,and ride a horse.lindsey also has a higher level of cognitive functioning than most girls with rett syndrome.though the average mental age of girls afflicted with rett syndrome is estimated to be eight to ten months,doctors estimate lindsey cognition to be between the seven and twelve year old equivalency it should be noted,however,that because girls with rett syndrome are nonverbal and have poor motor control,it is quite difficult to measure their cognitive ability accurately.
among the many effects of rett syndrome are that lindsey hands get locked together,and she needs assistance in unlocking them.in addition,and perhaps significantly for purposes of this case,lindsey engages in vocalizations,which can be loud and last for anywhere from a few seconds to over a minute.the cause and meaning of the vocalizations is not known with any certainty.rett syndrome also causes lindsey to engage in behaviors,which include hitting herself on the chin or head,the cause of which is also unknown.lindsey also sometimes strikes others,usually by butting them with her head.
until she entered high school,lindsey attended regular public schools in her educational jargon,she was mainstreamed.in the fall of,she entered james conant high school,in hoffman estates,illinois conant is one of the five high schools within district.that year,she was placed in five regular education classes she received extensive assistance from her own special education teacher and teacher aide,who accompanied her throughout the day.they provided whatever academic or physical services she required,including behavioral interventions,calming measures,assistance with hygienic needs,and help with communication devices.conant provided a work room for her private use,for times when she needed individualized instruction or she had to be separated from the other students.occasionally,separation became necessary.for example,in may of her freshman year,she two staff members,causing nasal fractures in both.following these incidents,she was removed from conant.over the summer,her parents had her evaluated by a specialist in alabama,who recommended continued monitoring.at approximately the same time,the district arranged for a multidisciplinary review of lindsey case to be conducted by bennett leventhal and marrea winnega of the university of chicago developmental disorders clinic.this review concluded that lindsey behavior was interfering with her ability to make educational progress and recommended that she be taken out of conant and placed in a special education setting.
on august,the district held a meeting for the purpose of reviewing lindsey individualized education plan iep for her upcoming sophomore year.the district recommended special placement,but lindsey parents strongly maintained that she would be better off remaining at conant.they requested an administrative hearing and indicated that they wanted to exercise the stay put provision of the idea,j,under which an eligible student remains in her current school or program during the pendency of an administrative hearing.litigation erupted at that point the district filed suit in the federal district court,asking it to prohibit the parents from invoking the stay put provision.the court granted a temporary restraining order,but matters calmed down somewhat when the parents decided to keep lindsey at home rather than put her in the special education setting.
under a compromise memorialized in an agreement dated november,the parties agreed that lindsey was to be returned to conant as soon as possible.the parties also agreed to submit the question of lindsey placement to a panel of three experts,leventhal,victor morris a specialist in educational and behavioral programming for students with autism spectrum disorders,including rett syndrome,and alice belgrade a behavioral specialist with teaching experience.the panel members did not work well together.nonetheless,they were able to agree that lindsey could return to conant in the spring of.she did so effective april,with a shortened schedule of three periods lunch,physical education,and english.as before,she had a special education teacher and a teacher aide to assist her.
lindsey attended school for days under that arrangement.logs kept by her special education teacher reflected the fact that she spent most of her time in her private work room,rather than in the classroom,because her behavior or disruptive vocalizations often required her to leave the other students.her academic progress was limited,but she improved various functional skills such as using a spoon,sorting,and responding to personal greetings.according to her parents,more could have been accomplished if the district had kept its word in other respects.they accuse the district of failing to provide some of the aids and services that it had promised,such as the creation of a special circle of friends to facilitate peer interaction,occupational therapy,and a properly fitting weighted vest which was used to help calm her.she completed her sophomore year in june.over the summer,her special education teacher decided not to return to district,and the district decided not to rehire the teacher aide.it hired replacements for both.lindsey parents believe that the departure of the teacher and the aide was a blow to lindsey progress,since she had developed an excellent rapport with them.
in august the iep team met to decide how to structure lindsey junior year.the team initially included lindsey parents,their attorney,the assistant director of special education for the district,the district attorney,two members of the expert panel,lindsey english teacher,and her physical therapist.morris,one of the panel members,resigned because of his disagreements with the others over the best course of action for lindsey.the result of these meetings was the district acquiescence in the plan proposed by lindsey parents,under which she was to return to conant in the fall and take a full day of classes.
soon after the school year began,it became apparent that lindsey was having problems.she was often tardy to class her classroom behavior deteriorated she suffered from medical problems perhaps because of those complications she was fatigued and unsteady on her feet and her motor skills seemed worse.the net result was that she was in school for the full six periods on only five days during september and october.the new teacher and teacher aide did not respond to these problems as effectively as the parents believed they should,nor did they try hard enough in the parents opinion to win lindsey trust.the district decided to convene a meeting of the iep team on november.opinions differed on the question whether lindsey should stay at conant or be moved to a special education setting.at the end of that meeting,the district decided to change her placement to a multiple needs program it recommended the one provided by lake park high school,which is run by the north dupage special education cooperative.
lindsey parents opposed that recommendation,but the district evidently least by the end of that the time for discussion was over.indeed,the parents assert that the november meeting itself was a sham and that the district had already decided to take lindsey out of conant.as proof,they point to the fact that the district had stationed its attorney at the federal courthouse with instructions to file a previously prepared lawsuit against the parents in case they did not acquiesce in its decision.in fact,that suit was filed and the district sought an emergency motion to permit it to move lindsey.this is why the district appears in this litigation as the plaintiff and the parents as defendants.not long afterwards,lindsey parents filed a request for administrative review,as they were entitled to do under federal and state law.see b ilcs.
the independent hearing officer,carolyn smaron,heard testimony for days,making lindsey the longest special education due process hearing in illinois history,according to the district court.the hearing officer issued a decision in which she concluded that the district placement decision was appropriate.lindsey parents appealed that decision to the district court under i a.in addition to asking for various forms of relief against the district,the parents also filed a against the illinois state board of education isbe,in which they alleged that isbe violated the idea,the americans with disabilities act,et,and section of the rehabilitation act,by failing to ensure that the district educate lindsey at conant.as noted earlier,the district court took some additional testimony before rendering its decision.on for summary judgment,it denied the parents motion and granted the district motion.it also found that its ruling in the district favor required judgment in isbe favor on the claim.lindsey parents now appeal to this court.
the idea guarantees disabled children the right to a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment.in order to implement that promise,of the act requires a school district to assess the child educational needs and to develop an iep based on that assessment.rowley makes clear that the statute imposes both a procedural obligation and a substantive obligation on the state.at.lindsey parents,on their own and her behalf,argue that the district failed to satisfy the statute in either respect.we address their arguments in turn.
procedural compliance 
the parents claim that the meetings that the district,but not only,the meeting of november,nothing but an elaborate effort to ratify a decision that the district had already made without their input.if this were true,then it would violate the idea.the central tool that the statute uses for the development of a proper educational program for each disabled child is the iep,which is defined as a written statement for each child with a disability that is developed,reviewed,and revised in accordance with section d of this title.the idea lays out an elaborate set of procedures that govern the process of developing an iep.see a c.throughout,the statute assures the parents an active and meaningful role in the development or modification of their child iep.if a school district were to change a student placement without observing those rules,it would violate the procedural obligations under the statute to which rowley referred.see deal hamilton county bd.of,cir spielberg ex rel.spielberg henrico county pub.schs,cir construing education of all handicapped children act,predecessor to idea.
while we can appreciate the frustration that lindsey parents felt at the conclusion of the november hearing,we can not say that the district court clearly erred when it found that they had a meaningful opportunity to participate in the development and review of lindsey iep.the parents point to three pieces of evidence that contradict this finding,in their opinion.first,during the august iep meeting,district officials left the room and drafted an addendum to the plan that read as follows 
by the end of her ninth grade year staff members who worked closely with lindsey sincerely believed she was receiving virtually no educational benefit in the mainstream.based on these beliefs,public school personnel recommended a placement at a separate school designed to appropriately meet lindsey needs.
t he belief among district staff that lindsey is not being appropriately served in the mainstream still exists however,staff is also advised by legal counsel that the settlement agreement continues to control and therefore they will in good faith implement whatever iep is agreed upon today.were it not for the settlement agreement,as a matter of conscience,public school personnel would continue to recommend an appro
