this lawsuit is an attempt by medicaid recipients in georgia who have been injured by the use of tobacco products to obtain from the state a portion of the proceeds that it is due to receive under the billion master settlement agreement consummated by the tobacco industry and states in.georgia is scheduled to receive billion under that agreement,and the plaintiffs contend that the medicaid act,et,entitles them to some of that money.the defendants,who are various georgia officials and a state agency,think otherwise.the district court held that the lawsuit was barred by the eleventh amendment.we affirm that holding as to the state agency,but do not reach the more difficult issue of whether the eleventh amendment bars the lawsuit insofar as the state officials are concerned,because we conclude that it lacks merit anyway.
background 
on august,the state of georgia and two state officials filed suit in the superior court of fulton county against six cigarette manufacturers and others tobacco companies,alleging that they had unlawfully shifted the financial responsibility to the state for the health care costs attributable to their addictive,injurious,and unreasonably dangerous products.the complaint contained eleven counts alleging violations of state law and requesting monetary and equitable relief it sought restitution in excess of billion dollars for medical assistance that the state estimated it had paid on behalf of medicaid recipients who suffered from injuries and illnesses.
the lawsuit was settled.on november,georgia,and other states,entered into an agreement with the tobacco companies known as the master settlement agreement.as part of that agreement,the tobacco companies agreed to pay georgia an estimated billion over the course of years,with the first payment of million coming in december of.
the settlement agreement stipulates that the payments are in settlement of antitrust,consumer protection,common law negligence,statutory,common law and equitable claims for monetary,restitutionary,equitable and injunctive relief brought by the settling states against the tobacco companies.it defines released claims as follows 
for past conduct,acts or omissions including any damages incurred in the future arising from such past conduct,acts,or omissions,those claims directly or indirectly based on,arising out of or in any way related,in whole or in part,to a the use,sale,distribution,manufacture,development,advertising,marketing or health effects of,b the exposure to,or c research,statements,or warnings regarding,tobacco products including,but not limited to,the claims asserted in the actions identified in exhibit d,or any comparable claims that were,could be or could have been asserted now or in the future in those actions or in any comparable action in federal,state or local court brought by a settling state or a releasing party whether or not such settling state or releasing party has brought such action,except for claims not asserted in the actions identified in exhibit d for outstanding liability under existing licensing or similar fee laws or existing tax laws but not excepting claims for any tax liability of the organizations or of any released party with respect to such organizations,which claims are covered by the release and covenants set forth in this agreement 
for future conduct,acts or omissions,only those monetary claims directly or indirectly based on,arising out of or in any way related to,in whole or in part,the use of or exposure to tobacco products manufactured in the ordinary course of business,including without limitation any future claims for reimbursement of health care costs allegedly associated with the use of or exposure to tobacco products.
the settlement agreement also defines the releasing parties 
pp releasing parties means each settling state and any of its past,present,and future agents,officials acting in their official capacities,legal representatives,agencies,departments,commissions and divisions and also means,to the full extent of the power of the signatories hereto to release past,present,and future claims,the following any settling state subdivisions political or otherwise,including,but not limited to,municipalities,counties,parishes,villages,unincorporated districts and hospital districts,public entities,public instrumentalities and public educational institutions and persons or entities acting in a parents patriae,sovereign,private attorney general,qui tam,taxpayer,or any other capacity,whether or not any of them participate in this settlement,a to the extent that any such person or entity is seeking relief on behalf of or generally applicable to the general public in such settling state or the people of the state,as opposed solely to private or individual relief for separate and distinct injuries,or b to the extent that any such entity as opposed to an individual is seeking recovery of expenses other than premium or capitation payments for the benefit of present or retired state employees paid or reimbursed,directly or indirectly,by a settling state.
as the quoted provisions indicate,by entering into the settlement agreement georgia released its past and future claims against the tobacco companies relating to the manufacture and use of tobacco products,but it did not purport to release private or individual claims based on separate and distinct injuries those were expressly excepted from release.
the plaintiffs in this case are individuals who suffer or have suffered from a variety of illnesses caused by the use of tobacco products,and who have been recipients of medical assistance payments under georgia federally supported medicaid program.they brought this putative class action in january,on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated,alleging violations of the medicaid act and the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.they contend that federal law,b,entitles them to that amount of the settlement proceeds georgia is scheduled to receive which exceeds the amount the state has actually expended on medical assistance.the defendants are the georgia department of community health,which,through its division of medical assistance,is responsible for administering georgia medicaid program as well as various state officials.
the complaint in this case asks for declaratory and injunctive relief,specifically requesting that orders be issued requiring the defendants to disburse to the plaintiffs that portion of the tobacco litigation settlement proceeds that belong to the plaintiffs,and enjoining the defendants to provide to each and every member of the plaintiff class due process of law concerning all property previously taken,including notice,information and documents regarding each plaintiff share of the settlement proceeds,and hearings to allow individual plaintiffs to challenge denials of those proceeds.the complaint includes claims that the defendants violated the medicaid act,a b,by failing to seek reimbursement from third parties for medical assistance payments made by the state,and that the defendants have violated and are violating federal law by failing to distribute a portion of the settlement proceeds to the plaintiffs.however,at least before this court,the plaintiffs have abandoned any claims about past violations of federal law,and insist that they seek only future compliance with federal law at each future point when the federal law becomes applicable to collected funds.brief for appellant at,mcclendon.of cmty.health,cir.
the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss on the ground that,under the eleventh amendment,the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs suit.
ii.contentions of the parties 
the plaintiffs contend that notwithstanding the dictates of the eleventh amendment,their suit is permissible under the doctrine announced in ex parte young.the young doctrine permits federal courts to entertain suits against state officers seeking prospective equitable relief to end continuing violations of federal law.see summit med,pryor,cir,cert.denied,d summit medical.according to the plaintiffs,the relief they seek is prospective because the defendants will not violate federal law,b,until some time in the future,when georgia receives settlement proceeds from the tobacco companies in excess of the state actual medical assistance payments,and unlawfully fails to disburse those excess proceeds to them.the plaintiffs claim that point has not yet been reached and will not be reached until years in the future.
the defendants argue that the district court correctly determined that the eleventh amendment bars the plaintiffs claims because those claims are not for prospective relief,but instead are claims for money damages based on a past violation of federal law.the defendants also argue that,even if the plaintiffs suit fits within the ex parte young doctrine,it is still barred by the eleventh amendment because the relief the plaintiffs seek would infringe on georgia special sovereignty interests in controlling property received in the settlement of a lawsuit.in the alternative,the defendants argue,the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the plaintiffs,of course,maintain that they have stated a valid claim for relief.
iii.discussion 
a.the eleventh amendment 
the eleventh amendment provides that t he judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.const.amend.xi.though by its plain terms the eleventh amendment only precludes federal courts from entertaining suits against a state brought by citizens of another state,it has been construed to bar suits against a state brought by that state own citizens as well.see,bd.of trs.of of garrett,d.the amendment is rooted in the recognition that states,though part of a union,retain attributes of sovereignty,including immunity from being compelled to appear in the courts of another sovereign against their will.see puerto rico aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d dekalb county sch.dist.schrenko,cir.in short,the eleventh amendment ultimate guarantee is that nonconsenting states may not be sued by private individuals in federal court.see garrett.at,d kimel.bd.of regents,d.
because the eleventh amendment represents a constitutional limitation on the federal judicial power established in article iii,see pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d,federal courts lack jurisdiction to entertain claims that are barred by the eleventh amendment.see vermont agency of natural res.united states,d pennhurst,at.at the significance of the eleventh amendment lies in its affirmation that the fundamental principle of sovereign immunity limits the grant of judicial authority in art.iii.internal marks and citation omitted.in accordance with the jurisdictional nature of the eleventh amendment limitation on judicial authority,the supreme court has held that the eleventh amendment defense need not be raised in the trial court,edelman jordan,d,and may be raised for the first time by a state on appeal,see ford motor of treasury.
but the jurisdictional bar embodied in the eleventh amendment is a rather peculiar kind of jurisdictional issue.united states scs bus.tech.unlike most subject matter jurisdiction issues,which can not be waived by the parties and must be raised by a court on its own initiative,the eleventh amendment does not automatically deprive a court of original jurisdiction.wisconsin of corrections schacht,d see calderon ashmus,d while the eleventh amendment is jurisdictional in the sense that it is a limitation on the federal court judicial power,we have recognized that it is not coextensive with the limitations on judicial power in article iii.rather,the supreme court has explained,the eleventh amendment grants the state a legal power to assert a sovereign immunity defense should it choose to do so.schacht,at.at.this understanding of the eleventh amendment as a volitional defense is manifest in decisions allowing it to be waived by the state,see,atascadero state hosp.scanlon,d,or ignored by the court if not raised,see,patsy bd.of regents of,d.thus,unlike other jurisdictional bars,federal courts are required to consider whether the eleventh amendment strips them of jurisdiction only if the state defendant insists that it does.
the supreme court decision in patsy illustrates the elective nature of the eleventh amendment jurisdictional bar.see,d.in that case the defendant,the board of regents of the state of florida,raised an eleventh amendment defense in its brief to the original court of appeals panel,and in its response in opposition to the plaintiff petition for certiorari.see id.at.at.although the eleventh amendment defense had been raised by the defendant before the case reached that level,the supreme court declined to consider whether it barred the plaintiff suit,explaining that we have never held that the eleventh amendment is jurisdictional in the sense that it must be raised and decided by this court on its own motion.id.the defendant in patsy had expressly requested that the court not pass on the state potential eleventh amendment immunity and,consequently,the court disposed of the case solely on the merits.id.in doing so,the court noted that its disposition of the case did not preclude the board of regents from raising its eleventh amendment claim on remand.id.
the defendants in this case have put forth two alternative bases for affirming the district court dismissal of the plaintiffs claims.they contend that we can dismiss this lawsuit either because the eleventh amendment deprives us of jurisdiction to consider it,or because the plaintiffs complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.after summarizing their eleventh amendment defense,the defendants stated in their reply brief that t he dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint can also be affirmed on the ground that their complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.brief for appellant at,mcclendon.of cmty.health,cir.at oral argument before this court,counsel for the defendants stated that e ither the eleventh amendment or the plaintiffs failure to state a claim is sufficient basis to affirm the district court decision.
we interpret the defendants position as a conditional assertion of eleventh amendment sovereign insist upon that defense only if it is necessary to prevent judgment against them on the merits.in other words,the defendants are willing to withhold the assertion of the eleventh amendment provided that our disposition of the merits issue is favorable to them.only if we are going to decide the merits issue against them do they insist upon a ruling on the eleventh amendment issue.because the eleventh amendment grants the state a legal power to assert a sovereign immunity defense should it choose to do so,schacht,at.at,the defendants are free to conditionally assert that defense in order to allow a federal court to decide in their favor on the merits.accord united states ex rel.long scs bus.tech,parella ret,cir see also floyd thompson,cir.but see united states.tech,cir holding that federal courts must consider eleventh amendment defense before addressing merits 
the proposition that a federal court may consider the merits before determining the applicability of an eleventh amendment immunity defense when a state invites it to do so may appear to conflict with our decision in seaborn florida,cir,but we do not believe there is a conflict when the holding of that case is limited to the circumstances that gave rise to it.in seaborn,we did say that an assertion of eleventh amendment immunity must be resolved before a court may address the merits of the underlying claim s.id.at citing steel citizens for a better env t,d however,in contrast to the defendants here,there is no indication that the defendants in seaborn expressed a willingness to permit the court to reach the merits instead of considering the eleventh amendment issue.because the defendants in this case have conditionally consented to us bypassing the eleventh amendment issue and proceeding directly to the merits,this is a different case than seaborn.see generally united states ag
