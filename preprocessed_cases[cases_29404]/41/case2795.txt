pursuant to the department of defense anthrax vaccine immunization program,members of the armed forces may be ordered to submit to inoculation against anthrax disease.eight servicemembers brought suit in district court to challenge the food and drug administration approval of the anthrax vaccine and to enjoin the defense department from administering it.the district court dismissed three counts of the complaint on the merits and dismissed a fourth count because the plaintiffs lack standing to make it.we affirm.
anthrax is an acute bacterial disease caused by infection with spores of bacillus anthracis.it can be contracted through three routes of exposure by skin contact cutaneously,by inhalation,and by ingestion.from,a clinical study led by philip brachman tested an anthrax vaccine produced by the department of defense dod.see philip brachman et,field evaluation of a human anthrax vaccine,am.pub.health hereinafter brachman study.brachman studied textile workers exposed to imported goat hair,dividing the population into a vaccine group,a placebo group,and an observational no treatment group.id.at,during the study,cases of anthrax occurred contracted cutaneously and by inhalation.id.at.three of the cutaneous cases occurred in the vaccine group the remainder,and all inhalation cases,occurred in the placebo and observational groups.id.the study calculated that the vaccine was percent effective lower percent confidence limit percent.id.at.the study noted,however,that the small number of inhalation cases makes the data less significant in showing effectiveness of the vaccine with respect to that form of the disease.id.at.
dod subsequently contracted with merck,sharpe,dohme to develop a new version of the vaccine for production.see food and drug administration fda,biological products bacterial vaccines and toxoids implementation of efficacy review anthrax vaccine adsorbed final order,hereinafter final order.later,it entered into a similar contract with the michigan department of public health mdph,the relevant division of which is now operated by the bioport corporation.id.at.produced and continues to produce the current generation of the vaccine,known as anthrax vaccine adsorbed ava.id.at.
prior to,the national institutes of health nih was the agency responsible for the licensing of biological products.see final order.at.in,nih issued a license for ava.as labeled,the vaccine was to be administered in a sequence,with specified intervals between each inoculation.id.at.
in,responsibility for licensing biological products was transferred from nih to the fda.id.at.the fda then issued procedures for determining that products previously licensed by nih are safe,effective,and not misbranded.procedures for review of safety,effectiveness and labeling,codified as amended at.under those procedures,the fda appoints an independent advisory panel to report on covered products.see a,e.after reviewing the panel recommendations,the fda makes its own determination,which it publishes as a proposed order along with the panel report.see id.f.after receiving and reviewing comments,the fda publishes a final order.see id.g.
in,the fda announced that advisory panels would review the safety and effectiveness of several vaccines previously licensed by nih,including ava.biological products bacterial vaccines and toxoids with standards of potency,single or in combination safety,effectiveness and labeling review request for data information.in,an advisory panel submitted a report finding that the best evidence for the efficacy of anthrax vaccine comes from the field trial conducted by brachman.biological products bacterial vaccines and toxoids implementation of efficacy review.although the panel concluded that inhalation anthrax occurred too infrequently in the brachman study to assess the protective effect of vaccine against this form of the disease,it recommended categorizing ava as safe and effective under the limited circumstances for which it is employed.id.at.in,the fda issued a proposed order classifying ava as safe and effective and not misbranded,id.at,but it did not issue a final order,see final order.at.
in,dod implemented the anthrax vaccine immunization program avip,which subjected members of the armed forces at risk of anthrax exposure to mandatory administration of ava.see id.at.thereafter,congress directed dod to support an independent examination of ava by the institute of medicine of the national academy of sciences.see,at.a committee convened by the institute conducted the study,examined all available data,and concluded that,a s indicated by evidence from studies in both humans and animals,ava,as licensed,is an effective vaccine to protect humans against anthrax,including inhalational anthrax.comm.to assess the safety and efficacy of the anthrax vaccine,institute of medicine,the anthrax vaccine is it safe does it work hereinafter institute of medicine report.
meanwhile,in july,a shortage of the vaccine resulted in a temporary suspension of dod vaccination program,causing servicemembers who had begun the regimen to miss scheduled shots.first am.compl,rempfer von eschenbach,d.according to the plaintiffs,when the suspension ended in,dod announced that personnel whose vaccination series had been interrupted would not repeat any doses already received but would instead continue with the next dose in the series.first am.compl.
six servicemembers sought to enjoin the vaccination program in.doe rumsfeld,d.although they did not dispute that ava had been approved as safe and effective against cutaneous anthrax,they argued that it was not a licensed vaccine for inhalational anthrax.id.as a consequence,they maintained,f barred administration of the vaccine without either informed consent or a presidential waiver 
finding a likelihood of success on this claim,the district court issued the requested preliminary injunction in december.doe,d at.days later,the fda finalized the order it had proposed in,but revised it to specify that ava was safe and effective independent of the route of exposure.biological products bacterial vaccines and toxoids implementation of efficacy review.the district court vacated that order for failure to comply with the requirements of the administrative procedure act apa.doe rumsfeld,d.the court then issued a permanent injunction unless and until fda follows the correct procedures to certify ava as safe and involuntary anthrax vaccinations absent informed consent or a presidential waiver.id.at.the government filed an appeal in this court.
in december,the fda issued a new proposed order for comment.biological products bacterial vaccines and toxoids implementation of efficacy review.after reviewing the comments,the fda issued a new final order on december,again classifying ava as safe and effective in the prevention of anthrax regardless of the route of exposure.final order.in february,a panel of this court concluded that,because issuance of the new order caused the permanent injunction to dissolve b y its own terms,the government appeal was moot.doe rumsfeld.in october,dod announced resumption of the mandatory immunization program.first am.compl.
thereafter,the plaintiffs in the case now before servicemembers subject to mandatory inoculation new proceedings in the district court challenging the fda final order.first am.compl.they also sought to enjoin dod from deviating from the recommended schedule for servicemembers whose vaccinations dod had suspended between and.the plaintiffs alleged that any such deviation would violate f.id.see supra note.the district court resolved the only issue raised by the plaintiffs three claims against the the agency reliance on the brachman study to establish the vaccine effectiveness against anthrax was arbitrary or capricious under the favor of the agency.rempfer,d.it also dismissed the plaintiffs claim against dod for lack of standing based on the plaintiffs failure to allege that they had been or would be subjected to inoculations.id.
we review the district court apa ruling de novo,as if the agency decision had been appealed to this court directly.gerber norton,quoting ftc.we also review de novo the district
