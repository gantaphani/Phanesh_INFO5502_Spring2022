plaintiff candice davis appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant,michigan bell telephone company,in this fmla action.the defendant terminated davis from her job as a customer service representative in february of because of excessive unexcused absences.davis had sought fmla leave with respect to those absences,but her request was denied on the ground that she had not worked enough hours in the preceding twelve months to be eligible for fmla benefits.after being fired,davis brought this action against the defendant,alleging that the defendant had interfered with her rights under the fmla,retaliated against her for exercising those rights,and failed to give proper notice of ineligibility as required by the fmla.finding that davis was ineligible for fmla benefits in,and that davis could not maintain a cause of action based on improper notice of ineligibility,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant.on appeal,davis argues that the district court erred in finding her ineligible for fmla benefits because her eligibility from should have carried over into.in the alternative,she argues that the defendant should be estopped from challenging her fmla eligibility,and that she is entitled to recover because of the defendant failure to provide proper notice of ineligibility.because these arguments are unavailing,the district court judgment is affirmed.
davis was hired by the defendant as a customer service representative in november of.she began suffering from depression in.prior to september of,davis requested fmla benefits on several occasions,but was denied on the ground that she was ineligible for fmla benefits.an eligible employee is one who has been employed for at least twelve months by the employer with respect to whom leave is requested,and who has been employed by that employer for at least hours of service during the period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave.a a.davis failed to qualify for fmla eligibility prior to september of because she did not meet the requirement.on september,however,she reached that mark and therefore became eligible for fmla leave.as soon as she became eligible,her healthcare provider certified that davis suffered from depression,and that the depression was a chronic condition that would require intermittent fmla leave.based on this certification,the defendant approved intermittent fmla leave for davis depression.
between september and december,davis depression caused her to take several discrete absences from work.each time she was absent,she sought fmla leave by submitting the medical certification forms required to obtain fmla leave.on each of these forms,davis healthcare provider indicated that davis absences were caused by her depression.the defendant accepted this documentation and considered these absences to be a part of the intermittent fmla leave that had begun on september.these absences were approved as fmla leave without the defendant having reevaluated davis eligibility for fmla leave on the date of each absence because the defendant concluded that davis eligibility should only be evaluated at the commencement of the intermittent leave,which occurred on september.
on december,davis began an absence that continued into she never submitted the medical certification form required for fmla leave,although she notified the defendant of her intent to seek fmla leave during the first week of this absence.after the seventh day of her defendant filed a claim for disability benefits on davis behalf.at that time,the defendant also notified davis that she had the right to apply for fmla benefits in the event that she was denied disability leave.disability leave is an employment benefit that is provided by the defendant,but not required by law.as is allowed by the fmla,time spent on disability leave is counted against an employee annual entitlement to fmla leave.
during her disability leave,davis informed her therapist that she wanted to return to work on december.nevertheless,davis remained absent into the new year.on january,davis to the the defendant that davis was no longer disabled and could have returned to work on january.as a result,the defendant notified davis on january that only those absences from december,until january,would be approved as paid disability leave every absence after january was to be considered an unexcused absence unless davis sought and received fmla leave for those absences.davis was further notified that she would be considered to have resigned if she did not report to work on january.see at.
january came and went without davis reporting to work.she did,however,show up for work on january,but by that time,she had missed her opportunity to save her job.as she had already been disciplined on three separate occasions for poor attendance,the defendant attendance policy mandated that davis be dismissed.accordingly,she was suspended pending her dismissal.
davis requested a review board hearing regarding her pending dismissal.on february,she also requested that her unexcused absences be approved as fmla leave.before davis submitted any medical documentation to support her request,the defendant determined that davis was not eligible to receive fmla benefits in.this determination was based on the defendant assumption that fmla eligibility could not carry over from one fmla period to the next.because the defendant measured its fmla period according to the calendar year,it concluded that davis eligibility should be reevaluated as of the first unexcused absence in,which occurred on january this reevaluation revealed that davis had not worked hours in the twelve months preceding january.the defendant therefore refused to convert davis unexcused absences from january into fmla leave.davis was also denied relief by the review board and a grievance proceeding,and she was therefore terminated on february.
after her termination,davis continued to seek fmla leave.on march,her healthcare provider submitted the requisite medical certification form.it indicated that her absences from december,to january,had been caused by her depression.in response,the defendant sent davis a letter on march,that again informed her that she was not eligible for fmla leave with respect to her absences from january to january.
davis subsequently filed suit against the defendant on the grounds that it had retaliated against her for asserting her rights under the fmla,interfered with her fmla rights by denying fmla benefits for her absences occurring after january,and failed to provide proper notice of her ineligibility.both sides submitted motions for summary judgment.davis argued that because her absences in january of were part of a continuous absence that began in,the absences in january of were part of the intermittent fmla leave that had been approved in september of.she claimed that she was therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law because her eligibility should have been evaluated as of the beginning of that leave in september of.the defendant,however,argued that fmla eligibility for intermittent leave can not be carried over from one fmla period to the next.according to the defendant,davis eligibility therefore had to be reevaluated as of her first request for fmla leave in.the district court agreed with the defendant,holding that a n employer may recalculate an employee fmla eligibility at the commencement of the first absence in a new period as designated by the employer.davis,wl,at.based on this reasoning,the district court concluded that the defendant had not interfered with davis fmla rights because davis had not worked enough hours in the preceding twelve months to be eligible for fmla benefits with respect to her absences occurring after january.the district court also found that her ineligibility precluded her retaliation claim.finally,the district court held that a cause of action can not be maintained on the basis of a failure to provide proper notice of ineligibility.based on these rulings,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant.
the only question with respect to davis fmla interference claim is whether davis was eligible for fmla leave with respect to her unexcused absences in january of.if she were eligible,then she would be entitled to proceed with her lawsuit because she would be able to satisfy the other elements an fmla interference claim.see wysong dow chem,cir reciting elements of fmla interference claim quoting cavin honda of am,cir.however,because the district court correctly determined that davis was not eligible,the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law since an employee ineligibility precludes the employee from pursuing an fmla interference claim.see killian yorozu auto,cir citing walton ford motor,cir.
the determination of fmla eligibility must be made as of the date leave commences.d.if the date is measured as of september,as davis suggests,then she was eligible for fmla leave.if the date is measured in january of,as the defendant suggests,then davis was not eligible.therefore,the question boils down to when davis leave commenced.
when an employee has a chronic health condition for which intermittent fmla leave has been approved,the leave commences upon the occurrence of the first absence caused by that condition,and it extends to cover every other absence caused by that condition during the same fmla period.see barron runyon,d.in other words,each absence subsequent to the first absence is not treated as a separate period of fmla leave with its own commencement date.to hold otherwise would render the term intermittent leave meaningless and would effectively read it out of the fmla since a period of intermittent leave must,by definition,comprise periods in which the employee is present at work.id.thus,a series of absences,separated by days during which the employee is at work,but all of which are taken for the same medical reason,subject to the same notice,and taken during the same period,comprises one period of intermittent leave.id.that leave,however,can only extend to the end of the fmla period in which it began.see id.at.once a new fmla period begins,any additional absences caused by that same chronic condition would constitute a new period of intermittent fmla leave.see id.at.otherwise,there would be no point at which the initial period of intermittent fmla leave ended and a new period commenced.under that scenario,employees would never have to reestablish their eligibility for fmla leave and would therefore be perpetually entitled to twelve weeks of fmla leave per year based on a single eligibility determination.see id.at.because congress could not have intended this absurd result,it must be true that a period of intermittent leave can not last beyond the specific fmla period in which it begins.therefore,absences caused by the same chronic condition,but occurring in different fmla periods,must constitute different periods of fmla leave.and as different periods of leave,they must have different times of commencement.the clear consequence of this is that davis unexcused absences in january of,if approved as fmla leave,would have constituted a new period of fmla leave that commenced in january of.therefore,davis fmla eligibility was appropriately reevaluated in january of,and the defendant was correct in determining that davis was not eligible for fmla leave with respect to her unexcused absences.
davis suggests that it is not proper to reevaluate her eligibility in the middle of her leave,and that therefore her eligibility should be allowed to carry over until the end of her,january,the date on which she returned to work.this argument is based on a misunderstanding of the concept of intermittent leave because it assumes that davis absence from december until january should be considered a single period of leave simply because it is a continuous period of absence.a period of intermittent leave,however,is not made up of a single continuous absence.as explained above,an employee does not begin a new period of leave with each new absence.an obvious corollary to this rule is that the simple act of returning from an absence does not itself terminate a period of intermittent leave.since a period of intermittent leave is not terminated solely by the act of returning to work,there is no basis for saying that davis intermittent leave terminated when she returned to work on january.but it is obvious that the period of intermittent leave that began in september of must end at some point.if the intermittent leave that began in september of instead ended upon the beginning of a new fmla period,then davis request for fmla leave in,if approved,would have constituted a new period of fmla leave commencing in january of.thus,the ultimate question presented by davis argument is whether her intermittent leave in ended upon the occurrence of a new fmla period,or whether it ended at some arbitrary point,such as her return to work on january.since the act of returning to work itself does not terminate a period of intermittent leave,there is no principled reason to conclude that davis intermittent leave should cover absences up to january,but not those occurring thereafter.there is,however,a logical basis for concluding that davis intermittent leave terminated upon the beginning of a new fmla period.because the fmla speaks in terms of periods,see a,the most reasonable conclusion is that a period of intermittent leave terminates when a new fmla period begins.see sills bendix commercial vehicle.llc,no.civ,wl,at.this means that davis intermittent leave that began on september,could not have carried over into.as a result,any intermittent leave sought in would have been a new period of leave commencing in january of,therefore requiring a reevaluation of davis eligibility at that time.
this conclusion is supported by a department of labor opinion that provides the following example 
assume an employee is diagnosed with an chronic condition,such as ms multiple sclerosis as in your example,that results in an employee needing intermittent leave due to the episodic nature of the condition.for example,if an employee with ms who was eligible to take intermittent fmla leave in april and may needed leave again when the episodes of incapacity recurred in july and again in october,the employee would be entitled to fmla leave without having to under the eligibility test so long as the absences occurred within the same period and the employee had not exhausted the leave entitlement for this or any other reason.if the employee needed leave for ms again in a new period,the employee would have to under the eligibility test to be entitled to take fmla leave for the same chronic condition in the new period.
of labor op.letter,wl.this further demonstrates that intermittent leave can not carry over into the next fmla period.because the example instructs that eligibility must be reevaluated in the new fmla period,it must be the case that a new period of intermittent fmla leave commences when a new fmla period begins.otherwise,there would be no justification for reevaluating eligibility.
the conclusion that davis fmla eligibility was properly reevaluated in january of is also supported by the general purposes of the fmla.the fmla is intended to balance the demands of the workplace with needs of families,and entitle employees to reasonable leave for reasons while doing so in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers.b.additionally,the stated purposes of the fmla demonstrate that congress wanted to ensure that employees entitlement to leave and reinstatement did not unduly infringe on employers needs to operate their businesses efficiently and profitably.bachelder am.airlines,cir.these considerations suggest that the fmla and its accompanying regulations should be interpreted to require that an employee reestablish fmla eligibility before taking leave in a new fmla period.it would be unduly burdensome on a business need to operate efficiently and profitably if the business were required to provide an employee with twelve weeks of intermittent leave per year perpetually based on the fact that the employee was eligible for fmla benefits on a single day.in order to accommodate the reasonable interests of businesses,it m
