patricia casey applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income benefits were denied by the social security administration ssa.casey sought review before an administrative law judge alj,who,after conducting a hearing,concluded that casey was not disabled and denied the benefits.the ssa appeals council denied review,thereby rendering the alj decision the final agency determination.casey sought review in the district court which affirmed the decision of the agency.casey appeals,and we affirm.
casey applications for benefits alleged that she became disabled and unable to work on june,due to fibromyalgia,back pain,leg pain,depression,and other impairments.on the alleged onset date,she was years old,had a education,and had completed a secretarial training course.she had previously worked as an administrative assistant,employment clerk,program manager,cashier,and waitress.
the alj evaluated casey disability claim under the sequential analysis prescribed by the social security regulations.see.first,the alj found that casey was not engaged in substantial gainful activity.second,the alj concluded that casey was severely impaired by the combination of fibromyalgia,status post left knee surgery,back pain secondary to past compression fracture and depression.at.at the third step,the alj determined that casey impairments did not meet or equal any of the impairment listings that create a presumption of disability.thus,the alj continued to the fourth step,where she considered casey residual functional capacity rfc and past relevant work.the alj determined that casey had the rfc to perform work with the following limitations occasionally lift ten pounds,frequently lift less than ten pounds,sit a total of six hours in an eight hour day,at least two hours in an eight hour day and occasionally climb,balance,stoop,kneel,crouch and crawl.id.at.the alj concluded that even with these limitations,casey could return to her past work as an employment clerk,administrative assistant,or program manager.id.at.because casey impairments did not prevent her from doing her past relevant work,the alj found that casey was not disabled and,thus,not entitled to benefits.the district court affirmed that decision.
on appeal,casey contends that the district court committed reversible error in affirming the alj decision because the alj gave improper weight to medical opinions in the record,improperly discredited casey subjective complaints of pain,and erred in determining casey rfc.we review de novo the district court decision affirming the agency denial of benefits.travis astrue,cir.in conducting this review,we consider whether the alj decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.id.substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable mind would find adequate to support the alj conclusion.nicola astrue,cir.we will not disturb the denial of benefits so long as the alj decision falls within the available zone of choice.id.quoting hacker barnhart,cir.an alj decision is not outside the zone of choice simply because we might have reached a different conclusion had we been the initial finder of fact.id.
casey first contends that the alj improperly weighed the medical evidence in determining that she was not disabled.in particular,casey argues that the alj gave too little weight to the opinions of physicians that treated and examined her and too much weight to the opinion of a physician who performed a paper review of the medical records.
the alj had a duty to evaluate the medical evidence as a whole.see hogan apfel,cir.while a treating physician opinion is generally entitled to substantial weight,such an opinion is not conclusive in determining disability status,and the opinion must be supported by medically acceptable clinical or diagnostic data.pena chater,cir quoting davis shalala,cir see also d if we find that a treating source opinion on the issue s of the nature and severity of your impairment s is by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in your case record,we will give it controlling weight.a n alj may credit other medical evaluations over that of the treating physician when such other assessments are supported by better or more thorough medical evidence.prosch apfel,cir quotation and citation omitted.in considering how much weight to give a treating physician opinion,an alj must also consider the length of the treatment relationship and the frequency of examinations.d i.
according to casey,the alj most outrageous error was the failure to credit the testimony of lawrence rettenmaier,the rheumatologist who treated casey fibromyalgia.appellant br.at.initially,it is important to note that contrary to casey suggestion,the alj did not reject all of rettenmaier opinions.the alj discussed and gave weight to rettenmaier treatment records of december to may.the alj only refused to give weight to rettenmaier opinion expressed in a fibromyalgia rfc questionnaire completed in july.in the rfc questionnaire,rettenmaier simply discussed his ultimate conclusions about casey limitations,specifically,that casey could sit for fifteen to twenty minutes at a time,for a total of less than two hours in an day could stand for five to ten minutes at a time,for a total of less than two hours in an day would need unscheduled breaks during the workday and would miss three or more days of work per month due to the severity of her symptoms.the alj characterized this opinion as quite conclusory,providing very little explanation of the evidence relied on in forming the opinion as to why the claimant was so limited.at.the alj further found that although rettenmaier did have a treating relationship with casey,the record revealed that the actual treatment visits were infrequent.
we will discuss the alj determination of casey rfc in part of this opinion.at this point,however,we note that substantial evidence supports the alj refusal to give the opinion of rettenmaier controlling weight.as we have stated,a treating physician opinion is entitled to controlling weight only to the extent that it is consistent with medically acceptable clinical or laboratory diagnostic data.see pena,at d haggard apfel,cir.our review of the medical records convinces us that rettenmaier opinion lacks such consistency.on december,rettenmaier saw casey for the first time in several years.at.a physical examination on that date indicated that casey had widespread soft tissue tender points,id.at,but also stated that casey reported doing reasonably well in the last several years with her fibromyalgia,id.at.casey had a full range of motion of the neck,shoulders,elbows,wrists,and hands,and no pain with range of motion of the hips.id.at.casey did not see rettenmaier again until january.at that time,casey tender points remained and she had crepitus crackling at the knee,but her straight leg raise was negative.she had tenderness in her lower back,but her thoracic back pain was stable.rettenmaier recommended exercise and a nonsteroidal drug.on february and,rettenmaier treated casey left knee with an injection of osteoarthritis medication.casey did not see rettenmaier again for over a year.on may,rettenmaier conducted a physical examination and noted that casey had some almost type pain in the lower extremities about her knees,but that s he does not really have that widespread finding.id.at.his report also noted that casey had widespread soft tissue tender points.id.at.
the alj discussed the reports of other treating physicians,whose diagnoses of casey health were more favorable than that of rettenmaier.casey was treated by jill meilahn,in and for back and neck pain.an taken on february,showed casey old vertical fracture through the centrum injured in,but indicated that the thoracic and lumbar discs are well hydrated,n o disc herniation,n o marrow lesion,and n o facet arthritis.id.at.to treat casey pain,meilahn recommended physical therapy,exercise,and epidural steroid injections.on september,meilahn noted that casey was helped substantially by trigger point injections.id.at.an taken on december,revealed
