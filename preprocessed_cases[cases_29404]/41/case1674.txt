jamila phillips appeals the district court grant of summary judgment for on her interference and retaliation claims brought under the family and medical leave act fmla.we affirm.
phillips began employment for the state of arkansas on october.on monday,april,phillips transferred to the department of arkansas heritage dah.her main job responsibilities included answering the telephone and greeting visitors as they entered dah headquarters.sharon hacker was phillips supervisor.as a new dah employee,phillips was hired subject to a probationary period,during which her employment could be terminated at any time based on her overall performance.during her first week at dah,phillips was reprimanded twice once for making too many personal telephone calls and once for failing to be cordial to dah guests and employees.
during phillips orientation,the subject of her available balance of paid leave time was discussed.when employees of the state of arkansas move to a different agency,they are allowed to transfer accrued leave time.because dah had not received the proof of prior service from her previous agency,which verifies the amount of leave time available to an employee,phillips was asked whether she had any leave time remaining.phillips responded that she used quite a bit of leave time prior to her transfer,and she did not know how much leave time she had left,if any.
on tuesday,april,phillips was involved in an automobile accident on her way to work.she called dah and told hacker of the accident.after police left the scene of the accident,phillips went to the emergency room,where she declined a doctor excuse to take a few days off from work.phillips arrived at dah around midday.because dah had not received a proof of prior service detailing the balance of her leave time,phillips and dah categorized her absence as leave without pay.
phillips performed her job responsibilities without complaint for the remainder of the week,with the exception of agreeing with a colleague not to stuff posters into a tube because her back was hurting.sometime on or after thursday,april,phillips scheduled a doctor appointment with her primary care physician for monday,april,at phillips discussed the appointment with hacker.they agreed that until dah received information concerning the balance of her leave time,they would continue to operate under the assumption she did not have any leave time available.as such,they both agreed she should arrive to work at prior to her doctor appointment and take an early lunch,thereby using the least amount of leave without pay as possible.
during this discussion,hacker mentioned that phillips may need time off for physical therapy.hacker printed and gave to phillips fmla paperwork to complete,and she suggested phillips discuss the possibility of fmla leave with sue montgomery or debbie ballard.phillips did not complete the paperwork nor discuss a need for fmla leave with either montgomery or ballard prior to her doctor appointment.
on monday,april,phillips car would not start.she called dah and informed another employee that her uncle was on his way to fix the car.phillips said she would call back when she had more information there is a factual dispute whether phillips did in fact call back.phillips did not report to dah prior to her doctor appointment.during the appointment,her doctor prescribed several sessions of physical therapy and recommended she take off work through thursday,april.phillips had the doctor complete the necessary fmla paperwork,and she brought the completed paperwork with her to dah after her appointment.phillips was unable to submit her fmla paperwork or inform dah of her need for time off,however,because she was given a letter of termination immediately upon her arrival.the letter stated phillips was terminated because she did not report to work until after her doctor appointment,and l eave without pay is a very serious issue and is not to be used because an automobile wo start.
phillips last check stub,received after her termination,indicated she had paid leave time available.on may,dah received the proof of prior service from her previous agency,which indicated she had no leave time remaining.there is no reason given for the discrepancy between her check stub and the proof of prior service.
phillips filed suit in the eastern district of arkansas against hacker,cathie mathews,director of dah,and mike beebe,governor of the state of arkansas.phillips sued hacker and mathews in their individual and official capacities and governor beebe in his official capacity.she alleged interference and retaliation in violation of the fmla.appellees moved for summary judgment,arguing they lacked notice concerning phillips need for fmla leave,they terminated her for reasons independent from the fmla,she did not have a serious health condition within the meaning of the fmla,and they were immune from suit in their official capacities.
the district court granted summary judgment in appellees favor on both claims.the court concluded the interference claim failed because dah did not have notice of phillips need for fmla leave,and,alternatively,her termination was not related to any fmla rights.the district court concluded the retaliation claim failed because she never exercised her fmla rights,and,alternatively,she was not terminated because of those rights phillips,arguing the district court erred in granting summary judgment on both of her claims,now appeals.
this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.spangler fed.home loan bank of des moines,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence,viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party,shows no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
the fmla entitles an employee to twelve workweeks of leave during any period if he or she has a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.a d.a serious health condition is any illness,injury,impairment,or physical or mental condition that involves a inpatient care in a hospital,hospice,or residential medical care facility or b continuing treatment by a health care provider.
there are two types of claims under the fmla interference or a claims in which the employee alleges that an employer denied or interfered with his substantive rights under the fmla and retaliation or a claims in which the employee alleges that the employer discriminated against him for exercising his fmla rights.stallings hussmann,cir citing a.
in order to state a claim for interference under the fmla,phillips must have given notice of her need for fmla leave.when leave is needed for an unforeseeable event,notice is required as soon as practicable.a.this ordinarily means at least verbal notification to the employer within one or two business days of when the need for leave becomes known to the employee.spangler,at quoting b alterations omitted.however,a n employee need not invoke the fmla by name in order to put an employer on notice that the act may have relevance to the employee absence from work.thorson gemini,cir.the employer duties arise when the employee provides enough information to put the employer on notice that the employee may be in need of fmla leave.id.quoting browning liberty mut.ins,cir.whether an employee gave sufficient information to put his or her employer on notice that an absence may be covered by the fmla is a question of fact for the jury.browning,at.
the district court erred in concluding as a matter of law that phillips failed to provide enough information to put her employer on notice she may be in need of fmla leave.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to phillips,a reasonable jury could conclude phillips satisfied the notice requirement because she put appellees on notice that her doctor visit was related to her prior accident and could result in a need for additional treatment and time off from work.
appellees argue they did not have notice of the need for fmla leave because phillips never indicated a need to be absent from work subsequent to the doctor appointment or an inability to perform her job responsibilities,and they terminated her before she turned in her fmla paperwork.a reasonable jury could conclude otherwise,however,because phillips and hacker specifically discussed the possibility that phillips could need time off for physical therapy subsequent to her doctor appointment,and hacker even printed fmla paperwork for phillips to complete.even though phillips did not indicate a significant inability to perform her job responsibilities in the days following the accident,hacker knew she was going to a doctor appointment and expressly recognized that the result of the appointment could necessitate fmla leave.thus,even though neither party knew before the appointment that phillips definitely would need additional time off,both were aware of the possibility that such time could be needed.
appellees attempt to make much of the fact that phillips did not discuss a need to be absent beyond her doctor appointment and did not submit fmla paperwork prior to her termination.this argument is insufficient for several reasons.first,the required fmla paperwork includes a medical certification,which phillips would have been unable to submit until after her doctor appointment.second,fmla leave include s visits to a doctor when the employee has symptoms that are eventually diagnosed as constituting a serious health condition,even if,at the time of the initial medical appointments,the illness has not yet been diagnosed nor its degree of seriousness determined.caldwell holland of,cir quoting hodgens dynamics,cir.thus,if phillips had a serious health condition,her doctor appointment to diagnose and treat that condition was covered by the fmla.because appellees knew that phillips was attending a doctor appointment for treatment related to her accident and that could result in a need for physical therapy,develop into a serious health condition,phillips gave notice that she may be in need of fmla leave,including for the doctor appointment itself.
moreover,it is immaterial that phillips was terminated before she submitted her fmla paperwork or before appellees learned she needed additional time off from work.that is because an employer does not avoid liability by discharging an employee who takes leave in order to seek treatment for a condition that is later held to be covered by the fmla.caldwell,at.because appellees had notice that phillips doctor appointment could potentially be covered by the fmla,they do not escape liability by simply terminating her before she could inform them of the results of her appointment they bore the risk that the health condition in question later develop ed into a serious health condition id.
contrary to appellees assertion,this does not mean that every routine visit to a doctor constitutes notice to an employer of a potential serious health condition,which in turn prohibits an employer from taking action against an employee in close temporal proximity to that visit.in this case,however,hacker knew phillips appointment was a visit related to her accident,expressly recognized that the result of the appointment could necessitate additional time off covered by the fmla,and even went so far as to print fmla paperwork for phillips to complete.in light of this evidence,a reasonable jury could conclude phillips satisfied the fmla notice requirement.
even though the district court erred on the issue of notice,reversal is not appropriate because the interference claim nonetheless fails.interference includes not only refusing to authorize fmla leave,but discouraging an employee from using such leave.it would also include manipulation by a covered employer to avoid responsibilities under fmla.stallings,at quoting b.an employer action that deters an employee from participating in protected activities constitutes interference or restraint of the employee exercise of his rights.id.for her claim,phillips must show only that she was entitled to the benefit denied.id.the appellees intent in denying that benefit is immaterial.id.phillips can prevail under an interference theory if s he was denied substantive rights under the fmla for a reason connected with h er fmla leave.id.
assuming phillips had a serious medical condition,which we do not decide on appeal,she was entitled to fmla leave starting from her doctor appointment at on monday,april,through her necessary time off from work.because phillips was terminated during her fmla leave,appellees interfered with her fmla rights since every discharge of an employee while she is taking fmla leave interferes with an employee fmla rights.throneberry mcgehee desha county,cir.the employer is not liable for this interference,however,where an employee reason for dismissal is insufficiently related to fmla leave stallings,at.the burden is on the employer to prove the reason for termination was unrelated to fmla.throneberry,at.
phillips interference claim fails because,viewing the evidence in her favor,there is no genuine issue of fact that she was terminated for a reason connected to her fmla leave.rather,she was terminated because she did not show up to work as agreed prior to her doctor appointment a time period not covered by the fmla and did not have any leave time available to apply towards that absence.the district court correctly concluded that phillips car being unable to start is not a serious health condition,and her termination for that reason was completely unrelated to her doctor appointment or any other need for fmla leave.additionally,appellees have further elaborated on their decision to terminate phillips by noting her two prior reprimands during her first week of employment.
phillips offers no evidence other than speculation to support a connection between her termination and fmla leave.her primary argument is that she did have leave time built up,noting the check stub she received after her termination.even though there is a factual dispute whether phillips had leave time available,it is not material because all parties were operating under the assumption that no leave time was available until dah received proof otherwise.at best,appellees were mistaken in their belief phillips did not have leave time available.however,termination based on even a mistaken,but honestly held,belief concerning leave time is still termination based on a reason unrelated to the fmla.thus,appellees have met their burden of showing phillips would have been dismissed regardless of her request for,or taking of,fmla leave.throneberry,at quoting smith diffee,cir.whether phillips had a doctor appointment or not,she would have been terminated for not showing up to work at monday,april,when appellees or absence would be taken as leave without pay because she did not have paid leave time available.because no reasonable jury could conclude phillips termination was related to her fmla leave,summary judgment for appellees was proper on her interference claim.
for many of the same reasons,the district court properly granted summary judgment for appellees on the retaliation claim.although the district court erred in concluding phillips did not exercise any rights under the fmla,it correctly determined she was not terminated because she exercised those rights.
because phillips does not have direct evidence of retaliation,we analyze her fmla retaliation claim under the mcdonnell douglas framework phillips must first establish a prima facie case,which requires her to show that she exercised rights afforded by the act,that she suffered an adverse employment action,and that there was a causal connection between her exercise of rights and the adverse employment action.smith allen health,cir.if phillips is able to do so,the burden shifts to appellees to come forward with evidence of a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action.id.at.their burden is not onerous and the showing need not be made by a preponderance of the evidence.wallace sparks health,cir.if appellees do so,phillips must come forward with evidence that creates an issue of fact as to whether the asserted reason was pretext for discrimination.smith,at.
