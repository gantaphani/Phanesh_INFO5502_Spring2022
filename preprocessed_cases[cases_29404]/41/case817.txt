this appeal concerns whether a ordinance designed to eliminate eyesores and promote public order,san marcos,code of ordinances a,can be applied to a wrecked oldsmobile that has been put to use as a cactus planter,colorfully painted,and adorned with the words make love not war.appellants contend that the car is an expressive artwork and that interference with this display violates their rights under the first amendment and the visual artists right act vara.a.the district court rejected both claims,then went further and ordered the owner to comply with a removal order of the san marcos municipal court.we also reject appellants constitutional and statutory claims but vacate the district court attempt to enforce the municipal court order.
background 
appellant michael kleinman operates planet k stores throughout the san antonio and austin areas.planet k stores are funky establishments that sell novelty items and gifts.kleinman has a tradition of celebrating new store openings with a car bash,a charity event at which the public pays for the privilege of sledgehammering a car to a smashed wreck.the wrecks are then filled with dirt,planted with vegetation,and painted.placed outside each store,the planters serve as unique advertising devices.
an oldsmobile was created upon the opening of a new planet k store in san marcos,texas.kleinman arranged to have the smashed car planted with a variety of native cacti and painted with scenes of life in san marcos.positioned in front of the store,the distinctive planter is visible to motorists traveling north on interstate.kleinman did not dictate the content of the illustrations,but he requested that the phrase make love not war be incorporated into the design.two local artists,scott wade and john furly travis,were commissioned to paint the wreck.at trial,travis testified that he had no particular message in mind when he painted the car,just happiness.he intended his images to convey the idea that you could take a junked vehicle,junk canvas,and create something beautiful out of it.wade sought to transform a large vehicle into something that more respectful of the planet and something that nurtures life as opposed to destroys it.wade explained that his intent was to describe american car culture and the link between gasoline and the war in iraq.
on several occasions during and after the conversion of the smashed wreck into a,the city of san marcos ticketed planet k and various planet k employees under an ordinance banning junked vehicles.the ordinance declares junked vehicles to be a public nuisance and prohibits citizens from placing or keeping junked vehicles on their property.san marcos,code of ordinances,a.the ordinance defines a junked vehicle as follows 
junked vehicle means a vehicle that is self propelled,inoperable,and 
does not have lawfully affixed to it both an unexpired license plate and a valid motor vehicle safety inspection certificate 
is wrecked,dismantled,partially dismantled,or discarded or 
has remained inoperable for more than consecutive days.
kleinman contested the tickets and requested a hearing to determine whether the falls within that definition.the san marcos municipal court found that it did and ordered the removed or brought into compliance by concealment behind a fence or in an enclosure kleinman then brought suit for injunctive relief in state court.the city removed the case to federal district court.wade and travis joined the suit to assert their claims under vara.
following a bench trial,the district court determined that the application of the ordinance to the would not violate the first amendment and that wade and travis failed to state a statutory claim for relief.the district court also ordered all three plaintiffs sua sponte to comply with the municipal court order and bring the into compliance with the city code within thirty days.this appeal ensued.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews a district court factual findings after a bench trial for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.water craft mgmt.llc mercury marine,cir.clear error exists 
if the findings are without substantial evidence to support them,the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence,and although there is evidence,which if credible would be substantial,the force and effect of the testimony,considered as a whole,convinces the court that the findings are so against the preponderance of credible testimony that they do not reflect or represent the truth and right of the case.
id.reversal for clear error is warranted only if the court has a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.
iii.discussion 
first amendment 
appellants principal contention is simple visual art is fully protected by the first amendment.consequently,neither the city ordinance nor the state statute standing behind the may impose a regulation prohibiting the public display.in the alternative,appellants,while acknowledging that the is a junked vehicle,assert that the ordinance fails to satisfy intermediate scrutiny as applied to their creation.
that this cactus planter,a advertisement for a novelty shop,could be considered a expression speaks more to the law vagueness than to the capability or intention of the artists.in fact,the city stipulated that the is an object which contains and projects some level of artistic expression after it was painted by plaintiffs wade and travis and altered to allow it to grow.but this category is not so unbounded.the supreme court,in the course of applying the first amendment to an expressive act a saint patrick day parade,stated unanimously 
as some of these examples of protected expression show,a narrow,succinctly articulable message is not a condition of constitutional protection,which if confined to expressions conveying a particularized message,would never reach the unquestionably shielded painting of jackson pollock,music of arnold sch√∂nberg,or jabberwocky verse of lewis carroll.
hurley gay,lesbian bisexual group of boston,d citation omitted.hurley refers solely to great works of art.neither in hurley nor in any later case has the court elaborated on the extent of first amendment protection for visual objects or artworks.
seizing on hurley statement,the second circuit declared,in a case concerning new york city street vendor regulations,that artworks including paintings,photographs,prints,and sculptures are always communicative and therefore entitled to full first amendment protection.bery city of new york,cir.despite this broad language,the bery court held only that the ordinance application to vendors of those works did not stand up to intermediate scrutiny.id.further,the court reasoned that,because the crafts of the jeweler,the potter,and the silversmith are only sometimes expressive,the constitutional protection afforded those categories of works must be determined on a basis.id.
subsequently,the second circuit grappled with bery implication when vendors of and ballcaps decorated with graffiti art sought an exemption from the same new york city ordinance.mastrovincenzo city of new york,cir.the court narrowed bery broad dictum to say that the first amendment protects the sale or dissemination of all objects ranging from totem poles to television sets does not take us far in trying to articulate or understand a jurisprudence of ordered liberty indeed,it would entirely drain the first amendment of meaning.id.at citation omitted.the court recast bery distinction between fine art and decorative arts in terms that enforcement officers and vendors in the real world can understand and apply without recourse to principles of aesthetics.id.at.mastrovincenzo ultimately decided that the expressive elements of the clothing merited some first amendment protection,but that the city ordinance was narrowly tailored and left ample alternative avenues of communication,thereby satisfying intermediate scrutiny.
we share the mastrovincenzo court skepticism that the heavy machinery of the first amendment is to be deployed in every case involving visual expression.protected expression takes many forms,but hurley reference to works of fine art did not sweep so broadly as to require a judicially crafted hierarchy of artistic expression.by analyzing the rights under intermediate scrutiny,the bery court effectively conceded as much.
fortunately,we need go no further than that in the instant case.irrespective of the intentions of its creators or planet k owner,the is a utilitarian device,an advertisement,and ultimately a junked vehicle.these qualities objectively dominate any expressive component of its exterior painting appellants concede that the car falls within the definition of the san marcos ordinance.moreover,the eighth circuit,confronted before hurley with a wrecked auto that was displayed streetside to remind the public how the owner son had been killed,had no difficulty finding that the auto removal under a ordinance survived intermediate scrutiny.davis norman,cir.when the expressive component of an object,considered objectively in light of its function and utility,is at best secondary,the public display of the object is conduct subject to reasonable state regulation.we therefore pretermit recourse to principles of aesthetics.
in an abundance of caution,however,because the city concedes that the has some protected expressive content,we apply the intermediate scrutiny test articulated by the supreme court in united states,d,which balances the individual right to speak with the government power to regulate.rests on the principle that when speech and elements are united in a course of conduct,a valid governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element can justify incidental limitations on first amendment freedoms.id.at.at.under,a regulation is constitutional if it is within the constitutional power of the government it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest the government interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and the incidental restriction on alleged first amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.id.at.at.the ordinance passes muster under the test.
first,regulation of junked vehicles is within the city traditional municipal police powers.second,important governmental interests justify the ordinance,the purpose of which is to protect the community health and safety from the problems created by abandoned vehicles left in public view.a junked vehicle is a public nuisance 
a junked vehicle that is located in a place where it is visible from a public place or public is detrimental to the safety and welfare of the general public,tends to reduce the value of private property,invites vandalism,creates fire hazards and constitutes an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors and is detrimental to the economic welfare of the city by producing urban blight adverse to the maintenance and continuing development of the city and is a public nuisance.
san marcos,code of ordinances a.junked vehicles are an attractive nuisance to children.rodents,pests,and weeds thrive in and around them.testimony showed that the city pursued more than junked vehicle cases in the two years prior to trial.these facts,found by the district court,fully support the city interests in regulating junked vehicles.the ordinance also tends to reduce urban blight,vandalism,and the depressing effect of junked vehicles on property values.appellants insistence that the has been rendered safe is immaterial to the constitutionality of the ordinance.the city right to regulate junked vehicles,not the individual status of each vehicle,is the concern of first amendment inquiry.see ftc superior court trial lawyers ass n,d.
third,the ordinance is not intended to regulate speech at all but is a health and safety ordinance.appellants argue that the city enforcement of the ordinance is motivated by disagreement with the content of the message and thus should be subject to the strict scrutiny reserved for speech regulations.the district court made no finding of an impermissible motivation,nor is such a finding compelled by the record.
fourth,the ordinance is reasonably tailored to achieve the city legitimate interests with only incidental restriction on protected expression.the ordinance authorizes junked vehicles to remain on private property if enclosed from public view.san marcos,code of ordinances a.appellants contend that the ordinance is not narrowly tailored because it permits an exception for dealerships and junkyards.the underlying state statute,however,prohibits the city from adopting any procedures as to vehicles stored or parked in a lawful manner on private property in connection with the business of a licensed vehicle dealer or junkyard.transp.code.thus,the city has an overarching legal basis for exempting dealerships and junkyards from its junked vehicle statute.indeed,the exemption for businesses that deal with junked vehicles reinforces rather than discredits the of the junked vehicle ordinance.both the city and the state sensibly distinguish individual conduct from commercial conduct,which creates different hazards and requires different regulations.in addition,the ordinance is limited to regulating the medium and location of the,and in so doing it reduces the blight and attractive nuisance problems caused by vehicular wrecks.
appellants also argue that the enclosure requirement leaves them without any adequate alternative means of expression.see ward rock against racism,d.but as the district court noted,enclosing the does not cut off public access because it leaves planet k free to display the behind a fence,indoors,or in a garage enclosure.kleinman could still advertise and invite the public to view the.he could,pursuant to local law,erect a sign or display a poster of the visible to the public.because the ordinance affords ample alternative means for appellants to express their messages,this court will not the scope of the ordinance nor impose appellants preferred display mode on the city.id.at.at.
appellants travis and wade also raise claims under the vara.the vara provides the author of a work of visual art with the right 
a to prevent any intentional distortion,mutilation,or other modification of that work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation,and any intentional distortion,mutilation,or modification of that work is a violation of that right,and 
b to prevent any destruction of a work of recognized stature,and any intentional or grossly negligent destruction of that work is a violation of that right.
a.the district court denied relief under vara,finding that the ordinance does not require the destruction of a junked vehicle,merely its screening from general public view.
the preliminary statutory issue,however,is whether the qualifies as a work of visual art under the vara.the statute excludes any merchandising item or advertising,promotional,descriptive,covering,packaging material or container from protection.the district court found that the are closely associated with planet k,are part of the store corporate image and culture,and are a distinctive symbol of the planet k business.these findings,which are not clearly erroneous,indicate that the are promotional material and thus outside of the vara protection.see pollara seymour,cir.for this reason as well as that of the district court,we affirm the conclusion that appellants travis and wade failed to state a claim for relief under vara.
order for compliance 
the district court ordered that plaintiffs shall comply with the order of the san marcos municipal court and bring the car planter into compliance with city code.appellants assert this order was in error since the city never requested any affirmative relief.further,wade and travis were not parties to the municipal court order and can not be ordered to comply.we agree.although the city contends that the order is actually in kleinman giving him thirty days to comply before any city enforcement district court lacked jurisdiction to grant this relief.this portion of the district court order must be vacated.
iv.conclusion 
for the reasons articulated above,we affirm the judgment on the merits but vacate the portion of the district court judgment that orders appellants to comply with the municipal
