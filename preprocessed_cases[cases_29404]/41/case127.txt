appellant katharine richardson alleges that her former employer,appellee friendly ice cream corporation friendly,discriminated against her in violation of the americans with disabilities act ada,and the maine human rights act mhra,by failing to accommodate her disability and by terminating her employment because of that disability.the district court entered summary judgment for friendly,holding that richardson is not covered by the ada or the mhra because she is not capable of performing the essential functions of her position,with or without a reasonable accommodation,and hence is not a qualified individual.we affirm.
friendly,a restaurant chain,hired richardson as an assistant manager of its ellsworth,maine store in.richardson worked alongside one other assistant manager during the period of her employment.both assistant managers reported to tina emery,the general manager of the ellsworth restaurant,who in turn reported to todd mosher,the district manager.between and,richardson performed both administrative and manual tasks as part of her job.among other duties,she regularly interacted with customers,supervised other employees and inspected their work,carried plates to customers,ordered new supplies,unloaded new supplies as they were delivered,operated the grill and the machine,and cleaned the restaurant.because the general manager and the other assistant manager preferred to work the opening and closing shifts,richardson typically worked the shift,which was the least physically demanding of the three shifts.
in january,richardson began to experience severe pain in her right shoulder.she claims,and friendly does not dispute,that the pain was caused by the manual tasks that she had been performing at work,such as working at the grill and scooping ice cream.when she reported her injury to friendly that same month,the company sent her to see a physician at mednow clinic in ellsworth.the physician diagnosed richardson pain as shoulder impingement syndrome,prescribed an medication,and recommended that richardson discontinue all grill work and other tasks that involved lifting objects heavier than ten pounds with her right arm.
between january and september,richardson continued to work at friendly without missing any days.although the pain in her shoulder impeded the full use of her right arm,she claims that she was able to modify her work behavior during that period to enable her to perform most of the tasks that she had previously performed.for example,when cooking french fries in the machine,she would cook small quantities at a time and would remove the cooked product with tongs rather than by lifting the entire basket as she formerly did.she admits that she was unable to perform certain tasks such as mopping the floor and lifting heavy bags of trash,but she says that there were typically other employees on duty who were able to perform those tasks.she adds that she had been reprimanded before her injury for failing to delegate manual tasks to other restaurant employees.
in september,richardson took a leave of absence to undergo shoulder surgery.following the surgery,richardson continued to experience intense pain in her shoulder and was unable to return to work immediately.at that point,friendly workers compensation administrator retained a nurse case manager,debra dwyer,to facilitate richardson recovery and return to work.dwyer was in regular contact with emery,the general manager,during the period after richardson surgery.emery testified at her deposition that she and dwyer discussed richardson anticipated return date,richardson anticipated medical restrictions,and certain accommodations and transitional job duties that might have enabled richardson to work within her medical restrictions.
based on richardson medical evaluations,emery and dwyer initially assumed that richardson would be able to return to work near the end of october.richardson did not improve as expected,however.her surgeon concluded that she had no work capacity,and richardson remained on leave throughout october and november.on december,the surgeon estimated that richardson would be able to return to work on january.dwyer gave that projected return date to emery,who then conveyed the information to district manager mosher.
three days later,mosher sent the following to theresa marino,a human resources manager at friendly corporate headquarters 
i i need your help.can you give us some guidance on kathy richardson as you know she is the manager from ellsworth that has been out with a shoulder injury from lifting french fry baskets.
she is supposed to be released the first week of after a second opinion last week revealed the opposite of what the original physician said.
i would prefer to not bring her back if at all possible as she is just going to do the same thing in.
can you help guide us on this 
please do cc the restaurant on any of tina emery gm is on vacation.
diana beach,a representative from friendly compensation and benefits department,responded that same day 
she has reached the end of her fml family and medical leave with friendly as of which means that our obligation of leaving her job open has ended.due to the fact that she is out on wc workers compensation,you may want to check with the legal department to see if you have to bring her back.i will be sending her out cobra for her insurance.
there is some dispute about the sequence of events that followed this exchange of.friendly claims that it decided to terminate richardson employment on december,because she had remained on leave beyond the time reserved for her by the family and medical leave act.diana beach sent richardson a letter that day notifying richardson of her right to continue her group insurance coverage.richardson acknowledges receiving the letter but says that she did not interpret it to be a notice of termination.when she questioned emery and beach about the letter,neither explained that she had been terminated.dwyer also told richardson that she and emery continued to correspond about richardson condition after that date,giving richardson the impression that she was still expected to return to work.
in any case,richardson physician finally signed a work release on january.although he permitted her to return to friendly,he prohibited her from performing repetitive activity with her right arm and from lifting objects weighing more than five pounds.richardson delivered the release to the ellsworth restaurant that same day.four days later,on january,mosher telephoned richardson to notify her that she had been terminated.according to richardson,mosher said because you are still disabled and you have gone over your thirteen weeks of family medical leave,we choose to terminate you.
on january,richardson filed a charge of discrimination with the maine human rights commission mhrc and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.she alleged in her charge that friendly reliance on the family and medical leave act was pretextual and that friendly discharged her solely because of her disability.the mhrc issued a letter,and on october,richardson filed a complaint in maine superior court asserting claims against friendly and its workers compensation administrator for violation of the ada and the mhra and for tortious interference with contract.the defendants then removed the action to federal court.
friendly moved for summary judgment after the close of discovery,claiming that richardson was not eligible for relief under the ada or mhra because she had not shown that she was qualified for her position at the time of her discharge,and she was terminated in accordance with friendly generally applicable leave policy rather than on the basis of disability.the motion was referred to a magistrate judge,who recommended that summary judgment be granted on the first ground.in a brief order,the district judge approved the magistrate judge reasoning and granted friendly motion.judgment was entered that same day and this appeal followed.
summary judgment is proper where the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in richardson favor.franklin memorial hosp.harvey,cir.
title i of the ada prohibits covered entities from discriminat ing against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures,the hiring,advancement,or discharge of employees,employee compensation,job training,and other terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.a richardson alleges that friendly discriminated against her on the basis of disability when it discharged her.in order to prevail on that claim at trial,she must show that she was disabled within the meaning of the ada that she was qualified for her position and that friendly discharged her because of her disability.lederle parenterals,cir citing criado ibm,cir.
friendly has not disputed richardson disability status.it moved for summary judgment on the grounds that richardson was not qualified for her position as an assistant manager and that friendly did not discharge her because of her disability.the district court granted the motion on the first ground and found it unnecessary to address the second.richardson argues on appeal that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to both issues.because we agree with the district court that no reasonable jury could conclude that richardson was qualified for her position,we do not address her second argument about friendly motive for terminating her.
to establish that she was qualified,richardson must demonstrate,first,that she had the necessary skill,experience,education,and other requirements for the assistant manager position and,second,that she was able to perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation.mulloy acushnet,cir quoting,at.friendly does not suggest that richardson lacks the basic skill,experience,and education for the assistant manager position.we therefore turn to the second requirement,and our assessment of whether richardson could perform the essential functions of the assistant manager position with or without reasonable accommodation.
a.the essential functions of richardson position 
to determine whether richardson was able to perform the essential functions of her position,it is necessary to identify those functions.precision is critical,as the level of generality at which the essential functions are defined can be outcome determinative.see,gillen fallon ambulance,cir skerski time warner cable,cir.
legal framework 
an essential function is,at its most basic level,one that is fundamental to a position rather than marginal.kvorjak maine,cir.the ada implementing regulations elaborate on this idea,listing three nonexclusive reasons why a job function may be considered essential the position exists for the purpose of performing the function there are a limited number of employees among whom responsibility for the function can be distributed the function is highly specialized and the incumbent was hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform it.n see also eeoc interpretive guidance on title i of the ada,pt,n hereinafter eeoc interpretive guidance illustrating the three reasons 
within these contours,the complex question of what constitutes an essential job function involves considerations and must be determined on a basis.gillen,at.among the types of evidence bearing on the analysis are 
the employer judgment as to which functions are essential 
written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job 
the amount of time spent on the job performing the function 
the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function 
the terms of a collective bargaining agreement 
the work experience of past incumbents in the job 
the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.
n.it is the employer burden to come forward with some evidence that a particular function is essential,tobin liberty mut.ins.tobin i,cir,but the plaintiff always has the ultimate burden of proving that she is a qualified individual,laurin providence,cir.
the purpose of these provisions is not to enable courts to legitimate business judgments,but,rather,to ensure that an employer asserted requirements are solidly anchored in the realities of the workplace,not constructed out of whole cloth.gillen,at.the ada expressly provides that consideration shall be given to the employer judgment as to what functions of a job are essential,and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job,this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.consistent with that directive,we generally give substantial weight to the employer view of job requirements.mulloy,at quoting ward.health research,cir.we have made it equally clear,however,that the employer view of what a job entails,though important,is not dispositive.gillen,at.
richardson argues that her sole essential function was to oversee the operation of the restaurant and ensure that it ran smoothly.friendly disagrees,relying heavily on a written job description for the assistant manager position as proof that it was essential for richardson to be able to perform a number of predominantly manual tasks as well.
the job description is divided into multiple sections the first substantive section,labeled primary task,provides 
the primary function of this position is to assist the general manager with assigned administrative and operational shift duties,provide guidance and direction to restaurant personnel,oversee,direct and assist in kitchen,dining and operations,facilitate production and customer service,ensure safety regulations and quality standards are maintained and that customer satisfaction is achieved.
the following section,labeled essential functions,lists thirteen general categories of job duties.among other things,it reiterates that an assistant manager must r un shifts,oversee,direct and assist in kitchen,dining and operations to facilitate production and customer service.the remaining sections of the job description are significantly more detailed,listing specific tasks and physical movements that the assistant manager may be asked to perform.
without addressing whether each individual task listed in the written job description is an essential function of the assistant manager position,we conclude that it was essential for an assistant manager to assist in kitchen,dining and operations to facilitate production and customer service.we further conclude,on the basis of the overwhelming weight of the summary judgment evidence,that an assistant manager had to be capable of performing a broad range of manual tasks in order to perform that function.
it is undisputed that richardson was often required to assist her subordinates in performing their jobs and to fill in for them as necessary.richardson admitted as much in her deposition testimony 
q and part of your job was,basically,to be able to do any of those jobs in the restaurant that you were trained to do 
a yes.i think.ideally,i i a manager,i am not going to be in the grill area trying to run the floor and take care of a customer i needed to be able to do everything so that i could train and that i could effectively take care of the restaurant.
q right.and also to fill in when needed 
q if you needed to fill in,right so if you needed to fill in at the grill,you fill in at the grill.
q and if you needed to fill in to help in the dining room 
richardson described in detail the duties she was often required to perform,which included cooking,cleaning,serving food,and unloading delivery trucks.richardson husband and physician confirmed in their testimony that her job had a substantial physical component.indeed,the very premise of richardson workers compensation claim was that her injury was caused by the heavy,repetitive manual tasks that she performed at friendly on a daily basis.all of this evidence indicates that richardson spent a substantial amount of time on the job performing manual tasks around the restaurant.s
