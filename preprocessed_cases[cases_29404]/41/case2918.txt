discussion 
we review claim construction and indefiniteness de novo.atmel info.storage devices.section,requires that a patent specification conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.an applicant may express an element of a claim as a means or step for performing a specified function and such claim shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure described in the specification and equivalents thereof.in exchange for the ability to use a generic means expression for a claim limitation,the applicant must indicate in the specification what structure constitutes the means.biomedino,llc waters techs.such structure must be clearly linked or associated with the claimed function.med.instrumentation diagnostics elekta ab.failure to specify the corresponding structure in the specification amounts to impermissible pure functional claiming.id.at.although statutorily provides that one may use language in a claim,one is still subject to the requirement that a claim particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention.in re donaldson,en banc.if an applicant does not disclose structure for a term,the claim is indefinite.
ergo argues that the corresponding structure for control means is the recitation of control device throughout the specification.ergo contends that the general disclosure of a control device is all that is necessary because a control device is a generic structure known to those skilled in the art.such a control device,according to ergo,is synonymous with a computer,even though a computer is not recited in the specification.ergo argues that disclosure of an algorithm was not required,because a computer can perform the function.ergo claims that the specification describes additional structure of the control device,in particular that it has processing capabilities,can generate control commands,and has memory.ergo also claims that the specification teaching that the control device has a programming means constitutes the structure with which control and monitoring functions can be performed.appellant reply br.at emphasis omitted.
none of these disclosures,however,are structure for the function of controlling the adjusting means.the recitation of control device provides no more structure than the term control means itself,rather it merely replaces the word means with the generic term device.the specification discloses that the control device has memory,but memory is not structure capable of performing the function of controlling the adjusting means.while in some circumstances generic structural disclosures may be sufficient,that is not the case here.see,telcordia,cisco,holding that controller was sufficient disclosure because t he record shows that an ordinary artisan would have recognized the controller as an electronic device with a known structure.in this case,ergo expert testimony illustrates that those skilled in the art would not recognize a control device as a known structure.at.instead,ergo expert explained that there were at least three different types of control devices commonly available and used at the time to control adjusting means microprocessors,discrete circuits connected to stepper motors,and analog circuits.id.although one of skill in the art may have been able to find a structure that would work,that does not satisfy.under,a patentee is only entitled to corresponding structure described in the specification and equivalents thereof,not any device capable of performing the function.emphasis added see also blackboard,that ordinarily skilled artisans could carry out the recited function in a variety of ways is precisely why claims written in form must disclose the particular structure that is used to perform the recited function.as ergo expert testimony demonstrates,the control device is not a specific structure.
as to ergo claim that control device is synonymous with computer,even if we were to accept that one skilled in the art would understand a control device to be a computer,the specification fails to disclose a corresponding algorithm required by our precedent.in wms gaming international game technology,we explained that terms are limited to the algorithms disclosed in the specification.we later clarified that wms gaming established that the corresponding structure for a claim for a function is the algorithm disclosed in the specification.harris ericsson.
until recently,we have consistently required that the structure disclosed in the specification be more than simply a general purpose computer or microprocessor.see aristocrat techs.austl.pty int l game.because general purpose computers can be programmed to perform very different tasks in very different ways,simply disclosing a computer as the structure designated to perform a particular function does not limit the scope of the claim to the corresponding structure,material,or acts that perform the function,as required by section paragraph.id.requiring disclosure of an algorithm properly defines the scope of the claim and prevents pure functional claiming.
in re katz interactive call processing patent litigation identified a narrow exception to the requirement that an algorithm must be disclosed for a computer to satisfy the disclosure requirement when the function can be achieved by any general purpose computer without special programming.in in re katz,we held that a bsent a possible narrower construction of the terms processing,receiving,and storing,the disclosure of a computer was sufficient.id.we explained that i n substance,claiming means for processing,receiving,and storing may simply claim a general purpose computer,although in terms.id.at.in other words,a computer is sufficient structure if the function of a term such as means for processing requires no more than merely processing,which any computer may do without any special programming.id.at.if special programming is required for a computer to perform the corresponding claimed function,then the default rule requiring disclosure of an algorithm applies.it is only in the rare circumstances where any computer without any special programming can perform the function that an algorithm need not be disclosed.
the control means at issue in this case can not be performed by a computer without any special programming.the function of controlling the adjusting means requires more than merely plugging in a computer.rather,some special programming would be required in order to control the adjusting means.ergo proposed construction exemplifies this any programmable computer or programmable control device suitable for use in a multichannel infusion system and equivalents thereof.a computer would need special programming to be suitable for use in a multichannel infusion system.a specially adapted computer is not a computer.
at oral argument,ergo argued that typhoon touch technologies,dell,supports its position because we held that algorithms may be disclosed in prose.oral argument at,ergo licensing,carefusion,available at http citing.an algorithm may be expressed in any understandable terms including as a mathematical formula,in prose,or as a flow chart,or in any other manner that provides sufficient structure.typhoon touch,at quoting finisar directv.even described in prose,an algorithm is still a procedure for accomplishing a given result.id.at quoting in re freeman,ccpa.in this case,however,there is no algorithm described in any form for the function of controlling the adjusting means.the specification merely provides functional language and does not contain any process for controlling the adjusting means.as a result,we hold that the district court correctly determined that the control means terms are indefinite for failure to disclose corresponding structure.
the court again,irregularly and unpredictably,departs from the established protocols of claim drafting.the claims here at issue were written in the standard straightforward manner of thousands of claims to systems in which,in today electronic technologies,digital devices routinely perform some steps of a new system.the claims here are of that genre certain steps are controlled by a device,in accordance with the known methods for such steps,as set forth in the patent specification.
ergo patent the patent,filed on june,and issued on april,describes a multichannel metering system in which one of multiple components called a control means controls various described functions.claims and are shown,with boldface marking the control means aspect that my colleagues hold is inadequately described,and that they hold thereby invalidates all of the claims

carefusion argued that the claims are invalid for lack of described structure for control means.the patent examiner did not deem the claims inadequate on this ground.pto expertise in such matters as patent examination for statutory compliance warrants deference,for the pto is a qualified government agency presumed to have properly done its job.am.hoist derrick sowa sons.the administrative procedure act demands no less.and the court wisely established in exxon research engineering united states,that close questions of indefiniteness in litigation involving issued patents are properly resolved in favor of the patentee.
the content of ergo specification including the claims is appropriate and routine.the invention is stated to be the overall system,called a multichannel metering system,as used in medical facilities to administer medicines or nutrients to patients.from the description in the court opinion,one would not suspect that the system is described in ten columns of specification,plus four figures.the element that the court finds to be inadequately described is the control device that performs the described functions.
the specification contains descriptive text in detail and completeness,describing the system in which the control device stores data fields on metering schedules.the specification starts in description of the overall system with figure,and the specification describes the system,starting with reference to this figure 
the motor drives,the first operation surface,the means,the selector switches,and the display units are connected to the control device via control lines.the control device has means for storing information,in which data fields on metering schedules of a plurality of solutions to be metered,which data fields are not represented in,are stored,as well as a programming means,which is likewise not shown,with which control and monitoring functions can be performed.the data fields associated with the individual solutions contain,the exact designation of tile solution,the type of the syringe,and the metering rate.
patent,ll emphases added.figure is as follows 
the specification describes the function and operation of the control device,including that the control device receives information about flow quantity,and generates warning signals and control commands 
t he said means send a measured quantity to the control device,and the said measured quantity is compared with stored limit values there.if necessary,the control device generates a warning signal,which is displayed on the operating surface.if the metering of the fluid flow is to be switched over to manual operation,manual metering can be blocked by the control device when the limit value is exceeded or not met.
id.at ll.at ll the specification further elaborates the operation of the control 
when the manual operating switch is actuated,the control device generates a control command,by which the predetermined adjusting means is switched into the position.
the specification also states that a multichannel metering system of this type was known in the prior art,and at ll describes a system of european patent 
a means,with which each fluid flow can be individually influenced,is located in the line path of each discharge line.the flow adjusting means are connected to a central,programmable control device,which is located in the lower part of the chassis,and which permits the selective actuation of the individual means.the control device has a means for storing information,in which data fields on discharge schedules of the individual types of fluids are stored.
the specification also references another metering system that appears in german patent document,where in that prior art system 
t he metering rates of the individual fluid flows are monitored by a central control device,but an individual coding switch,with which the metering rate can be set manually,is associated with each fluid flow source.all coding switches are connected to the control device,which calculates a total rate of delivery from the individual metering rates delivered by the coding switches to the control device,and displays it via a display on the control device.
the panel majority is not explicit as to the specific area of inadequacy of structure on which it relies for its rejection as fatally flawed under.no error is attributed to the patent examiner.the patent specification is clear that the invention is the arrangement of the components of the system,not any special or nonobvious structure of a component.the specification is clear that the inventor is not claiming the control device as its invention.the patent describes the invention that is presented for patenting 
the basic task of the present invention is to improve a multichannel metering system such that essential operating functions are integrated on a central operating surface,on the one hand,and,on the other hand,the data fields associated with the individual fluid flow sources can be polled in a simple manner,and the risk of confusion of the fluids to be metered is reduced.
id.at ll.it is a truism that patent documents need not include subject matter that is known in the field of the invention and is in the prior art,for patents are written for persons experienced in the field of the invention.nvidia.
the specification states that the invention is the arrangement of components,not an improvement in a control device the advantage of the present invention is essentially the fact that direct access to the data field of a fluid flow source or to the data fields of a predetermined group of fluid flow sources is possible by means of the selector switches.patent,ll.the specification describes structures that perform control functions.see,clearstream wasterwater,hydro action,prior art disclosed in specification included in structure for claimed means when elements were not the only points of novelty.the court departs from the routines of patent protocol,in now ruling that the control device is not described in sufficient detail to meet the requirements of.
no party disputed that a person of ordinary skill in the field of metering systems could routinely instruct the control device how to perform the described control.the pto examination for compliance with did not require whatever additional description my colleagues believe to be lacking,and on which undefined lack my colleagues invalidate all of the claims.
the presentation in the ergo patent is a typical presentation of a routine step that is performed by a known component,in the form of descriptive text and stylized figures.this court foray into patent draftsmanship,finding standard presentations now to be fatally deficient,adds grievous unreliability to duly granted patents.the invention patented by ergo displays the established protocol of specification content as characterizes many thousands of procedures.the court now rules that more was needed,although i can not discern what more,except for a shelf of zeros and ones.
the correct focus is whether one skilled in the art would have understood that the specification of each patent disclosed structure capable of performing the function recited in the claim limitation.creo,presstek.this court,recognizing the ease with which patent claims can later be criticized,stated in exxon,at that i f the meaning of the claim is discernable,even though the task may be formidable and the conclusion may be one over which reasonable persons will disagree,we have held the claim sufficiently clear to avoid invalidity on indefiniteness grounds.nonetheless,my colleagues take up the opportunistic ploy of the accused infringer,and hold,on summary judgment,that has been somehow violated,although we are not told what is missing.
it was not disputed that skilled artisans would understand the control device to be a microprocessor or circuitry to perform the steps in accordance with the criteria described in the specification.ergo disclosure conforms to the established protocol.as the specification states,the present invention is directed to the arrangement of components,of which the control device is a conventional feature,depicted in accordance with pto practice as set forth in pto rule 
content of drawing.
a the drawing in a nonprovisional application must show every feature of the invention specified in the claims.however,conventional features disclosed in the description and claims,where their detailed illustration is not essential for a proper understanding of the invention,should be illustrated in the drawing in the form of a graphical drawing symbol or a labeled representation,a labeled rectangular box.
although carefusion sold its theory to my colleagues,it is curious that the description in carefusion own patent,entitled multiple infusion system tracks that herein,for carefusion recites programmable electronic means in some claims and depicts,as the structure that performs the function,a microprocessor as a rectangular box.patent,ll id.at figure.indeed,so do thousands,perhaps hundreds of thousands,of issued patents.a challenge to a claim containing a limitation as lacking structural support requires a finding,by clear and convincing evidence,that the specification lacks disclosure of structure sufficient to be understood by one skilled in the art as being adequate to perform the recited function.budde harley davidson,see also intel via,via needed to prove,by clear and convincing evidence,that the specification lacks adequate disclosure of structure to be understood by one skilled in the art as able to perform the recited functions.such a finding could not be made on summary judgment,on the record in the district court.
precedent also establishes that the specification disclose structure for performing the claimed means is not a high bar,biomedino,llc waters technologies corporation,and does not raise the specter of an unending disclosure of what everyone in the field knows.amtel info.storage devices.there was no semblance of clear and convincing evidence of insufficient disclosure in terms of.
the panel majority argues that a person of skill in the field of the invention would not understand control device as a known structure.op.at.that argument is contrary to the specification,for knowledge of one skilled in the art can be called upon to flesh out a particular structural reference in the specification for the purpose of satisfying the statutory requirement of definiteness.creo,at.indeed,if there were some semblance of substance to this argument,again summary judgment would be negated.further,precedent does not require a function to be implemented by a single structure.see linear tech.impala linear,that the disputed term is not limited to a single structure does not disqualify it as a corresponding structure,as long as the class of structures is identifiable by a person of ordinary skill in the art.as the court stated in telcordia technologies,ciso systems,fed.cir,the specification need only disclose adequate defining structure
