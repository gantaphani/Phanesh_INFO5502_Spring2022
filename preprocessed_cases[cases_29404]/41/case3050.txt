william young appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of ohio holding that claims of patent the patent are invalid as indefinite under,and the summary judgment that the patent is unenforceable by reason of inequitable conduct.young lumenis,indefiniteness order young lumenis,inequitable conduct order.because we conclude that the term near is not indefinite,we reverse the judgment of invalidity.because we conclude that no inequitable conduct occurred during the reexamination of the patent,we reverse the court grant of summary judgment of patent unenforceability.
background 
young is the inventor of the patent,directed to a surgical method for removing a claw from a domesticated cat.a declaw procedure is known as an onychectomy,and the patent is entitled laser onychectomy by resection of the redundant epithelium of the ungual crest.figure of the patent,as represented below,illustrates the feline appendage 
the feline appendage includes a second phalanx and a third phalanx also called the claw connected by the extensor tendon,the flexor tendon,the collateral ligaments and,the epithelium,and the pad.patent.the synovium is positioned in the joint between the second and third phalanges and also connects the phalanges together.id.at.the ungual crest is the tissue that creates the hard claw.
the claimed procedure begins by making a circumferential incision in the epidermis of the ungual crest and applying traction to the epidermis in a cranial direction so that the epidermis is pushed back and exposes the extensor tendon and synovium.a laser then incises the extensor tendon and synovium,followed by ablation of the collateral ligaments,thereby permitting further disarticulation of the joint.finally,the flexor tendon and tissue of the pad are incised by the laser,permitting removal of the third phalanx.the declaw site is then covered with the preserved redundant epithelium.according to the patent,by preserving the redundant epithelium and using it to cover the declaw site,the need for surgical closure is eliminated and thus the incidence of infection is reduced.
figure of the shows in more detail the incisions made in the redundant epidermis of the ungual crest during the first step of the claimed procedure 
according to the patent,the surgeon makes a first circumferential incision in the redundant epidermis of the ungual crest along line.patent.that incision is made near the most distal edge of the epidermis and extends circumferentially around the claw to sever the epidermis from the ungual crest.id.at.after the redundant epidermis is severed from the ungual crest,that tissue is still attached to the cat claw,and the surgeon applies traction and pushes it back cranially in the direction of t.the traction in the direction of t causes the epidermis to release from its distal attachment and permits a second circumferential incision of the redundant epidermis approximately millimeters from the first incision along line.id.at.the second incision permits deeper subcutaneous tissue to be moved cranially from the ungual crest.after the redundant epidermis is separated from the ungual crest and is pushed back,the onychectomy proceeds with a laser severing the synovium between the second and third phalanges.once the onychectomy procedure is complete and the claw is removed,the preserved redundant epidermis is pushed over the declaw site to cover and protect the opening formed by the removal of the claw.
young filed the application for the patent on january.the patent issued on january,without any amendments to the claims.representative claim reads as follows 
a feline onychectomy surgical method using a laser cutting instrument,the method comprising 
a forming a first circumferential incision in the epidermis near the edge of the ungual crest of the claw,thereby severing at least some of the epidermis from the ungual crest 
b applying cranial traction to the epidermis severed from the ungual crest to displace the distal edge of the epithelium cranially 
c incising the extensor tendon near its insertion on the ungual crest 
d incising the synovium of the joint 
e applying traction to the claw in the palmar direction for disarticulating the joint 
f ablating the medial and lateral collateral ligaments 
g incising the digital flexor tendon and 
h incising the subcutaneous tissues of the pad of the second phalanx.
patent emphasis added.
on july,young filed suit in the district court against lumenis,alleging infringement of the patent and seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions,damages,and attorney fees.lumenis is a manufacturer,seller,and distributor of surgical laser instruments that were alleged to have been used to perform young patented surgical procedure.young asserted that lumenis had been teaching veterinarians to perform the patented procedure in connection with its sales efforts.lumenis responded by denying infringement and asserting a counterclaim of patent invalidity.
in june,lumenis requested reexamination of the patent by the united states patent trademark office pto.on september,the pto issued a first office action on the reexamination,rejecting independent claim and dependent claim under a as being unpatentable over two references submitted by lumenis luxar accuvet,clinical atlas,in view of fossum,small animal surgery,the fossum reference.the examiner determined that the fossum reference disclosed steps a and b in claim,the circumferential incision in the redundant epidermis and the retraction of the epidermis from the ungual crest.
the fossum reference is a chapter in a veterinary textbook,edited by professor theresa fossum,and it teaches an onychectomy procedure.fossum teaches one to circumferentially incise the hairless,skin away from the claw near the articulation between the second and third phalanx.figure is reproduced below 
the description accompanying figure states that dissection onychetomy disarticulates the third phalanx by transecting the tendons,ligaments,and other soft tissue attachments.the examiner stated that figure of fossum illustrates circumferential incision in the epidermis near the edge of the ungual crest see dotted line while fossum does not specifically state that cranial traction is applied to the epidermis or that the tissue is retracted from the ungual crest between the second and third phalanges,the figure appears to illustrate such displacement of the epidermis away from the joint between the second and third phalanges.
on october,young submitted a response to the first office action october response.that response argued that the prior art references do not teach a first circumferential incision near the edge of the ungual crest.with regard to the fossum reference,the october response argues 
the articulation between the second and third phalanx is the joint through which conventional declaw incisions proceed in a single cutting path.this is supported by the illustration referenced,b,which is shown on page of the fossum reference.this illustration has a broken line labeled incision that extends between the pii and piii phalanges.the line is not near the edge of the ungual crest,but goes through the articulation between the pii and piii phalanges emphasis in original.
after some further prosecution,the pto issued a reexamination certificate,confirming the patentability of all claims.
while the reexamination of the patent was proceeding at the pto,the district court continued to adjudicate the suit between young and lumenis.on march,the district court conducted a markman hearing.professor hedlund,author of the textbook that includes the fossum reference,testified as to onychectomy taught in that reference.hedlund was specifically asked about figure.in her direct examination,she testified 
q okay.could you turn to figure on page,looks like b do you have that in front of you 
q can you explain why the scalpel is shown at the joint in that figure 
a because this is demonstrating as you begin to cut though the tendons that attach to.
q so is this figure after the first circumferential incision has already been made 
a yes,it is.
q and has the skin already been pulled back at that point 
on,hedlund was asked to clarify her explanation of figure and she testified 
q then if we look at figure that referred to in that sentence that i directed you to a moment ago,that of hedlund exhibit,does that illustration show that incision you just described 
a no.it not really showing the cuticle incision,it referring to the anatomy there and the dotted line is showing where you go through the joint space after you made your incision.
it is whether this testimony was timely submitted to the pto that is at issue concerning the inequitable conduct claim,see infra.
on november,the court issued an order holding,inter alia,claims through to be invalid under,because the claim term near was indefinite.the court relied on amgen,chugai pharm,for the principle that a word of degree can be indefinite when it fails to distinguish the invention over the prior art and does not permit one of ordinary skill to know what activity constitutes infringement.indefiniteness order,slip op.at.the district court stated 
applying amgen to claim,step a,the court finds the word near indefinite pursuant to,for failing to distinguish the claimed subject matter from the prior art.defendant has convinced this court,by clear and convincing evidence,that a veterinary surgeon attempting to avoid infringement would be unable to do so because near fails to distinguish plaintiff patent from prior art.
id.at.after rejecting young argument that the fossum reference teaches an incision between the joint,not near the edge of the ungual crest,the court then determined that lumenis had proved by clear and convincing evidence that the fossum reference instructs a surgeon to make the incision at essentially the same point described in the patent.the court reasoned that fossum directs a surgeon to circumferentially incise the hairless,skin away from the claw near the articulation between the second and third phalanx.id.at.the court determined that i n light of this strikingly similar prior art,the court does not see how the first step in claim of the patent adequately delineates the scope of the invention.id.
the district court rejected young argument that the claims are clearly distinguishable from the prior art because the surgeon intends to and does save enough epidermis to cover the wound,unlike in the prior art.the court stated that claim,step a is invalid for indefiniteness because defendant has proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would be impossible for someone skilled in the art to determine the meaning of near so as to avoid infringement.id.at.a footnote included at the end of that statement notes that although lumenis had extensively argued that the claims were invalid for obviousness,the court would not resolve that issue because it was not fully briefed or argued before the court.indefiniteness order,slip op.at.hence,the district court held claims to be invalid only for indefiniteness.
on january,after young had filed his october response at the pto,lumenis filed a motion in the district court for summary judgment of unenforceability due to inequitable conduct during the reexamination.lumenis asserted that young engaged in inequitable conduct during the reexamination because he failed to disclose the hedlund deposition testimony to the pto,which was material,and his attorney made false statements to the pto in his october response to the first office action.subsequently,on january,young did submit hedlund deposition testimony to the pto,which was thus before the examiner issued a second office action.
on march,the district court granted lumenis motion for summary judgment of unenforceability due to inequitable conduct.the court first considered the failure to submit the hedlund deposition testimony to the pto.the court held that young had a duty to disclose that testimony to the pto because it was material.the court reasoned that 
plaintiff understanding of what is material during reexamination proceedings is mistaken.section b i expressly provides that information is material to a reexamination proceeding when i t refutes,or is inconsistent with,a position the patent owner takes in opposing an argument of unpatentability relied on by the office.b i.hedlund deposition testimony falls squarely within this category because her explanation for the diagram refutes plaintiff position that the fossum reference teaches a different incision than the incision in claims and of the patent.therefore the hedlund deposition testimony is material to the reexamination proceedings.
inequitable conduct order,slip op.at.young argued that his submission of the hedlund deposition testimony to the pto on january,before the examiner had issued its second office action,mooted the issue of whether the failure to disclose that testimony constituted inequitable conduct.in a footnote,the court disagreed and stated that i f the court finds his conduct before the pto inequitable,plaintiff recent submission does not cure his misconduct.inequitable conduct,slip op.at.the court further stated that young did not provide the updated information to the pto until defendant filed this motion and cited rohm haas crystal chemical,for the principle that to cure inequitable conduct,one must take the necessary action on one own initiative.the court also noted that rohm haas sets forth other specific requirements for remedying inequitable conduct and that young had not proved by clear and convincing evidence that he had taken the necessary steps to cure the inequitable conduct,although the court did not state which other specific requirements were not fulfilled.at the end of the footnote,the court concluded that if the court finds inequitable conduct here,young misdeeds are not cured simply because of his recent disclosure of the hedlund deposition to the pto.inequitable conduct,slip op.at.
the court next considered the allegation that young made false written statements in the october response.the court noted that the specific statements in the october response that lumenis alleged were false were that fossum teaches a skin incision at the joint between pii and piii not near the edge of the ungual crest the prior art only teaches to cut through the joint in a single straight cutting path the fossum reference also teaches a single cutting path incision starting with the skin at the joint.id.at emphases in original.the court stated that 
plaintiff statements to the pto are misleading in light of hedlund deposition testimony,which plaintiff should have submitted to the examiner and,contrary to plaintiff suggestion,hedlund deposition testimony is not merely an opinion that contradicts plaintiff argument hedlund is the author of the chapter in the fossum reference that plaintiff concedes is prior art.plaintiff statements to the examiner flatly reject the content of hedlund deposition testimony.without question,plaintiff statements are affirmative misstatements of material fact.
inequitable conduct order,slip op.at.
with regard to intent,the district court stated that g iven the highly material nature of plaintiff misleading statements and his failure to disclose hedlund deposition testimony,which the court finds to be material information,this court may properly infer an intent to deceive.id.at.the court then concluded that because lumenis demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence both that the information was material and that the conduct was intended to deceive,the court finds that plaintiff did engage in inequitable conduct before the pto,and as such,the patent is unenforceable in its entirety.id.hence,the court granted lumenis motion for summary judgment that the patent is unenforceable.id.

indefiniteness 
on appeal,young argues that the district court incorrectly determined that the term near is indefinite.according to young,the district court never considered the intrinsic evidence to determine the meaning of the term near,and instead only relied on extrinsic evidence,such as the prior art fossum reference and the hedlund deposition testimony.young asserts that the term near is clearly defined in the specification and can be construed such that it is not indefinite.moreover,young asserts that all the witnesses understood the term,including hedlund,who,in fact,used the term near in the fossum reference to describe the location of an incision.finally,young contends that the court misapplied amgen,which involved a limitation that was not supported in the specification or the prosecution history.
lumenis responds that the district court properly determined that the term near fails to distinguish the claimed invention from the prior art,and thus fails to apprise potential infringers of the scope of the claims.lumenis further asserts that if the claims were unambiguous,there would have been no need to resort to extrinsic evidence.lumenis contends that there is,in fact,no definition of the term near in the specification so that it was proper for the court to rely on extrinsic evidence.according to lumenis,the district court focus on whether the claims distinguished what was claimed from what was in the prior art was the appropriate inquiry,as stated by this court in datamize,llc plumtree software.lumenis argues that the prior art is very close.lumenis further asserts that the term near is a word of degree and is indefinite because it fails to inform the public of its bounds and is thus akin to the situation in amgen,as the district court noted.
we agree with young that the district court erred in determining that the term near is indefinite.a patent specification must conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.the purpose of the definiteness requirement is to ensure that the claims delineate the scope of the invention using language that adequately notifies the public of the patentee right to exclude.datamize,at internal citation omitted.claims are considered indefinite when they are not amenable to construction or are insolubly ambiguous thus,the definiteness of claim terms depends on whether those terms can be given any reasonable meaning.id.indefiniteness requires a determination whether those skilled in the art would understand what is claimed.to make that determination,we have explained that in the face of an allegation of indefiniteness,general principles of claim construction apply.id.at.in that regard,claim construction involves consideration of primarily the intrinsic evidence,the claim language,the specification,and the prosecution history.phillips awh,en banc.
we first consider the claim language.the term near is recited in claim a as forming a first circumferential incision in the epidermis near the edge of the ungual crest of the claw.that language implies that an incision is made in the epidermis somewhere close to or at the edge of the ungual crest.as used in the claim,the term near is not insolubly ambiguous and does not depart from the ordinary and customary meaning of the phrase near as meaning close to or at the edge of the ungual crest.
reference to the specification shows that it is consistent with that understanding of the term.the specification makes reasonably clear that the first incision is made very close to or at the edge of the ungual crest.in the brief summary of the invention,the specification describes the invented method as including a first incision in the epidermis at the edge of the ungual crest of the feline claw.patent.the specification further describes that the first incision severs the most distal portion of the epidermis from the underlying fascia of the ungual crest.id.additionally,in the detailed description of the invention,the disclosure states that the first incision is made near the most distal edge of the epidermis and extends circumferentially around the claw to sever the epidermis from the ungual crest.id.ll.thus,based on the several descriptions in the specification,we understand the term near the edge of the ungual crest as recited in the claims to mean close to or at the most distal edge of the epidermis.in fact,figure shows an example of such an incision near the edge of the ungual crest,as illustrated by line.that figure illustrates where the first incision is made in relation to the crest and phalanx,and provides a standard for measuring the meaning of the term near.
moreover,because the term near describes a location on an animal,its use,as opposed to a precise numerical measurement,is not inappropriate because the size of the appendage and the amount of skin required to be incised will vary from animal to animal based on the animal size.akin to the term approximately,a person having ordinary skill in the art would know where to make the cut thus the use of the word near does not deprive one of ordinary skill from being able to ascertain where the cut should be made.
lumenis argues that the district court properly applied amgen and determined that the term near is indefinite because it fails to distinguish the claims over the prior art.we do not agree that amgen supports the district court decision.in amgen,the invention was directed to homogeneous erythropoietin epo,a protein consisting of amino acids that stimulates the production of red blood cells.at.the claim recited homogenous epo characterized by the limitation specific activity of at least about iu per absorbance unit.id.the district court determined that bioassays provide an imprecise form of measurement with a range of error and that the use of the term about iu coupled with the range of error already inherent in the specific activity limitation,did not distinguish the invention over close prior art,which described preparations of iu,or permitted one of ordinary skill in the art to know what specific activity values below iu might constitute infringement.id.at.the claims as filed included the limitation at least.after the examiner rejected the claims because the prior art included epo having a specific activity of iu,the claims were amended to change the at least language to at least about to avoid the cited prior art.
because the term about did not give any indication as to which numerical value between the prior art specific activity value of and constituted infringement,the court held the term at least about to be indefinite.id.at.the district court further observed that there was nothing in the specification or prosecution history that provided any indication as to what range of specific activity was covered by the term about,and no expert testified as to a definite meaning for the term.for those reasons,we affirmed the district court determination of invalidity,stating that when the meaning of the claims is unclear,especially when there is close prior art,the claims properly may be held to be invalid.id.
unlike the situation in amgen,here the intrinsic evidence
