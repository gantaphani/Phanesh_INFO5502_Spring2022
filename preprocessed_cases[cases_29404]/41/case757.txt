james heiko brings suit against his former employer,colombo savings bank,alleging a failure to promote and constructive discharge on the basis of disability.at the time of the alleged discrimination,heiko suffered from renal complete kidney spent three afternoons per week,for a total of twelve hours,attached to a dialysis machine that removed fatal toxins from his blood.the district court granted summary judgment for colombo,holding that heiko was not disabled under the americans with disabilities act ada because the elimination of bodily waste is not a major life activity.see a.it also held in the alternative that even if heiko was disabled,he had not proffered facts sufficient to support a finding of discrimination.
we hold that elimination of bodily waste is a major life activity within the meaning of the ada.with respect to the allegations of discrimination,summary judgment was improper on the claim of failure to promote,because heiko has presented a strong prima facie case of disability discrimination and considerable evidence of job qualifications superior to those of the person selected in his stead.summary judgment was proper,however,on the allegation of constructive discharge.we therefore affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
in january,james heiko commenced employment with colombo savings bank as a loan assistant in the loan administration department.colombo is a small commercial bank in maryland that employs approximately thirty people.prior to joining colombo,heiko had received his undergraduate degree in mathematics in.he had worked in the banking industry since,most recently as a research representative with the chase manhattan bank.
heiko moved quickly through the ranks at colombo.in april,the bank president and ceo,john lane,approved heiko promotion to senior operations loan tfl supervisor.with lane approval,heiko was again promoted in june,this time to assistant vice president of loan administration.in this new capacity,heiko handled a wide range of commercial lending responsibilities,including reviewing escrow analyses,monitoring commercial loans,and preparing reports and audits.he also assumed some supervisory authority over various employees in loan administration.
heiko had a variety of other duties at colombo.throughout the course of his tenure at the bank,he was often asked to tackle problems outside the loan administration department.among other things,he was responsible for creating a loan tracking device and a weekly loan report.he also participated in meetings on banking matters unrelated to his primary duties.heiko received favorable performance evaluations,and in december lane named him employee of the year at a bank holiday function.
heiko had polycystic kidney disease when he joined colombo.several months after his promotion to assistant vice president,his condition deteriorated and he was diagnosed with renal disease.this disease renders the kidneys virtually inoperative.in a normal human body,the kidneys filter from the blood dangerous toxins that naturally build up over time,allowing these toxins to exit the body during urination.to avoid toxic waste buildup,and death within several months,renal disease must be treated with either a kidney transplant or dialysis.
heiko began hemodialysis in november.in this procedure,heiko blood was pumped through a dialysis machine,which purged the toxins and returned the cleansed blood to his body.heiko attached to the dialysis machine by inserting a needle into a fistula located in his arm.a fistula is a connection between an artery and vein,designed to withstand frequent needle insertions and augment blood flow.
heiko dialysis regimen required a substantial amount of time and forced him to rearrange his work schedule.he underwent dialysis three afternoons each week for four hours each day.to keep up a work week,heiko had to maintain irregular hours,working from to on the days he received dialysis.
heiko dialysis treatment caused him significant discomfort.according to heiko,dialysis was like having a job.being attached to a dialysis machine was constricting,and often caused pain and swelling in his arm,where the needle attached to his fistula.after dialysis,he immediately went home to rest and felt exhausted for the remainder of the evening.he was usually able to take only baths because standing in the shower was too difficult.in the following mornings he would often feel the urge to vomit,and would frequently remain nauseous well into that day.dialysis also necessitated changes to his diet,such as limitations on potassium intake,occasional fasting,and a reduction in fluid consumption.heiko was once hospitalized for low potassium levels and had one of his kidneys removed in.he also had several surgeries to build and repair his fistula.
after heiko had begun dialysis,heather brown,colombo vice president of loan administration and heiko immediate supervisor,began preparing to leave colombo.heiko was interested in her position,and discussed his desire for a promotion with brown and lane.in march,however,lane awarded the vice president position to sandy rubin on brown recommendation.brown had considered only rubin and heiko for the position,but had not conducted interviews.
prior to her promotion to vice president,rubin had been employed with colombo for approximately eighteen months and had served as the head of colombo mortgage operations department.she did not have a college degree,but had worked in banking since the.the mortgage operations department handled mortgage loans and was initially distinct from loan administration,which was primarily concerned with commercial loans.mortgage operations was eventually subsumed into loan administration and brown became rubin supervisor.rubin was not,however,familiar with certain types of management reports or with several of the computer programs utilized in the loan administration department.after her promotion to vice president,heiko assisted in training her on various software applications and spreadsheet functions.
upon learning that rubin had received the promotion,heiko approached both lane and brown to determine why he had not been named vice president.according to heiko,lane referred to the number of hours the vice president would need to work and noted that if heiko was to receive a kidney transplant,he would have to be out of the office for four to six months.heiko contends that he had informed lane on numerous occasions that a kidney transplant would only require a absence.when heiko confronted brown about rubin promotion,she replied look at your situation.
heiko warned lane that promoting rubin was a mistake and informed various colombo officers that he would not work under her.lane asked heiko if he would,in addition to some of his current responsibilities,be interested in taking over rubin former responsibility managing the mortgage operations department,which was apparently in disarray.heiko declined this lateral move.
in july,heiko instead transferred to the loan processing department and began work as a loan processor.this move resulted in the loss of his assistant vice president title and his previous responsibilities,but not a diminution in his salary.heiko was aware that he would no longer be considered an assistant vice president once he joined loan processing.on july,he was informed that he would not receive an annual pay raise.
soon after,heiko complained to several colombo officers that the bank was discriminating against him on the basis of his kidney failure by not promoting him and later reducing his responsibilities.he also relayed this complaint to lane,and they discussed the matter.around the same time,heiko informed colombo that he had been searching for new employment.
in early august of,lane informed heiko that the loan processing department was overstaffed and that the only available position was as his executive assistant.heiko accepted this position.lane also told heiko that he would not be needed before.this impacted heiko total hours,because he still had to leave early for dialysis every other day.after several weeks as an executive assistant,lane asked heiko to move back to loan administration because a loan assistant position had become available.this was the position heiko had occupied when he first joined colombo.
heiko resigned from colombo in october,after accepting employment elsewhere.in june,he received a kidney transplant and does not now require dialysis.sandy rubin,meanwhile,did not fare well as the vice president of loan administration.in january,lane demoted rubin to her former position and cut her salary.she resigned in february after colombo decided to terminate her employment.
heiko filed suit against colombo in state court in march alleging discrimination on the basis of his kidney failure,in violation of article,of the montgomery county code.the parties agreed that was to be interpreted consistent with the federal ada.as relevant here,heiko contended that he was covered under the definition of disability set forth in the ada because his renal disease rendered him substantially limit ed in the major life activit y of eliminating bodily waste.see a.colombo removed the suit to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.see.
the district court granted summary judgment for colombo.it held that waste elimination was not a major life activity,and that heiko was therefore not disabled.it also held that even if he had a disability,heiko had not set forth facts sufficient to permit findings of discriminatory failure to promote or constructive discharge.heiko appeals.
the threshold question before us is whether heiko is disabled within the meaning of the ada.a court may resolve this issue as a matter of law.see caldera,cir involving the parallel provisions of the rehabilitation act,et.while heiko has brought this suit under the montgomery county code,the relevant definition of disability in this municipal code is virtually identical to the ada definition of the term.compare montgomery county,code,c with.the parties agree that the montgomery county code tracks the ada in all relevant respects,and we accordingly analyze this case under that federal statute.see also cohen montgomery county dep t of health human,interpreting the disability discrimination provisions in the montgomery county code as congruent with the ada.
the ada provides that an individual has a disability if,inter alia,he suffers from a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of his major life activities.a.heiko is thus required to make a showing.he must prove that he has a physical or mental impairment,that this impairment implicates at least one major life activity,and that the limitation is substantial.see toyota motor,williams,d bragdon abbott,d pollard high of baltimore,cir.the parties agree that heiko renal disease constitutes a physical impairment.we thus proceed to the major life activity and substantial limitation questions.
the ada does not define the term major life activities.torcasio murray,cir.the supreme court has,however,explained that m ajor in the phrase major life activities means important.toyota motor,at.an activity may lack a public or economic dimension and still be considered important.bragdon,at.we have therefore concluded that t he term major life activities refers to those activities that are of central importance to daily life,rohan networks presentations llc,cir quoting toyota motor,at.and that the average person in the general population can perform with little or no difficulty,id.internal quotation marks omitted.
heiko contends that his kidney failure severely impacted his ability to eliminate bodily waste.under the framework presented above,we conclude that waste elimination qualifies as a major life activity.the elimination of bodily waste is basic to any person daily regimen.it is also a daily activity that the average person can accomplish with little effort,see rohan,at,by urinating several times a day.the elimination of bodily waste is,moreover,not only of central importance to daily life,toyota motor,at,but of importance.without it,hazardous toxins would remain in the body and eventually become fatal.for all of these reasons,waste elimination also fits comfortably within the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc list of major life activities,which includes functions such as caring for oneself,performing manual tasks,walking,seeing,hearing,speaking,breathing,learning,and working.i 
it is therefore not surprising that every circuit court to address the issue has concluded that waste elimination is a major life activity.for example,in fiscus stores,cir,the plaintiff suffered from renal disease and received dialysis treatment.the third circuit concluded that processing and eliminating waste from the blood qualifies as a major life activity because,in their absence,death results.id.at see kammueller loomis,fargo,cir holding that plaintiff who underwent dialysis was incapable of doing activities of central importance to a person life,such as cleansing one own blood cells see also gilbert frank,cir noting that persons whose kidneys do not function sufficiently to rid their bodies of waste matter without regular dialysis may be substantially limited in their ability to care for themselves.
the district court reasoned,however,that waste elimination was not a major life activity because it was merely a characteristic of heiko kidney failure.this was not correct.the impairment in this case is heiko kidney failure.the effect of this impairment is an inability to eliminate waste naturally.see also fiscus,at absence of kidney function is the impairment the consequence is the impact on the activity of blood cleansing and body waste processing.thus it was incorrect for the district court to conflate the two.
were the district court correct,the ada would not cover major life activities that are closely linked with serious disabilities.for example,the supreme court in toyota explicitly noted that major life activities is a category that includes such basic abilities as walking,seeing,and hearing.at.but an inability to see could of course be recast as a characteristic of blindness,and an inability to hear could likewise be reframed as a feature of deafness.see also i major life activities include seeing and hearing.waste elimination thus can not be a mere characteristic of renal disease for the purposes of the ada.
this does not mean,however,that every example of organ failure will be equated with a major life activity.in this case,kidney failure is a physical impairment with a direct effect on waste elimination,an activity of critical importance that the average individual can easily perform.see rohan,at.we have no occasion to consider whether the malfunction of other organs would have a similar effect on a major life activity.see fiscus,at m ajor life activities are conceptually distinct from the physical impairments that give rise to them.such questions are simply not before us.
nor do we accept colombo contention that recognizing waste elimination as a major life activity would effectively read out the separate statutory requirement that a plaintiff prove he is substantially limited.to be sure,recognition of a major life activity gives rise to the implication that certain impairments are by their very nature substantially limiting the major life activity of seeing,for example,is always substantially limited by blindness.see,runnebaum nationsbank of,cir en banc plurality w e recognize that some conditions will always constitute impairments that substantially limit the major life activities of the afflicted individual.abrogated on other grounds,bragdon,at.it would be ironic,to say the least,if the existence of such severe conditions prevented us from recognizing the major life activities they impair.nevertheless,the substantiality inquiry remains analytically separate from the identification of a major life activity.as we demonstrate below,whether a person is substantially limited is a distinct and individualized inquiry that must consider not only a particular plaintiff limitations,but also the effects of corrective mitigation measures.see sutton united air lines,d halperin abacus tech,cir.not every impairment of sight is a substantial limitation,see sutton,at,and there is little reason to think that every instance of kidney disease will constitute a substantial limitation either.
we thus turn to whether heiko kidney failure substantially limit ed his ability to eliminate waste.a.the statutory term substantially means considerable or to a large degree.toyota motor,at.internal quotation marks omitted.this definition precludes coverage of impairments whose effects on a major life activity rise only to the level of a mere difference with the abilities of an average individual.albertson,kirkingburg,d see also eeoc sara lee,cir no substantial limitation in major life activity of sleeping where plaintiff did not experience a greater lack of sleep than the average individual.as we have explained,t he phrase substantially limits sets a threshold that excludes minor impairments from coverage under the ada.id.at.
among the factors courts should consider in making the substantial limitation determination are the impairment nature and severity and expected duration.j i ii see also pollard,at same.the impairment must,for example,be permanent or long term.toyota motor,at.sporadic or otherwise temporary impairments do not qualify as substantial limitations.see rohan,at pollard,at.
whether heiko is substantially limited in a major life activity is thus determined by examining the unique facts and circumstances surrounding his particular impairment.see toyota motor,at.sutton,at.ennis ass of bus.educ.radio,cir.we conduct this inquiry by assessing the impairment in combination with any positive or negative effects from mitigation measures.see sutton,at.
reviewing heiko renal disease and dialysis under this individualized framework,we conclude that heiko was substantially limited in his ability to eliminate waste.indeed,no reasonable jury could conclude otherwise.in order to accomplish the equivalent of urination,heiko had to insert a needle into his fistula and tether himself to a dialysis machine three afternoons per week,for a total of twelve hours.this did not include travel time to and from the dialysis center,or the time required to set up the dialysis equipment.dialysis also unyieldingly set the terms of his daily schedule.while he was able to work a week,his condition required him to arrive at work by every other day.and whereas urination does not have side effects,after dialysis heiko felt nauseous and depleted,unable even to stand in the shower.these aspects of his renal failure and concomitant treatment dramatically distinguish him from the general population in the major life activity of waste elimination.rohan,at.and while dialysis did of course enable heiko to eliminate waste,the ada addresses substantial limitations on major life activities,not utter inabilities.bragdon,at.
heiko impairment was also neither fleeting or temporary,rohan,at,as he dealt with dialysis and its unfortunate effects each day.the prospect of a kidney transplant was speculative at waited on a transplant list for over two years,and only received a new kidney after nearly four years of dialysis.crucially,at all times relevant to this case,he labored under the uncompromising limitations we have just described.for all of these reasons,heiko impairment and mitigation measures rise to the level of severity that the substantial limitation requirement demands.see j i 
in sum,plaintiff renal disease is his physical impairment,the elimination of waste is the major life activity that is limited,and the limitation was a substantial one because heiko was required to spend at least four hours,three days a week undergoing dialysis in order to remove waste from his body.considering heiko circumstances through any broader lens on disability only reconfirms a close textual analysis under the statute.we can hardly believe that congress wished to leave outside the purview of the ada an individual determined to surmount a real disability and make a constructive contribution to the workplace.the ada was designed to protect the truly disabled,but genuinely capable.see halperin,at.in short,heiko seems just the sort of person for whom the ada was intended.viewed from the perspective of the forest or the trees,the act coverage of him is apparent.
we next address the district court grant of summary judgment to colombo on heiko failure to promote and constructive discharge claims.we conclude that summary judgment was improper on the claim of failure to promote,which presents a jury question.as to heiko constructive discharge contention,the district court properly awarded summary judgment to the employer.
heiko first alleges that colombo did not promote him to vice president of loan administration because of his renal disease.colombo contends that it promoted sandy rubin instead of heiko due to her superior qualifications.because colombo disclaims any suggestion that its decision was founded on heiko disability,this case is properly analyzed under the familiar framework set forth in mcdonnell douglas green,d,and its progeny.see halperin,at ennis,at see also raytheon hernandez,d noting that courts use the mcdonnell douglas methodology for ada claims 
under mcdonnell douglas,the plaintiff must first make out a prima facie case of discrimination.see anderson westinghouse savannah river,cir.if he does so successfully,the burden then shifts to the defendant to provide a legitimate,explanation for its decision.see.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d bryant aiken reg l med.ctrs,cir.once such a neutral reason is proffered,the burden reverts to the plaintiff to establish that the employer rationale is a pretext for intentional discrimination.see reeves sanderson plumbing,d.at this point,a plaintiff prima facie case,combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer asserted justification is false,may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated.id.at.see also anderson,at.
there can be no doubt in this case that heiko has established at least a prima facie inference of discrimination,and that colombo has successfully rebutted it by responding that it selected rubin over heiko due to her superior qualifications.see evans techs.applications serv,cir r elative employee qualifications are widely recognized as valid,bases for any adverse employment decision.we thus turn to the crux of the there is sufficient evidence of pretext.reeves,at.a plaintiff alleging a failure to promote can prove pretext by showing that he was better qualified,or by amassing circumstantial evidence that otherwise undermines the credibility of the employer stated reasons.see anderson,at dennis columbia colleton med,cir.
in conducting this analysis,we are mindful that we assess relative job qualifications based on the criteria that the employer has established as relevant to the position in question.see anderson,at citing beall abbott,cir and jiminez mary washington,cir.here,colombo focused primarily on banking skills and experience.in a job description of the vice president position,colombo listed as the relevant job specifications computer literacy and l oan managerial experience in a banking atmosphere.heather brown testified that there was no specific formula she used to evaluate candidates,but that banking experience and how much training the candidate would require were primary considerations.
construing the facts in favor of heiko,as we must,we conclude that a reasonable factfinder could determine that colombo explanation for its promotion decision is unworthy of credence.burdine,at.heiko was climbing his way toward the upper rungs of loan administration when his kidney condition declined and he began extensive dialysis treatment.he was then denied a promotion.heiko has satisfied his burden under mcdonnell douglas because in light of colombo proffered job criteria,a reasonable jury could the basis of heiko greater familiarity with various aspects of commercial lending,his superior mastery of the relevant computer programs used in the loan administration department,his quick succession of promotions,and his performance colombo contention that he was less qualified than rubin is not to be believed.we address each in turn.
first,a reasonable fa
