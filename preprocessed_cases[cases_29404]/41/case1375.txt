roger craft filed an application in august for disability insurance benefits dib and an application in september for supplemental security income ssi,alleging a disability due to diabetes mellitus and disorders.both claims were denied initially and upon reconsideration.craft timely requested a hearing before an administrative law judge alj,which was held on october.the alj determined that craft did not qualify for dib or ssi because he could perform a significant number of jobs despite his limitations.the appeals council denied review of the alj decision.the district court affirmed the alj decision and denied craft motion to alter or amend the judgment.upon review,we conclude that the alj erred in evaluating craft mental impairments and in making the credibility determination accordingly,we reverse.
background 
in,craft was injured at work when a forklift crushed his left foot.he experienced pain in his foot for the next three years,at which time his podiatrist,santangelo,referred him to neurologist sicotte.sicotte noted that craft had decreased sensation and strength in his foot,and the results of an emg nerve conduction test indicated a neuropathy which was sensory in nature he did not have peripheral neuropathy.in may,craft underwent an operation on his foot,and he continued to see his podiatrist regularly until discharged from care in august.craft was also diagnosed with type i diabetes mellitus in may,after complaining of thirst,frequent urination,weight loss,and blurred vision 
craft medical records do not indicate that he visited any doctors in,but he visited nichols for his diabetes once in september.craft applied for disability in august,at the age of.on september,craft reported to the emergency room at cook county hospital,complaining of muscle pain,frequent urination,thirst,weight loss,and weakness for the previous six months.he was given insulin and released.on october,rodriguez completed a physical assessment form,finding that craft suffered from diabetes,was twenty percent limited in several areas of physical activity,and had mild mental impairments.he was hospitalized on the same day and diagnosed with hyperglycemia secondary to medicine noncompliance.craft reported that he had not been taking his medication due to unpleasant side effects and an inability to afford the medication.
on october,shaikh examined craft at the request of disability determination services dds craft again reported that he had previously stopped taking his medication because he could not afford it.shaikh noted that craft had uncontrolled diabetes,scabbing on his left leg and varicose veins in both legs,decreased range of motion in his left knee,hip pain with normal range of motion,early retinopathy neuropathy in the left hand,loss of sensation in the left foot and lower third of the leg,and decreased memory.frey completed a psychiatric examination of craft on the same day,also at the request of dds.frey noted craft physical and mental complaints and diagnosed him with dysthymic disorder 
on november,a state agency psychiatrist,tomassetti,completed a psychiatric review technique form and a mental residual functional capacity evaluation.tomassetti noted that craft had dysthymic disorder,he had mild impairments in three areas of mental functional limitation,and he was moderately limited in several areas relevant to his ability to work.
craft visited rodriguez again on december,and received prescriptions for his diabetes and neuropathy.he visited a doctor to complain that his diabetes medication was not working on april,and he was prescribed a different medicine.on may,craft visited a doctor to complain about additional symptoms associated with his new medicine.he visited a doctor again on may,at which time his glucose levels were elevated.
on june,craft complained about pain in his extremities,which the doctor noted might indicate neuropathy.he was again diagnosed with probable diabetic neuropathy on july,after he complained about pain in his extremities.on september,he complained of severe leg pain and an inability to sleep.on november,he was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy,and he received another prescription for his neuropathy on february.
dang performed a psychiatric examination of craft by request of dds on may.dang diagnosed craft with dysthymia and noted that craft experienced depression,anger,difficulty with concentration,and tiredness.dang completed a mental analysis form for craft ability to do activities,and he found craft to have mild and moderate limitations in several areas.on july,craft reported improvement in symptoms of his neuropathy the doctor noted a rash on craft legs and renewed the prescription for craft neuropathy medication.on october,craft visited escalona,who diagnosed craft with diabetes,uncontrolled diabetic neuropathy,and depression.escalona also noted that craft continued to have paresthesia and pain in his arms and legs despite the neuropathy medication 
the hearing for craft disability claims was held on october.craft was years old at the time.the alj heard testimony from craft and his landlord,vivian hedemark.craft testified that he experienced paresthesia in his arms,legs,and back,which caused him to have difficulty sleeping at night.he also complained of loss of teeth,memory loss,and weight loss.the alj questioned craft as to the extent of his daily activities.craft testified that daily activities left him exhausted.he cooked his own meals,walked to the mailbox daily,vacuumed once a week,and occasionally drove until his vehicle needed repairs that he could not afford.hedemark testified about craft weight loss,memory loss,and rages that he would go into when his diabetes was high.she also confirmed that craft could not sleep at night because she could hear him walking around and watching television.after consulting with a vocational expert ve,the alj concluded that craft was not disabled.
ii.analysis 
where the appeals council has denied review of the alj decision,we review the alj decision as the final decision of the commissioner.schmidt astrue,cir.we review the alj legal conclusions de novo.id.we deferentially review the alj factual determinations and affirm the alj if the decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record.id.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.barnett barnhart,cir.the alj is not required to mention every piece of evidence but must provide an accurate and logical bridge between the evidence and the conclusion that the claimant is not disabled,so that as a reviewing court,we may assess the validity of the agency ultimate findings and afford the claimant meaningful judicial review.young barnhart,cir.
a claim of disability is determined under a sequential analysis.see dib ssi the first step considers whether the applicant is engaging in substantial gainful activity.the second step evaluates whether an alleged physical or mental impairment is severe,medically determinable,and meets a durational requirement.the third step compares the impairment to a list of impairments that are considered conclusively disabling.if the impairment meets or equals one of the listed impairments,then the applicant is considered disabled if the impairment does not meet or equal a listed impairment,then the evaluation continues.the fourth step assesses an applicant residual functional capacity rfc and ability to engage in past relevant work.if an applicant can engage in past relevant work,he is not disabled.the fifth step assesses the applicant rfc,as well as his age,education,and work experience to determine whether the applicant can engage in other work.if the applicant can engage in other work,he is not disabled.
in this case,at steps one and two,the alj determined that craft had not engaged in substantial gainful activity and that he had severe impairments due to insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with neuropathy and early retinopathy,a history of crush injury to the left foot,and dysthymia.at step three,the alj determined that the impairments did not meet or equal the listed impairments.the alj next determined that craft rfc was for a full range of light work,limited to simple,unskilled tasks.the alj reasoned that the rfc was appropriate because no greater or additional limitations were justified by the medical evidence and craft complaints were not entirely credible.at step four,the alj concluded that craft could not return to his past relevant work,which consisted of driving trucks and hvac installation.the alj consulted a ve who opined that craft could engage in work as a hand packager or assembler.at step five,the alj agreed that craft could engage in this work,and,therefore,concluded he was not disabled.
mental limitations 
craft first argues that the alj failed to use the special technique to assess his mental impairments.the special technique is set forth in a,and it is used to analyze whether a claimant has a medically determinable mental impairment and whether that impairment causes functional limitations.if a limitation is of severity,then the claimant is conclusively disabled.thus,the special technique is used to evaluate mental impairments at steps two and three of the evaluation.see ssr.
the special technique requires that the alj evaluate the claimant pertinent symptoms,signs,and laboratory findings to determine whether the claimant has a medically determinable mental impairment.a b.if the claimant has a medically determinable mental impairment,then the alj must document that finding and rate the degree of functional limitation in four broad areas activities of daily living social functioning concentration,persistence,or pace and episodes of decompensation.id.a c.these functional areas are known as the b criteria.see pt,subpt.p,app,et.
the first three functional areas are rated on a scale of none,mild,moderate,marked,and extreme.a c.the final functional area is rated on a scale of none,one or two,three,and four or more.id.the ratings in the functional areas correspond to a determination of severity of mental impairment.id.a d.if the alj rates the first three functional areas as none or mild and the fourth area as none,then generally the impairment is not considered severe.id.otherwise,the impairment is considered severe,and the alj must determine whether it meets or is equivalent in severity to a listed mental disorder.id.a d.if the mental impairment does not meet or is not equivalent to any listing,then the alj will assess the claimant rfc.id.a d.the alj must document use of the special technique by incorporating the pertinent findings and conclusions into the written decision.id.a e.the decision must elaborate on significant medical history,including examination and laboratory findings,and the functional limitations that were considered in reaching a conclusion about the mental impairment severity.the decision must also incorporate a specific finding as to the degree of limitation in each of the functional areas.id.
in this case,the alj determined at step two that craft had severe limitations due to insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with neuropathy and early retinopathy,a history of crush injury to the left foot,and dysthymia.as the government concedes,the alj did not apply the special technique to determine the severity of craft mental impairments.the alj implicitly found that craft dysthymia was a medically determinable impairment but then apparently jumped to the conclusion that the dysthymia was severe without discussing craft mental medical history or rating the severity of the four functional areas of limitation.the alj did recite some of craft mental medical history in the rfc analysis however,the rfc analysis is not a substitute for the special technique,even though some of the evidence considered may overlap.see ssr.the alj explicitly stated that craft limitations from his physical and mental impairments did not individually or in combination meet or equal a listed impairment.
the government argues that the alj failure to use the special technique is harmless because craft has not shown that consideration of the b criteria would have resulted in a determination of disability due to a impairment.after all,the alj did determine that craft had a severe mental impairment and considered whether it met or equaled a listed impairment,as required by the final step of the special technique.under some circumstances,the failure to explicitly use the special technique may indeed be harmless error.see,keys barnhart,cir finding harmless error where an older version of a regulation was used because the outcome would have been the same under the new regulation.we can not conclude that it was harmless here because the alj failure to consider the functional impairments during the special technique analysis was compounded by a failure of analysis during the mental rfc determination,as we will discuss further.ultimately,the alj gave short shrift to potential limitations caused by craft mental impairments,and that error requires a remand.
craft next argues that the alj failed to determine a proper mental rfc for craft,resulting in the ve being given a flawed hypothetical,which affected the alj determination of craft at step five of the analysis.the rfc is the maximum that a claimant can still do despite his mental and physical limitations.a ssr.it is based upon the medical evidence in the record and other evidence,such as testimony by the claimant or his friends and family.a.the alj is required to determine which treating and examining doctors opinions should receive weight and must explain the reasons for that finding.id.d,f.
when determining the rfc,the alj must consider all medically determinable impairments,physical and mental,even those that are not considered severe.id.a,b,c.mental limitations must be part of the rfc assessment,because a limited ability to carry out certain mental activities,such as limitations in understanding,remembering,and carrying out instructions,and in responding appropriately to supervision,coworkers,and work pressures in a work setting,may reduce a claimant ability to do past work and other work.id.c.
in explaining the basis for the rfc,the alj first listed craft alleged symptoms and limitations.she discussed craft daily activities and hedemark testimony.as is relevant to the mental analysis,the alj stated that craft and hedemark testified about craft memory loss.the alj stated that hedemark also testified that craft had mood swings and would go into rages when his diabetes was high.the alj then recited some of craft medical history.
with respect to possible mental limitations,the alj noted that treating physician rodriguez had found craft to have mild limitations in activities of daily living,social functioning,and concentration,persistence,and pace.the alj noted that frey psychiatric examination found craft to be mildly depressed,frustrated,and helpless,and that craft believed it was due to his diabetes and his inability to pay for medication.frey also noted that craft memory was within normal limits,and he diagnosed craft with dysthymic disorder.the alj noted that dang psychiatric examination reported that craft mood was depressed,he appeared tired,and he had a problem with concentration.dang diagnosed craft with dysthymia and assigned a global assessment of functioning gaf of finally,the alj noted that treating physician escalona diagnosed him with depression and also stated that he suffered from mood swings.
the alj concluded that craft rfc was 
a full range of light work,which involves lifting no more than pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to pounds,except that he can only walk occasionally,can not climb,and can not perform more than simple,unskilled tasks.the limitation to simple,unskilled task s is based on the claimant history of dysthymia and complaints of ongoing fatigue due to an inability to sleep well.
based upon the ve opinion that craft previous jobs required a medium to very heavy level of exertion,the alj concluded that craft could not perform past relevant work.the alj asked the ve the following hypothetical for a claimant aged with craft prior work experience can lift up to pounds occasionally,pounds frequently.sit,stand,or walk as required.can occasionally walk.can not climb.can perform simple unskilled tasks,which by definition can be detailed but not require a lot of variables to them.the ve concluded that the claimant could perform work as a hand packager and assembly line worker,of which there were positions in the chicago area,and the alj ultimately adopted this finding in her decision.the alj asked the ve additional hypotheticals with varying physical limitations,but no mental limitations were added.
the alj mental rfc analysis is troubling in several respects.most significantly,the alj rfc and the hypotheticals given to the ve ostensibly accounted for craft mental impairments by limiting him to simple,unskilled work.however,the social security administration has explained b ecause response to the demands of work is highly individualized,the skill level of a position is not necessarily related to the difficulty an individual will have in meeting the demands of the job.a claimant mental condition may make performance of an unskilled job as difficult as an objectively more demanding job.ssr.
the government directs our attention to johansen barnhart,cir,in which the alj adopted a medical opinion where a doctor had translated the checkmarks on a mental rfc assessment form into a suggested rfc that the claimant could engage in repetitive,work.here,the only doctor to fill out a mental rfc assessment checklist was tomassetti,whose opinion the alj never mentioned.tomassetti placed checkmarks in boxes to indicate that craft had moderate and slight limitations in several areas,and the narrative portion of the form translated that craft had the ability to understand and recall instructions,his mood moderately interfered with his concentration and pace,and he enjoyed people but had a difficult time controlling his temper.in johansen,the rfc reflected some work requirements that were relevant to mental abilities,repetition and stress here,the rfc was for unskilled work,which by itself does not provide any information about craft mental condition or abilities.the social security administration has stated that where the claimant has the ability to understand,carry out,and remember simple instructions respond appropriately to supervision,coworkers,and usual work situations and deal with changes in a routine work setting,then an rfc of unskilled work would be appropriate.see c ssr.
here,the use of the term unskilled is unhelpful because we can not discern whether the alj actually found craft to have those abilities.most of the alj discussion of craft medical history is merely a recitation of information contained in his medical records.the alj implicitly found that rodriguez opinion deserved less weight,and she explicitly found that two state agents opinions should be accorded some weight only one was a psychiatric assessment,by frey.the rest of the medical opinions were recited without a determination of weight therefore,we can not determine the significance of dang opinion,and,as noted previously,tomassetti opinion was never mentioned at all.all three psychiatric assessments by frey,dang,and tomassetti indicate that craft had some level of difficulty with memory,concentration,or mood swings.we conclude that the there is not an accurate and logical bridge between the alj recitation of the mental medical evidence and the decision to account for craft mental impairments by limiting him to unskilled work.
although the alj is not required to mention every piece of evidence,we note for future reference some of the unmentioned mental evidence that seemed particularly critical to the mental rfc analysis.tomassetti found craft to be moderately limited in two of the b criteria social functioning and concentration,persistence,or pace,as well as moderately limited in the ability to understand,remember,and carry out detailed instructions,the ability to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods,the ability to complete a normal workday without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms,and the ability to get along with coworkers or peers without distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes.the alj certainly is entitled to give psychiatrist tomassetti opinion whatever weight that it is due however,the failure to mention this detailed mental assessment is cause for concern.the alj also failed to note that frey evaluation mentioned that craft mental functioning had been reduced.although this statement seems inconsistent with some of frey other conclusions about craft,we can not tell whether the alj considered and rejected this piece of evidence because she did not mention it.finally,the alj discussed dang evaluation but failed to mention any of the moderate and slight mental limitations that dang found craft to possess.
physical limitations 
craft also asserts that the alj erred in assessing his physical limitations because of a negative credibility finding.an alj is in the best position to determine the credibility of witnesses,and we review that determination deferentially.sims barnhart,cir.we overturn a credibility determination only if it is patently wrong.prochaska barnhart,cir.the determination of credibility must contain specific reasons for the credibility finding.arnold barnhart,cir citing ssr.the finding must be supported by the evidence and must be specific enough to enable the claimant and a reviewing body to understand the reasoning.id.where the credibility determination is based upon objective factors rather than subjective considerations,we have greater freedom to review the alj decision.clifford apfel,cir quoting herron shalala,cir.
an alj must consider a claimant subjective complaints of pain if the claimant has a medically determined impairment that could reasonably be expected to produce that pain.c.here,the alj determined that the objective medical evidence did not provide strong support for craft claimed symptoms and limitations.the alj conclusion that craft complaints were not supported by the medical evidence was based upon three considerations.
first,the alj found that craft complaints were not entirely credible because he did not seek any treatment from to.while reciting craft medical history,the alj acknowledged that craft was treated several times during and left only and without treatment.the alj failed to note,however,that craft was also treated on september.the government asserts that this was harmless error because the doctor report from the visit in did not contain any information of substance,and it still demonstrates craft dearth of treatment during that time period.several of craft medical records noted,however,that craft had been out of compliance with his medicine and did not seek regular treatment because of his inability to cover the associated costs.in assessing credibility,infrequent treatment or failure to follow a treatment plan can support an adverse credibility finding where the claimant does not have a good reason for the failure or infrequency of treatment.ssr.however,the alj must not draw any inferences about a claimant condition from this failure unless the alj has explored the claimant explanations as to the lack of medical care.id.an inability to afford treatment is one reason that can provide insight into the individual credibility.id.here,although the alj drew a negative inference as to craft credibility from his lack of medical care,she neither questioned him about his lack of treatment or medicine noncompliance during that period,nor did she note that a number of medical records reflected that craft had reported an inability to pay for regular treatment and medicine.
second,the alj claimed in her written decision that craft had a litany of complaints that were not noted in the treatment records until the day after the hearing specifically,the claimant was asked at the hearing if he had ever addressed the various complaints to his doctors and he said he raised them every time this does not enhance his credibility.this statement by the alj is completely without foundation.
craft complaints at the hearing included pain and tingling in his legs his left leg had been bothering him for a few years and his right leg began to bother him in jun
