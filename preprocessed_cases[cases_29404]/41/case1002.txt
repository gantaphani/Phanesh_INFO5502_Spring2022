normally our task in construing a contract or similar document is to identify not merely a reasonable interpretation,but the best one.in some cases,however,some other court or entity is to determine what interpretation is best.in those cases,we might ask whether that court interpretation is reasonable,and if so leave matters there.
this is such a case.at issue in these appeals are two orders interpreting different provisions of a single bankruptcy plan.the court that entered those orders is more familiar with the plan and the circumstances surrounding it than we are,so we ask primarily whether its interpretations of the two provisions are reasonable.we conclude that its interpretation of one provision is reasonable,but that,for technical grammatical reasons,its interpretation of the other provision is not.
in,dow corning had pending against it thousands of lawsuits relating to breast implants it had manufactured.dow corning filed bankruptcy under chapter that year to facilitate settlement of those claims.we have already described those bankruptcy proceedings in prior opinions.see,in re dow corning,cir.here,we describe only the facts relevant to these consolidated appeals.
dow corning amended joint plan of reorganization the plan took effect in june.the plan establishes a billion by the settlement corning claimants who choose to settle rather than litigate their claims.each of the orders before us today involves a plan definition that affects payments made pursuant to the plan.
the first order concerns tissue expanders,which are devices implanted in the body and then gradually filled with saline solution in the weeks that follow.their purpose is to expand the patient skin around the device and upon accomplishing that purpose,they are typically if not always removed.dow corning has manufactured more than kinds of tissue expanders,three of which are specifically designed to be implanted in the breast.the question presented in the first appeal is whether those three types of tissue expanders are breast implants as defined by the plan.the district court held they were,thereby opening the door to settlement payments based on a claimant use of them.
the second order concerns the plan definition of total disability,which is set forth in a plan document that the parties call annex claimants who meet the plan definition of total disability receive larger settlement payments than they otherwise would under the plan.dow corning and the claimants advisory committee the committee disagree as to what this definition means dow corning takes a narrower view of the definition,the committee a broader one.the district court held that the broader view is the correct one.
dow corning appealed both orders.
the parties dispute the standard of review.at issue in each appeal is the district court interpretation of a definition set forth in the plan.we review for abuse of discretion a bankruptcy court interpretation of a plan that the court had confirmed.see dow corning,at.but these appeals involve a decision by a district court,not a bankruptcy one,so the dow corning standard does not apply by its terms here.dow corning would take us to the other extreme it argues that our review should be de novo,citing our rule that,i n a bankruptcy case on appeal from a district court,we owe no special deference to the district court decision.in re,cir.but that rule does not apply by its terms either,because the district court here did not sit merely as an appellate court.it decided the issues before us in the first instance.
so we look to the underpinnings for each standard.on the one hand,the district court was not interpret ing its own prior language or intent when it interpreted the plan,dow corning,at,so that particular rationale for deference is not present here.but other rationales are.the district court judge who entered the orders at denise page presided over this bankruptcy case continuously since.she was present on the bench for two days of the plan confirmation hearings.and she has adjudicated the case directly since,which is when she withdrew the reference to the bankruptcy court.the bankruptcy judge who had entered the confirmation order departed the bench that year.thus,judge hood has presided over this case for fifteen years,and acted as the court of first resort for nine.there is simply no denying that she is much more familiar with this with the parties expectations regarding we are.
so a measure of deference is in order.the question is how to characterize it.the district court orders involve interpretation of the plan and i n interpreting a confirmed plan,courts use contract principles.id.at.contractual interpretation is not discretionary,so it is awkward to say that we review the court interpretation for abuse of discretion.we need to convert the language of discretion to fit the task at hand.
a basic principle of contractual interpretation is that a term is deemed ambiguous when it is capable of more than one reasonable interpretation.id.internal quotation marks omitted.our court is reasonably to determine whether a plan provision is construe contracts all the in this case we should be mindful that our blind spots with respect to how one provision might interrelate with others are likely much larger than are the district court.on the whole,however,the determination whether a plan provision is ambiguous is not a point on which we substantially defer.
that point arrives,instead,when we determine that a provision is ambiguous.then,under the law of virtually any jurisdiction,we open the cleanroom of textual interpretation to whatever extrinsic evidence awaits outside.here,each party has amassed a formidable dump of such evidence and each side argues,in great detail,that its evidence shows that the other interpretation would confound everyone expectations as to what the plan was supposed to mean.this is where we start to defer in earnest.the district court in this case,like the bankruptcy courts in others,is equipped,not least in terms of background knowledge,to sort through that evidence and determine what is important.
thus,to summarize for purposes of plan interpretation,an ambiguous provision can reasonably be read more than one way.to determine which of the reasonable readings is best,the court normally may assess extrinsic evidence.that assessment is best left to the district court here.thus,if the court assessed extrinsic evidence in choosing among reasonable interpretations of the plan,we will not disturb its choice.that is the deference we afford the district court in these consolidated appeals.
the first order concerns the plan definition of breast implant.section of the plan provides 
breast implant means all silicone gel and breast implants with silicone elastomer envelopes manufactured and either sold or otherwise distributed by the debtor.
the issue before us is whether this definition encompasses tissue expanders that dow corning designed and manufactured specifically for implantation in the breast.the district court held,and dow corning does not dispute,that the three types of tissue expanders at issue here had silicone elastomer envelopes and were.the only element of the definition that is disputed,therefore,is whether the subject expanders were breast implants as that term is used in the definition.
a definition that contains the defined term within it is very likely to be ambiguous.so it is here.the term breast implant,as used in the definition of breast implant,amazingly,can reasonably be read to refer to any device specifically designed for implantation in the breast.that is how the district court read the term and that reading draws additional support from the definition use of the word all.
but there is another reading of the provision.dow corning essentially contends that breast implant is a term of art,whose meaning was generally understood in the medical community to include only devices designed for,of course,tissue expanders are not.and dow corning argues that breast implant should be given that technical meaning in.but that argument begs the question whether the words breast implant were used in a technical or more ordinary sense in this provision.we see nothing in the definition text that answers that question as a matter of logical necessity.and we are not at all convinced by dow corning structural arguments concerning the qualifying product identifiers in annex a and the definition of other products in of the plan.each of those arguments assumes that tissue expanders are not breast implants which is to say the arguments are entirely circular.
the choice between these different readings of,therefore,lies with the district court.even so,we can not now affirm the order before us in case.although we hold that is ambiguous,the district court apparently thought it was not.as a result,the court did not assess the parties extrinsic evidence with respect to the provision.and thus we have no such assessment to which we can defer.
had the district court been the court that entered the order confirming the plan,we would owe the court more deference than we owe it here,and would affirm the court decision notwithstanding that omission.see dow corning,at disagree ing with the bankruptcy court conclusion that the plan was unambiguous,but holding that the bankruptcy court did not incorrectly interpret its own prior language or intent.the court that enters an order has less need to consider extrinsic evidence of the order meaning than a court that does not.but the district court here did not enter the order confirming the plan.we therefore vacate the district court order with respect to tissue expanders and remand the case to allow it to assess the relevant extrinsic evidence.once it does so,we expect to defer to its decision.
the second order concerns the plan definition of total disability.the relevant portion of annex a provides 
death or total disability resulting from the compensable condition.an individual will be considered totally disabled if she demonstrates a functional capacity adequate to consistently perform none or only few of the usual duties or activities of vocation or.
the parties dispute the showing necessary to meet this definition.dow corning says the claimant must be disabled in both and.the committee says that a claimant need be disabled in only one.thus,in the committee view,a claimant inability to do more than a few activities in only one of the or enough to meet the definition of total disability,even if she can do many activities in the other.
the district court reasoning with respect to this provision was straightforward.simply put,the court held that the word or,as used in vocation or,was disjunctive,and that a showing of disability in either category was therefore enough to meet the definition.in doing so,the court deemed the provision unambiguous and look ed solely to the plain language used by the parties within the four corners of the contract.order at.
with respect,we read the provision differently.the word or is normally conjunctive when introduced by none or not.see,huddleston pullum,cambridge grammar of the english language when a subclausal falls within the scope of a negative,it is equivalent to an of negative clauses.to say that none of the teachers or students will be at the school on july,for example,does not mean that only one of those groups will be absent that day.it means that both groups will be.so it is here to say that a claimant can perform none or only a few of the activities of vocation or,means that she is disabled from performing both types of activities.in the district court defense to say that this provision is ultimately unambiguous,as we do here,is not to say that it is.dow corning reading of this provision is correct.
we vacate the order in case,reverse the order in case,and remand the cases for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
concurring in part and dissenting in part 
i concur with the majority opinion conclusion that the plan definition of total disability requires a showing of disability in both vocational and activities.in my opinion,that conclusion is required by the rules of english grammar,as recognized by the majority opinion,and by simple common sense.i write separately because i believe the majority opinion discussion confuses,rather than clarifies,the standard of review in cases such as these.i must also dissent from the majority opinion holding that the plan definition of breast implants is ambiguous and its conclusion that the definition is even susceptible to the district court interpretation.
standard of review 
the majority opinion searches for a new way to describe the standard of review in cases such as this.our prior case law establishing the standard of review is not a model of clarity,but the majority opinion efforts to convert the language of discretion to fit the task at hand,op.at,serves only to further muddy the waters.in my opinion,we should avoid crafting new standards of review when existing standards can be clarified therefore,we should simply restate what was once district court legal conclusions are reviewed de novo,and its factual findings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.in re terex,cir holding that a bankruptcy court legal conclusions regarding the bankruptcy code were subject to de novo review,but that interpretation of the terms of a bankruptcy plan were reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.
we apply contract principles when we interpret a confirmed bankruptcy plan,since the plan is effectively a new contract between the debtor and its creditors.in re dow corning,cir.state law governs those interpretations,and under contract law principles,if a plan term is unambiguous,it is to be enforced as written.id.a district court faced with the task of interpreting a confirmed bankruptcy plan,therefore,must engage in a process.first,the district court must determine whether the plan terms are ambiguous,a purely legal question under the state law of most states.if the district court finds the plan to be unambiguous,state contract law will typically require the district court to enforce the plan as written,without reference to extrinsic evidence.if,however,the district court finds the plan to be ambiguous,defined as being capable of more than one reasonable interpretation,then the meaning of the plan must be determined,a process which,in most states,requires consideration of the intent of the parties.in the first step,then,the district court engages in a purely legal inquiry,and begins its factual inquiry only in the event that it reaches the second step.
the majority opinion does not completely abandon de novo review of the district court legal conclusions in the first step,but the language it uses casts unnecessary doubt on the ability of this court to correctly resolve questions of law which are not dependent upon the facts of the case.op.at our court is reasonably to determine whether a plan provision is ambiguous though we should be mindful that our blind spots are likely much larger than are the district court whether a plan provision is ambiguous is not a point on which we substantially defer.emphasis added.in my opinion,this type of equivocation is unnecessary and inappropriate.instead,we should strongly affirm that we will review any legal conclusions de novo,as we have always done,without deference to the district court.
application of our previous standard of review to the second step seems equally uncontroversial.it is true that the district court,in cases where the meaning of the plan is ambiguous,will often be presented with mountains of extrinsic evidence.it is within the discretion of the district court to determine what evidence it will rely upon,and that choice by the district court will determine its ultimate conclusion as to the interpretation.when the case comes before us on appeal,we must determine whether the district court abused its discretion in arriving at its decision.in essence,we must affirm the district court unless we decide that the district court was unreasonable in its reliance on the evidence expressly or impliedly described in its opinion,or unless we decide that the district court was unreasonable in its rejection of other evidence that runs counter to its opinion.
the majority opinion paints this task as especially difficult and tr
