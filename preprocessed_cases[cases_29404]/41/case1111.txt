kimberly wysong wysong sued the dow chemical company dow after dow terminated her employment.wysong alleged that dow violated her rights under both the family and medical leave act,et.fmla,and ohio statute,ohio,and also that dow committed the state tort of wrongful discharge.the district court,wl,granted dow motion for summary judgment on all of wysong claims.because the district court erred in its reasoning when it granted summary judgment to dow on wysong fmla claim,state claim,and claim,we reverse the district court judgment on these claims and remand to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
background 
wysong worked at dow hanging rock facility as an operating technician.joint appendix at wysong dep.at.her position involved placing raw material into a laminating machine.at wysong dep.at.the raw material came into wysong work area on pallets from the warehouse,and a fork truck sometimes operated by wysong was used to load the laminating machine.id.the machine had moving parts,and the operator could sustain serious injury if all safety precautions were not followed.at wysong dep.at.
in,wysong took hours of paid medical leave,and in,she took hours of such leave.at wysong dep.at.the leave taken during this period was for various reasons chronic neck and groin pain,a hernia operation,mononucleosis,a hysterectomy,and caring for an ill child.at,wysong dep.at miller dep.at.wysong always received her full pay during these leaves.at wysong dep.at.
on february,production leader dwight miller miller issued wysong a letter of concern stating that she had exhausted all of her paid medical leave and that if she required additional leave before accruing further leave time,she would have to use her vacation time or take leave without pay.at,wysong dep.at ltr.of concern.wysong was required to notify miller and to obtain his approval prior to any further absences,including planned medical procedures.at,miller dep.at wysong dep.at ltr.of concern.on february,miller issued wysong a last chance letter stating that wysong had reported to work late without prior notification,and that dow would terminate wysong for any further performance failure.at last chance ltr.there were no further conflicts between the parties until may.
although it is unclear how the conversation started,on may,wysong conveyed that her neck had been bothering her to dow plant nurse,janet jones jones.at miller dep.at.wysong did not request any time off work in conjunction with this incident.at miller dep.at.jones reported wysong complaint to environmental health and safety director,troy dehoff dehoff.dehoff in turn notified miller,who contacted teter,dow regional medical director.at miller dep.at.
after speaking with miller,teter placed wysong on work restrictions she was not to lift,push,pull,or tug anything over five pounds.at miller dep.at.according to teter,the restrictions were issued out of his concern that wysong was currently having neck trouble,and that she had missed a lot of work in the past that may have been due to a previous neck problem.at teter dep.at.miller determined that he could not assign wysong to a job comporting with the work restrictions imposed by teter,and miller called wysong to tell her not to come into work.at miller dep.at.
in a letter dated may,miller informed wysong that her request for fmla leave was approved,and that because she had previously exhausted most of her fmla leave for that leave year,she was eligible for only three more days of fmla leave.at ltr.re certification of med.leave.wysong brought the letter back to human resources partner tom hutson hutson explaining that she had not requested any leave.at hutson dep.at.hutson reissued the letter,removing the language about her request,but retaining the fact that dow had put her on fmla leave.id.
dow medical review board met to discuss wysong case.the medical review board concluded and wysong was informed that she would need to pass a functional capacity exam fce as a condition of returning to work.at,hutson dep.at miller dep.at.an fce is used to determine whether an employee is physically capable of performing a specific set of job duties.it consists of a series of tests,conducted by a physical or occupational therapist,and is intended to duplicate actions that the employee would perform at work.at teter dep.at.
on may,wysong signed release forms authorizing dow to obtain medical information from her treating physicians and providers.at signed authorization for info.forms.after reviewing wysong medical records obtained as a result of the medical releases signed by wysong,teter found a comment by one of wysong treating physicians that wysong was possibly exhibiting behavior.at,teter dep.at,wysong dep.at.teter took this to mean that wysong was drug dependen t.at,teter dep.at.
without consulting with any of wysong treating physicians,teter decided that wysong could not take the fce unless she stopped taking all pain medication for two weeks.at teter dep.at.in addition to being concerned about the safety risks associated with her taking narcotic drugs while working with the laminating machine and the fork truck,teter believed that if wysong took the fce while taking these narcotics,the result of the test would be invalid.at,teter dep.at.wysong maintains that she refused to stop taking her pain medication for two weeks on the advice of one of her physicians.at wysong dep.at.
because wysong did not stop taking her pain medication,dow refused to give her the fce.at ltr.re extension of med.leave.on june,dow placed wysong on unpaid leave,effective july,pending a release to work without restrictions from both her physician and from dow medical department.id.wysong did not obtain any work releases,and on december,dow terminated wysong,basing the decision on its policy of terminating employees who are on a medical leave of absence status for a continuous period of six months.at,wysong dep.at termination notification ltr.
wysong sued dow in the district court alleging that dow conduct violated both the fmla and ohio statute,and also constituted wrongful discharge.the district court granted dow summary judgment on all of wysong claims.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.ercegovich goodyear tire rubber,cir.the district court grant of summary judgment to dow was proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that dow is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.the district court must construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of wysong,the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the crux of the inquiry is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
fmla claim interference 
the fmla entitles qualifying employees to take up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave,without fear of termination,when the leave is taken for,inter alia,a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.a d,a.a serious health condition is an illness,injury,impairment,or physical or mental condition that involves a inpatient care in a hospital,hospice,or residential medical care facility or b continuing treatment by a health care provider.there are two recovery theories available under the fmla the interference theory,pursuant to a,and the retaliation theory,pursuant to a.edgar jac,cir.
the district court found that wysong complaint stated only a retaliation claim under the fmla,and refused to consider her fmla claim under the interference theory.at op.at.in its decision granting summary judgment for dow,the district court determined that wysong did not make her prima facie case for retaliation.on appeal,wysong argues that the district court erred in failing to analyze her fmla claim under the interference theory.
under our system of notice pleading a complaint need only provide the defendant with fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.erickson pardus,d second alteration in original quoting bell atlantic twombly,d.see also.rule a requiring only a short and plain statement of the claim at the complaint stage.
the district court rejection of wysong argument evidences an overly rigid approach which stands in conflict with our system.a defendant looking at wysong complaint would be on sufficient notice that she was broadly alleging violations under,and that her fmla claim could encompass either the interference theory,the retaliation theory,or both theories.at compl.at.contrary to the district court characterization,wysong has never alleged a new claim since filing her complaint.the claim has always been the same one that dow actions violated the fmla.although we analyze an fmla claim based on the interference theory differently from one based on the retaliation theory,notice pleading does not box plaintiffs into one theory or the other at the complaint stage of an fmla action.thus,wysong did not forfeit the opportunity to present her fmla claim under the interference theory.
wysong claim that she was terminated for taking fmla leave is cognizable under the a interference theory.chandler specialty tires of am,cir e mployers are prohibited from interfering,restraining,or denying the exercise of or attempted exercise of any fmla right.a.this prohibition includes retaliatory discharge for taking leave.see skrjanc great lakes power serv,cir we now turn to the applicable statutory provisions and analyze wysong claim under the interference theory.
the fmla prohibits qualifying employers from interfer ing with,restrain ing,or deny ing the exercise of or the attempt to exercise,any right provided under th e fmla.a.to prevail under the interference theory,the employee must establish the following 
he is an e ligible employee,the defendant is an e mployer,the employee was entitled to leave under the fmla,a the employee gave the employer notice of his intention to take leave,e and the employer denied the employee fmla benefits to which he was entitled.
cavin honda of am,cir.the employee must establish these elements by a preponderance of the evidence.sorrell rinker materials,cir.the parties agree that wysong meets the first four elements of her case.the question of whether dow denied her fmla benefits to which she was entitled the fifth element is more complicated.
quoting a case from the district court for the southern district of ohio,wysong argues that the fifth element of an claim is that the employer somehow used the leave against her and in an unlawful manner,as provided in either the statute or regulations.bradley mary rutan,d.although this language is different from the language used in cavin,it does not conflict with cavin,and,in fact,adds depth to the fifth element articulated in cavin.under c employers can not use the taking of fmla leave as a negative factor in employment actions,such as hiring,promotions or disciplinary actions.we have earlier held that this analysis is applicable in analyzing an interference claim.see brenneman medcentral health,cir pharakhone nissan,cir.if an employer takes an employment action based,in whole or in part,on the fact that the employee took leave,the employer has denied the employee a benefit to which he is entitled.we,therefore,have no objection to rephrasing the fifth element of an interference claim as being that the employer has somehow used the leave against her and in an unlawful manner,as provided in either the statute or regulations.bradley,d at.
wysong theory is that she was eventually terminated because of her taking fmla leave in.wysong asserts that teter wrote the work restrictions,in part,as a result of his knowledge that she had taken significant leave time in the past.the work restrictions prevented her from working,and she states that she could not comply with dow mandate that she go off all pain medications for two weeks before taking the fce.because she was not reporting to work,dow terminated her.according to wysong,this chain of events indicates that dow used her fmla leave time as a negative factor in its decision to terminate her.wysong br.at.
dow acknowledges that teter considered wysong previous absences when he issued the work restrictions and required wysong to take the fce without pain medications,but argues that he could consider her previous absences,because teter did not write the restrictions solely on the basis of her missing work in.dow br.at.this argument stands in direct conflict with the rule that employers can not use the taking of fmla leave as a negative factor in employment actions.c emphasis supplied.see also cavin,at a termination based only in part on an absence covered by the fmla,even in combination with other absences,may still violate the fmla.internal quotation marks omitted.
dow also argues that n othing in the fmla,its regulations,or the case law states that fmla leave can never be considered by an employer for any purpose,or that it can not be taken into consideration by medical personnel in making medical decisions.dow br.at.further,dow asserts that i t would be illogical to presume that the fmla makes it unlawful for a company physician to consider that a medical condition required an employee to miss work in determining what steps need to be taken to protect that employee from injury.id.at.
these arguments suffer from the same malady they are based on the false premise that teter knew that wysong missed work in based on a neck condition.teter had no idea why wysong missed work in.at teter dep.at.in fact,wysong absences were unrelated to her neck condition.at,wysong dep.at miller dep.at.dow can not prevail on the argument that teter was permitted to consider leave time in issuing severe work restrictions,because he had no knowledge as to why the earlier leave was taken.accordingly,dow arguments are without merit.
we finally turn to the question of causation.the facts in this case are unique in that there are intervening events between the leave wysong took in and her termination in.teter considered her fmla taken for reasons unrelated to her neck condition when writing the work restrictions.miller determined that wysong could not perform a job meeting those restrictions and so told wysong to stay home.wysong was not permitted to return until she took the fce which wysong alleges she could not take based on the conditions imposed by dow.as a result,wysong could not return to work,which led to her termination.we agree with wysong that the initial issuance of the severe restrictions set in motion an unbroken chain of events culminating in her termination.on these facts,we conclude that wysong has met the fifth element of her interference claim.
fmla involuntary leave 
wysong also made a claim under an theory,alleging that dow violated her fmla rights by forcing her to take her last three days of fmla leave when she did not need to do so.wysong argues that dow forced her to take fmla leave after she complained of neck pain in may.the district court rejected wysong argument,stating that c ase law is clear that dow could place wysong on fmla leave,so long as wysong neck condition constituted a serious health condition.at op.at.finding that wysong did have a serious health condition,the district court granted summary judgment to dow on this argument as well although we ultimately agree with the district court rejection of wysong argument,we do so for different reasons.
an claim is really a type of interference claim.an employee may have a claim under a when an employer forces an employee to take fmla leave when the employee does not have a serious health condition that precludes her from working.see hicks leroy jewelers,wl,at cir.july,unpublished,cert.denied,d megan blomquist,a shield,not a sword involuntary leave under the family and medical leave act.however,the employee claim ripens only when and if the employee seeks fmla leave at a later date,and such leave is not available because the employee was wrongfully forced to use fmla leave in the past.see edgar,at setting forth the elements of an interference claim.
our decision in hicks provides an excellent example as to when one might have a ripe,claim.in hicks,the plaintiff was pregnant and informed her employer that she wanted to take twelve weeks of fmla leave after the baby was born so that she could care for the infant.hicks,wl,at.a month before the baby was born,the plaintiff developed a kidney infection,causing her to miss work and spend one night in the hospital.she informed her employer that she would return to work the next day,but her employer instead forced her to take fmla leave and would not allow her to return to work before the baby birth.as a result of the involuntary leave,the plaintiff was unable to take the full twelve weeks of fmla leave when the baby was born.
in a case such as hicks,a plaintiff has a ripe a employee may argue that she was later prevented from taking fmla leave time to care for her child,because the employer had earlier forced her to take fmla leave when she was suffering from a kidney infection.in order to recover,a plaintiff such as the one in hicks would have to show that she was not suffering from a serious health condition that precluded her from working during the time for which the employer forced her to take fmla leave,and thus,the employer was not entitled to require her to take the leave 
although we recognize that an employer who forces an employee to take leave may create a claim under the fmla,wysong does not have a viable claim under this theory.wysong alleged that she was forced to take leave even though she did not have a serious health condition that precluded her from working.but this,in itself,does not create a ripe,claim.wysong would have had to allege also that she later requested fmla leave,but that dow refused,based on the fact that she had already used up her available fmla leave.wysong did not allege these facts,and thus,as a matter of law,she can not prevail on her fmla claim based on this theory.
wysong does not have a viable fmla claim under the theory pursuant to a,because she can not show that she was denied fmla leave to which she was entitled as a result of dow forcing her to take earlier leave when she did not have a serious health condition that precluded her from working.
ohio claim 
statutory regulatory framework 
wysong also claimed that dow actions violated ohio statute prohibiting discrimination based on disability.ohio law prohibits any employer,because of the disability of any person,to discharge without just cause,to refuse to hire,or otherwise to discriminate against that person with respect to hire,tenure,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,or any matter directly or indirectly related to employment.ohio.disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities,including the functions of caring for one self,performing manual tasks,walking,seeing,hearing,speaking,breathing,learning,and working a record of a physical or mental impairment or being regarded as having a physical or mental impairment.ohio a.
because t he federal americans with disabilities act ada is similar to the ohio handicap discrimination law,w e can look to regulations and cases interpreting the federal act for guidance in our interpretation of ohio law.city of columbus civil serv.comm mcglone,ohio.regulations issued to provide interpretive guidance for terms found in the ada define substantially limits to mean a person is 
i unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform or ii significantly restricted as to the condition,manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition,manner,or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.
j.major life activities are defined as functions such as caring for oneself,performing manual tasks,walking,seeing,hearing,speaking,breathing,learning,and working.i.however,an eeoc interpretive guideline states that this list is not meant to be exclusive,and added lifting as one example of another major life activity,app.i 
where the major life activity in issue is working,the definition for substantially limits changes to 
significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training,skills and abilities.the inability to perform a single,particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.
prima facie case 
to make a prima facie case of disability discrimination under ohio law,an employee must show that he or she was handicapped,that an adverse employment action was taken by an employer,at least in part,because the individual was handicapped,and that the person,though handicapped,can safely and substantially perform the essential functions of the job in question.hood diamond,ohio.
an employee may satisfy the first requirement of her prima facie case by showing that,although she was not disabled,she was regarded as having a physical or mental impairment.ohio a sutton united air lines,d.a n individual may fall into the definition of one regarded as having a disability if an employer ascribes to that individual an inability to perform the functions of a job because of a medical condition when,in fact,the individual is perfectly able to meet the job duties.ross campbell soup,cir.the supreme court has explained 
there are two apparent ways in which individuals may fall within this statutory definition a covered entity mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities,or a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual,nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities.in both cases,it is necessary that a covered entity entertain misperceptions about the must believe either that one has a substantially limiting impairment that one does not have or that one has a substantially limiting impairment when,in fact,the impairment is not so limiting.
sutton,at.it is undisputed that dow regarded wysong as having a chronic neck condition and drug dependency.thus,the critical inquiry is whether dow mistakenly regarded those impairments as substantially limiting a major life activity.
the district court granted summary judgment to dow because it determined that wysong did not meet the first prong of her prima facie case,that is,she did not demonstrate that dow regarded her as disabled.at op.at.before examining each health condition,we initially note that u nder the regarded as prong of the ada,membership in the protected class becomes a question of intent and that,the employer one rarely susceptible to resolution at the summary judgment stage.ross,at internal quotation marks omitted.the case at bar is no exception.
neck condition 
the major life activity in issue with respect to wysong neck condition is lifting see ross,at t he standard mandates that the defendant must have regarded the plaintiff as significantly limited in his ability to lift.thus,the question is whether wysong put forth evidence demonstrating that dow regarded her as u nable to lift or regarded her as s ignificantly restricted as to the condition,manner or duration under which she could lift as compared to the condition,manner,or duration under which the average person in the general population can lift.j.
the key evidence put forth were the work restrictions imposed by teter forbidding wysong from lifting,pushing,pulling,or tugging more than five pounds.at miller dep.at.the district court rested its decision to grant summary judgment on two bases.first,the district court noted that teter stated that he imposed the restrictions to prevent her from injuring herself,and he never determined that wysong required permanent restrictions.at op.at.but this reasoning fails because a reasonable jury could infer,based on the severity of the restrictions imposed,that teter regarded wysong as substantially limited in her ability to lift.
second,the district court found that wysong has failed to introduce any evidence that dow ever considered whether she was able to lift more than five pounds in her daily life outside of work.in fact,teter restrictions were for work only.id.citation omitted.of course the restrictions were for work only teter,as a dow employee,had no authority to restrict wysong movement outside of the workplace.but a jury could make the obvious inference that,based on the work restrictions,teter believed wysong could not safely lift five pounds outside of work.because the work restrictions could lead a reasonable jury to determine that dow regarded wysong as disabled,the district court erred in finding that wysong did not meet the first prong of her prima facie case with respect to her neck condition.
drug dependence 
the major life activity in issue with respect to wysong claim is working.thus,the question here is whether dow regarded wysong drug dependence as significantly restrict ing her ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training,skills and abilities.j i.the district court found that wysong failed to make her prima facie case because n o where does teter state that he considered wysong unable to perform a broad class of jobs because of her drug dependency.at op.at.but such specific evidence is not required to make a prima facie showing of disability.
in henderson ardco,cir,we reversed a grant of summary judgment for the defendant where the plaintiff brought forward evidence that the defendant perceived there was no job for the employee at the plant.id.this evidence g ave an indication of the employer perception about her suitability for a class of relevantly similar employment.id.see also moorer baptist mem l health care,cir relying on henderson in concluding that evidence that the employer perceived the plaintiff as unable to work in any relevant position at the defendants place of business constituted competent evidence of the employer perception about the plaintiff ability to perform the same broad class of work anywhere else.
in the case at bar,wysong has presented evidence that she was not permitted back to work at dow until she was completely off all pain medications.wysong received a letter from dow stating that,due to her condition of drug dependency,she was unable to return to work pending a release to work without restrictions from her physician and the dow medical department.at ltr.re extension of med.leave see also at hutson dep.at.the letter sent by dow,stating that she was unfit to return to work because of her condition,is the type of evidence that gives an indication of the employer perception about her suitability for a class of relevantly similar employment.moorer,at.further,dow did not offer wysong any other position within the hanging rock facility.a reasonable fact finder could conclude that,under the facts presented,dow perceived wysong as being unable to work anywhere at the plant,and thus,unable to perform the same broad class of work anywhere else.because there was sufficient evidence put forth by wysong that could lead a reasonable fact finder to conclude that dow regarded her as disabled,we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to dow with respect to wysong disability claim based on drug dependency.
wysong also brought a state claim,averring that dow wrongfully discharged her by unlawfully requiring her to sign a blanket release of her medical records and then using the information obtained therefrom to terminate her employment.wysong based this claim on a provision of the federal ada which states 
a covered entity shall not require a medical examination and shall not make inquiries of an employee as to whether such employee is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of the disability,unless such examination or inquiry is shown to be and consistent with business necessity.
the district court granted summary judgment to dow on the rationale that wysong claim was actually based on ohio revised code et,and that because her claim under the state disability statute failed,the underlying claim must also fail.at op.at citing godfredson hess clark,cir.
ohio disability discrimination law has no mirror statute or regulation that covers the same area as d a,no law covering unlawfully broad medical examinations or requests for information.therefore,the district court erred in concluding that wysong claim was subsumed by ohio revised code et.accordingly,we remand this claim to the district court.in so doing,we express no opinion on the merits of the claim.
iii.conclusion 
because the district court erred in its reasoning when it granted summary judgment to dow on wysong fmla claim,state claim,and claim,we reverse the district court judgment on these claims and remand to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
for the most part,i concur in the and majority opinion.however,i find i must respectfully dissent from one aspect of the decision,that is the portion of the majority opinion labeled where the issue of wysong disability claim is discussed.my dissent is driven by my understanding of the supreme court decision in toyota motor manufacturing,kentucky,williams.i understand the import of that decision differently than does the majority.
in all other aspects of the majority opinion,i join in the opinion.wysong,through no fault of her own,found herself in a position where she was not allowed to continue her employment with dow while also meeting her medical needs.dow actions in this regard were not reasonable.it is unfortunate dow,once it learned the complete facts,did not reinstate wysong.
where i part company with the majority opinion is where the opinion concludes wysong had made out a prima facie case demonstrating dow regarded her as being disabled in the major life activity of lifting due to her chronic neck condition.
on this issue i would affirm the district court.what the record shows is that dow company doctor restricted wysong ability to lift more than five pounds.based upon this restriction,dow concluded wysong could not perform any work at dow so she was told to not report to work.although there is no evidence in the record dow gave any thought as to how this inability to lift more than five pounds would affect wysong in her daily life outside of work,it is reasonable,as the majority does,to infer that dow considered wysong unable to lift more than five pounds in her life outside of work.i agree with the majority that such an inference is permissible.
in my opinion,however,even given that inference,the question remains whether wysong has demonstrated what the supreme court has indicated she must.the majority correctly states the test for a regarded as disabled case,the court must look to the state of mind of the employer against whom the plaintiff makes a claim.ross campbell soup,cir.in toyota motor manufacturing,kentucky,williams,the supreme court emphasized,in addressing major life activities other than the ability to work,the central inquiry must be whether the claimant is unable to perform the variety of tasks central to most people daily lives,not whether the claimant is unable to perform the tasks associated with her specific job,d.i believe this same logic must be applied to a regarded as disabled case.accordingly,this court must consider whether,with this lifting restriction,dow regarded wysong as substantially limited in her daily life.
the district court relied on dunaway ford motor.cir,in granting summary judgment on wysong regarded as claim.in dunaway,an unpublished decision,the plaintiff claimed his prospective employer believed he was disabled substantially limited in the major life activities of standing,climbing,squatting,kneeling,and lifting more than pounds and so refused to hire him.id.at.the plaintiff offered evidence that the defendant company doctor restricted his ability to lift.id.the plaintiff also submitted testimony from the hiring decisionmaker,which purportedly demonstrated the belief the plaintiff was disabled.the decisi
