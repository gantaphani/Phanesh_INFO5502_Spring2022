plaintiff mark brown appeals the district court dismissal of his complaint against medtronic,several of its directors,a retirement plan committee,and various fiduciaries.brown alleges claims pursuant to the employee retirement and income security act of erisa and seeks to serve as the representative plaintiff.his claims relate to purported breaches of fiduciary duties associated with information disclosures or surrounding two medtronic products bone graft material infuse and sprint lead wires for implantable defribillators and pacemakers fidelis.brown alleges generally that medtronic stock became an imprudent investment after the defendants obtained certain adverse information regarding performance of fidelis and business practices surrounding infuse.he alleges specifically that the defendants breached fiduciary duties by failing to adequately disclose the information,making a disclosure that deceptively downplayed the information,and imprudently continuing to invest in medtronic stock after receipt of the adverse information.
the district court held brown lacked constitutional standing.we affirm the judgment of the district court,albeit on slightly different grounds.we hold brown lacks constitutional standing to bring claims,possesses standing to bring claims,but,ultimately,fails to state a claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.
background 
medtronic manufactures and markets a broad assortment of medical devices through several different business units.infuse and fidelis are two of medtronic many products.regarding infuse,brown alleges medtronic promoted infuse for uses not approved by the fda and improperly paid reviewing physicians for favorable reviews.brown alleges information regarding these actions came to light through a september,wall street journal article.he alleges medtronic stock price dropped following publication of the article because the price had been artificially inflated due to the previously undisclosed actions.he also alleges the present defendants breached their fiduciary duties at an earlier time by participating in,or turning a blind eye towards,these activities and continuing to invest in medtronic stock.although he alleges defendants knew of the alleged actions prior to publication of the wall street journal article,he does not allege that any issues surrounding infuse caused medtronic stock price to drop prior to september.
regarding fidelis,brown alleges that the defendants failed to respond properly to a february report from a physician,hauser,who observed an approximate failure rate in fidelis leads among approximately patients.hauser reported his concerns to medtronic personnel,including a vice president,in february.hauser then published his concerns in a medical journal in march.in april,medtronic issued a dear doctor letter relaying hauser concerns and discussing medtronic investigation into the concerns.in the letter,medtronic suggested physician error in implantation might be partially responsible for some failures and suggested techniques to minimize failures.medtronic subsequently collected data from approximately patients.in october,medtronic stopped marketing fidelis,issued a recall of devices,and instructed physicians to cease new uses of fidelis.
medtronic stock price had climbed to about per share prior to the october fidelis recall and dropped by shortly after the recall to around per share.brown alleges medtronic failed to react appropriately to hauser february report and attempted to cover up a product defect by issuing the dear doctor letter suggesting physician error was partially to blame.he also alleges it was imprudent to wait until october to recall fidelis.
brown does not allege company stock was an imprudent investment prior to february.also,he admits that some degree of drop likely would have occurred even if medtronic had immediately made a public disclosure of hauser report or immediately taken more dramatic corrective action.brown counsel made clear in arguments to the district court,however,that brown alleges more than merely a stock price drop due to decreased earning expectations associated with the negative fidelis information.brown alleges that the broader market perceived medtronic eventual response as delayed and as a and that the market essentially punished medtronic by devaluing its stock through the application of a liar discount.accordingly,brown alleges the stock price drop that occurred in october was due in part to the adverse product data and recall but also in part to this alleged liar discount or general loss of faith in medtronic veracity and goodwill.
medtronic stock price,like the broader market,subsequently fluctuated in ensuing months.in fall,like the broader market,medtronic stock temporarily dropped in value by about.
medtronic employed brown from through may.during this time brown participated in an employee stock ownership plan esop.on february,the date brown proposes as the beginning of the class period,brown held approximately units of a plan fund that invested almost exclusively in medtronic common stock the closing price on february,was slightly over.after february,and until his separation from medtronic in spring,brown continued to purchase shares,acquiring additional shares.he alleges that the average price he paid for these additional shares was slightly less than per share.brown does not indicate the exact dates of his purchases,and therefore,it is not clear how many shares he purchased before and after the various events he alleges to be material to his claims.brown liquidated his shares in transactions in may and june.he sold the majority of his shares for slightly less than per share and a small minority of his shares for about per share.
brown brings five claims.claims and allege breaches of fiduciary duties through imprudent esop investment in medtronic stock.claim alleges breaches of fiduciary duties through material misrepresentations and nondisclosures.claims and are derivative of the other claims with claim alleging divided loyalties by fiduciaries and claim alleging corporate fiduciaries failed to properly appoint,monitor,and inform members of the retirement plan committee the district court looked at the dates of changes and the dates of brown purchases and sales of shares and determined that brown was a net beneficiary of any artificial price inflation caused by the defendants actions or failures to act.accordingly,the district court held brown lacked standing because he suffered no constitutionally cognizable injury fairly traceable to any of the defendants alleged breaches of duty.in so holding,the district court appears to have focused on the overall share price drop that occurred in fall.brown appeals.
ii.discussion 
general requirements 
th e irreducible constitutional minimum of standing requires a showing of injury in fact to the plaintiff that is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.braden stores,cir internal quotations and alteration omitted.federal courts must address questions of standing before addressing the merits of a case where standing is called into question.steel citizens for a better.here,the parties disagree as to the analytical framework that should apply to determine the presence of an injury.our court has not addressed this question in the context of the present types of erisa claims.although we do not suggest there is only one means by which a defendant might demonstrate an injury in this context,we agree with the district court that,at a minimum,a plaintiff must allege a net loss in investment value that is fairly traceable to the defendants challenged actions.for the purpose of our analysis,we interpret brown claims as alleging two distinct injuries injuries and infuserelated injuries 
the district court applied a net loss theory of injury as described in in re boston scientific.erisa litigation.boston scientific,in turn,applied an analysis from dura pharmaceuticals,broudo.boston scientific teaches that,where an erisa plan participant complains of a breach of fiduciary duty in the form of actions that artificially inflated share price,the participant has suffered no cognizable injury if the participant sold shares at an inflated price and,therefore,was a net beneficiary of the inflated share price.boston scientific,at.the supreme court in dura set forth this same concept when analyzing causation in the context of a case,finding no loss where a party sold shares at an allegedly artificially inflated price.dura,at.
the court in dura did not face a question of erisa fiduciary duties.regardless,the court pronounced a rule that it described as pure logic.dura,at.presumably any such rule founded on basic concepts of loss and injury and characterized as pure logic should find broad application in erisa,securities law,and other contexts where plaintiffs describe their injuries in terms of stock price changes.brown argues against the application of boston scientific and dura,pointing to what he characterizes as losses and arguing simply that,because he sold stock for less than it was worth at the start of the proposed class period,he has suffered a sufficient injury to create standing.the court in dura rejected this simplistic view,stating 
for one thing,as a matter of pure logic,at the moment the transaction takes place,the plaintiff has suffered no loss the inflated purchase payment is offset by ownership of a share that at that instant possesses equivalent value.moreover,the logical link between the inflated share purchase price and any later economic loss is not invariably strong.shares are normally purchased with an eye toward a later sale.but if,say,the purchaser sells the shares quickly before the relevant truth begins to leak out,the misrepresentation will not have led to any loss.if the purchaser sells later after the truth makes its way into the marketplace,an initially inflated purchase price might mean a later loss.but that is far from inevitably so.when the purchaser subsequently resells such shares,even at a lower price,that lower price may reflect,not the earlier misrepresentation,but changed economic circumstances,changed investor expectations,new or facts,conditions,or other events,which taken separately or together account for some or all of that lower price.the same is true in respect to a claim that a share higher price is lower than it would otherwise have claim we do not consider here.other things being equal,the longer the time between purchase and sale,the more likely that this is so,the more likely that other factors caused the loss.
id.at.the district court and the court in boston scientific applied this logic and determined that it is necessary for a plaintiff to identify more than merely a stock price drop throughout a proposed class period to articulate an injury for the purpose of establishing standing.
in fact,brown does not present meaningful arguments to refute the statement of pure logic from dura.instead,brown cites a district court case that rejected boston scientific and criticized boston scientific for conflat ing the threshold standing inquiry with a determination of the merits of the plaintiff claim at the motion to dismiss stage.almonor bankatlantic bancorp,slip op.at.july,provided as an addendum in the appellant brief.the court in almonor held that financial damages were not a component of the standing inquiry in an erisa breach of fiduciary duty case and that the abstract violation of a fiduciary duty in and of itself was injury sufficient to confer standing.id.at.
we agree with almonor only in part.we agree that is important not to conflate the injury and traceability requirements of a standing analysis with the plaintiff ultimate burden of proof as to the issues of damages and causation at a trial on the merits.see braden,at in most cases a plaintiff standing tracks his cause of action.that is,the question whether he has a cognizable injury sufficient to confer standing is closely bound up with the question of whether and how the law will grant him relief.it is crucial,however,not to conflate article iii requirement of injury in fact with a plaintiff potential causes of action,for the concepts are not coextensive.internal citations omitted.
we do not,however,agree that in the present context a purported abstract violation of a fiduciary duty is sufficient to create standing for all persons to whom the duty is owed.such a position fails to account for the third requirement of standing redressability.see lujan defenders of wildlife.neither the court in almonor nor brown in his arguments discuss how an erisa fiduciary breach could be redressed by our court in the event the breach actually conferred a financial benefit on a plan participant who has already liquidated his shares and has no ongoing financial stake in the plan or the company.we have rejected such abstract injury theories in the context of different types of erisa claims.see,schulz windstream commc ns,cir the amendment did not alter the pension benefits owed to appellants.therefore,even if this court invalidated the amendment,these appellants would still receive benefits they have no standing to challenge how it was adopted because how it was adopted does not affect them.mccullough aegon usa,cir finding a lack of standing to assert an erisa claim where,although there may have been an abstract breach of duty,the plan at issue in the case was at all relevant times substantially overfunded.in essence,if applied in the present circumstances as urged by brown,almonor would eliminate the redressabilty requirement or,at a minimum,decouple the concepts of injury and redressability.as already noted,we share almonor generalized concern that limited inquiries for analyzing standing not be confused with a requirement for full proof of causation or a detailed assessment of damages.still,there must exist some measure of redressability as related to the alleged injury to prevent a federal court opinion from being purely advisory.
brown further argues against the loss theory of boston scientific and dura by offering two alternative theories.as already noted,he proposes a theory that would look only at losses without reference to the timing of information disclosures.he also argues he may establish an actionable injury based on the foregone earnings from some alternative,investment.
in brown loss theory,he asserts merely that,when he sold his plan units,they were worth less per unit than they were at the beginning of the proposed class period.according to brown,this alone is sufficient to establish standing.such a theory,however,could only establish a constitutional injury if a reviewing court also required a colorable claim of causation to establish that any such alleged loss be fairly traceable to the challenged action.braden,at.brown articulation of an loss theory omits this element of standing and amounts to little more than a request for the court to focus solely on the alleged loss without reference to its cause.
such a theory of loss ignores the practical reality of the market.investors or participants who sell before allegedly concealed,adverse information impacts price may ultimately earn or lose money on their transaction.if their sale price captures the alleged artificial price inflation if it does not reflect the discount alleged to be caused by the disclosure of previously concealed information,the participant losses can not be viewed as fairly traceable to the allegedly wrongful concealment.such investors may,of course,have some losses,but,as the court noted in dura,gains or losses on particular sales could be caused by endless different market factors.at.we therefore reject brown proposed theory as failing to account for all three requirements for standing.
the other of his two arguments,the theory,is essentially an argument without a component.brown cites donovan bierwirth,cir,for the purported proposition that if,in hindsight,a different investment alternative would have generated better returns,the existence of this foregone higher return is in and of itself sufficient injury to grant standing.this appears to be a misreading of donovan.the court in donovan did not address a question of standing.rather,it addressed a question of damages and looked at harm to t
