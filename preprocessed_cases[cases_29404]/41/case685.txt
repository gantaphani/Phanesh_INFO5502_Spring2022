in late,plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the north carolina woman right to know act,the act,a statute that requires certain informed consent procedures prior to the performance of an abortion.to.although the north carolina attorney general actively sought to defend the statute,appellants a group of medical professionals,women who have previously undergone abortions,and pregnancy counseling centers filed a motion to intervene as defendants in the suit.the district court denied their motion.because the court did not abuse its discretion in doing so,we affirm.
the north carolina general assembly enacted the woman right to know act in july.the act requires that a physician who is to perform an abortion,or a qualified technician must provide the pregnant woman with a ultrasound display of the fetus and a simultaneous explanation of what the display is depicting.a.in addition to these display and explanation requirements,the act contains certain other informed consent provisions and authorizes civil remedies against persons who violate the law.id.
plaintiffs are a group of physicians and medical centers that provide abortion services.on september,they filed a complaint in the united states district court for the middle district of north carolina seeking a declaration that the act violates the first and fourteenth amendment rights of physicians and their patients,along with an injunction preventing enforcement of the act.plaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.the merits of plaintiffs claims are not at issue in this appeal,but the procedural history of the lawsuit is relevant to our evaluation of the district court denial of appellants motion to intervene.
on october,the defendants in the underlying suit a number of state officials represented by the north carolina attorney general filed their opposition to the motion for a preliminary injunction.the district court held a hearing on the motion five days later,which lasted nearly three hours.during that hearing,the attorney general through a special deputy pressed numerous arguments for upholding the act under planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania casey,d,which upheld an abortion informed consent statute against a similar challenge.in particular,the attorney general argued that the act should be upheld because casey recognizes the state profound interest in potential life its permissible purpose of informing women considering an abortion of the procedure potential consequences for their future psychological and emotional health and its ability to require the communication of truthful and information to patients.the attorney general did not introduce factual evidence in support of the act,choosing instead to rely on the above legal arguments from casey.
the district court ruled on the motion on october,issuing a preliminary injunction against the act display and explanation requirements,but denying the motion with respect to the remainder of the act.stuart huff,d.those unaffected portions of the act went into effect the next day.deciding to litigate the case to final judgment rather than appeal the preliminary injunction,the attorney general filed an answer and moved to dismiss the complaint two weeks later.
appellants in this matter are a group of doctors,former abortion patients,and pregnancy counseling centers.on november,they filed a motion to intervene as defendants in the case,the subject of this appeal.appellants sought to intervene as a matter of right pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,and,alternatively,as a permissive matter pursuant to rule b.
the district court denied the motion on both grounds.with regard to intervention as of right,the court focused on the requirement under rule a that the proposed intervenors must demonstrate that their interests are not being adequately represented by the existing d efendants.the court noted two presumptions that cut against the appellants on this point.first,the court explained that w hen the party seeking intervention has the same ultimate objective as a party to the suit,a presumption arises that its interests are adequately represented,which can only be rebutted by a showing of adversity of interest,collusion,or nonfeasance.id.at quoting virginia westinghouse,cir.the presumption applied in this case,the court held,because the appellants and the existing defendants share precisely the same goal to uphold the act as constitutionally permissible.id.
the court also explained that because the existing defendant in this case is a government agency,a very strong showing of inadequacy is needed to warrant intervention.this is so,the court reasoned,because acting in a type of representative capacity is a basic governmental function,and the business of the government could hardly be conducted if,in matters of litigation,individual citizens could usually or always intervene and assert individual points of view.id.
after identifying the applicable legal standard,the district court considered the appellants chief contention that their interests were not being adequately represented because the attorney general did not introduce evidence in opposition to the preliminary injunction motion.the court rejected this argument,pointing out that the attorney general had filed a thorough and substantial brief and had argued zealously in opposition to the motion for injunctive relief.the court explained,moreover,that while the proposed intervenors may have disagreed with the d efendants tactical decisions,such a disagreement does not amount to the necessary showing of adversity of interest,collusion,or nonfeasance that would rebut the presumption of adequacy.id.the court accordingly denied the motion for intervention as of right.
the district court then addressed the appellants request for permissive intervention.citing federal rule of civil procedure b,which requires courts to consider whether the intervention will unduly delay the litigation,the court denied permissive intervention on the ground that adding the intervenors would complicate the discovery process and consume additional resources of the court and the parties.
the intervenors now appeal the district court decision.
the federal rules of civil procedure provide two avenues for intervention relevant to this appeal.under rule a,a district court must permit intervention as a matter of right if the movant can demonstrate an interest in the subject matter of the action that the protection of this interest would be impaired because of the action and that the applicant interest is not adequately represented by existing parties to the litigation.teague bakker,cir.if intervention of right is not warranted,a court may still allow an applicant to intervene permissively under rule b,although in that case the court must consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties rights.b.
it is well settled that district court rulings on both types of intervention motions are to be reviewed for abuse of discretion.in re sierra club,cir.deferential appellate review is proper here for many reasons,the first of which is that rule requirements are based on dynamics that develop in the trial court and that the court is accordingly in the best position to evaluate.indeed,appellate deference is customarily appropriate where trial judges are tasked with exercising judgment based on their on the scene presence.martha davis,standards of review judicial review of discretionary decisionmaking.prac.process.thus,in the intervention context,it is the trial judge who is best able to determine whether,for example,a proposed intervenor interests are being adequately represented by an existing party pursuant to rule a.indeed,the trial court superior vantage point was evident in this very case when the judge noted the attorney general detailed,thorough,and substantial brief and zealous oral argument in opposition to the preliminary injunction.
appellate review is necessarily limited in this setting for another reason questions of trial management are quintessentially the province of the district courts.united states smith,cir see also,arnold air lines,cir noting that many details of trial management are necessarily committed to broad trial court discretion.it is incontrovertible that motions to intervene can have profound implications for district courts trial management functions.additional parties can complicate routine scheduling orders,prolong and increase the burdens of discovery and motion practice,thwart settlement,and delay trial.this is particularly so where,as here,the proposed intervenors are themselves differently situated entities.the district court thus rightly expressed its concern that a dding three groups of intervenors would necessarily complicate the discovery process and consume additional resources of the court and the parties.
with these boundaries of our reviewing role in mind,we examine the appellants arguments for intervention.
the district court denied the appellants motion to intervene as of right based on its finding that the attorney general was adequately representing their interests.the court conclusion rested on two presumptions.first,the court reasoned that where a proposed intervenor ultimate objective is the same as that of an existing party,the party representation is presumptively adequate,rebuttable only by a showing of adverse interests,collusion,or nonfeasance.second,the court explained that where the party who shares the intervenor objective is a government agency,the intervenor has the burden of making a strong showing of inadequacy.
appellants contend that the court ruling was an abuse of discretion in two regards.to begin,although they concede that the court was correct to apply the first presumption,they dispute the second.that is,appellants claim that the district court was wrong to demand a strong showing of inadequacy due to the fact that the attorney general is a government official.according to appellants,our precedents dictate that the burden of demonstrating inadequate representation ought only to be a minimal one.appellants then argue that they satisfied this minimal burden by demonstrating adversity of interest with and,alternatively,nonfeasance by the attorney general.we consider these arguments in turn.
we begin with appellants contention that,regardless of the fact that the existing defendants are represented by a government agency,the burden of showing inadequacy of representation ought to be minimal,in contrast to the very strong showing required by the district court.
we disagree.although our circuit has yet to address the question of whether a more exacting showing of inadequacy should be required where the proposed intervenor shares the same objective as a government party,every circuit to rule on the matter has held in the affirmative.see,arakaki cayetano,cir daggett comm on governmental ethics election practices,cir wade goldschmidt,cir.we find this position persuasive for several reasons.
to start,it is among the most elementary functions of a government to serve in a representative capacity on behalf of its people.in matters of public law litigation that may affect great numbers of citizens,it is the government basic duty to represent the public interest.and the need for government to exercise its representative function is perhaps at its apex where,as here,a duly enacted statute faces a constitutional challenge.in such cases,the government is simply the most natural party to shoulder the responsibility of defending the fruits of the democratic process.as the supreme court stated in the related standing context in diamond charles,b ecause the state alone is entitled to create a legal code,only the state has the kind of direct stake needed to defend the standards embodied in that code against a constitutional attack,d internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,when a statute comes under attack,it is difficult to conceive of an entity better situated to defend it than the government.it is after all the government that,through the democratic process,gains familiarity with the matters of public concern that lead to the statute passage in the first place.thus in this case,while defending the act in district court,the attorney general vigorously pressed the state important interests in protecting the woman future psychological health,promoting the potential life of the unborn child,and ensuring that each woman has the opportunity to fully appreciate the consequences of an abortion to herself and to her unborn child.
finally,to permit private persons and entities to intervene in the government defense of a statute upon only a nominal showing would greatly complicate the government job.faced with the prospect of a deluge of potential intervenors,the government could be compelled to modify its litigation strategy to suit the motivations of those who seek party status,or else suffer the consequences of a geometrically protracted,costly,and complicated litigation.in short,the business of the government could hardly be conducted if,in matters of litigation,individual citizens could usually or always intervene and assert individual points of view.moore federal practice a iv a ed.
appellants respond that the requirement of a very strong showing of inadequacy by a government party is inconsistent with supreme court precedent and the law of this circuit.specifically,they point to the supreme court decision in trbovich united mine workers,which held that rule a is satisfied if the applicant shows that representation of his interest may be inadequate and the burden of making that showing should be treated as minimal,d emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted see also united guar.residential ins.of iowa phila.sav.fund soc y,cir.
appellants argument misses the mark.for in trbovich and united guaranty the proposed intervenors did not even share the same ultimate objective as an existing party.thus,in trbovich,the supreme court expressly noted that the secretary of labor was compelled by statute to serve two distinct interests,such that the secretary ultimate objective was not the same as that of the proposed intervenor to begin with.at.likewise,in united guaranty,we observed that the existing defendant objectives were apparently at cross purposes with the proposed intervenor.at.
contrary to the appellants claim,then,trbovich and united guaranty stand for the conventional proposition that where the existing party and proposed intervenor seek divergent objectives,there is less reason to presume that the party government agency or otherwise will adequately represent the intervenor.in such circumstances,it is perfectly sensible to require a more modest showing of inadequacy before granting intervention of right since an existing party is not likely to adequately represent the interests of another with whom it is at cross purposes in the first instance.
that is not so here,however,where appellants concede that they share the same ultimate objective as the existing defendants and where those defendants are represented by a government agency.both the government agency and the intervenors want the statute to be constitutionally sustained.in this context,for the reasons described above,we join our fellow courts of appeals in holding that the putative intervenor must mount a strong showing of inadequacy.to hold otherwise would place a severe and unnecessary burden on government agencies as they seek to fulfill their basic duty of representing the people in matters of public litigation.
appellants next argue that they have sufficiently demonstrated adversity of interest with and,alternatively,nonfeasance by the attorney general,thereby rebutting the presumption of adequacy that arises because they share the same objective.the district court rejected both arguments,and we hold that it did not abuse its discretion in doing so.for rather than making the necessary strong showing,appellants have demonstrated merely that they disagree with the attorney general reasonable litigation tactics.
first as to adversity of interest.appellants begin by pointing to their desire to ensure that a pregnant woman understands the potential risk and harms to the child so that she can make the decision for the child.ap
