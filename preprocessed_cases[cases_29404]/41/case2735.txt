background 
cruz was a employee who worked in publix bakery department as a cake decorator.she worked for publix from october of until her termination in november of.in may of,cruz learned that her adult daughter was pregnant and was due to give birth to cruz second grandchild on november.after learning of her daughter pregnancy,cruz requested two weeks of unpaid leave from october,to november,to travel to colorado for the birth of her grandchild,by filling out the appropriate time away from work form.despite the fact that cruz had already used all of her vacation time for the year,publix store manager gary southall approved cruz request for two weeks unpaid leave.significantly,the leave was predicated on publix policy regarding unpaid leave,not the fmla.
after publix approved her leave,cruz reminded assistant bakery manager lance davis that because she was taking leave due to her daughter pregnancy,she might have to leave for colorado earlier than planned,if her daughter went into labor earlier than expected.davis responded,okay.at this time,cruz,however,did not tell davis that she might have to stay in colorado longer than expected,nor did she request additional time off.
on or about october,cruz learned that her daughter believed that she might deliver the baby early.that day,cruz changed her flight to colorado to leave two days later,on october,which was two weeks before her leave was scheduled to begin.
the next day,on october,cruz informed davis that she thought her daughter was in labor and therefore she planned to leave the following day for colorado.cruz told davis that she planned to return to work on november,as previously scheduled,and davis responded,okay.davis immediately relayed the news of cruz change of plans to southall and to bakery department manager justin pierro,who called cruz into the front office for a meeting.
southall asked cruz to explain her situation,and cruz told them that she believed her daughter was in labor,that her daughter husband broke his collarbone,and that her daughter needed her help.at no time did cruz tell them that her daughter was having complications due to her pregnancy.cruz also told southall and pierro that she had already changed her plane ticket to leave for colorado the following day.southall and pierro agreed to allow cruz two weeks of unpaid leave to begin immediately,but refused to grant her more than two weeks of leave.it was at this point that cruz asked,for the first time,whether she was eligible for family leave.believing that cruz did not qualify for fmla leave under the circumstances,southall told her no.
at the completion of the meeting,cruz understood that she was approved for of unpaid leave.she admitted that she had a good suspicion that if she took four weeks of leave,she might be fired.during the meeting,cruz even inquired as to how to reapply for a position with publix when she returned.
later that day,after meeting with the managers,cruz inquired at the publix personnel office to determine how an employee applies for leave under the fmla.cruz was told that she needed to provide a letter from her daughter physician to the store coordinator,who would fill out the appropriate forms so that the fmla leave could be approved.cruz arranged for her daughter physician to fax a letter to the store coordinator,which stated that her had a broken collarbone and is now unable to help with labor coaching.in addition,the letter stated that cruz daughter feels she needs her mother to come help with labor,as she has no one else to help.we hope you agree with us that her mother presence would help their difficult situation at this time.absent from the note was any indication that cruz daughter was having complications due to her pregnancy cruz provided the letter to the store coordinator and left for colorado the next day.
when southall received cruz fmla leave application,including the letter from cruz daughter physician,he again denied her request using the appropriate form because he did not believe she qualified for fmla leave.publix then scheduled cruz to work her regular schedule during the work week beginning november,which was the week following her two weeks of approved leave.
however,cruz did not return to work after her two weeks of leave were over.in fact,publix did not hear from cruz until four weeks later,on november,when she called from colorado to ask about her schedule.at this time,publix informed cruz that she had been terminated for job abandonment when she failed to return to work after her two weeks of approved leave was over.cruz termination was effective on november,after cruz failed to work the entire work week of november.
cruz subsequently filed her complaint,alleging that publix improperly denied her fmla leave to care for her pregnant daughter who had a serious medical condition and was terminated in retaliation for exercising her rights under the fmla.the district court determined that a genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether cruz daughter was incapable of because of a mental or physical disability,which would qualify cruz for leave under the fmla.see b.nevertheless,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of publix on cruz fmla claims because cruz failed to give publix sufficient notice that her leave was due to a potentially reason.
