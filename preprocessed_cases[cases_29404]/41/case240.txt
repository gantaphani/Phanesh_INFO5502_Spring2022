after undergoing an unsuccessful surgical procedure,katherine macaulay sued for negligence the case was tried to a jury,which returned a verdict in favor of her surgeon,peter anas.macaulay appeals,assigning error to the district court actions in refusing to grant her motion for a continuance,placing certain limitations on the testimony of her principal expert witness,and permitting of her treating physician with respect to matters touching upon the standard of care.concluding,as we do,that these claims of error are without merit,we affirm.
background 
we start by sketching a broad picture of the case.we bring that picture into sharper focus by adding more specific facts during our discussion of particular issues.
the appellant,like many other people,suffers from back problems.in due course,she came under the care of anas a orthopedist.the physician recommended that she undergo spinal fusion surgery,and the appellant acquiesced.
anas performed the surgery on september,at new england baptist hospital in boston,massachusetts.the operation was not a success.when the macaulay family moved to philadelphia,the appellant came under the care of a different orthopedist,todd albert.on february,albert performed corrective spinal surgery.
displeased by what had happened on anas watch,the appellant brought a diversity action,a,in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.she named as defendants anas,the hospital and acromed corporation the manufacturer of the hardware used in the original surgery.she alleged,inter alia,that anas had been negligent in using investigational bone screws,in improperly positioning them during the operation,and in failing to remove them afterwards.
within a matter of weeks,the case was transferred,for purposes of centralized pretrial proceedings,to the eastern district of pennsylvania.see describing procedures applicable to multidistrict litigation.the transfer was prompted by the pendency of hundreds of other cases involving manufacturers of investigational medical hardware.see in re orthopedic bone screw liab.when the claims against the manufacturers were resolved,the appellant case was remitted to the district of massachusetts.at that point,acromed was no longer a defendant.
on august,the district court referred the case to the massachusetts medical malpractice tribunal the tribunal.see.laws ch.on march,the tribunal rendered a decision in favor of anas,finding that the appellant case exemplified an unfortunate medical result.the appellant posted the bond required in order to pursue her claim against anas in court.see id.
meantime,the district court had been attempting to compose a timeline leading to trial.the court initially scheduled the trial to commence on november,but postponed it sine die because the tribunal had not yet acted.after march of,the district court set a number of putative trial dates,but vacated all of them for one reason or another in several instances to accommodate the appellant counsel.the court finally settled upon a firm trial date of september,and rebuffed the appellant efforts to vacate that assignment.
the trial went forward on september,but the appellant principal attorney,joseph messa,was not present.instead,one of messa associates,andrew swain,took the lead.on september,the jury returned a defendant verdict.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
we divide our discussion of the issues into three segments,corresponding to the appellant assignments of error.
refusal to grant a continuance.
the appellant calumnizes the district court for its refusal to vacate the september trial assignment,asserting that the court dogged insistence on going forward effectively deprived her of counsel of her own choosing.in her view,relatively inexperienced no substitute for the highly skilled advocate whom she had hired.she mentions fleetingly a second reason why the district court should have granted a continuance her house had burned down approximately one month before the trial date.
we review the district court denial of a continuance for abuse of discretion.united states saccoccia,cir united states devin,cir.we discern none here.after all,a party right to counsel of her choosing is not absolute,and courts are not required either to wait endlessly for lawyers to make themselves available or to conform their calendars to suit attorneys preferences.see,united states woodard,cir united states noah,cir.
the record reflects that the trial court exhibited great patience in endeavoring to accommodate the appellant counsel.the appellant requested no fewer than four trial continuances,including requests made in march,may,and june of due to conflicts with messa schedule.on each of these occasions,the district court yielded to counsel scheduling constraints and delayed the trial.when all was said and done,these serial continuances moved the scheduled start of trial to july.
on july,the court held a pretrial conference.with the agreement of both parties,it vacated the july trial assignment.in an effort to accommodate the vacation schedules of all concerned,the court proposed to start the trial on september.messa asked for special consideration because he was planning to return from vacation that day.the court then suggested september,but messa protested.the court yielded once more it acceded to messa importunings and set trial to commence on september.but the court exacted a reciprocal commitment from messa.it fixed the september trial date only after the lawyer gave what was described as an ironclad guarantee that he or someone from his office would be available to try the case that day.on july,messa confirmed that assurance in writing.
the english satirist,jonathan swift,wrote nearly three centuries ago that promises and pie crusts are made to be broken.swift,polite conversation.so it was here.on august,messa wrote to the district court requesting yet another continuance because he was to start a trial in pennsylvania on september and neither the appellant nor his pennsylvania client would consent to having another lawyer appear.on september,the district court rejected messa request.noting that the appellant previously had been granted multiple continuances,the court declared i picked a date satisfactory to you and you guaranteed me you would be available.messa renewed his request,this time mentioning that the macaulays family home had burned down several weeks earlier.the court responded that it had selected the september date at messa urging,that it had blocked off three weeks to accommodate the trial,and that it would not continue the case.messa essayed yet a third request,advising the court that the appellant had threatened to sue messa firm if swain tried the case and lost.the court stood firm.
we descry no hint of error.district courts enjoy broad discretion in administering their dockets.this discretion encompasses the granting and denial of requests for continuances.saccoccia,at.mindful that the exigencies of managing a heavy caseload are real,appellate review of the denial of a motion to continue is highly deferential.an appellate court looks primarily to the persuasiveness of the trial court reasons for refusing the continuance and gives due regard not only to the factors which inform that court ruling but also to its superior point of vantage.united states ottens,cir.the burden is on the movant to demonstrate that the trial court,in refusing a continuance,indulged in a serious error of law or suffered a meaningful lapse of judgment,resulting in substantial prejudice.saccoccia,at.
in sifting the record to determine whether this heavy burden has been carried,an inquiring court must consider the totality of the circumstances,including,in addition to the trier rationale for denying the motion,the reasons that the movant contemporaneously advanced in support of her request for a continuance,the history of the proceedings,the probable utility of a continuance,the extent of inconvenience to others,the court,the witnesses,and the opposing party should a continuance ensue,and the extent of any unfair prejudice to the movant should a continuance be denied.see id.
here,the hallmark of the district court handling of the case was patience,not hubris.its stated rationale for refusing a further continuance was entirely plausible.in contrast,the appellant claim of entitlement was weak,especially since messa knew about the conflicting pennsylvania trial assignment when he guaranteed that the appellant case would go forward on september.moreover,the history of the litigation buttresses the court action.the court had been indulgent in trying to work around messa hectic schedule.having granted several continuances,the court was justified in drawing a line in the sand.even then,the court did not set the september trial date by fiat,but,rather,based it on messa unqualified assurance of his availability.both the court and the adverse party relied on this assurance the court had cleared its calendar,the had adjusted his workload,and the defense had proceeded with its trial preparations on the reasonable assumption that the case would go forward.it was the court,its weigh these facts in acting upon the appellant request for yet another continuance.see ottens,at.
to say more on this point would be to paint the lily.while we are sympathetic to the appellant plight,parties are bound by their attorneys representations,see united states woburn city ath.club,cir,and courts are entitled to take those representations at face value.that messa chose to do a juggling act by committing himself to begin trials in two different courts on the same date was it was not the court responsibility to extricate him from this hole.courts simply can not afford to let lawyers schedules dominate the management of their dockets.given the totality of the circumstances,it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to insist that the trial begin as scheduled 
preclusion of expert testimony.
the appellant next strives to convince us that the district court erred in precluding her expert witness,robert dunn,from testifying that the surgery performed by anas was not medically indicated.we are not persuaded.
in order to place this assignment of error in perspective,we first inspect the relevant provisions of the civil rules.under that regime 
except as otherwise stipulated or directed by the court,a party disclosure shall,with respect to a witness who is retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case,be accompanied by a written report,prepared and signed by the witness.the report shall contain a complete statement of all opinions to be expressed and the basis and reasons therefor 
a b.once such a disclosure is made,it must be kept current.see.e explicating the duty to supplement discovery responses.since an important object of these rules is to avoid trial by ambush,the district court typically sets temporal parameters for the production of such information.see.b.such a timetable promotes fairness both in the discovery process and at trial.thibeault square d,cir.when a party fails to comply with this timetable,the district court has the authority to impose a condign sanction including the authority to preclude expert testimony.id.at.
moving from the general to the particular,we trace the chronology of pertinent events in this case.on march,the district court entered an order establishing a discovery date some six months in the future.the court subsequently extended that date to october.at a status conference held after the close of standard discovery,the court constructed a staggered template for the exchange of expert witnesses reports and related depositions.the deadline for the appellant submission of reports was february.
pursuant to this timetable,the appellant produced dunn report on february.the report concluded that anas had improperly positioned the screws that he placed in the appellant spine and had compounded this negligence by not removing the screws after it had become apparent that the appellant was suffering significant irritation.on march,the parties filed a joint motion to vacate the extant march trial assignment and reassign the case for trial on april,the district court granted them half a loaf,shifting the trial date to april.
on march,the parties took a videotaped deposition from albert the appellant treating physician.this deposition was taken on the understanding that it would be used at trial in lieu of live testimony by albert.eight days more than a month after the deadline had passed for submitting her expert witnesses appellant produced a supplemental report from dunn.in this report dunn opined,for the first time,that the surgery that had been performed was not medically indicated.
the following day,the district court held a pretrial conference.the defense complained about the appellant attempted injection of a new theory of liability well after the deadline had passed for divulging her expert witnesses reports.the district court noted the imminence of trial and ruled that the parties were bound by the tenor of the reports that had been submitted on or before february.the court made an exception for certain additional and ct films that the appellant had belatedly produced and,subsequently,reassigned the case for trial on may.although the trial eventually was postponed until september,the appellant never sought to revisit the district court preclusionary order.
this brings us to the standard of review.district courts have available a range of sanctions for the untimely production of discovery materials.in addressing such matters,trial judges must work a complicated equation,balancing fairness to the parties with the need to manage crowded dockets.because trial judges tend to have an intimate knowledge of the variables that enter into the equation,see,fashion house,k mart,cir explaining that,district judges are,by and large,in a far better position than appellate tribunals to determine the presence of misconduct and to prescribe concinnous remedies,appellate review of sanctions orders is deferential.see thibeault,at.it follows that when a party proffers expert testimony out of time and the district court opts to preclude it,the question on appeal is not whether we would have imposed the same sanction.rather,the question is whether the district court action was so wide of the mark as to constitute an abuse of discretion.hockey league metro.hockey club,d per curiam thibeault,at.
in answering this question,the court of appeals must consider a multiplicity of pertinent factors,including the history of the litigation,the proponent need for the challenged evidence,the justification if any for the late disclosure,and the opponent ability to overcome its adverse effects.thibeault,at johnson webster,cir.surprise and prejudice are important integers in this calculus.thibeault,at johnson,at.so too is an assessment of what the late disclosure portends for the court docket.salgado motors,cir.
in this instance,the appellant faces a steep,uphill climb.the record shows beyond hope of contradiction that she had ample time to conduct discovery and to submit her expert reports within the period allotted by the district court yet,she did not proffer the report limning the unnecessary surgery theory until more than a month after the applicable deadline had expired.moreover,the neoteric theory was not based on any newly discovered evidence,and the appellant has not advanced any real justification for its tardy emergence.to compound these failings,discovery was closed and trial was imminent at the time the supplemental report surfaced.consequently,had the district court allowed the late submission,it would have had a hobson choice either to force the defense to trial without appropriate preparation such as targeted pretrial discovery or to reopen discovery and vacate the trial assignment.under those circumstances,it is surpassingly difficult to fault the court for refusing to overlook the discovery violation.
in an effort to blur this compelling picture,the appellant argues that the lower court should have permitted her to proceed because the defense could not credibly claim to have been surprised.this argument is little more than whistling past the graveyard.a careful review of the record shows that,although the unnecessary surg
