the wichita district also referred to as the ark valley chapter of the mda sponsors a one week summer camp each year at camp chihowa near perry,kansas.the camp is not owned by the mda but rather is leased for the one week session.camp chihowa is located on acres.it includes a lake for fishing and boating and wooded acres.other recreational facilities include a baseball diamond,basketball and volleyball courts,and a swimming pool.lodging available at the camp includes two lodges and four cabins.total capacity of the camp is about persons.the main lodge contains a dining room where meals are served to campers and volunteer workers and a meeting room that accommodates up to people.all of the facilities at the camp are fully.
mda summer camp program aims to provide a safe week of recreation for children with muscular dystrophy.attending the camp permits children with neuromuscular diseases to do things they might not ordinarily get to do,such as socializing with other children who face similar challenges and taking part in various recreational activities with their fellow campers.to be eligible to attend as a camper,individuals must be between the ages of,must have a neuromuscular disease that comes within the mda purview,and must be registered with the local chapter.d at.
mda classifies individuals in attendance at mda summer camps primarily into three groups young campers,adult volunteer counselors,and mda paid staff.mda paid staff includes the camp director and a few others,such as kitchen staff or cooks.mda also arranges for a volunteer medical staff to be at the camp.
plaintiffs bauer and stolz both attended the wichita mda camp chihowa as campers from through.mda former wichita camp director allowed the plaintiffs to serve as volunteer counselors after.mda solicits volunteer counselors to assist with its summer camp programs.mda policy requires that volunteer counselors be at least years of age and of sufficient size and strength to assist with the needs of campers.mda requires that volunteers be able to lift and care for campers.mda has had such a policy for at least years,although apparently the staff running the wichita camp in previous years were unaware of the policy.id.at.

in september of,kim dinell told bauer that she could not be a volunteer counselor at the camp in,due to the mda policy requiring volunteers to be able to lift and care for campers.for,mda added a question to its volunteer application form asking whether the applicant is able to lift and care for a camper.neither bauer nor stolz actually submitted an application to be a counselor at the session of camp.the district court found that mda had advised the plaintiffs that they would not have been considered for the position of volunteer counselor even if they submitted their applications because they did not meet the requirement of being able to lift and care for a camper.
ii.procedural history 
bauer and stolz filed suit in kansas state court,alleging that mda application of the requirement that volunteer counselors be able to lift and care for campers denied them the opportunity to participate as volunteer counselors and was in violation of the ada and the kansas act against discrimination.in particular,plaintiffs alleged that camp chihowa was a place of public accommodation operated by mda,as defined under title iii of the ada,as well as under a corresponding section of the state statute.stat.ann.they further alleged that by requiring that volunteer counselors be able to lift and care for campers,mda had imposed eligibility criteria which would screen out or tend to screen out individuals with disabilities from fully enjoying the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages or accommodations of camp chihowa,and that mda failed to make reasonable accommodations or take other such steps as would be necessary to allow bauer and stolz full enjoyment of camp chihowa,in violation of.

thereafter,the district court entered a final decision and judgment for the defendant.the court held that as adult volunteer counselors at a summer camp for children,plaintiffs were not covered under title iii of the ada.bauer,d at.the court further held that even if plaintiffs were covered under the act,mda application of its eligibility criteria did not amount to unlawful discrimination because the criteria were necessary to fulfill the primary purpose of the camp and to ensure its safe operation,and that plaintiffs had failed to identify any reasonable modification of those criteria that would have allowed them to perform the essential functions that were required of them.id.at.the court noted that neither side had argued that the public accommodation provisions of the state statute differed in any significant respect from title iii of the ada,and it therefore ruled likewise in favor of mda on
