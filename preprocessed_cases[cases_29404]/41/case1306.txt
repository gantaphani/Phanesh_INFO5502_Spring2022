barbara castile filed numerous claims under title ii of the social security act in accordance with the process proscribed by the social security administration ssa for obtaining disability insurance and disability widow benefits.all of her claims were denied at each of the ssa administrative levels.on subsequent judicial review by the district court,the ssa denials were affirmed.castile now appeals her claims for the sixth time,alleging that the district court erred in affirming the denials.we affirm.
background 
as part of its review of the ssa determination,the district court undertook a comprehensive review of castile medical and vocational history.included in this review was the administrative law judge alj application of the required sequential analysis to castile personal history.because of the exhaustive nature of the district court review,we adopt this background discussion in its entirety,as contained in castile astrue,wl.nevertheless,we feel it is appropriate and have chosen to set forth herein a summary of the procedural history of this appeal.
on march,castile filed applications for social security disability insurance benefits and disabled widow benefits under title ii of the social security act.castile alleged that her disability began on march,due to a combination of fibromyalgia,arthritis,chronic fatigue,depression,obesity,high blood pressure,anxiety,and sleep apnea,among other maladies.at the date of the onset of her alleged disability castile was years old,an age classification associated with a younger individual under the social security act.her claims were initially denied on june,and were again denied upon reconsideration on november.dissatisfied with these determinations,castile subsequently requested and received an administrative hearing at which she appeared with an attorney and presented testimony.her claims were denied by the alj on june.castile then requested review by the ssa appeals council.the council remanded the matter to the alj with instructions to obtain additional evidence.
a supplemental hearing was convened on march.an exhaustive amount of evidence was presented,including additional medical records,medical expert testimony,and vocational expert testimony.castile was again represented by counsel.in conducting the sequential analysis to determine disability as required by and,the alj found that castile had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the alleged onset date of her disability step one castile suffered from the severe impairments of hypertension,sleep apnea,obesity,fibromyalgia,and depression,but castile chronic fatigue syndrome was not severe step two and that none of castile impairments,either alone or in combination,qualified as a listed impairment step three.the alj then examined castile residual functioning capacity and concluded that she could perform her past relevant work as an order clerk step four.because the alj determined castile was not disabled at step four,he was not required to and did not proceed to step five.
on february,the alj,acting on behalf of the ssa commissioner,again denied castile applications.the alj concluded that castile was not disabled as the meaning of that term is defined under the social security act because her impairments did not meet or equal any listed impairment,and she remained capable of performing her past relevant work as an order clerk.the council declined castile request for further review,thereby making the alj decision the final decision of the commissioner.
on january,castile filed a civil action in the district court seeking judicial review of the commissioner decision.on november,the district court found that the alj findings were supported by substantial evidence and issued an entry on judicial review and final judgment affirming the commissioner final decision.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,castile presents arguments identical to those addressed by the district court.castile argues again that the alj erred at step two of the evaluation by determining that her chronic fatigue syndrome was not severe.castile next argues that the alj failed to give sufficient weight to the effect of her obesity on her ability to work.lastly,castile argues that the alj credibility finding was improperly articulated and unreasonable.we take each argument in turn.
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court judgment affirming the commissioner final decision,dixon massanari,cir,and will uphold the commissioner decision so long as the alj applied the correct legal standard and substantial evidence supported the decision,see skinner astrue,cir steele barnhart,cir.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.skinner,at quoting richardson perales.when reviewing for substantial evidence,we do not displace the alj judgment by reconsidering facts or evidence or making credibility determinations.id.
we note that on appeal castile primarily addresses the alj decision without discussing the district court analysis of that decision.while not legally flawed,we have previously indicated that such an approach is a risky tactic,especially in a case such as this where the district court judge issued a thorough and persuasive opinion.white barnhart,cir.
chronic fatigue syndrome 
castile argues that the alj erred by finding that her alleged chronic fatigue syndrome was not a severe impairment.she contends that her claimed chronic fatigue syndrome by itself renders her incapable of performing work.
procedurally,the alj is required to determine at step two of the sequential analysis whether the claimant in fact has an impairment or combination of impairments that is severe.a ii.the burden,however,is on the claimant to prove that the impairment is severe.zurawski halter,cir.a severe impairment is an impairment or combination of impairments that significantly limits one physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.c a.as long as the alj determines that the claimant has one severe impairment,the alj will proceed to the remaining steps of the evaluation process.see also golembiewski barnhart,cir having found that one or more of appellant impairments was severe,the alj needed to consider the aggregate effect of the entire constellation of those impairments that in isolation are not severe.therefore,the step two determination of severity is merely a threshold requirement.hickman apfel,cir.
although the alj found that castile has numerous severe impairments,his findings also indicated that castile chronic fatigue syndrome was not severe because it did not more than minimally affect her ability to perform basic sedentary work activities.in addition,the alj noted that the record was devoid of any medical laboratory test results to support her claim.the alj also observed that although castile had complained of chronic fatigue syndrome since,she continued working,and she apparently felt well enough to apply for work as late as january.finally,the alj noted that there were no records whatsoever of any physical complaints since august.
we agree with the district court that there was substantial evidence to support the alj conclusion.regardless,this particular determination is of no consequence with respect to the outcome of the case.because the alj recognized numerous other severe impairments,he was obligated to proceed with the evaluation process.see golembiewski barnhart,cir having found that one or more of appellant impairments was severe,the alj needed to consider the aggregate effect of the entire constellation of ailments.accordingly,in step four of the evaluation,the alj properly considered castile chronic fatigue syndrome along with her other severe and impairments in determining whether castile could perform her past work.
castile further contends that her chronic fatigue syndrome,in combination with her other impairments,rendered her disabled because such impairments cause a level of absenteeism that makes it impossible for her to perform acceptable work.therefore,castile argues,the alj erred as a matter of law and fact because the alj improperly evaluated the limiting effects of her chro
