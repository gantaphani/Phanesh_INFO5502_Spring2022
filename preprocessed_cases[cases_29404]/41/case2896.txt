this case,brought under the national childhood vaccine injury act of,to,as amended the vaccine act,presents the question whether petitioner cynthia lalonde,on behalf of her son,has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that pertussis dtap vaccination caused a focal brain injury.the special master found that although dtap vaccination likely caused his initial anaphylactic reaction,lalonde failed to establish under any reliable medical theory that anaphylaxis caused a focal brain injury.see lalonde sec y of health human,wl.after a careful consideration of the record,the court of federal claims upheld that finding.see lalonde sec y of health human.we affirm.
background 
the relevant facts are primarily those found by the special master in his detailed september,decision.see lalonde,wl,at.was born on september.at his wellchild visit,his pediatrician noted that was walking and generally developing normally but did not want to talk.on april,received several immunizations,including the dtap vaccination.about five hours later,allegedly began experiencing an abnormally high fever and some swelling.the next day was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of vaccine adverse reaction with secondary fever,angiodema,and anaphylactoid reaction.he was discharged on april.however,the following morning mother called an ambulance because was exhibiting signs of hypothermia and episodes.
in the weeks and months following the administration of the dtap vaccination,vocabulary allegedly decreased,worrying his parents and his doctors.an mri of brain with and without contrast was normal,revealing a deep bilateral middle ear infection but no brain damage.nonetheless,continued to exhibit several activities,but after a few months he was weaned off medication.after observing developmental delays and repetitive behaviors,a pediatric neurologist placed in the autism spectrum disorder category.
ii.procedural history 
lalonde filed a petition under the vaccine act on june,seeking compensation for alleged injuries.the case was assigned to a special master,who heard expert testimony from marcel kinsbourne for lalonde.kinsbourne testified that m.experienced a anaphylactic reaction that included a delayed second state.he pointed to medical literature that supports the existence of anaphylactic reactions and offered three possible mechanisms of injury that have been shown in medical literature to result from an anaphylactic reaction.however,kinsbourne was unable to point to anywhere in the literature that describes the sequence of events that are presented in this case.kinsbourne also admitted that he lacked any reliable medical evidence supporting the notion that anaphylactic shock can cause focal brain injuries.
after reviewing the evidence in the case,the special master saw what he called a major gap in lalonde case.lalonde,wl,at.he alerted lalonde to this fact and allowed her to submit new evidence,updated medical records,and a revised expert report.id.at.nonetheless,after the entire record,the special master found two decisive defects in lalonde case kinsbourne opinions were based on information provided by lalonde and not on medical information found in the record and the record indicated and all experts agreed that initial reaction to the immunizations resolved,and kinsbourne theory that there was a secondary,delayed anaphylactic reaction was unsupported by the record.id.at.
on review,the court of federal claims concluded that the special master abused his discretion by discrediting kinsbourne opinions that were based on statements made by lalonde,even if some of her statements were in conflict with the medical records.lalonde.at.nonetheless,the court of federal claims concluded that this abuse of discretion was harmless.id.it explained that the special master quite properly required lalonde to carry her burden to bring forward a reliable medical or scientific explanation,and she failed to do so.id.at.her expert,kinsbourne,testified that he had never seen an anaphylactic reaction lead to a focal brain injury,he did not find any support for a link in the medical literature,and he had an incomplete understanding of how the reaction could evolve into a focal brain injury.id.
we have jurisdiction to review the final judgment of the court of federal claims under f.
iii.the vaccine act 
in,congress passed the vaccine act to establish a program administered by the secretary of health and human services to increase the safety and availability of vaccines.see terran sec y of health human.the vaccine act created the national vaccine injury compensation program,through which claimants could petition to receive compensation for injuries or death.see a.
to receive compensation,a claimant must show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the vaccinated person received a covered vaccine and either suffered an injury,condition,or a significant aggravation of a preexisting injury or condition listed on the table within the requisite time frame,in which case causation is presumed a table injury or suffered an injury or condition or suffered the significant aggravation of a injury or condition not on the table,in which case causation must be proven a injury.see c c.to prove actual causation in a injury case,the petitioner must 
show by preponderant evidence that the vaccination brought about the injury by providing a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury and a showing of a proximate temporal relationship between the vaccination and the injury.
moberly ex rel.moberly sec y of health human,quoting althen sec y of health human.if the petitioner satisfies this burden,she is entitled to recover unless the government shows,also by a preponderance of evidence,that the injury was in fact caused by factors unrelated to the vaccine.althen,at quoting knudsen sec y of health human,alteration in original.the petitioner is not required to prove the case to a level of scientific certainty.rather,the burden of showing something by a preponderance of the evidence,the most common standard in the civil law,simply requires the trier of fact to believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence before he may find in favor of the party who has the burden to persuade the judge of the fact existence.moberly,at quoting concrete pipe prods.of,constr.laborers pension trust for,d.
iv.standard of review 
in vaccine act cases,we review a ruling by the court of federal claims de novo,applying the same standard that it applies in reviewing the decision of the special master.moberly,at citing lampe sec y of health human.we review factual findings under the arbitrary and capricious standard,and we review legal rulings to determine whether they are not in accordance with law.id.citing munn sec y of health human.
discussion 
on appeal,lalonde argues that the special master made a legal error when he denied her claim for compensation.relying on knudsen secretary of health and human services,she claims that the special master used an incorrect legal standard when he required lalonde to prove the mechanism through which the initial anaphylactic reaction caused to later suffer focal brain injuries.she argues that although kinsbourne had proposed three potential mechanisms,the special master discredited him due to his failure to specify which caused injury.
additionally,lalonde acknowledges that under our case law,a temporal relationship alone between a vaccination and injury would not logically support a causal relationship.moberly,at.but she argues that t here is a very significant difference between inferring causation from a proximate temporal relationship between an anaphylactic reaction and an injury which is what she requests that we do,and inferring causation from a proximate temporal relationship between a vaccination and an injury,which the law states is not enough to receive relief under the vaccine act.pet r reply br.emphasis added.lalonde claims that such a temporal association is a logical sequence of cause and effect she asserts that the proximate temporal
