this case presents a challenge to the federal abortion ban act of,stat.codified at.the day the president signed the act into law,plaintiffs filed suit in the united states district court for the district of nebraska seeking an injunction against enforcement of the act.after a trial,the district court held the act unconstitutional on several grounds.the government appeals.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in,the supreme court handed down its decision in stenberg carhart,d,which found nebraska abortion ban unconstitutional for two separate reasons.first,the court determined the law was unconstitutional because it did not contain an exception to preserve the health of the mother.second,the court determined the law was worded so broadly it covered the vast majority of abortions and thus imposed an undue burden on the right to abortion itself.
in the eight years before the court decision in stenberg,at least thirty states passed laws banning abortions.see id.at.thomas,dissenting.in and,congress enacted prohibitions on abortions,however,president clinton vetoed them.id.at.thomas,dissenting.in,congress enacted,and president george bush signed,the abortion ban act of.the act exposes a ny physician who,in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce,knowingly performs a abortion and thereby kills a human fetus to up to two years of imprisonment.a.the act goes on to define a abortion as an abortion in which the person performing the abortion 
a deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until,in the case of a head first presentation,the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother,or,in the case of a breech presentation,any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother,for the purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will kill the partially delivered living fetus and 
b performs the overt act,other than completion of delivery,that kills the partially delivered living fetus 
the act contains an exception allowing the performance of a abortion that is necessary to save the life of the mother.id.a.the act does not,however,contain an exception for the preservation of the health of the mother.
presumably recognizing that the act is similar though not identical to the nebraska law found unconstitutional in stenberg,congress made several findings and declarations in the act.congress f ound and declare d that under supreme court jurisprudence,the united states congress is not bound to accept the same factual findings that the supreme court was bound to accept in stenberg.abortion ban act of,stat.at.congress concluded that a moral,medical,and ethical consensus exists that the practice of performing a abortion is a gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never medically necessary and should be prohibited,stat.at.in addition to determining there is substantial evidence that abortions are never medically necessary,congress also concluded abortions pose serious risks to the health of the mother undergoing the procedure,stat.at.
after a trial,the district court found the act unconstitutional on two separate grounds.first,the district court concluded congress finding regarding a medical consensus was unreasonable and thus the act was unconstitutional due to its lack of health exception.second,the district court concluded the act covered the most common abortion procedure and thus imposed an undue burden on the right to an abortion.
the procedures in question in this case are used during abortions and we therefore must,for context,present some basic information regarding these procedures.there are three primary methods of abortions medical induction dilation and evacuation d e and dilation and extraction d x.in a medical induction,formerly the most common method of abortion,a physician uses medication to induce premature labor.stenberg,at.in a d e,now the most common procedure,the physician causes dilation of the woman cervix and then the physician reaches into the woman uterus with an instrument,grasps an extremity of the fetus,and pulls.women med.prof l taft,cir.when the fetus lodges in the cervix,the traction between the grasping instrument and the cervix causes dismemberment and eventual death,although death may occur prior to dismemberment.id.this process is repeated until the entire fetus has been removed.
d x and a process called intact d e are what are now widely known as partial birth abortion.id.in these procedures,the fetus is removed intact in a single pass.if the fetus presents head first,the physician collapses the skull of the fetus and then removes the intact fetus.stenberg,at.this is what is known as an intact d e.if the fetus presents feet first,the physician pulls the fetal body through the cervix,collapses the skull,and extracts the fetus through the cervix.id.this is the d x procedure.despite the technical differences between an intact d e and a d x,they are sufficiently similar for us to use the terms interchangeably.id.at.
as a preliminary matter,although the plaintiffs purported to bring a facial challenge to the act,the district court expressed confusion over whether its judgment declared the act facially unconstitutional or unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiffs.see carhart ashcroft,d,stating the district court do es not know if its ruling was facial or as applied and leaving that for others to determine.this is a question of law and we therefore review it de novo.see,united states jeffries,cir.the traditional standard for evaluating a facial challenge was set forth in united states salerno,d.in salerno,the supreme court explained that a facial challenge to a legislative act is,of course,the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid.id.at.in stenberg,however,the supreme court struck down nebraska abortion ban as facially unconstitutional without applying the salerno standard.in fact,the approach taken in stenberg was fundamentally inconsistent with salerno no set of circumstances test in that it regarded rarity of the need for a particular procedure as not highly relevant.stenberg,at.the salerno test is also inconsistent with the general undue burden analysis for abortion statutes set forth in planned parenthood casey,d.this has led the vast majority of circuit courts to apply these standards in place of salerno.see planned parenthood of new england heed,cir collecting cases,cert.granted sub nom.ayotte planned parenthood,d may,richmond med.ctr.for women hicks,cir same.we have previously declined to apply the no set of circumstances test in the context of facial challenges to abortion restrictions in planned parenthood,sioux falls clinic miller,cir,where we explained we would follow what the supreme court actually than what it failed to say and thus applied casey undue burden test.we will again follow what the supreme court actually did and apply the test from stenberg rather than the one from salerno.we therefore join every circuit that has addressed the question.see hicks,at planned parenthood of idaho,wasden,cir planned parenthood of the rocky mountains,owens,cir.thus,if the act fails the stenberg test,it must be held facially unconstitutional.
we begin our analysis with the supreme court decision in stenberg that case has engendered some disagreement as to the proper standard for evaluating the necessity of a health exception.the proper reading of stenberg is a question of law and therefore is reviewed de novo.see,jeffries,at.the government argues stenberg merely examined the specific factual record before the court,and thus a health exception is only required when a banned procedure is actually necessary,in appropriate medical judgment,for the preservation of the health of the mother.stenberg,at.internal quotations omitted.plaintiffs,in contrast,contend that where substantial medical authority supports the proposition that banning a particular abortion procedure could endanger women health,casey requires the statute to include a health exception when the procedure is necessary,in appropriate medical judgment,for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.stenberg,at.quoting casey,at.quoting roe wade,d.
the government argues that stenberg embodies a lenient standard,and further urges that congressional factfinding must be afforded deference under turner broadcasting fcc,d turner i,and turner broadcasting fcc,d turner ii.the government contends that because in its opinion congress is afforded deference in factfinding as a general proposition,the district court adoption of the substantial medical authority standard amounts to an implicit overruling of the turner line of cases.according to the government,the substantial medical authority standard must therefore be understood as,at most,a rule of decision in the absence of congressional findings,not as a basis for disregarding such findings.br.of appellant at.the government argument,however,fundamentally misconstrues the threshold issue,for our task lies not in identifying who gets to decide,but rather in identifying the precise question that must be answered.
the other end of the spectrum on potential readings of stenberg is exemplified by a recent decision in which the fourth circuit addressed stenberg health exception requirement standard in a case involving a state abortion statute.hicks,at.the fourth circuit held that stenberg established the health exception requirement as a per se constitutional rule.id.at.the court explained that t his rule is based on substantial medical authority from a broad array of sources recognized by the supreme court,and this body of medical authority does not have to be reproduced in every subsequent challenge to a partial birth abortion statute lacking a health exception,and therefore all statutes regulating abortion must contain a health exception.id.several district courts have,at least implicitly,taken this position as well.see,reproductive health servs.of planned parenthood nixon,d,womancare of southfield,granholm,d,summit med.assocs.siegelman,d,daniel underwood,d.
we agree with the fourth circuit that stenberg establishes a per se constitutional rule in that the constitutional requirement of a health exception applies to all abortion statutes,without regard to precisely how the statute regulates abortion.see heed,at applying stenberg to parental notification law.as the ninth circuit recently explained any abortion regulation must contain adequate provision for a woman to terminate her pregnancy if it poses a threat to her life or her health.wasden,at.while stenberg health exception rule undoubtedly applies to all abortion statutes,such a proposition does not explain how to evaluate whether a given restriction poses a constitutionally significant threat to the mother health.
we believe the appropriate question is whether substantial medical authority supports the medical necessity of the banned procedure.see stenberg,at.id.at,concurring see also planned parenthood fed of am.ashcroft,d,abortion fed ashcroft,d,carhart,d at.the stenberg court determined medical necessity as that term was used in casey does not refer to an absolute necessity or to absolute proof.stenberg,at.rather,appropriate medical judgment must embody the judicial need to tolerate responsible differences of medical opinion.id.recognition of this principle was driven by the court concern that the division of medical opinion about the matter at most means uncertainty,a factor that signals the presence of risk,not its absence.id.thus,when substantial medical authority supports the medical necessity of a procedure in some instances,a health exception is constitutionally required.in effect,we believe when a lack of consensus exists in the medical community,the constitution requires legislatures to err on the side of protecting women health by including a health exception.
in dissent,both justice kennedy and justice thomas criticized the stenberg majority for imposing what they believed was a high burden on legislatures.justice kennedy commented that by disagreeing with nebraska,the court was effectively r equiring nebraska to defer to carhart judgment,which was no different from forbidding nebraska from enacting a ban at all for it is now leroy carhart who sets abortion policy id.at.kennedy,dissenting.justice thomas characterized the majority opinion as requiring a health exception because there is a division of opinion among some medical experts id.at.thomas,dissenting quoting id.at.in other words,unless a state can conclusively establish that an abortion procedure is no safer than other procedures,the state can not regulate that procedure without including a health exception.id.thomas,dissenting.
although the stenberg majority did not believe the rule it announced gave individual doctors an absolute veto over legislatures,it emphasized that a health exception is required where substantial medical authority supports the medical necessity of a procedure.id.at.such language would be rendered essentially meaningless if we accepted the government reading of the case,a reading that would conform to neither the majority reasoning nor to the dissenters concerns.in sum,we conclude stenberg requires the inclusion of a health exception whenever substantial medical authority supports the medical necessity of the prohibited procedure.
having identified the proper question,we now turn to determining how this question should be answered.the government argues the turner line of cases requires courts to accord substantial deference to the predictive judgments of congress,and the sole obligation of reviewing courts is to assure that,in formulating its judgments,congress has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence.turner ii,at.quoting turner i,at.thus,under the government formulation,we would be bound by congress determination that a moral,medical,and ethical consensus exists that the practice of performing a abortion is never medically necessary,so long as this apparent factual determination is reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.
the government argument is predicated on an erroneous assumption that the substantial medical authority standard is a question of fact.while questions of law and questions of fact sometimes can be neatly separated,such questions are often intermingled and identified as mixed questions of fact and law.see,ornelas united states,d.whether a abortion is medically necessary in a given instance would be a question of fact for in any given instance it would be either true or false that a abortion is medically necessary.there may be conflicting expert opinions,but only one can actually be right in any given set of medical circumstances.in contrast,whether the record in a particular lawsuit reflects the existence of substantial medical authority supporting the medical necessity of such procedures is a question that is different in kind it asks only whether there is a certain quantum of evidence to support a particular answer,not which of the divergent opinions is ultimately correct.reviewing the record to determine if the evidence presented suffices to support the conclusion reached by the lower court is typically treated as a matter of law.see,howard massanari,cir applying de novo review of the social security commissioner conclusion despite prior district court review united states thompson,cir reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence de novo.we must,of course,examine the evidence,but the legal question inherent in this inquiry is whether such record evidence constitutes substantial medical authority in a given case.
this case differs slightly from the typical case in which we review the evidence to determine if the record is sufficient to support the lower court conclusion.under the substantial medical authority standard,our review of the record is effectively limited to determining whether substantial evidence exists to support the medical necessity of abortions without regard to the factual conclusions drawn from the record by the lower court or,in this case,congress.thus,stenberg created a standard in which the ultimate factual conclusion is irrelevant.under this standard,we must examine the record to determine if substantial medical authority supports the medical necessity of the banned procedures.if it does,then a health exception is constitutionally required.if the need for a health exception is not supported by substantial medical authority,by contrast,then the state is free to impose the restriction without providing a health exception.
we believe an example from the supreme court first amendment jurisprudence is instructive here.in new york times sullivan,d,the court held that the first amendment prohibits a public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with actual malice that is,with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.id.at.to meet this burden,the public official must show actual malice by clear and convincing evidence.see,campbell citizens for an honest gov t,cir.in bose consumers union of the united states,d,the court faced the question of whether federal rule of civil procedure a,which makes facts subject only to review for clear error,was the appropriate standard for reviewing a finding of actual malice.id.at.an individual state of mind is a question of historical fact and would thus normally be reviewed only for clear error.see,hickey reeder,cir holding that state of mind is a question of fact that is reviewed for clear error see also bose,at.noting that in herbert lando,d,the court had referred in passing to actual malice as ultimate fact.the court concluded,however,that the first amendment requires independent appellate review.the bose court explained that j udges,as expositors of the constitution,must independently decide whether the evidence in the record is sufficient to cross the constitutional threshold.id.at.the court further stated that independent inquiries of this kind are familiar under the settled principle that in cases in which there is a claim of denial of rights under the federal constitution,this court is not bound by the conclusions of lower courts,but will reexamine the evidentiary basis on which those conclusions are founded.id.at.internal quotations and alterations omitted.thus,despite the fact that an individual mental state is a question of pure historical fact,a determination of whether the record supports the finding of actual malice is a question of law.see,communications,connaughton,d mercer city of cedar rapids,cir see also bose,at.explaining the new york times rule emphasizes the need for an appellate court to make an independent examination of the entire record.the same reasoning applies here.while judges under bose must determine whether clear and convincing evidence of an individual state of mind exists in an effort to protect that individual first amendment rights,here we must examine the record to determine whether substantial medical authority supports the need for a health exception so as to guard against the denial of another constitutional right.
as a result,the government argument regarding turner deference is irrelevant to the case at hand.our review is based on the record and is guided,as described below,by the legal conclusions reached by the supreme court in prior cases.therefore,we need not address the government assertions that federal courts must defer to congressional factfinding.
courts engage in different types of factfinding,as the facts that they find can be either of an adjudicatory or legislative nature.see qualley int l,cir.adjudicatory facts are those relevant only to the particular parties involved in the case.united states gould,cir.classic examples are who did what,when,where,how and with what motive or intent.id.quoting kenneth davis,administrative law treatise,at.in contrast,legislative facts are those that have salience beyond the specific parties to the suit.qualley,at.the medical necessity of particular abortion procedures clearly falls into this latter category,as such procedures are either sometimes medically necessary or they are not the answer to this question does not vary from place to place or party to party while lower court conclusions drawn from the same body of evidence may vary from individual case to individual case,appellate courts can impose uniformity within their jurisdictions by according no deference to a lower court conclusions.indeed,adopting a deferential posture in such circumstances could lead to the absurd result where two district courts within the same circuit perhaps even within the same state might examine the same body of evidence and reach different conclusions as to the medical necessity of the abortion procedures,but we would be forced to affirm both because the question is a close one.see hope clinic ryan,cir en banc posner,dissenting,vacated and remanded,d see also lockhart mccree,d expressing doubt that legislative facts are reviewed deferentially because different courts can come to different conclusions from the same evidence.as judge easterbrook has cogently explained for the seventh circuit,the medical necessity of abortion must be assessed at the level of legislative fact,rather than adjudicative fact determined by more than district judges.only treating the matter as one of legislative fact produces the nationally uniform approach that stenberg demands.a woman.side women clinic newman,cir.the newman court recognized that f indings based on new evidence could produce a new understanding,and thus a different legal outcome but if the issue is one of legislative rather than adjudicative fact,it is unsound to say that,on records similar in nature,wisconsin law could be valid and indiana law invalid,just because different district judges reached different conclusions about the inferences to be drawn from the same body of statistical work.see also hope clinic,at en banc posner,dissenting.thus,although the seventh circuit prior to stenberg had affirmed a trial court decision upholding a abortion ban based on the trial court conclusion that abortions are never medically necessary,the supreme court vacated the decision without regard to the specific facts found by that particular trial court.see hope clinic,at.on remand,the seventh circuit held the state bans unconstitutional in agreement with the parties.see hope clinic ryan,en banc decision on remand b oth illinois and wisconsin have conceded that their statutes are unconstitutional under the approach the court adopted in stenberg.we agree with this assessment of stenberg significance.while we are hesitant to read too much into the supreme court decision to vacate and remand hope clinic,its decision,along with the seventh circuit comments regarding stenberg significance,is suggestive of a need to achieve constitutional uniformity through treatment of the issue as one of legislative fact.
in the specific context of a ban on abortions,we join the reasoning of the fourth circuit and some of the district courts that have treated stenberg as a per se constitutional rule.in stenberg,the court surveyed all of the available medical evidence including the formal district court record,the district court records from other abortion cases,amicus submissions,and some congressional records and determined that substantial medical authority supported the need for a health exception.t his body of medical authority does not have to be reproduced in every subsequent challenge to a partial birth abortion statute lacking a health exception.hicks,at.neither we,nor congress,are free to disagree with the supreme court determination because the court conclusions are final on matters of constitutional law.see,dickerson united states,d congress may not legislatively supersede our decisions interpreting and applying the constitution.city of boerne flores,d stell county bd.of,cir n o inferior federal court may refrain from acting as required by brown board of education even if such a court should conclude that the supreme court erred as to its facts or as to the law.and because the medical necessity of a health exception is a question of legislative fact,subsequent litigants need not relitigate questions the supreme court has already addressed.see,hicks,at citizen action edison township,cir weis,dissenting the constitutional f
