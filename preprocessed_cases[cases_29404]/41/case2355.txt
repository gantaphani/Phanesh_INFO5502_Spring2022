sterling widmark appeals a decision of the district court affirming the social security commissioner commissioner denial of benefits.an administrative law judge alj found widmark,though severely impaired,had the residual functional capacity rfc for the full range of light work.widmark argues that,in reaching his decision,the alj rejected the medical opinion of an examining physician without offering adequate reasons.widmark also claims the alj erred in using the guidelines in making his disability determination.
we have jurisdiction under,and we hold that the alj improperly rejected the examining physician opinion regarding widmark thumb.we also hold that this error made the alj use of the guidelines in his final disability determination improper.therefore,we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion 
widmark applied for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income on december,claiming disability with an onset date of may,due to back and neck pain.both applications were denied.
for a review hearing before an alj on april,widmark presented,among other evidence,a physical rfc assessment form,dated august,filled out by a state agency physician,who indicated that widmark had no manipulative limitations by checking a box on the standardized form.the physician noted that he had seen the report of another physician who previously examined widmark for his back injury but did not otherwise explain how he arrived at his conclusion about widmark manipulative ability.
following the hearing,the alj denied widmark application.widmark requested review.the appeals council granted widmark request and,by order dated august,remanded to the alj for further development of widmark subjective complaints.
on remand,widmark presented,among other evidence,a disability examination report,dated august,signed by delmar greenleaf,an orthopedist.greenleaf conducted a comprehensive orthopedic examination,during which he observed that widmark was able to do pincher grasp and make an okay sign and grasp and manipulate articles with his right hand,but he could not flex the interphalangeal joint of his right thumb.greenleaf concluded that,due to a past flexor tendon laceration,the range of motion in widmark right thumb was definitely abnormal.in the assessment form accompanying his report,greenleaf indicated that widmark thumb injury limited his ability to perform fine manipulation.
the alj once again denied widmark application for benefits.in determining widmark rfc,the alj found that widmark was physically restricted to light work activity on a sustained basis and was,therefore,unable to perform his past relevant work operating heavy machinery.the alj also found,however,that widmark suffered from no significant,documented nonexertional limitations and was thus able to perform the full range of light work.applying the guidelines to determine widmark final disability status,the alj concluded that widmark could engage in substantial gainful employment and,therefore,was not disabled as defined by the social security act.
the appeals council denied widmark request for review,making the alj decision the commissioner final decision.see.widmark appealed to the district court where,in august,united states magistrate judge janice stewart affirmed.this timely appeal followed.
we review de novo the district court order affirming the commissioner denial of benefits.we will overturn the commissioner decision if it is not supported by substantial evidence or is based on legal error.moisa barnhart,cir citations omitted.substantial evidence is relevant evidence which a reasonable person might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.young sullivan,cir citing richardson perales,d.while inferences from the record can constitute substantial evidence,only those reasonably drawn from the record will suffice.batson comm r of soc.sec,cir.
widmark argues that the alj erred in making his rfc determination by ignoring greenleaf opinion that his thumb injury limited his ability to do fine manipulation.
t he commissioner must provide clear and convincing reasons for rejecting the uncontradicted opinion of an examining physician t he opinion of an examining doctor,even if contradicted by another doctor,can only be rejected for specific and legitimate reasons that are supported by substantial evidence in the record.lester chater,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
as to whether the clear and convincing or specific and legitimate standard applies in widmark case,we note that the alj found only that n o other physician has cited any significant restrictions related to right thumb impairment.of course,the mere absence of a corroborating opinion can not in itself constitute a conflict among the medical opinions.but a fair reading of the record reveals that greenleaf opinion is inconsistent with the brief,conclusory opinion of the state agency reviewing physician,who indicated that widmark had no manipulative limitations by checking a box on a standardized rfc assessment form thus,the alj was required to provide specific,legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record before rejecting greenleaf opinion.see lester,at.
the alj offered three reasons for rejecting greenleaf medical opinion of widmark ability to do fine manipulation greenleaf himself had concluded widmark manipulation ability was not limited the record contained no other thumb opinion and widmark himself did not mention the injured thumb in connection with his disability claim.we hold that none of these reasons was legally adequate for rejecting greenleaf opinion.
first,to the extent the alj rejected greenleaf opinion based on his interpretation that greenleaf concluded that the claimant was not restricted as to grasping and manipulation with the hands,the decision was not supported by substantial evidence.while greenleaf report states that widmark can grasp and manipulate articles in his right and left hand,the same report,when viewed in its entirety,indicates that greenleaf found widmark ability to do fine manipulation was restricted.for example,greenleaf wrote that widmark interphalangeal joint on his right thumb was stuck in extension and would not flex at all and that widmark does have flaccid paralysis,tendon laceration and dysfunction of his right thumb.furthermore,on an evaluation chart accompanying the report,greenleaf indicated that the range of motion in the interphalangeal joint of widmark right thumb is zero degrees,he is entirely unable to bend it.finally,in the accompanying medical source statement of widmark ability to do physical activities,greenleaf indicated that widmark could only occasionally perform fingering and added the following note the flexor tendon laceration on right thumb limits his fine fingering abilities.thus,a thorough and fair reading of greenleaf report shows that he concluded widmark ability to do fine manipulation was limited by his thumb injury.any interpretation otherwise would not be supported by substantial evidence in the report.see edlund massanari,cir holding that the alj failed to provide substantial evidence for rejecting a psychologist examination report where,inter alia,the alj selectively focused on aspects of the report which tend ed to suggest.
the alj second reason for rejecting greenleaf opinion was that n o other physician has cited any significant restrictions related to right thumb impairment.this merely states a fact and does not and legitimately or that fact leads to the conclusion that greenleaf evaluation should be disregarded.
nor can this conclusion be supported by substantial evidence in the record.to reject greenleaf thumb opinion based on the absence of another thumb opinion in the record,the alj would have had to infer from this absence that widmark other examining physicians did not comment on any restriction in his ability to do fine manipulation because none existed.this inference would,in turn,require the further inference that it would be reasonable to expect widmark examining physicians to have tested the range of motion in his thumb.but such an inference can not reasonably be drawn from the rel
