background 
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to popoalii,the nonmoving party.from april to march,popoalii was incarcerated at the charles county department of corrections.she began complaining of headaches in february,for which she was eventually hospitalized at joseph health center where she was diagnosed with viral encephalitis.on march,popoalii was transferred from charles to the werdcc.while incarcerated at the werdcc,popoalii developed permanent blindness from complications of a condition known as cryptococcal meningitis.
cryptococcal meningitis is an uncommon fungal infection,primarily associated with hiv positive and individuals.while at the werdcc,popoalii was not hiv positive and had no known risk factors associated with the infection.permanent blindness is a rare complication of this infection.
the cause of popoalii infection remains unknown.her medical experts have opined that she never had viral encephalitis,which was the diagnosis she received before her transfer to the werdcc.her experts did not offer testimony as to specific acts by defendants that fell beneath a standard of care.her experts did state that,generally,earlier treatment may have prevented her blindness,but they could not say with any degree of medical certainty that particular failures or delays in care or any delays in obtaining her medical records caused popoalii blindness.
popoalii treatment by correctional staff at werdcc 
when popoalii first arrived at the werdcc,she was processed through the receiving and orientation unit.during intake,she gave her medical history and underwent a brief evaluation by medical personnel.mdoc officers play no role in the medical evaluation nor do they gather medical records.popoalii complained of headaches upon arrival,and mdoc defendant scott neagles instructed her to go to sick once daily opportunity for inmates to be seen by medical staff.
during a subsequent educational screening with mdoc defendant rebecca patterson,popoalii told patterson that her head hurt so badly that she could not answer questions and that she just wanted to lie down.patterson told popoalii that she did not have permission for a which allows a prisoner to stay in bed except for meals.popoalii responded by telling patterson just to take her to administrative segregation otherwise known as the hole so that she could lay down.patterson called a nurse and obtained permission to continue with the educational testing.
patterson also called mdoc defendant renee samm who came to talk to popoalii about her headache complaint.popoalii told samm that her head hurt and that she just wanted to lie down.samm called the receiving and orientation unit to inform them of popoalii headache complaint,but was told popoalii had just been in the medical unit and had not received a.popoalii continued to complain about headaches and that she could not continue the repeated that she just wanted to go to the hole so that she could lie down.samm wrote popoalii a conduct citation.popoalii was interviewed a few days later by mdoc defendant bruce sharp about this conduct violation.popoalii did not offer any statement about the incident nor did she specifically request medical attention at that time.
on march,three days after her arrival at the werdcc,popoalii was placed in administrative segregation by order of mdoc defendant mark trusty.trusty did not speak with or see popoalii but ordered her moved to administrative segregation based on sharp interview.prior to being placed in administrative segregation,popoalii had been seen by medical staff twice since her arrival.
two days later,popoalii screamed from severe back pain.mdoc defendant christina hancock called the medical unit and spoke to an unidentified nurse practitioner who told hancock that there was nothing wrong with popoalii.on march,during head count,hancock ordered popoalii to sit up so she could be counted.popoalii responded that she could not sit up because her head hurt too much.popoalii also began to hallucinate.popoalii eventually complied,but she was issued a conduct violation for the delay.she was interviewed by mdoc defendant stephen taylor for this conduct violation,but popoalii again made no statement during the interview.neither popoalii nor taylor remember whether she asked for medical attention.
that same day,mdoc defendant mary ann white conducted a disciplinary action hearing regarding popoalii conduct violations.white asked popoalii over the intercom if she wanted to participate,and popoalii responded that she did not.
on april,medical staff decided to transfer popoalii from administrative segregation to the transitional care unit tcu at that time,popoalii first reported that she could not see and that her head continued to hurt.mdoc officers were on duty in the tcu for security reasons but were not allowed to provide medical care to inmates.mdoc officers also are not told why an inmate is in the tcu.
often over the next few days,popoalii screamed loudly.mdoc defendants linda rose,thomas dunn,and james wilder told her to stop because she was disturbing other patients.popoalii spilled her food and was told that if she did not clean it up and stop screaming,she would be returned to administrative segregation.popoalii stated that she could not see her food at that time.
during this period of frequent screaming,popoalii received several more conduct violations.one violation was read to popoalii by mdoc defendant colin nichols who asked popoalii to sign the citation.popoalii stated that she wanted to sign the document,but she could not see it and that she had not been able to see for two days.mdoc defendant neagles interviewed popoalii about another conduct violation,and popoalii told neagles she could not see the violation well enough to sign it.on april,popoalii was sent back to administrative segregation for these conduct violations by the order of mdoc defendant william vallier.vallier never saw popoalii before issuing the transfer order.popoalii was cleared for transfer by one of the nurses in the tcu.
the day after she was transferred back to administrative segregation,neagles saw popoalii hitting her head on the wall of her cell,stumbling around and falling on her bed.he notified his supervisor and the mental health unit by filling out a suicide intervention form.he also called the medical unit to report the head banging.popoalii was moved to a padded cell in the mental health unit and placed on full suicide watch 
on april,popoalii was transferred from the padded cell back to the tcu.she was subsequently taken to the emergency room at audrain medical center.at the hospital she was diagnosed for the first time with cryptococcal meningitis and was eventually transferred to the university of missouri health center 
popoalii medical care at werdcc 
during intake at the werdcc in,popoalii reported her medical history to cms defendant nurse earl cox,including her recent hospitalization for viral encephalitis.popoalii told another unidentified nurse that she could not see.cox visited popoalii again a short while later when she complained of head pain.she told cox that she had a constant headache due to the encephalitis.cox evaluated her vital signs,which were normal,and gave her a restriction,which allowed her to stay in bed at all times except during medical care and meals.cox also told her to report to sick call for further evaluation.popoalii spoke to an unidentified nurse who gave her ibuprofen for her headache,which she continued to receive regularly during her stay at werdcc.
the next day cms defendant nurse marilyn meyer saw popoalii due to her severe headache.meyer assessed popoalii vital signs as within normal limits and examined popoalii pupils to verify that they were equal and reactive to light.meyer found popoalii to be alert,oriented and balanced.meyer noted that popoalii was uncomfortable,and she instructed popoalii to report to sick call for further care.
cms defendant nurse practitioner wendy hull saw popoalii on march,for a severe headache.popoalii told her that she had been previously hospitalized for viral meningitis,which was causing her headaches.hull assessed popoalii vital signs as within normal limits and provided her with a hour.hull saw popoalii again on april,when popoalii was admitted to the tcu for evaluation and observation.hull evaluated popoalii,as is required,before popoalii was transferred out of tcu back to administrative segregation.popoalii complained of a headache and hull gave her ibuprofen,but because popoalii vital signs were normal hull deemed popoalii medically fit for a transfer to administrative segregation.april,after popoalii was moved to a padded cell,hull again evaluated her.popoalii told hull that she could not see,and hull performed eye reflex tests and checked whether her eyes were equal and reactive to light.hull also tested popoalii neurological function and vital signs.hull remained with popoalii for an hour to observe her,during this time popoalii condition did not change or decline.
cms defendant nurse debbie welch saw popoalii for complaints of a headache on the morning of march.popoalii told welch that she had been recently discharged from the hospital with viral meningitis as opposed to encephalitis.welch took her vitals,checked that her pupils were equal and reactive to light,checked that her smile was equal on both sides and that she could grip,push and pull.welch saw that popoalii was uncomfortable and contacted cms defendant sripatt kulkanthorn to request a course of medical treatment.kulkanthorn prescribed ibuprofen,which welch administered.
cms defendant nurse carrie oliver evaluated popoalii on march,after popoalii complained of a severe headache.popoalii told oliver that she had recently had viral meningitis,and oliver had popoalii sign a release to obtain prior medical records.oliver also called defendant raymond bloomquist to come evaluate popoalii.bloomquist evaluated popoalii neck and found it was flexible.popoalii was responsive,coherent,and her vital signs were stable.bloomquist ordered ibuprofen for popoalii pain.bloomquist does not recall being aware of her reported history of encephalitis or meningitis,or that she was sensitive to light.according to bloomquist,had he known of the light sensitivity in conjunction with a history of encephalitis,it would have been a red flag.
cms defendant kulkanthorn met popoalii first on march,when welch consulted him about popoalii headaches.kulkanthorn prescribed ibuprofen.on april,kulkanthorn saw popoalii again for a scheduled appointment regarding her headaches,and she reported head pain and said that she had not been able to see for a couple of days.she reported a history of headaches and a recent diagnosis of viral encephalitis.kulkanthorn examined her head,neck,and eyes.her neurological exam was normal,and he placed popoalii in the tcu for observation.kulkanthorn encouraged more fluid intake and ordered a blood count he prescribed ibuprofen and a shot of visteril for the headache,and he ordered her to lie flat and to be placed on fall precaution because of her visual problems.
on april,popoalii was placed in a room for observation by cms defendant nurse teresa vanlandingham who assessed her skin,eyes,and vital signs as normal.cms defendant nurse vicki dixon observed popoalii during the early morning of both april and,and she assessed popoalii vital signs,neurological signs,eyes and facial movements as normal.dixon did note that popoalii began making noises and picking at things in the air.dixon refused a request from popoalii for pain medication once because it was not time to administer the medication,and dixon did not have permission to give extra medicine.
kulkanthorn saw popoalii again on april,and she still complained of headaches but could walk normally and put her chin to her chest.her eye movement and neurological function were normal.kulkanthorn attributed her headaches to her previously diagnosed encephalitis,poor vision,and depression.kulkanthorn reviewed popoalii medical records that her mother had faxed to the werdcc sometime on or before april,and he saw her encephalitis diagnosis and negative ct scan.he obtained results of new blood work and liver and thyroid tests.he ordered that popoalii remain in the tcu,but despite his order she was removed to administrative segregation on april by mdoc staff.on april,when kulkanthorn discovered popoalii had been removed to administrative segregation,he ordered that she be returned back to the tcu.when popoalii told kulkanthorn that she could not see any light,he requested a consultation with an ophthalmologist.on april,the opthalmologist evaluated popoalii complaints and recommended an immediate mri.popoalii was taken to a hospital for an mri and ct scan and was then correctly diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis.
motions to amend the complaint 
in april,popoalii filed this suit alleging that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to her serious medical needs in violation of her eighth amendment rights.pursuant to the district court scheduling order,any motion to amend the pleadings was to be filed on or before january.discovery closed september.
popoalii first requested to file an amended complaint on june,which was five months after the deadline for amending the pleadings.popoalii motion stated that she wanted to add additional counts and to add and dismiss some defendants.popoalii counsel argued popoalii illness had prevented identification of all proper claims and defendants.this motion did not include a copy of the proposed amended complaint.the district court denied this motion on june.
about a month later,on july,popoalii again requested to amend her complaint.the new motion to amend attached a proposed amended complaint to the motion as required by rule of the federal rules of civil procedure rule.the proposed amended complaint removed several defendants and added a negligence claim against cms and its employees.the district court held a teleconference on july,to discuss this second motion to amend.during this teleconference,the defendants objected to the amended complaint based on the timing of the amendment and the nature of the changes.the defendants argued that they would be unfairly prejudiced by an amendment so close to the discovery deadline.the district court informed popoalii that it would grant the motion provided that popoalii agreed to reimburse certain defense costs and fees.popoalii counsel declined this offer,and the court denied popoalii motion.
expert affidavit 
the district court scheduling order also required disclosure of expert witnesses by july.popoalii timely disclosed jerold dreyer.dreyer filed his expert report on june.in this report,consisting of a three paragraph letter,dreyer opined that despite her earlier diagnosis,popoalii never had viral meningitis,and that there was no significant effort on the part of the correctional institute to ascertain her prior medical diagnosis and condition.this resulted in the lack of appropriate care and led to the blindness of popoalii.
during his deposition dreyer testified that his june letter accurately and completely summarized his opinions in this case and that he had not prepared any other reports.he also testified that he had no specific criticisms of the defendants actions.further,dreyer acknowledged that even with appropriate treatment a patient with cryptococcal meningitis may nonetheless develop blindness.he testified that there were two ways cryptococcal meningitis could lead to pressure or a direct fungal invasion of the optic nerve.dreyer stated that only if
