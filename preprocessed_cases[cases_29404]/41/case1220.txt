lenscrafters,along with several other interstate optical companies and their national trade association,appeal the district court summary judgment upholding the constitutionality of a tennessee state statute,ann.c,which,as interpreted by the tennessee supreme court,essentially prohibits optical companies from leasing space to optometrists to perform eye exams in their retail eyewear stores.on appeal,lenscrafters claims that the provision violates the commerce,equal protection,and due process clauses of the united states constitution.for the following reasons,we affirm the summary judgment of the district court.
on april,tennessee code annotated section c was signed into law.this provision,the constitutionality of which is at issue in this case,provides that it is unlawful for any licensed optometrist to p ractice or offer to practice optometry in,or in conjunction with,any retail store or other commercial establishment where merchandise is displayed or offered for sale.at the time that the law was passed,proponents argued that the prohibition was necessary to upgrade the profession and to protect the relationship from interference by commercial interests.kenneth robinson,in his capacity as commissioner of the tennessee department of health and henceforth referred to as the state,claims that the law was enacted to prevent the harm that may occur if optometrists are subjected to the control of optical retail stores.
the plaintiffs in this case,collectively referred to as lenscrafters,argue that the statute was passed as a protectionist measure,aimed at preventing large retail stores from competing with local optometrists in the retail eyewear market.to support its claim,they point to tennessee optometric association documents that seemingly refer to a top secret campaign to rid tennessee of commercialism in discount optometric stores.lenscrafters also claims that the legislative history of the law suggests that the provision had discriminatory purposes since at least some members of the tennessee legislature criticized the bill at the time of its passage as lacking any public purpose.
lenscrafters generally prefers to provide shopping,whereby it leases space in its retail eyewear superstores to optometrists who perform eye exams.section c,as interpreted by the tennessee supreme court,essentially outlaws this practice.see lenscrafters,sundquist,holding that section c applies to businesses,such as lenscrafters,that primarily sell ophthalmic materials.consequently,lenscrafters claims that section c violates the commerce,equal protection,and due process clauses of the united states constitution because it allows optometrists to provide shopping while prohibiting optical companies from doing the same.
lenscrafters filed the original action challenging section c on february,in the district court for the middle district of tennessee.on august,the district court certified a question to the tennessee supreme court,seeking an interpretation of whether an entity engaged primarily in the business of selling lenses and frames is a retail store or other commercial establishment under section c.the tennessee supreme court,in an opinion entered on december,held that such establishments did fall within section c prohibition.see sundquist,at.in its opinion,the court noted that the statute applies only to care profession commercial entities,suggesting that optometrists are allowed to sell lenses and frames within their own practice.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
on january,the district court denied lenscrafters motion for summary judgment and granted the state motion for summary judgment,holding that section c does not violate the commerce clause,the equal protection clause,or the due process clause.the court rejected lenscrafters equal protection and due process challenges,finding that the statute was rationally related to a legitimate state interest,particularly in light of the united states supreme court rejection of similar challenges in williamson lee optical.the court also upheld the statute on the dormant commerce clause claim,holding that the statute was not discriminatory and did not impose a burden on interstate commerce clearly excessive to the putative benefits of the statute.on january,lenscrafters filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment under federal rule,requesting that the district court reconsider its finding that some of their exhibits were inadmissible hearsay.on february,the district court revised its evidentiary rulings on four exhibits,but refused to alter or amend its judgment.lenscrafters timely appealed the district court decision on march.
this court reviews de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.gribcheck runyon,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.a court considering a summary judgment motion considers the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
lenscrafters claims on appeal that the district court erred in holding that section c does not violate the dormant commerce clause,the equal protection clause,or the due process clause.we will address each claim in turn.
we first consider whether the district court erred in rejecting lenscrafters claim that section c is violative of the commerce clause.in short,lenscrafters claims that the challenged provision impermissibly discriminates against interstate commerce by giving tennessee optometrists a competitive advantage over their competitors in the retail eyewear market.
although the commerce clause is by its text an affirmative grant of power to congress,the clause has long been recognized as a limitation on the power of the states to enact laws imposing substantial burdens on such commerce.timber,wunnicke,d.this as the negative or dormant commerce states from advancing their own economic interests by frustrating the movement of articles of commerce into or out of the state.in analyzing the constitutionality of a statute under the dormant commerce clause,this court engages in a inquiry.first,we determine whether the statute directly burdens interstate commerce or discriminates against interests.res.fiscal court of magoffin county,cir.if the statute is found to be discriminatory,it is virtually per se invalid and the court applies the strictest scrutiny.or.waste,dep t of envtl.quality of the state of,d.if,on the other hand,the statute is not discriminatory,we proceed to the second step to determine whether the burdens on interstate commerce are clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits,at quoting pike bruce church,d.if the burdens are clearly excessive,then the statute violates the commerce clause.
the threshold question is whether section c is discriminatory.this court has noted that a statute can discriminate against interests in three different ways a facially,b purposefully,or c in practical effect,at citing wyoming oklahoma,d.the statute at issue here is not discriminatory on its face,so the only issues are whether the statute either purposefully,or in practical effect,discriminates against interests.
discriminatory purpose 
the burden of establishing that a challenged statute has a discriminatory purpose under the commerce clause falls on the party challenging the provision.hughes oklahoma,d.as this court has noted,w hen a party seeks to present circumstantial evidence of a discriminatory purpose pursuant to a dormant commerce clause challenge,it is the duty of that party to show the effect of that evidence on the challenged statute,at.lenscrafters claims on appeal that the district court erred in concluding that section c did not purposefully discriminate against optical stores,pointing to legislative history and documents from the optometrists trade association that proposed and guided the law through the state legislature.the state,however,argues that the legislative history demonstrates that the provision was intended to apply to both and optical retail stores,and that there was no discriminatory animus behin
