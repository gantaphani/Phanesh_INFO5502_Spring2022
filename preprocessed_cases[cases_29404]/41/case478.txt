opinion of the court 
this appeal arises from a challenge to the approval by the secretary of the united states department of health and human services the secretary or hhs of a amendment to pennsylvania state plan for administering its medicaid program.numerous private nursing facilities that provide services to medicaid recipients argue that the state plan amendment,or spa,violates title xix of the social security act,et the medicaid act or the act.specifically,they contend that the spa adjusted pennsylvania method for determining medicaid reimbursement rates to private nursing facilities for the fiscal year without considering quality of care,which they say violates a a section a,and without satisfying the public process requirements of a a section a.to remedy those alleged violations,plaintiffs invoke the administrative procedure act the apa and the supremacy clause of the constitution,and seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the secretary,the administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms collectively,the federal defendants,and the secretary of pennsylvania department of public welfare dpw or the state defendant the district court granted in part the defendants motions to dismiss,and then entered summary judgment in their favor on the remaining claims.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm those rulings in part and reverse them in part.
background 
factual and statutory background 
medicaid is a cooperative program that provides medical care to needy individuals.douglas indep.living ctr.of,d.states that choose to participate in the program are responsible for developing and implementing a state medicaid plan and have considerable control over the plan details and administration.pharmacists ass houstoun,cir en banc citing wilder.hosp.ass n,d.in order to qualify for federal funding,however,a state plan must comply with the requirements of the medicaid act.defining the requirements a state plan must satisfy for approval id.a providing for federal payments to each s tate which has a plan approved.those requirements include,among other things,the equal access provision of section a,which mandates that a state plan provide methods and procedures to assure that the state pays participating nursing facilities and other medicaid providers at rates that are consistent with efficiency,economy,quality of care,and adequate access to providers by medicaid beneficiaries.a a see.med.soc y,reynolds,cir explaining that section a is typically called the equal access provision.state plans must also satisfy section a of the act,which requires that rates of payment to hospitals and nursing facilities be determined using a public process similar to rulemaking.a a.
cms is the division of hhs tasked with ensuring that state plans comply with those and other requirements of the medicaid act.states must submit their proposed plans to cms,and the agency must review each plan,make a determination as to whether it conforms to the requirements for approval,a,and approve any plan which fulfills the conditions specified in the medicaid act,b.see also describing the submittal of state plans to cms.a state may later amend an approved plan,but any amendments must also be submitted to cms,and the agency must determine whether the amended plan continues to meet the requirements for approval.c i.states are required to amend their plans whenever necessary to reflect,among other things,m aterial changes in state law,organization,or policy,or in the state operation of the medicaid program.id.
pennsylvania has elected to participate in the medicaid program,and it has designated dpw as the single s tate agency responsible for creating and administering the state medicaid plan see a requiring states to establish or designate a single s tate agency to administer the plan.since,pennsylvania,in accordance with an approved state plan,has paid participating nursing facilities for services using an annual prospective payment rate often referred to as the rate.see prices will be set prospectively on an annual basis christ the king manor pennsylvania,since july,dpw compensated both public and private nursing facilities through its medicaid program under what is known as the payment system.dpw calculates the rate using a complex formula that produces an individualized per diem reimbursement rate for each facility based on the allowable costs incurred by facilities the acuity level of residents and other factors.see describing the p rice and ratesetting computations.see also at pennsylvania state plan.the rate is effective for one year,from july through the following june,and it is adjusted quarterly,based on resident acuity.a.
under that methodology,pennsylvania reimbursement rates to nursing facilities have risen steadily each year,and,beginning in,the state grew concerned that the pace of that inflation was creating unsustainable costs.in june,dpw announced that reimbursement rates had increased by over the previous five years,and that,unless rates were somehow limited,there would be insufficient funds available to make payments to medicaid nursing facilities in accordance with the existing payment methodology.bull.june.therefore,after soliciting public comments and receiving input from pennsylvania medical assistance advisory committee dpw proposed using a budget adjustment factor,or baf,to slow the increasing rates.
as it has come to be used in pennsylvania,a baf is a fraction by which each provider payment rate is multiplied,thereby reducing the reimbursement rate by a certain percentage.for example,if a rate of was multiplied by a baf of,the resulting reimbursement rate would be,or less than what was called for by the calculation.under the methodology proposed by dpw in,the size of the baf was to be dictated by the funds appropriated by the state legislature for payments to nursing facilities for the fiscal year.application of the baf would therefore cap payments to providers based on budget allocation decisions by the pennsylvania legislature.bull.for the fiscal year,the baf rate cap allowed payments to increase by from the previous year.although the baf reduces the rate for a given year,that does not necessarily mean that the adjusted rate will be less than it was the previous year.as described above,rates calculated using the methodology have steadily increased each year.if an annual increase is larger than the reduction imposed by the baf in that year,then rates can still increase in absolute terms.for example,if rates increased under the methodology by five percent from one year to the next,and then the baf reduced rates by three percent,there would still be an overall increase in rates from the previous year.
although dpw initially portrayed the baf as an interim measure,applicable only to the computation of payment rates for the fiscal year,bafs became a fixture of the state methodology.for each year between and,the pennsylvania legislature authorized the use of a baf,after which dpw submitted the baf to cms as a state plan amendment,and the agency approved the change.as a result,the rate calculated for each of those years was reduced by the amount defined in that year baf the rates were reduced by,the rates by,and the rates by,as compared to what the rates would have been without the application of the baf 
on june,two days before the prior legislative authorization for a baf was set to expire,dpw issued a public notice and request for comment announcing the state intent to authorize the continued use of a budget adjustment factor in calculating nursing facility payment rates.bull.june,the june notice.the june notice explained that the continued use of a baf would ensure that the aggregate increase in the statewide average payment rate does not exceed the percentage rate of increase permitted by the funds appropriated for nursing facility services.id.it defined the formula for calculating the baf,which,as in years to,was determined by the amount the legislature allocated for nursing facility reimbursements.the june notice also projected that for fiscal year the baf would be,meaning that the per diem rates under the method would be decreased by from what they would have been without the application of the baf.id.that projection was based on the funds allocated for nursing facility services in the governor proposed budget.
a week later,on july,the pennsylvania legislature passed act.stat.ann.iii.as if the bureaucratese were not already painfully thick in this field,the act directed dpw to apply what it called a revenue adjustment neutrality factor,which is another term for a baf,in each fiscal year between july,and june.stat.ann.iii a.act also codified the methodology announced in the june notice,and provided that the revenue adjustment neutrality factor shall limit the estimated aggregate increase in the s tatewide average payment rate to the amount permitted by the funds appropriated by the general appropriations act for those fiscal years.id.translation the baf would continue to cap annual rates at the amount pennsylvania decided it could afford to pay.on the same day,the legislature enacted the general appropriations act for fiscal year,which appropriated slightly more funds for nursing facility services than had been called for in the governor proposed budget.soon after those enactments,dpw published another notice and request for comment regarding provider rates.bull.july,the july notice.the july notice announced that dpw had calculated proposed annual per diem rates for,and that,c ontingent on cms approval,it would apply a baf to those rates.id.
on september,dpw submitted a proposed baf for,designated as spa,to cms for approval in a brief cover letter accompanying the spa,dpw explained that its purpose was to authorize the continued use of the budget adjustment factor baf for nursing facility payment rates for the rate year.at.the letter described the formula for calculating the baf,and said that the baf produced by this formula for rate year is.at.it further explained that the baf served to moderate the growth of nursing facility payment rates consistent with the fiscal resources of the commonwealth,while still providing payment rate increases sufficient to assure that consumers will continue to have access to medically necessary nursing facility services.at.finally,the letter assured cms that pennsylvania had provided advance notice of its intent to amend its state plan by publishing public notices in the pennsylvania bulletin.at.with the cover letter,dpw submitted to cms a spa submittal form,a chart showing that the total cost of the state medicaid program was within the regulatory limits copies of the june and july notices,and a description of the methods and standards used to calculate the per diem payment rates.that description did not explain the basis for the particular baf proposed for but rather referred to pennsylvania statutory provisions defining the method and explained the use of bafs generally.no other information regarding the reasons behind the new baf,or its anticipated effect on care,was included in dpw initial submission.
in november,dpw published a public notice that included the information it had provided to cms.bull,the november notice.the november notice announced that,based on the amounts appropriated by the state legislature,the baf for the fiscal year would be.id.that baf was the same as stated in the spa,but it differed from the estimate included in the june notice because of the disparity between the governor proposed budget and the one the legislature actually passed,which increased appropriations to nursing facilities slightly.still,the proposed baf represented the largest downward adjustment to the rate calculation since pennsylvania had introduced bafs,reducing each nursing facility proposed per diem rate by application of the baf to the rates meant that,on average,provider payments would be one percent higher in fiscal year than they had been in fiscal year,due to the continuing increase in per diem rates under the methodology 
meanwhile,cms was reviewing spa.keith leuschner,the cms employee responsible for reviewing pennsylvania spas,contacted dpw in november to clarify what effect the spa would have on the federal dollars flowing to pennsylvania.in particular,leuschner was concerned because the form dpw submitted with its spa showed negative numbers in the federal budget impact box for fiscal years and,which suggested that nonpublic nursing facilities would be paid less under the amended plan than if the state continued using the existing payment methodology.at.leuschner asked dpw if that was the case,and the agency responded that the numbers on the form were actually incorrect,and that nonpublic nursing homes were going to be paid more under the proposed rate methodology for state year than they would have been paid if the existing rate structure were not changed.at.to demonstrate that assertion,dpw provided a spreadsheet,which leuschner understood to be comparing the rates for the fiscal year calculated under pennsylvania proposed methodology with those calculated in accordance with the methodology pennsylvania had in place under the existing and at that time approved method.at.leuschner concluded that the total payments to private nursing homes were estimated to increase slightly during federal fiscal years and under the proposed spas,and so recommended proceeding with approval.at.cms made a few pen and ink changes to the transmittal form to correct the federal budget impact numbers at,and,on december,it approved the spa.in doing so,it specifically certified that the spa conformed with the requirements of section a and section a,and retroactively made the spa effective date july,
in march,dpw published a final public notice announcing the finalized annual per diem payment rates,after the application of the baf,for private nursing facilities for.bull.it then sent letters to all participating nursing facilities to notify them of their final individualized rates.
procedural history 
following dpw publication of the final payment rates,plaintiffs filed timely state administrative appeals with dpw bureau of hearings and appeals the bha challenging those rates and asking that dpw recalculate them consistent with the law.administrative appeal,doc,ex.a,at.see giving bha exclusive jurisdiction over provider appeals allowing a provider that is aggrieved by an agency action to appeal and obtain review of that action by the bha by filing a request for hearing.they claimed that dpw had violated the medicaid act and its own regulations by providing inadequate notice of and public process for the proposed rate changes,by retroactively setting the rates,and by failing to provide cms with any information on which that agency of the federal government could base its conclusion that spa satisfied section a requirements.in particular,plaintiffs alleged that there was no evidence of any consideration of the spa effect on quality of care.
in october,with those state administrative appeals pending,plaintiffs filed the present action in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania,bringing claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against the secretary of hhs,the administrator of cms,and the secretary of dpw.specifically,the complaint asserted a claim under the apa against the federal defendants,seeking to have hhs approval of spa set aside as being contrary to law.the complaint also included a claim under the supremacy clause against the state defendant,seeking to bar the application of spa in the determination of payment rates.those claims were primarily based on the federal and state defendants alleged violations of section a and section a in their development and approval of the state plan amendments.
both the federal and the state defendants filed timely motions to dismiss plaintiffs claims.the federal defendants argued that the apa claim was barred by sovereign immunity,but the district court disagreed,concluding that the claim fell within the scope of the waiver of federal sovereign immunity provided for in the apa it therefore denied the federal defendants motion to dismiss.the state defendant motion raised three independent bases for dismissal the abstention doctrine described in younger harris,mootness,and eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.the district court granted the motion in part.it abstained from deciding the supremacy clause claim insofar as it related to conduct occurring prior to cms approval of the proposed amendments,as those issues could be adequately addressed in the ongoing state administrative proceeding.christ the king manor,sebelius,cv,at.june,slip op.it also dismissed the request for declaratory relief on immunity grounds,explaining that,if it were to issue a declaratory decree to the effect that state defendant implementation of the spa violated federal law,the decree could have res judicata effect in the state administrative appeals process,which would leave to the state system only a form of accounting proceeding whereby damages or restitution would be computed.id.at quoting green mansour,d.the district court held that the case was not moot,however,and it did not dismiss plaintiffs claim for injunctive relief regarding the continuing application of the amended state plan.
the parties proceeded to discovery,and subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment on the remaining claims.the district court granted the federal and state defendants motions on july,holding that,g iven the regulatory framework and the deference afforded agency,there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the secretary approval of the spas under s ection a.christ the king manor,sebelius,cv,wl,at.july.it further held that cms could properly conclude that dpw had substantially complied with the public process requirements of section a.id.at.the court therefore found that hhs approval of spa was not arbitrary or capricious,and that the state defendant implementation of the spa was proper.id.at.accordingly,it denied plaintiffs motion and entered judgment for the defendants.id.at.this timely appeal followed,in which plaintiffs appeal both the grant of summary judgment and the earlier partial dismissal of plaintiffs claim against the state defendant.
on appeal,plaintiffs ask that we reverse the district court orders and enter judgment in their favor on all counts.they repeat their contention that hhs approval of spa as well as dpw implementation of it,violates federal law,specifically sections a and a of the medicaid act.they also argue that their claim against the state defendant can be addressed in this proceeding and should be resolved in their favor.this appeal therefore presents two distinct issues first,whether the federal defendants approval of spa was proper under the apa,and,second,what relief,if any,plaintiffs can obtain from the state defendant in this suit.
apa claim against the federal defendants 
plaintiffs argue that hhs approval of spa was improper for two reasons first,they say that there was insufficient evidence in the administrative record to support any conclusion that the spa satisfies section a of the medicaid act.discussed in more depth below,that provision requires that a state plan provide methods and procedures necessary to assure that payments to providers are consistent with efficiency,economy,quality of care,and adequate access to providers.a a.plaintiffs note that spa categorically reduced by more than nine percent the per diem payments which are called for by the state own calculation,and which are represented by the state as reflecting what is necessary and reasonable for an efficiently and economically operated nursing facility to provide services to medicaid residents.they say that the arbitrary reduction imposed by the spa threatens the quality of care provided to medicaid recipients,yet the administrative record is silent as to the defendants consideration of the quality of care factor.appellants opening br.at.therefore,they contend,hhs improperly concluded that the amended state plan satisfies section a.plaintiffs second contention is that hhs erred in concluding that dpw had satisfied the public process requirements of section a.more particularly,they say that the only public notice published before the spa effective date failed to comply with federal regulations regarding the content of such notices.
the district court rejected both lines of argument.according significant deference to hhs interpretations of the medicaid act,the court held that the record was sufficient to support the secretary approval of the spa.christ the king manor,wl,at.for the reasons elaborated herein,we disagree in part.although we agree with the district court that we must defer to hhs reasonable interpretations of the medicaid act,and that dpw satisfied the public process requirements of section a,we part ways when it comes to the district court decision that hhs could properly conclude on the evidence before it that spa complies with section a.our conclusion is,to the contrary,that hhs approval of the spa was arbitrary and capricious,and must be set aside.

the agency action at issue here is hhs approval of pennsylvania spa,which plaintiffs argue was arbitrary and capricious because there was insufficient evidence in the administrative record that,as required by section a,dpw had considered the spa impact on quality of care,or that it had followed the public process requirements of section a.in so arguing,plaintiffs implicitly take issue with hhs interpretation of the medicaid act.by approving spa,hhs evidently concluded that pennsylvania amended state plan satisfies the requirements of sections a and a of the act.see a requiring the secretary to make a determination as to whether the submitted plan conforms to the requirements for approval.to reach that conclusion,the agency had to determine what those requirements entail,which involves interpreting the relevant provisions.therefore,we must establish at the outset whether to accord chevron deference to agency interpretations of the medicaid act inherent in hhs approval of a state plan amendment see chevron,natural res.def.council,d barring a court from substitut ing its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.
under the supreme court decision in united states mead,administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for chevron deference when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority,d.as the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit recently explained,the supreme court a rguably has already concluded that spa approvals meet that standard,and thus are entitled to chevron deference.managed pharmacy care sebelius,cir.in douglas independent living center of southern california,the supreme court said that t he medicaid act commits to the federal agency the power to administer a federal program,and that,in approving a spa,the agency has acted under that grant of authority,d.the douglas court noted that the agency approval carries weight,especially when the language of the particular provision at issue is broad and general,suggesting that the agency expertise is relevant in determining its application.id.although the court stopped short of explicitly holding that the chevron framework applies to spa approvals,those statements in dicta strongly suggest as much,and we do not view them lightly.galli meadowlands comm n,cir alteration and internal quotation marks omitted see also id.to ignore what we perceive as persuasive statements by the supreme court is to place our rulings in peril.
in addition to that suggestion from the supreme court,some of our sister circuits have held that spa approvals are the type of agency action entitled to chevron deference under mead,and no circuit court precedent holds to the contrary.in managed pharmacy care,for example,the ninth circuit concluded that congress explicitly granted the secretary authority to determine whether a state medicaid plan complies with federal law,and that i t is well within the secretary mandate to interpret the statute via spa adjudication.at.similarly,the circuit has held that,through express delegation of interpretive authority,congress manifested its intent that the secretary determinations,based on interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions,should have the force of law.pharm.research mfrs.of am.thompson.in short,the reasoning goes,the chevron framework applies to spa approvals.id.at see also managed pharmacy care,at chevron applies to spa approvals harris olszewski,cir t he agency approval of the state plan amendment is entitled to chevron deference.
we agree.the medicaid act expressly states that the secretary must approve any plan which fulfills the conditions specified in the statute.b.through that provision,congress delegated to the agency the responsibility to make interpretive decisions regarding which state plans satisfy the act requirements.those decisions carry the force of law,as hhs is prohibited from making payments to states whose plans do not comply with the act,and the state must pay for medicaid services using rates determined in accordance with methods and standards specified in an approved state plan,i.see cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d applying the chevron framework because a statute gave an agency the authority to promulgate binding legal rules citing mead,at.spa approvals are therefore the type of agency action that warrants chevron deference under mead.
with that in mind,we turn to hhs approval of spa,given the strictures of section a and section a.
compliance with section a 
section a requires that a state medicaid plan 
provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of,and the payment for,care and services available under the plan as may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care and services and to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.
a a emphasis added.put more simply,it mandates that a state plan include methods and procedures that assure that payments to providers produce four outcomes efficiency,economy,quality of care,and adequate access to providers by medicaid beneficiaries.pharmacists ass n,at quoting a a.section a is one of the statutory prerequisites a state plan must satisfy to receive federal approval,and thus federal funding.see a defining the requirements that a state plan must satisfy id.b the secretary shall approve any plan which fulfills the conditions specified in subsection a of this section.
we have considered section a requirements on two previous occasions.in rite aid of pennsylvania houstoun,we held that it mandates substantive compliance with the four specified factors,but it does not impose any particular method or process for getting to that result.at.rather,in contrast to an earlier and provision of the medicaid act known as the boren amendment,which specifically requir ed that states take into account certain findings and make particular assurances section a leaves it up to a state how it will assure the required outcomes.id.at.nonetheless,we said that the state process of in setting a rate methodology must be reasonable and sound,id.at,and budgetary considerations may not be the sole basis for a rate revision,id.at.in pennsylvania pharmacists association houstoun,we again interpreted section a,this time for the purpose of determining whether it granted medicaid providers a cause of action under s.at.in holding that it does not,we explained that section a,unlike the boren amendment,does not demand that payments be set at levels that are sufficient to cover provider costs,but instead requires that they be sufficient to meet recipients needs.id.at.therefore,under this court existing jurisprudence,section a allows states to set a rate methodology using any process that is reasonable,considers more than simply budgetary factors,and results in payments that are sufficient to meet recipients needs.
but while those prior interpretations help guide our analysis,they do not necessarily control the outcome here.under chevron,if hhs applied a different but nonetheless permissible interpretation of section a,then we must defer to that interpretation,even if it conflicts with our precedent.as the supreme court has made clear,a judicial precedent can not displace a conflicting agency construction unless the statute unambiguously forecloses the agency interpretation.see brand x,at.the question before us is therefore whether hhs approval of spa was based on a permissible construction of section a,not whether the spa satisfies our prior interpretation of the statute.managed pharmacy care,at deferring to hhs interpretation of section a instead of applying the court prior interpretation of that provision.
to answer that question,we must consider the basis hhs had for concluding that section a is satisfied,which requires that we examine the record it had before it during the spa approval process.rite aid,at i n reviewing section a issues a court must confine itself to the agency administrative record.that record is remarkably thin,especially when compared to the administrative records developed in other section a challenges.in rite aid,for example,the state amended reimbursement rates to pharmacies after conducting cost studies of pharmacy pricing data,considering input from interested parties,seeking additional data on the reimbursement rates of payors,and comparing pennsylvania rates to the rates in neighboring states.id.at see also,long term care pharmacy alliance ferguson,cir noting that the state agency revised rates after it held hearings and sought data from massachusetts pharmacies as to their costs of acquisition of individual drugs.here,on the other hand,there is no indication in the record as to how pennsylvania settled on the particular methodology proposed in spa.although dpw explained that the baf was intended to limit payments to the amount appropriated by the state legislature,that explanation is the same as the one offered for bafs overall.it reveals nothing about how the particular baf proposed in spa which differed from the ones imposed in years past and required independent approval was selected,other than that it was based on legislative appropriations for that fiscal year.absent information on how the appropriated amount was determined,or a reasoned explanation for why that amount allows for rates that are consistent with efficiency,economy,quality of care,and adequate access,dpw description of the baf methodology provides no insight into whether the spa complies with section a.the state gave no such information,and hhs did not request any.there are no studies or analyses of any kind in the record,and the only data dpw provided was a spreadsheet comparing rates under the proposed spa with those paid the previous year.hhs therefore had to base its approval decision solely on the proposed methodology itself,a comparison to the previous year rates,and dpw unsupported assertion that the new baf would permit payment rate increases sufficient to assure that consumers will continue to have access to medically necessary nursing facility services.at.
notwithstanding the sparseness of the administrative record,the federal defendants argue that it supports the secretary approval of spa.specifically,they say that hhs could properly conclude that the spa satisfies section a for three reasons first,payments to nursing facilities increased slightly from the previous fiscal year under the proposed spa,second,pennsylvania had previously employed bafs without harming quality of care,and,third,other statutory provisions independently assure that medicaid recipients will receive quality care.the federal defendants focus particularly on the overall increase in payments,emphasizing that the budget adjustment factor did not cut payment rates in absolute terms,but rather served to moderate the rate of increase in provider payments under the system and thereby avoid an unsustainable pace of inflation.br.at.
but while that assertion is undisputed,and reducing unsustainable inflation is certainly a laudable and entirely legitimate state objective,the small absolute increase in payments from to reveals practically nothing about spa compliance with section a.as the federal defendants acknowledge,that increase is due to the application of the methodology,which has been in place since.an essential premise of their argument seems to be that the method results in payments that are unduly high,and that do not in fact reflect the necessary costs of providing care to medicaid recipients.that may be the case,but there is no evidence of it anywhere in the record,and dpw never suggests that the state underlying methodology is flawed.rather,the state repeatedly explains that it must reduce the rates for budgetary reasons,not because they are based on a methodology that overcompensates providers.
the method sets per diem rates for each nursing facility by considering,among other things,the projected acuity level of medicaid recipients and the costs which are necessary and reasonable for an efficiently and economically operated nursing facility to provide services to those patients.in other words,it determines payments by considering the costs of providing care to medicaid recipients,which means that the increase in payment rates is due,at least in part,to increasing costs.the contested spa does not change that aspect of the rate calculation methodology it just adds one last step using a baf to reduce the final per diem rates.the overall increase in payments therefore tells us nothing about the spa effect on quality of care it just shows that the cost of caring for medicaid recipients as determined under the methodology continues to go up.
to demonstrate that point,we need only look to dpw proposed rate revisions for.the baf initially proposed for the fiscal year would have allowed rates to increase two percent from the previous year twice the increase allowed by the baf.after interested parties raised numerous criticisms about the proposed change,the legislature appropriated additional funds and the baf was revised to allow for a increase in rates.bull.dpw explained that the adjustment in the cap addressed quality of care concerns,and thus dpw effectively acknowledged that rates can increase in absolute terms while still being inadequate to meet recipients needs.id.at.
in reviewing spa,however,hhs not only treated the absolute increase as sufficient assurance of quality of care it also seemed to misunderstand the spa effect on pennsylvania rate calculation methodology.based on a spreadsheet showing the one percent increase in payments from the previous year,the cms employee responsible for reviewing the spa concluded that rates would be higher under the spa than they would have been if the existing rate structure were not changed,in effect concluding that the spa was responsible for the rate increase.at.but that can not be the case,as the only change proposed in the spa was the use of a baf that more substantially reduced the rates than in any previous year.see supra note.moreover,under the previously approved state plan,bafs were authorized only through,meaning that the approved method did not involve the use of any baf for the fiscal year.rates were therefore projected to increase in despite the proposed spa,not because of it.
pennsylvania previous use of bafs also provides no assurance that payments under spa would be consistent with quality of care.according to the federal defendants,because pennsylvania had already employed a budget adjustment factor in three previous fiscal years br.at without causing any apparent issues with quality of care or beneficiary access to services id.at,hhs could reasonably conclude that spa was likewise compliant with section a id.they emphasize that,even with ongoing monitoring activities,hhs had not been made aware of any complaints by beneficiaries or nursing facilities about payments made pursuant to the baf system.id.they further note that federal regulations permit hhs to approve a state plan amendment on the basis of policy statements and precedents previously approved by the agency.b.therefore,they argue,hhs could reasonably conclude that the proposed amendment,which employed a substantially similar methodology to the one taken the previous three years,was likewise compliant with section a.br.at.
the obvious flaw in that argument is that earlier adjustments do not reveal how a later and different adjustment may change a system already affected by the earlier adjustments.the fifth blow to a boxer chin may be no more forceful than the previous four,but still be forceful enough to shatter a weakened jaw.and if the fifth blow is more forceful,a no worries mindset is even less warranted.the fiscal year adjustment of is not necessarily the same in its impact as the adjustment that was proposed for.
the federal defendants portray the continued use of bafs generally as the key change proposed by spa,and they treat bafs as simply another variable in the methodology.just as provider costs and resident acuity vary year to year under the approved formula,so too does the baf,they imply.but a baf is not simply a variable in an approved formula each new baf effectively establishes a new formula by which final rates are calculated,and hence is a m aterial change to the state plan that requires its own approval.see c ii requiring a state to amend its plan when necessary to reflect m aterial changes in the state operation of the medicaid program.depending on what the state legislature decides,a baf could cut per diem rates by less than five percent,as it did in,or by nine percent,as spa proposed,or potentially by even more.yet under the federal defendants reasoning,the use of any baf,regardless of its size,could be justified by the fact that a previous,smaller adjustment to the rate proved acceptable.that conclusion is unsupported and unsupportable.a baf is at base simply a cut to provider payments,and the size of that cut matters to medicaid recipients and providers.although it may be possible to decrease payments by nine percent,as spa does,and not affect quality of care,it is also very possible that care will be significantly and negatively affected,and the success of earlier cuts does not suggest otherwise.it is simply not reasonable to conclude that,because prior cuts did not seem too painful,a deeper cut would not hurt.
that leaves independent statutory assurances as the only basis,beyond dpw bare assertion that consumers will still have access to medicaid services,upon which hhs could conclude that the methodology of spa will produce payments that are consistent with quality of care.it is true,as the federal defendants note,that we have previously considered it reasonable for a state to rely upon laws or regulations which independently ensure quality care when setting payment rates under section a.rite aid,at.seizing upon that statement,the federal defendants describe provisions of the nursing home reform act,that allow for oversight and inspection of nursing facilities and require certification that participating facilities satisfy certain quality of care standards.br.at citing those provisions.they also note that in pennsylvania instructed nursing facilities that they have an obligation to provide appropriate,care that exists independent of any particular payment rate or any features of the methodology.id.quoting.bull,internal quotation marks omitted.based on our holding in rite aid,the federal defendants contend that hhs could have reasonably relied upon such independent assurances of quality of care when it approved spa.
those assurances can not be the sole basis for a rate revision,however,or section a quality of care component and hhs review of that component would be rendered meaningless.in rite aid,independent statutory assurances were but one feature of an ample record.see at describing the studies conducted.we never suggested that,as long as states declare their insistence on quality care under other statutory provisions,reimbursement rates will be deemed to satisfy section a.such an interpretation of section a not only defies its plain language and nullifies hhs review process under that provision,see erie cnty.geriatic ctr.sullivan,cir declining to interpret the medicaid act in a manner that renders hhs review hardly more than ministerial,it also ignores fiscal realities by implying that a state can continue to assure quality of care by holding nursing homes to high standards while simultaneously underfunding them.in short,simply passing a statute saying that nursing homes will provide quality care does not make it so.section a can not reasonably be interpreted to mean that once a state has declared its commitment to quality of care,it need not consider that factor in setting its reimbursement rates.
nor is a state unsupported assertion that its plan meets section a requirements,without any accompanying explanation or evidence,a sufficient basis to support hhs approval.in approving a state plan,hhs must be able to conclude that the plan provide s such methods and procedures as may be necessary to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care.a a.it is true that section a grants states considerable latitude in selecting a method for calculating reimbursement rates,and that it does not impose any particular method or process for meeting its substantive requirements.rite aid,at.but that latitude is not limitless.the reimbursement rates that states select affect the funding they are entitled to receive from the federal government,and material changes to those rates are thus subject to federal approval.section a gives teeth to the approval process,allowing hhs to reject state plans that provide inadequate assurance that payments will be consistent with efficiency,economy,quality of care,and adequate access.see c providing that cms,with hhs approval,retains authority for determining that proposed plan material is not approvable or that previously approved material no longer meets the requirements for approval.and hhs has done so before,denying approval to state plan amendments when states provide no data to substantiate their proposed rates,alaska dep t of health soc.servs.ctrs.for medicare medicaid servs,cir,or when they provide unsupported assertions of compliance with section a,minnesota ctrs.for medicare medicaid,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
if we were to hold that dpw bare assertion is sufficient to satisfy section a,we would make that provision a dead letter.the medicaid act requires that hhs approve any plan which fulfills the conditions imposed on state plans.b.therefore,in order for hhs to deny approval on section a grounds,a plan must fail to fulfill its conditions.if a state could satisfy those conditions simply by asserting that it has done so,then hhs would lack the authority to disapprove a plan due to a state lack of data or its unsupported assertions.no court has countenanced such an interpretation of section a.on the contrary,in holding that section a confers no private right of action against the state under,courts have repeatedly assured medicaid providers and recipients that the quality of care and access requirements will not go unenforced because hhs is responsible for ensuring that state plans are administered in accordance with these requirements.pharmacists ass n,at see also long term care pharm.alliance ferguson,cir of course,the secretary of hhs can enforce compliance with section a and implementing regulations by disapproving a state plan.there is no suggestion in the text,its accompanying regulations,or the legislative history that hhs oversight role in enforcing section a requirements involves simply accepting a state assertions at face value.see b requiring the secretary to approve plans that fulfill the conditions specified in subsection a,which include section a c requiring p rompt submittal of amendments s o that cms can determine whether the plan continues to meet the requirements for approval cong.rec.explaining that,even with the repeal of the boren amendment,the medicaid act ensures through section a that states provide adequate reimbursement.therefore,to the extent that hhs approval of a spa rests on such an interpretation,it is not a permissible construction of the statute entitled to deference under chevron.at 
of course,as the federal defendants rightly note,there is a bit more in the record in this case than the state assertion that spa would still provid e payment rate increases sufficient to assure that consumers will continue to have access to medically necessary nursing facility services.at.there is also data,in the form of the spreadsheet dpw submitted at hhs request,showing that payments to nonpublic nursing facilities would increase from the prior fiscal year.br.at.but,as described above,that increase does not,by itself,tell us or hhs anything about the spa effect on quality of care or access to providers so far as the record shows,pennsylvania decided to reduce its per diem rates to the amount that it could afford to pay,without taking any steps to ensure that payments would still be consistent with quality of care and adequate access.in approving that decision,hhs seems to have entirely failed to consider those important aspect s of section a.see state farm,at.indeed,the record suggests that the agency misunderstood the proposed changes and blessed the spa based solely on the absolute increase in payments from the previous year.there is no indication that the agency examine d the relevant data,nor did it articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.id.therefore,because we can not discern from the record a reasoned basis for the agency decision,we conclude that its approval of spa was arbitrary and capricious under the apa.
in so holding,we do not imply that the payments pennsylvania made to providers during the fiscal year were in fact inconsistent with any of section a requirements.it is possible that the state was able to adjust the per diem rates by nine percent while maintaining quality care and ensuring adequate access to providers.but it is also possible that the state nine percent adjustment threatened to harm care to medicaid recipients in ways that previous,smaller adjustments had not.the problem here is that,at least so far as the record shows,hhs did not actually determine which scenario it confronted,and thus we are obligated to set its approval decision aside.requiring courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency action found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law 
compliance with section a 
plaintiffs also contend that hhs approval of spa was arbitrary and capricious because the state failed to comply with the public process requirements of section a and its accompanying regulations.they say that,although dpw provided numerous public notices of its proposed changes,only the june notice was published before the spa effective date,and it inadequately described the new rate methodology and did not include certain details required by federal regulations.specifically,they complain that the notice was published only two days before the spa proposed effective date,did not include the specific baf ultimately adopted,failed to provide an estimate of the expected increase or decrease in aggregate expenditures,and did not identify any local agencies where copies of the proposed changes would be available for public review.because of those alleged deficiencies,they argue that hhs could not have lawfully accepted dpw assurance that pennsylvania had provided advance notice of its intent to amend its state plan.at.
section a of the medicaid act requires that states seeking to change their methodologies provide a public process under which 
i proposed rates,the methodologies underlying the establishment of such rates,and justifications for the proposed rates are published,
ii providers,beneficiaries and their representatives,and other concerned state residents are given a reasonable opportunity for review and comment on the proposed rates,methodologies,and justifications,and 
iii final rates,the methodologies underlying the establishment of such rates,and justifications for such final rates are published 
a a.in other words,a state must provide notice of proposed rates together with the methodologies and justifications used to establish those rates,and give concerned state residents a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on them.children seashore house waldman,cir.federal regulations provide further guidance on the substantive requirements of that notice.under,notice of a significant proposed change in a state methodology must d escribe the proposed change in methods and standards,g ive an estimate of any expected increase or decrease in annual aggregate expenditures,e xplain why the agency is changing its methods and standards,and i dentify a local agency where copies of the proposed changes are available for public review.a,c.section also provides that the notice must b e published before the proposed effective date of the change.id.d.those notice requirements must be satisfied in order for a state plan amendment to receive approval.id.h.
our review of the state compliance with section a is circumscribed by hhs decision to approve the spa.as the ninth circuit has explained,o ur duty is not to determine for ourselves whether the state notice sufficiently complied with the statute and regulations that duty is imposed on the secretary.indep.acceptance california,cir.we must instead consider,as we did with section a,whether the secretary acted arbitrarily or capriciously when she accepted the state assurance of notice as satisfactory to her.id.at.in doing so,we accord deference to the secretary reasonable interpretations of section a,see supra section,and we must give controlling weight to her interpretations of her own regulations unless they are inconsistent with the regulation or plainly erroneous.thomas jefferson shalala,d.
under that standard,we can not say that it was arbitrary or capricious for hhs to accept dpw assurance that it had provided adequate notice of the proposed changes to its ratecalculation methodology.section a speaks very generally,requiring simply that the state provide notice and a reasonable opportunity for comment on proposed rate revisions.a a.the june notice did so,as it put providers and beneficiaries on notice of the estimated baf for,informed them as to how and why the baf would be determined,and provided thirty days for submission of comments.see evergreen presbyterian ministries,hood,cir holding that a state satisfied section a notice requirements because its notices outlined the substance of the plan in sufficient detail to allow interested parties to decide how and whether to seek more information on the plan particular aspects internal quotation marks omitted,abrogation on other grounds recognized by equal access for el paso,hawkins,cir.although the notice was published just days before the spa requested effective date of july,the new rates were not actually implemented on that date rather the spa was made retroactively effective when it was approved in december.interested parties therefore had ample opportunity to review and comment on the proposed changes before they were finalized furthermore,although the baf described in the june notice differed slightly from the one submitted in the spa,the revised baf was,on its face,more favorable to nursing facilities.hhs could therefore have reasonably concluded that the june notice outlined the substance of the new rate calculation methodology in sufficient detail to alert nursing facilities to the scope and nature of the proposed change.evergreen,at.
that dpw may have failed to literally comply with federal regulations regarding public notice does not make hhs acceptance of its assurances arbitrary or capricious.according to plaintiffs,the june notice violated c by not providing a numeric estimate of the expected increase or decrease in annual aggregate expenditures,and by not identifying any county offices where copies of the notice would be available for public review.appellants opening br.at.plaintiffs do not dispute,however,that the estimated baf included in the notice revealed the percentage by which rates would be adjusted,which hhs could reasonably have found to be an acceptable substitute to a dollar estimate of the state aggregate expenditures.see evergreen,at permitting the use of a percentage,rather than a dollar figure in a state notice of a proposed amendment.
plaintiffs also do not contend that the june notice was unavailable for public review they just say it was not made available in the precise manner provided for in the regulation.but again,it is within the secretary discretion to consider publication in the pennsylvania bulletin the effective equivalent of distributing a notice to county offices.in any event,based on the record before it,hhs could readily conclude that pennsylvania had substantial ly compli ed with federal notice requirements,which is all that is necessary for the secretary to reasonably accept a state assurances to that effect.indep.acceptance,at holding that in accepting the state assurance,the secretary was not required to hold the state to absolutely literal compliance with the notice requirements,but rather had discretion to determine whether the state had given sufficient assurance that its notice was in substantial compliance see also oklahoma shalala,cir deferring to cms decision to relax the notice requirement from full formal compliance to at least minimal compliance through publication of an appropriate public notice before the effective date of the proposed change.
we therefore agree with the district court that hhs was neither arbitrary nor capricious in accepting dpw assurance that the state had satisfied section a public process requirements.that does not mean that plaintiffs dissatisfaction with the process at issue here is unreasonable.their fundamental complaint that dpw published an incomplete notice two days before the proposed effective date of a major change to the administration of its medicaid program is an accurate description of the state actions.but hhs accepted those actions as being sufficiently compliant with federal law,and,p
