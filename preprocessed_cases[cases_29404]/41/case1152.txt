milton donelson donelson and cortez lotts lotts collectively,appellees claimed that their former employer,electronic data systems corporation eds,discriminated against them in violation of michigan law.the parties executed an arbitration agreement,and,after a hearing,a panel of three arbitrators awarded damages,attorney fees,and costs to both donelson and lotts.eds subsequently petitioned the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan for an order vacating the arbitration award.the district court denied the petition,and eds now appeals.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
donelson and lotts,both of whom are,each worked for eds for approximately five months in.in may,both were assigned to work under the supervision of anne hoffmaster hoffmaster,a caucasian,who had recently returned to work after a maternity leave.during the next several months,hoffmaster issued multiple disciplinary notices to both donelson for performance deficiencies and lotts for chronic tardiness during this time,hoffmaster displayed,in her work cubicle,a doll with a black face,suspended in the air by a rope around its neck.a few months after hoffmaster return,both donelson in june and lotts in july were fired.it is undisputed that hoffmaster also participated in the terminations of two other employees in the months following her return to eds,during which period she was not involved in the firing of any caucasian employee.
donelson and lotts filed separate suits against eds in early donelson in february and lotts in march,alleging that their terminations were the result of racial with regard to both donelson and lotts and disability with regard to donelson discrimination,in violation of the civil rights act elcra.comp.laws et,and the persons with disabilities civil rights act pdcra.comp.laws et.on february,the parties reached an agreement to arbitrate the disputes,pursuant to which donelson and lotts dismissed their claims against eds.the agreement provided for a hearing before a panel of three arbitrators,followed by briefing to be submitted within two weeks of the hearing and a panel decision to be rendered within two weeks of the completion of briefing.
the arbitration hearing,of which no record was made,took place on september and.at the inception of the hearing,counsel for eds requested that the arbitrators set forth,in their award,findings of fact and conclusions of law,pursuant to the rule set forth in rembert ryan family steak houses.the panel took the request under advisement.after the hearing,the parties agreed to extend the briefing and award deadlines.briefing was completed on december.
on january,counsel for eds submitted a written objection to the panel,arguing that,because the arbitration panel had not issued a decision within two weeks of the completion of briefing,as required by the arbitration agreement,the panel no longer possessed the power to do so.notwithstanding eds letter,on january,the panel awarded damages to donelson in the amount of and to lotts in the amount of.neither award set forth findings of fact or conclusions of law,but each included a request for additional briefing on the proper amount of attorney fees to be awarded.approximately one month later,donelson and lotts submitted the requested briefs,to which eds objected on the grounds that the arbitrators lacked the authority to award attorney fees and that,in any event,no evidence concerning fees had been timely submitted.
on april,eds filed an application in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan to vacate the arbitration awards.subsequently,on may,the arbitration panel awarded attorney fees and costs to donelson in the amount of plus interest and to lotts in the amount of plus interest.on december,the district court denied eds application to vacate,and eds now appeals.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the standard of appellate review of a district court decision whether to vacate or confirm an arbitration award is governed by first options of chicago,kaplan,d.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,jaros,cir.
t here is no special standard governing the review of a district court decision in these circumstances.rather,review of,for example,a district court decision confirming an arbitration award on the ground that the parties agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration,should proceed like review of any other district court decision finding an agreement between parties,accepting findings of fact that are not clearly erroneous but deciding questions of law de novo.
kaplan,at.see also jaros,at in light of kaplan,it is clear that f indings of fact are reviewed for clear error and questions of law are reviewed de novo.
legal standard 
a court power to vacate an arbitration award is limited in scope.specifically,we have held that 
a court may vacate an arbitration award in the following situations where the award was procured by fraud,where the arbitrators were evidently partial or corrupt,where the arbitrators misbehaved so that a party rights were prejudiced,or where the arbitrators exceeded their powers or executed them so that a final,definite award was not made.in addition,a reviewing court may vacate an award where the arbitrators have manifestly disregarded the law.
dawahare spencer,cir,cert.denied,d internal citation omitted see also a federal arbitration act faa.eds contends that the arbitration panel in this case both exceeded its powers and manifestly disregarded the law.
c.the panel did not exceed its powers 
arbitrators exceed their power when they act beyond the material terms of the contract from which they primarily draw their authority,or in contravention of controlling principles of law.saveski tiseo architects,quoting detroit auto.exch.gavin.in this case,eds argues that the arbitrators exceeded their power by failing to set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law,as required by the elcra.comp.laws et,and by the decision of the michigan court of appeals in rembert,and awarding attorney fees and costs to both donelson and lotts despite the fact that the arbitration agreement provided only for an award of damages.
the form of the awards 
although the elcra itself does not mention arbitration,the overwhelming majority of federal and state courts have held that agreements to arbitrate statutory claims are enforceable,provided that the arbitration procedures are fair rembert,at emphasis added.the rembert court imposed a requirement that arbitral awards include findings of fact and conclusions of law,as a necessary corollary to its holding regarding the standard of judicial review.id.at.the holding regarding the standard of review,in turn,its own to predispute arbitration agreements w e hold that a predispute agreement to arbitrate a statutory employment discrimination claim will be reviewed under the standard enunciated by our supreme court in gavin.id.emphasis added.
the limited scope of the rembert holding is consistent with that court discussion of the interests implicated by the arbitration of statutory claims 
opponents of arbitration in this case,as elsewhere,generally acknowledge the public policy favoring arbitration,but claim that it ought not apply to claims arising under public interest statutes such as civil rights statutes.they argue that the public policy advanced by the statutes would be undermined if these disputes were addressed in the relatively private forum of arbitration.these very arguments were thoroughly considered and rejected by the united states supreme court in a trio of cases known as the mitsubishi trilogy and,later,in gilmer lane,d.although initially reluctant to endorse predispute arbitration agreements of statutory claims,federal law has long since strongly endorsed arbitration of statutory claims.
wilko swan,is representative of the initial skepticism toward arbitration.there,the united states supreme court held that predispute agreements to arbitrate claims arising under the securities act of were void under of the securities act,which nullified stipulations to waive compliance with the securities act.like the opponents of arbitrat
