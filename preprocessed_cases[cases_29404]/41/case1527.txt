this appeal involves a state law claim under indiana uniform fraudulent transfer act iufta,et.it has long been argued by some that diversity jurisdiction should be limited or even abolished.the proponents of this view argue that the federal courts are overburdened,that they lack expertise in matters of state law and that in most cases,the concern of hometown bias originally driving the establishment of diversity jurisdiction represents no real threat to the parties.while we express no opinion as to whether diversity jurisdiction should be limited generally,we have little doubt that this case would have been better brought in an indiana state court.this case raises numerous novel questions of indiana state law,upon which federal courts can provide no more than conjecture as to how the indiana supreme court would hold.the appellee,in oral argument,made it clear that it did not want us to certify any question to the indiana supreme court because of the inevitable delay that would follow.however,it was the appellee that chose to file its complaint in federal court and it was that complaint which sought novel remedies,never previously awarded under indiana law.at cplt.therefore,although we are not fans of delay,it is with limited sympathy that ultimately we must certify several of the questions raised in this appeal to the indiana supreme court.see stephan rocky mountain chocolate factory,cir.
background 
on may,caregivers plus,cpi,a provider of home healthcare services to medicare recipients and others,entered into a factoring agreement with dfs secured health receivables trust dfs.app.at.under this agreement,dfs purchased the right to receive the proceeds of collections of healthcare receivables payable by governmental obligors when such collections were received by cpi in exchange for immediate cash payments of of the value of these receivables to cpi.id.at.additionally,under this agreement,cpi was obligated to pay dfs interest for each month that receivables made payable to dfs went unpaid.id.therefore,in addition to its discount on the value of the receivables dfs received,cpi owed dfs annual interest on unpaid receivables.id.at.a monday morning quarterback might think this a bad deal for cpi,but it was still sunday morning,and it apparently looked serviceable to cpi at the time.
by february,however,cpi owed dfs approximately under this agreement.id.at.on april,dfs filed suit against cpi and its principal,claudette harrison,in the northern district of california to collect the debt.id.at.before the lawsuit began,harrison admitted converting in receivables that should have been paid to dfs.id.at.the parties executed a settlement agreement and the suit was dismissed voluntarily without prejudice.id.at.following this settlement,dfs continued to purchase cpi receivables despite the fact that cpi was constantly in default.id.at.by the end of,cpi debt to dfs had grown to approximately million.id.at.on february,dfs again filed suit against harrison,cpi and others in the united states district court for the eastern district of california and was granted a default judgment for approximately million.id.at.
in the meantime,cpi had fallen into financial distress and its officers were concerned that it would go under by the end of due to its debts.id.at.cpi financial distress was due,in part,to changes in the medicare program,including the balanced budget act of,which changed the medicare reimbursement method and led to a drop in spending on home health care agencies that year.id.at.as a result,about of indiana home health care agencies closed in.id.at.
harrison decided to sell cpi.id.at.on december,marc leestma,an entrepreneur in the home health care business,executed an asset purchase agreement apa for the sale of essentially all of cpi assets medicare provider number,files,furniture and computers for.id.at.the apa defined the buyer of cpi assets as marc leestma or,at his option,a corporation to be formed by him for purposes of this agreement.id.at.under the terms of the apa,the buyer purchased cpi assets and was also required to lease specific property,employ various former cpi employees including harrison,whose new salary with cgl was to be even higher than it was with cpi and assume cpi equipment leases.id.at.following execution of the apa,on december,leestma filed articles of incorporation for caregivers great lakes,cgl,to be the buyer of cpi assets.id.at.on january,cgl paid cpi and the transaction was complete.app.at.leestma claims that represented the fair market value of cpi and was consistent with other offers harrison had received during this time period.id.at.a jury,however,ultimately found that the fair value for cpi assets was actually.id.at.
because cgl had purchased cpi medicare provider number,medicare made payments totaling to cgl for services provided by cpi prior to the asset purchase.id.at.dfs claimed based on its may,agreement with cpi that it should have received these reimbursements.on october,dfs filed a complaint in the northern district of indiana claiming fraudulent transfer under the iufta,as well as,civil and criminal conversion.after a hearing at which the district court found that dfs was the lawful recipient of the medicare receivables,cgl paid these funds to dfs.id.at.
nonetheless,dfs maintained its action,claiming that the sale of cpi was a fraudulent attempt to shield cpi assets from its creditors dfs.after the district court dismissed the conversion claims,trial began on may.at the close of trial,the jury found that the reasonably equivalent value of the assets transferred to cgl was rather than the paid by cgl and recommended punitive damages of against leestma and against cgl.id.at.because the remedy sought was equitable in nature,the district court treated the jury findings as advisory but ultimately adopted its recommendation.id.at.on january,after the district court ruled on various motions,cgl and leestma filed a timely notice of appeal.
in this appeal,leestma and cgl challenge four discrete issues.first,leestma argues that the district court erred in finding that he could be personally liable under the iufta.second,leestma argues that dfs did not constitute a creditor under the iufta because dfs did not obtain its judgment against cpi until after the asset transfer and its contract with cpi was void since the sale of medicare receivables is illegal.third,leestma argues that a money judgment is not available under the iufta when the transferred assets are available for reconveyance.finally,leestma appeals the district court award of punitive damages,arguing that such damages are not available under the iufta.
ii.discussion 
leestma personal liability 
leestma argues that the district court erred in holding him personally liable,because under the iufta,a judgment may be entered only against a first transferee of fraudulently transferred assets or a person for whose benefit the transfer was made,and leestma claims to be neither.see b.according to leestma,corporation he created to purchase cpi the first transferee of those assets,and leestma acted as a mere agent of cgl.therefore,he argues that because dfs did not attempt to pierce the corporate veil of cgl,he can not be held personally liable.
we agree that a transferee is one with actual dominion or control over the assets in question.see bonded fin,cir control does not mean the ability to steal the money,or use it for personal purposes in breach of duty.in re schick.a transferee must have the right to put the money to one own purposes,rather than merely being an agent,possessor or someone who touches the money.bonded fin,at.
on december,the parties entered into an apa,under which the buyer,defined as marc leetsma sic or,at his option,a corporation to be formed by him for purposes of this agreement,agreed to purchase cpi assets for.see app.at.the district court concluded that because leestma signed the apa in his own name,he was not an agent and that he personally became the first transferee of the assets.see short app.at evidence supports a finding that leestma is personally liable for buying fraudulently discounted was he who signed the asset purchase lesstma sic is not entitled to dismissal of the fraudulent transfer claim against him.
of course,under indiana law and likely in any other state,the mere fact that a person signs an agreement in his own name does not preclude a finding that he signs in an agency capacity.see,stepp duffy.a fair reading of the apa suggests that the parties always intended that the buyer would be cgl rather than leestma personally.first,the apa definition of buyer,which contemplates that no corporation had yet been established but that one might be,not only suggests that leestma could be signing as an agent for a future corporation but also made it awkward for leestma to sign anything other than his name.see app.at.it was not likely that leestma would sign marc leestma,as president of the company which will be formed by him for purposes of this agreement.more importantly,however,the apa incorporated by reference and the asset transfer was conditioned on executing certain employment agreements and a lease agreement,which were apparently attached to it.id.at the transaction contemplated by this agreement is conditioned upon the buyer signing a five year employment contract in the form of exhibits and attached hereto.these agreements,which did not include the same awkward buyer definition,were made out by caregivers great lakes cgl and signed by marc leestma,president.id.at,therefore,viewing the apa as a whole,it is clear that leestma was signing as an agent for cgl,and the parties intended that cgl be the purchaser.therefore,had a transfer taken place upon the signing of the apa,cgl would be the first transferee and leestma,a mere agent.
however,even if cgl were the first transferee,it would not alter the outcome in this particular case,because cgl was not legally incorporated until january.see id.at articles of incorporation signed december,but including a delayed effective date of january,a.enc.corporations unless a delayed effective date is specified,a corporation existence begins when the articles of incorporation are filed.emphasis added therefore,there would be no need for dfs to pierce the corporate veil,as cgl was not yet wearing one.leestma could be personally liable whether he was the first transferee or not.
leestma may yet be saved,however,because although the parties had signed the apa,that alone was not enough to cause a transfer to occur in this case.an obvious implicit requirement to being a first transferee is that a transfer of legal rights has taken place.see rupp markgraf,cir determining the initial transferee of a transaction is necessarily a temporal inquiry there must be a transfer before there can be a transferee.see also.noting that a transfer must involve the disposing of or parting with an asset or an interest in an asset.therefore,we must determine when a transfer of legal rights occurred under the facts of this case.the answer will lie with the parties intent 
the apa,signed on december,states that s ubject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth,the company agrees to sell assign,transfer and deliver to the buyer at the closing provided for hereafter,all of the assets.app.at emphasis added.the apa further states that t he purchase price for the a ssets shall be in immediately available funds at the c losing.id.the closing date was set under the apa for december.id.at.the apa,however,does not suggest that time was of the essence.see smith potter,indiana cases discussing time of the essence clauses provide that courts do not generally view time as being of the essence of a contract unless the terms of the contract or the conduct of the parties make it so.the text of this agreement therefore makes it clear that the parties had entered into an executory agreement and that ownership the right to legally control the assets would transfer on december,or at such time as consideration was paid.
further evidence that the parties did not intend an immediate transfer of assets comes from a letter dated december,in which cpi provided the requisite notice to department of health and human services and indicated that a new corporation,cgl was to be the new owner of the medicare provider number.app.at see also b a provider who is contemplating or negotiating a change of ownership must notify the department of health and human services emphasis added.this letter,dated eleven days after the apa was signed,stated that cpi was in the process of selling its assets rather than that it had sold its assets.app.at emphasis added.
because the apa was an executory contract not governed by the ucc,neither leestma nor cgl was given ownership in or the legal right to control any asset under the apa until the parties so intended see first bank smoker,prior to the adoption of the uniform commercial code,ownership of goods and the rights incident thereto were defined by the location of title and the intention of the parties was the primary test as to who had title.webb clark county,holding that an agreement which gives the buyer the right to property in the future is executory and title does not pass until the parties comply with terms of the contract branigan hendricks,in the case of an executory contract,the purchaser does not become the owner the property to be sold is not at his risk.his remedy,if there be a breach,is confined to an action for damages.whether any particular contract is one or the other is,generally,a question of fact depending upon the intention of the parties,to be gathered from the terms and stipulations of the agreement.keck state ex rel,noting that petitioner only contracted for an interest at some time in the future,when he had complied with certain conditions.such an interest is not subject to levy and sale see also bradley michael,frame station,indiana dep t of state revenue,the transfer of property occurs when the buyer agrees to buy property from a seller,pays the purchase price,and takes ownership and possession of the property.
although the closing was originally scheduled by the apa to take place on december,it appears that nothing actually happened on that date.see tr.vol.at.the record is devoid of information about when any of the tangible assets were physically transferred but,in any case,it is the legal right to control the asset,not physical possession,which matters under bonded financial services.see at moreover,the parties agreed in the apa and at oral argument that the real value of this transaction was in the intangible assets.app.at the parties to this agreement acknowledge that the value of the company is its certification and good will.as we have noted,the parties intended that the legal right to control the assets would shift when value was paid.this occurred on january,when cgl issued a check.app.at.therefore,it is clear that cgl gained the right to control these assets on january,and is thus the first transferee.
the fact that leestma is not the first transferee under the iufta,however,does not necessarily mean that the only way he can be personally liable is by piercing cgl corporate veil.under indiana state law,an officer or shareholder of a corporation can be held individually liable,without the need to pierce the corporate veil,if he personally participates in the fraud.see state civil rights comm county line park,citing gable curtis,it is that a corporate officer can not escape liability for fraud by claiming that he acted on behalf of the corporation when that corporate officer personally participated in the fraud.b business corporations act unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation,a shareholder of a corporation is not personally liable for the acts or debts of the corporation except that the shareholder may become personally liable by reason of the shareholder own acts or conduct.emphasis added.enc.corporations.this principle of indiana law has been applied not just in common law fraud actions,but in other statutory and common law causes.see,roake christensen,finding defendant individually liable for fraud in connection with his criminal conversion in violation of berghoff mcdonald,holding an agent personally liable in an action of replevin for an unlawful taking or detention american indep.mgmt.mcdaniel,stoutco,amma,in indiana,the law is also clear that a corporate officer or shareholder is not shielded from liability on the basis of his representative capacity when he participates in a tort because an agent is liable for his own torts.in re mills,w hen a personal debtor who,as an officer of a corporation,actually participates in the conversion of property which is subject matter to the security interest of a third party,he is personally liable to said party and thus the debt is nondischargeable pursuant to a.
no court has yet considered whether this indiana common law rule can be applied to the iufta there is good reason to believe it would apply,however.first,indiana seems to treat claims under the iufta as a type of fraud claim.see,fire police city county federal credit union eagle,treating a claim under as a fraud claim bruce markell,the indiana uniform fradulent transfer act introduction,indiana statutes require a finding that fraud existed in connection with a transaction challenged as a fraudulent transfer.second,the iufta itself expressly incorporates principles of common law fraud by reference.finally,at least one other court has applied similar common law to find the president of a corporation personally liable under another state version of the ufta,despite the fact that he was not a first transferee.see firstar bank,faul,wl,at.
at least one state with a similar common law rule,however,has declined to hold an officer who personally participated in fraud liable under the ufta.see kondracky crystal restoration.while kondracky did not specifically discuss or necessarily consider what effect rhode island common law personal participation rule would have on the ufta,a rhode island district court later felt constrained by kondracky and held that the common law would not expand liability under the ufta.see rohm and haas capuano,d,criticizing firstar.the court in rohm also noted that most courts have been reluctant to extend the reach of fraudulent conveyance actions as to include parties that are only participants in a fraudulent transfer.id.at compiling cases.
we do not share the concerns of the rhode island district court,at least with respect to this case.the cases upon which it relies do not involve officers,directors or shareholders of the first transferee,who personally participated in the fraud.instead,they involve novel claims of accessory,conspiracy or aiding and abetting liability under the ufta.see lowell staats mining phila,cir declining to extend ufta to find aiding and abetting liability against an agent of the corporation,where it seems the agent was not an officer,director or shareholder mack newton,cir declining to extend ufta to individuals who participated in a conspiracy to commit a fraudulent transfer thompson kernaghan global intellicom,civ.dlc,wl,at,declining to apply an accessory liability theory to a lawyer of first transferee who helped set up the corporation involved.therefore,these cases are not on point.
in contrast,we are aware of no case suggesting that veil piercing is impermissible under the ufta liability for officers or shareholders of a first transferee who personally participated in the fraud is a substitute for veil piercing,not an extension of who can be a transferee under the ufta.moreover,the reasoning behind the general rule that courts should avoid extending the parties who can be a transferee under the ufta appears to be based,at least in part,on the difficulty of proving damages.see duell brewer,cir c ourts have generally held as to fraudulent conveyances that a person who assists another to procure one,is not liable in tort to the insolvent creditors the reasons ordinarily given are the impossibility of proving any damages,which scarcely seems sufficient but the result is settled,at least for us.cited by lowell staats mining,at.we do not believe that there would be any such difficulty here,where joint and several liability would clearly be appropriate.
finally,this case is somewhat unique in that,because punitive damages were sought rightly or wrongly,we have an actual jury finding that leestma personally participated in fraudulent conduct,in addition to the general finding of liability under the ufta.app.at in deciding the issue of punitive damages,though,the jury found by clear and convincing evidence that both defendants leestma and cgl acted with malice,fraud,gross negligence,or oppressiveness.emphasis added app.at verdict form.therefore,we see no reason that the rule should not be extended in this case.
nonetheless,given that we can not avoid certifying two other questions to the indiana supreme court see infra,in an abundance of caution,we do so here as well.therefore,we hereby certify to the indiana supreme court the question whether an officer or director of a first transferee under the iufta who is found to have personally participated in the fraud can be held personally liable under indiana law on that basis alone.
dfs as creditor 
the appellants second argument is that the district court erred in finding dfs to be a creditor under the iufta.according to the appellants,dfs was not a creditor under the iufta because dfs did not obtain its judgment against cpi until after the asset transfer and its contract with cpi was void as the sale of medicare receivables is illegal.leestma br.at.both arguments are without merit.
we start with the appellants argument that dfs is not a creditor because dfs did not obtain its judgment against cpi until after the asset transfer.the appellants argument,properly articulated,does not have to do with whether dfs is a creditor as defined under section of the iufta,but whether dfs is a present creditor under section of the iufta transfers fraudulent as to present creditors.reply br.at.section notes that a transfer made or an obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor whose claim arose before the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred if certain specified conditions are met.emphasis added.
although dfs did not receive a court judgment until after the asset transfer,the court judgment simply made official the obligation with respect to which dfs had been trying to recover long before the asset transfer.the appellants have presented no evidence to suggest that this debt did not arise before the fraudulent transfer.the iufta definition of a claim makes it clear that a claim is a right to payment whether the right is reduced to judgment or not id.at.therefore,the fact that dfs did not receive a court judgment until after the asset transfer is not relevant to the inquiry.
nor did the district court err in considering the court judgment in deciding that dfs was a present creditor under the iufta,given that the judgment evidenced the debt and the appellants presented no evidence to the contrary.in fact,it appears that the appellants never made the argument below that dfs claim did not arise before the transfer or that dfs was not a present creditor.see reply br.at.this argument is raised for the first time on appeal and is thus waived.see murphy keystone steel wire,cir.in any event,even if the appellants had properly made this argument below,and had presented compelling evidence that dfs claim not just its judgment arose after the transfer,they would presumably still be liable under section of the iufta which applies regardless of whether the creditor claim arose before or after the transfer was made if the debtor made the transfer with the actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any creditor of the debtor emphasis added.
with respect to the appellants second contention,they argue that dfs contract with cpi,in which dfs purchased the right to receive the proceeds of collections of healthcare receivables payable by governmental obligors when such collections were received by provider is void for illegality.app.at.essentially,the appellants argument is that the factoring agreement violates c which states that no payment which may be made to a provider of services under this title for any service furnished to an individual shall be made to any other person under an assignment or power of attorney see also a cfr.although it is reassuring to see that at least one issue of federal law managed to creep its way into this appeal,the appellants argument is without merit.
on its face,this statute stands only for the proposition that medicare funds can not be paid directly by the government to someone other than the provider,but it does not prohibit a third party from receiving medicare funds if they first flow through the provider.before this statute,health care providers assigned their right to medicare receivables to third parties which then submitted incorrect and inflated claims to be paid in their own names,creating administrative nightmares and overpayments in excess of one million dollars,reprinted in.therefore,congress passed this statute to remedy this problem by ensuring that payments would be made directly to healthcare providers.however,nothing suggests that congress intended to prevent healthcare providers from assigning receivables to a.id.the committee bill would not preclude a physician or other person who provided the services and accepted an assignment from having the payment mailed to anyone or any organization he wishes,but the payment would be to him in his name.
the appellants cite no case and we have uncovered none,which interprets this statute to prohibit a provider assignment of medicare or medicaid receivables to a.if anything,case law suggests the opposite.see,in re missionary baptist found.of,cir holding that a creditor could collateralize its loan to the debtor by an assignment of the debtor accounts receivable due from medical care payments under a credit recovery,llc hieke,d,t he court notes that neither the medicare nor medicaid statutes expressly proscribe a provider assignment of the general right to receive medicare or medicaid receivables to a nonprovider.indeed,all the parties to this dispute agree that collateral arrangements such as where a loan to a provider is secured by medicare receivables do not run afoul of any of the federal rules relating to the assignment of medicare and medicaid claims.see also in re am.care,same intermediary medicare manual,part three,ch.five c,http these provisions preclude medicare payment of amounts due a provider or other person to a person or entity furnishing financing to the provider,whether the provider sells claims to that person or entity or pledges them to that person or entity as collateral on a loan.emphasis added.further,the record suggests that medicare was aware of this agreement between dfs and cpi,at least post facto,and other than disallowing a claim for the interest on the obligation,there is no evidence that it expressed any disapproval of the arrangement.app.at.therefore,we remain unconvinced that this factoring agreement between dfs and cpi was illegal.
in any case,it is doubtful that leestma and cgl,to this fully executed contract,have standing at this late date to argue that the contract is void for illegality.the appellants draw our attention to the general rule stated in corpus juris secundum that when for any reason the judgment against the grantor is invalid the grantee may show its invalidity in a proceeding to set aside the conveyance as fraudulent.reply br.at quoting fraudulent conveyances.the appellants,however,cite no law from indiana,and it is not obvious that indiana rule would necessarily mirror the rule stated in corpus juris or that it would apply specifically to illegal contracts.see,commercial television serv,cir in the absence of any express holding in indiana or illinois,the rule that the law will not enforce an illegal contract has application only between the immediate parties to the contract,is sound and applicable.hence,it follows that one in possession of the fruits of an illegal transaction to which he was not a party can not invoke the defense of illegality.citation omitted.however,even if we were to treat corpus juris as gospel,the appellants ignore the exception to the general rule reported in corpus juris immediately subsequent 
where the judgment against the debtor has been rendered in the regular course of judicial proceedings by a court of competent jurisdiction and it can not be objected to on the ground that it was obtained by fraud or collusion,it is,whether rendered on default or after contest,conclusive as to the relation of debtor and creditor between the parties and the amount of the indebtedness,and can not be collaterally impeached by the grantee of the debtor in a suit to set aside the conveyance as fraudulent.
fraudulent conveyances emphasis added.here,the judgment against cpi was rendered in the course of a judicial proceeding.the appellants do not argue that the court that rendered the judgment lacked jurisdiction,that there were defects in the proceedings or that the judgment was obtained by fraud or collusion.therefore the appellants present no basis upon which the judgment can be attacked.see scott indianapolis wagon works,finding that in suit by a judgment creditor to set aside fraudulent conveyance,a grantee can not call a judgment into question by raising matters which might have been defenses to the action in which the judgment was rendered.enc.fraudulent conveyances matters which have no bearing on the issues in the suit to set aside the conveyance as fraudulent can not be urged as a defense thereto.citing scott 
finally,as a technical matter,even if the appellants had standing to attack the validity of this contract,this would not change dfs status as a creditor under the iufta.a creditor with a colorable claim can not lose its status as creditor under the iufta simply because the debtor or a has a legal defense to the claim.the statute itself defines creditor as a person who has a claim,and notes that a claim under the statute means a right to payment,whether the right is disputed or undisputed id.at.therefore,the fact that the appellants may dispute the claim would not change dfs status as a creditor.
money damages under the iufta 
the appellants next argument is that a money judgment is not available under the iufta when the transferred assets are available for reconveyance leestma br.at.the iufta specifically discusses the r emedies of a creditor and notes that 
a in an action for relief against a transfer or an obligation under this chapter,a creditor,subject to the limitations in section of this chapter,may obtain any of the following 
avoidance of the transfer or obligation to the extent necessary to satisfy the creditor claim.
an attachment or other provisional remedy against the asset transferred or other property of the transferee in accordance with the procedure prescribed by ic or any other applicable statute providing for attachment or other provisional remedy against debtors generally.
subject to applicable principles of equity and in accordance with applicable rules of civil procedure,any of the following 
a an injunction against further disposition by the debtor or a transferee,or both,of the asset transferred,its proceeds,or of other property.
b appointment of a receiver to take charge of the asset transferred or of the property of the transferee.
c any other relief the circumstances require.
b if a creditor has obtained a judgment on a claim against the debtor,the creditor,if the court orders,may levy execution on the asset transferred or its proceeds.
emphasis added.although the section specifically discusses only remedies which are equitable in nature,the catchall provision allowing a creditor to obtain any other relief the circumstances require would seemingly empower a court to provide monetary relief at its discretion.see,freeman first union,cir citing hansard construction rite aid of florida,so d despite the fact that the other remedies set forth in the act are equitable in nature,we find this catchall provision sufficiently broad to encompass the monetary judgment sought by appellants.morris askeland,a court acting in equity always retains the power to enter a monetary award to implement its decree profeta lombardo,ohio app d,allowing money damages under the catchall provision of oufta see also bruce markell,the indiana uniform fradulent transfer act introduction.at noting that t he remedies specified in section are not exclusive but see forum ins.devere,applying cal.a terms such as liability and damages do not appear in the statute thus,by its terms,ufta allows only equitable remedies such as avoidance,attachment,an injunction,or appointment of a receiver.mack,at same under bankruptcy act of.
the next section of the iufta discusses a t ransferee defenses,liability,and protections and notes that 
b except as otherwise provided in this chapter,to the extent a transfer is voidable in an action by a creditor under section a of this chapter,the creditor may recover judgment for the value of the asset transferred,as adjusted under subsection c,or the amount necessary to satisfy the creditor claim,whichever is less 
c if the judgment under subsection b is based upon the value of the asset transferred,the judgment must be for an amount equal to the value of the asset at the time of the transfer,subject to adjustment as the equities may require.
emphasis added.similarly,we find no language in this section expressly limiting a court ability to award monetary damages to the situation in which the assets are unavailable for reconveyance.the appellants argue that the phrase e xcept as otherwise provided in this chapter should be read as referring to section,and should thus be understood to mean that monetary damages are not available if equitable relief is available under section.we do not find this to be a plausible reading of the statute.
first,it is curious that,if the drafters intended this language in section to mean that monetary damages are not available where equitable relief is available under section,they would not just have written except as otherwise provided in section or to the extent sufficient equitable relief is unavailable.second,it seems odd that the drafters would state except as otherwise provided rather than except as otherwise available.the use of the word provided suggests that monetary relief could be awarded instead of equitable relief,so long as the court has not awarded equitable relief.third,because section allows for any other relief the circumstances require,allowing monetary relief under section except as otherwise provided in section would seemingly provide no real limitation on the court,and allowing monetary relief except as otherwise available in section would seemingly mean that no relief could ever be awarded under section.finally,under the appellants interpretation of the except as otherwise provided clause,if a court ordered that assets be reconveyed under section,but the assets had seriously depreciated in value since the time of the fraudulent transfer,the statute would seemingly not allow for an award of any additional monetary damages to make up the difference.this would contradict the holding of even those cases upon which the appellants rely.see,robinson coughlin,in re mclaughlin.
nonetheless,we are aware of no reported cases in which monetary damages were awarded under the iufta,and courts such as robinson have held under their state version of the ufta that monetary damage awards are only appropriate where reconveyance of the fraudulently transferred property is impossible or where the subject property has depreciated in value.policy considerations would support such a rule,as it would avoid speculation as to the value of conveyed assets.see,in re vedaa,noting in the context of the bankruptcy code that it is clear that courts favor a return of the property itself if at all possible so as to avoid speculation over its value.this case exemplifies the problem with such speculation,in that it has been argued that these assets range in value from to the jury determined that they were worth.app.at.therefore,we hereby certify to the indiana supreme court the question whether an award of monetary damages under the iufta is only available where reconveyance of the fraudulently transferred property is impossible or where the subject property has depreciated in value,or whether the nature of the award is at the court discretion.
punitive damages under the iufta 
finally,the appellants appeal the district court award of punitive damages,arguing that such damages are not available under the iufta.yet a straightforward reading of the iufta catchall provision would seemingly allow for punitive damages.see.c allowing a court to award any other relief the circumstances require.moreover,as noted earlier,the iufta incorporates principles of state common law.under indiana law,tortious conduct involving malice,fraud,gross negligence,or oppressiveness which was not the result of a mistake of fact or law,honest error or judgment,overzealousness,mere negligence,or other human failing may be punished by an award of punitive damages.erie ins.hickman.in this case,the jury found that leestma personally engaged in such conduct,seemingly making punitive damages appropriate.app.at.
no indiana court,however,has addressed the question whether punitive damages can be awarded under the iufta,and other states are split on the question.compare macris,neways,utah allowing punitive damages under utah ufta volk constr.wilmescherr drusch roofing,same under missouri ufta henderson henderson,no,wl,at same under maine uniform fraudulent conveyance act locafrance united states interstate distribution,ohio,same under ohio uniform fraudulent conveyance act,with morris,at finding punitive damages are not available under colorado ufta,and northern tankers backstrom,same under connecticut ufta.
leestma argues that the indiana supreme court would conclude that punitive damages are not recoverable under the iufta because indiana construes statutory remedies narrowly and only allows for punitive damages when the legislature expressly includes them in the statute.leestma br.at.however,in none of the cases cited by leestma did the statute in question contain anything like the catchall provision which is present in the iufta.see forte connerwood healthcare,reversing an award of punitive damages under the child wrongful death statute which contained an exclusive list of damages recoverable by a child parent or guardian fleming int l pizza supply,declining to find individual liability or punitive damages under indiana business corporation laws,where the statute allowed only for appraisal watters dinn,declining to create a civil remedy where the act under which the plaintiff was suing did not allow for a civil action demayo state ex rel.of natural resources,reversing an award of monetary damages where the statute only authorized and empowered the indiana department of conservation to bring in any court of proper jurisdiction,actions by way of injunction,either prohibitive or mandatory,or both.we do not believe that these cases provide much insight into how indiana would decide this question and we therefore certify to the indiana supreme court the question whether punitive damages are available under the iufta.
iii.conclusion 
in conclusion,we certify the following three questions to the indiana supreme court 
can an officer or director of a first transferee under the iufta who is found to have personally participated in the fraud be held personally liable under indiana law on that basis alone 
is an award of monetary damages under the iufta available only where reconveyance of the fraudulently transferred property is impossible or where the subject property has depreciated in value 
are punitive damages available under the iufta 
we invite,of course,the justices of the indiana supreme court to reformulate our questions if they feel that course is appropriate.we do not intend anything in this certification,including our statement of the questions,to limit the scope of their inquiry.further proceedings in this court are stayed while the indiana supreme court considers this certification.
