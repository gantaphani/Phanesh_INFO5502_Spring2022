following a jury verdict in favor of appellee troy mattis,appellants carlon electrical products,lamson and sessions,and oatey challenge the district court evidentiary rulings and its refusal to grant judgment as a matter of law in appellants favor.we affirm.
background 
in the summer of,mattis was years old and was working as an apprentice electrician.at the beginning of the summer,he had a history of good health on july,mattis worked on a project near wagner,south dakota and used carlon all weather quick set cement carlon cement.carlon cement is manufactured by oatey,and it is labeled and sold by carlon electrical products,a business unit of lamson and sessions.carlon cement includes six ingredients,four of which are respiratory irritants tetrahydrofuran,acetone,cyclohexanone,and methyl ethyl ketone.
on july,mattis spent most of the day outside laying ten foot sections of inch polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe in a trench that was six inches wide and eighteen inches deep.the temperature was degrees.after laying the sections of pipe,he worked on his hands and knees using carlon cement to connect the sections.before performing this work,mattis read the safety warnings on the label of the carlon cement when mattis was not using the glue,he put the lid back on the can according to his supervisor instructions.the can sat in the sun when not in use.to reopen the can of cement,mattis held it close to his chest and opened the lid.as he did this,the can made sizzling sounds,like a can of.he testified that he opened the can at least ten to twelve times during the course of the day.
on the morning of july,mattis woke up with a severe headache,nausea,vomiting,and soreness in his chest.nevertheless,he returned to work and again used the carlon cement.on saturday morning,july,mattis awoke with another severe headache,continued nausea,and tightness in his chest.his symptoms were worsening,and it was difficult for him to breathe.on sunday,he went to a doctor and was treated for dehydration and released.he called in sick on monday and went to see another doctor on tuesday.his physician,weber,admitted him to the hospital,where he stayed for six days.of his chest were taken on july,and again on july.the board certified radiologist,frank messner,who read the concluded 
the patient demonstrates a rather extensive bilateral infiltrate,which has a somewhat nodular component to it the distribution would suggest some type of unusual organism or cause impression.fairly extensive bilateral infiltrates suspicious for unusual pneumonia or some type of response to a noxious agent.
appellee app.at.weber diagnosed mattis with bilateral pneumonia,reactive airways disease,and exposure to pvc glue fumes,among other things.weber referred mattis to hansen,a board certified pulmonologist.she first met with mattis on august.at that time,she performed a differential diagnosis using a specific medical methodology for reactive airways dysfunction syndrome rads.after performing the differential diagnosis,hansen diagnosed mattis with rads and concluded that it was caused by his inhalation of the carlon cement fumes.
since his release from the hospital,mattis has experienced persistent intermittent symptoms and some decline in his lung function.he must avoid exposure to irritants such as smoke,dust,chemical odors,and extremes in temperatures.because of his health problems and work restrictions,he gave up working as an electrician.
mattis and his wife brought a cause of action in federal court against oatey,carlon,and lamson and sessions claiming negligence,strict liability based on failure to warn,and negligence per se.the jury returned a verdict in favor of mattis in the amount of and in favor of his wife for on her loss of consortium claim.following the verdict,the defendants filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for a new trial.the district court denied these motions and carlon,oatey,and lamson and sessions appeal.
ii.discussion 
appellants raise four issues on appeal.they contend that the district court erred in refusing to grant judgment as a matter of law in their favor because mattis failed to establish causation and he failed to establish liability on the failure to warn claim.appellants also maintain that the district court erred in excluding the results of field studies oatey conducted after mattis injury,and that the court erred in admitting reports of health problems caused by carlon cement.
we first address appellants argument that the district court should have granted judgment as a matter of law in their favor because the expert testimony offered by mattis failed to prove that his exposure to carlon cement caused his illness.we review de novo the district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law and view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.cardenas v.at t,cir citation omitted.judgment as a matter of law is only appropriate when no reasonable jury could have found for the nonmoving party.id.citation omitted.
to prove causation in a toxic tort case,a plaintiff must show both that the alleged toxin is capable of causing injuries like that suffered by the plaintiff in human beings subjected to the same level of exposure as the plaintiff,and that the toxin was the cause of the plaintiff injury.bonner isp,cir citing wright willamette,cir.to meet his burden of proving causation,mattis presented the testimony of two expert witnesses,hansen,his treating pulmonologist,and roger wabeke,an industrial hygienist.the district court found that this testimony,in addition to the testimony by appellants expert,kapp,was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that mattis exposure to the organic solvents in carlon cement was capable of causing rads and that exposure to those solvents did,in fact,cause his illness.we agree.kapp admitted that the organic solvents in carlon cement were capable of causing rads at high exposure levels.wabeke testimony established that mattis was exposed to dangerous levels of those organic solvents,and hansen testimony provided evidence that mattis exposure to the organic solvents in the cement caused him to develop rads.
appellants argue,however,that hansen and wabeke testimony was insufficient as a matter of law to establish causation.they fault wabeke testimony because he could not determine mattis exact exposure level.to prove exposure levels,plaintiffs need not produce a mathematically precise table equating levels of exposure with levels of harm.bednar bassett furniture,cir quoting wright,at.rather,a plaintiff need only make a threshold showing that he or she was exposed to toxic levels known to cause the type of injuries he or she suffered.id.wabeke testified that experts have known for a long time that the organic solvents in carlon cement are respiratory irritants capable of injuring respiratory mucous membranes in the nostrils,throat,trachea,and lungs.in addition,wabeke used a vapor concentration test to determine whether mattis was exposed to a dangerous level of fumes.to perform the test he heated a can of carlon cement to degrees and cut pvc pipe into five inch sections.he then transferred the pipe and the cement to an air sampling chamber and spread the cement on the pipe.the test showed that the solvent vapors accumulated rapidly at extreme concentrations,far in excess of safe exposure levels.at trial,wabeke noted that mattis exposure levels would have been higher than the levels in his test because the hissing and sizzling sounds the can made indicated that it was hotter than degrees.this evidence is admissible and created a question of fact for the jury about whether mattis was exposed to an unsafe level of fumes,capable of causing respiratory problems.
next,appellants argue that hansen testimony was legally insufficient.we disagree.a medical opinion based upon a proper differential diagnosis is sufficiently reliable to satisfy daubert merrell dow,d.turner iowa fire,cir.hansen performed a valid differential diagnosis to determine that mattis exposure to the cement caused his rads.id.noting that a proper differential diagnosis is one that identifies the cause of a medical cond
