tommy mcclanahan appeals the district court denial of his motion for summary judgment and the grant of the commissioner of social security motion for summary judgment affirming the commissioner decision and dismissing the case.mcclanahan claims that the district court erred when it upheld the commissioner determination of the date of onset of his disability.for the reasons that follow,the ruling of the district court is affirmed.
background 
mcclanahan first applied for disability benefits and supplemental social security income in december of,claiming that he was unable to work beginning february,due to degenerative disc disease.his initial application was denied,and he requested a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.following the hearing,the alj issued a decision on september,denying mcclanahan disability claim.the alj decision became the commissioner final decision on september,when the appeals council denied mcclanahan request for review.
mcclanahan filed his first complaint in federal district court seeking review of the alj decision on october.the parties filed,each asking the district court to reverse the alj decision and enter an order to remand the case for further.the magistrate issued a report and recommendation,recommending that the motions be granted and that judgment be entered.on march,the district court entered an order accepting the magistrate recommendation in its entirety.as a result of the order,the claimant underwent neuropsychological evaluation and a supplemental hearing was conducted.
following the additional development of the record,mcclanahan appeared represented by counsel on february,before a different alj,who found that mcclanahan was disabled as of july,due to organic brain dysfunction,but not prior to that date.the alj decision became the commissioner final decision on july,when the appeals council found no reason to assume jurisdiction.
on august,mcclanahan filed a second complaint in federal district court seeking judicial review of the alj february,determination.the magistrate judge issued a report recommending the entry of judgment for the commissioner.after overruling mcclanahan objections to the report,the district court entered an order granting the commissioner motion for summary judgment.this timely appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court exercised jurisdiction over the final decision of the commissioner pursuant to g and c.this court has jurisdiction over the final ruling of the district court pursuant to,g,and c.
this court must affirm the commissioner conclusions unless the commissioner failed to apply the correct legal standard or made findings of fact that are unsupported by substantial evidence.branham gardner,cir.the findings of the commissioner as to any fact if supported by substantial evidence shall be conclusive g.substantial evidence is more than a scintilla of evidence but less than a preponderance and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.besaw sec y of health and human,cir.the findings of the commissioner are not subject to reversal merely because there exists in the record substantial evidence to support a different conclusion this is so because there is a zone of choice within which the commissioner can act,without the fear of court interference.buxton halter,cir citations omitted.this court reviews questions of law de novo.sec y of health and human,cir.
iii.analysis 
mcclanahan brings two issues on appeal.first,he claims that the alj committed error because he applied the wrong legal standard when he determined the onset date of mcclanahan disability.second,he claims that the alj erred in finding that july,was the date of onset for his disability.
disability determination 
an alj engages in a sequential evaluation when deciding whether a claimant is entitled to social security disability benefits pursuant to a.the evaluation proceeds as follows the claimant work activity is considered.if he is performing substantial gainful activity,he will be found to be not disabled the severity of the claimant alleged impairments is considered,including the duration the severity of the alleged impairment is considered compared to the disability listings,and if the impairment meets one of the listings,the claimant is found to be disabled if the claimant impairment does not prevent him from doing past relevant work,a finding of not disabled will be made finally,even if the impairment does prevent him from doing past relevant work,the claimant age,education,and work experience are considered along with the residual functional capacity to determine whether the claimant could adjust to other work.id.
during the sequential evaluation,if the claimant is found to be conclusively disabled or not disabled,the disability determination is made,and the inquiry is ended.id.if we can find that you are disabled or not disabled at a step,we do not go on to the next step.
wrong legal standard 
mcclanahan first claims that the alj erred when he did not mention social security ruling to establish the onset date of disability,and when he did not employ the correct legal standard in his disability determination.
social security ruling governs the determination of disability onset date.once a finding of disability is made,the alj must determine the onset date of the disability.see key callahan,cir.the ruling states,in relevant part 
factors relevant to the determination of disability onset include the individual allegation,the work history,and the medical evidence.these factors are often evaluated together to arrive at the onset date.however,the individual allegation or the date of work stoppage is significant in determining onset only if it is consistent with the severity of the condition s shown by the medical evidence.
ssr at emphasis added.further,the ruling states that the medical evidence serves as the primary element in the onset determination.id.at.
mcclanahan claims that the alj did not mention or apply the proper legal standard in determining the onset date of disability.once he found claimant disabled at step of the sequential evaluation process,he should have established the onset date using the legal standard set forth in social security ruling.appellant br.at.in particular,mcclanahan urges that an earlier disability onset date should be identified,because the ruling states 
particularly in the case of slowly progressive impairments,it is not necessary for an impairment to have reached listing severity be decided on medical grounds alone before onset can be established in some cases,it may be possible,based on the medical evidence,to reasonably infer that the onset of a disabling impairment occurred some time prior to the date of the first recorded medical examination,the date the claimant stopped working.
mcclanahan argues that the alj decision requires this court to remand the case so the alj can create a record which forms a basis for the onset date because the opinion fails to mention ssr,fails to explain the legal standard used to establish the onset date,and fails to offer any rationale for the onset date the alj identified.appellant br.at.
alj not required to specifically mention ssr 
mcclanahan advances no legal authority for his theory that the alj applied the wrong legal standard when he failed to mention ssr during the disability determination.he cites to blankenship bowen,cir,wherein this court stated that social security rulings are binding on all components of the social security administration.these rulings represent precedent final opinions and orders and statements of policy and interpretations that the social security administration ha s adopted.b internal citations omitted.while we agree with this assertion,we do not find that it stands for the proposition that an alj must refer with specificity to social security rulings when making disability determinations.because the alj conducted the analysis required by the ruling,his failure to mention it by name is not fatal to the decision.see pugh bowen,cir.
the alj followed the dictates of ssr 
we find that the alj did follow the requirements of ssr when rendering the disability determination,even though the ruling was not specifically mentioned.contrary to mcclanahan assertion,the alj performed a thorough and considered review of the record.he found that mcclanahan met the criteria for organic brain dysfunction based on the findings of the neuropsychological testing performed by miller.in his report,the alj summarized his rationale for his determination.he stated 
the claimant,who met the insured status requirements of title ii of the act on february,and through the date of this decision,has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since such alleged disability onset date.
the medical evidence establishes that the claimant has severe impairments as set forth in the body of this decision.
the claimant organic brain dysfunction has met the criteria of section of the listing of impairments,from july,and thereafter,but not prior thereto.
prior to july,the medical evidence fails to establish that the claimant had impairment s satisfying the criteria of any section of the listing of impairments.his borderline intellectual functioning and depression imposed no more than moderate restriction of daily activities,or ability to maintain social functioning,or ability to sustain concentration,persistence,or pace.there were no repeated episodes of mental decompensation,and no showing of inability to function adequately outside of a highly supportive setting.
the claimant subjective complaints of functional limitation are disproportionate to the medical evidence and are not fully credible for the period prior to july,considering both medical and other evidence of record.and.
from february,through july,the claimant had the residual functional capacity to perform light exertion,provided he perform no more than simple,unskilled tasks and perform no work requiring close interaction with coworkers or supervisors.
from february,through july,the claimant was unable to perform past relevant work.
from february,through july,the claimant was a younger person.
the claimant has marginal literacy.
based on an exertional capacity for light exertion and the claimant age,education,and work history,and and guideline rule would direct a finding of not disabled.
although additional nonexertional limitations did not allow the claimant to perform the full range of light exertion,using the cited rule as a framework for decision making,there were significant numbers of jobs in the regional and national economies that he could perform prior to july,examples of which are set forth in the body of this decision.
the claimant was under a disability as defined in the social security act and regulations commencing july,but not prior thereto.d,f and d,f.
in the body of his report,the alj discussed the method he used to ascertain the disability onset date.he stated 
although organic brain dysfunction has been diagnosed,the undersigned notes that medical documentation thereof did not occur prior to miller report of july.consequently,the medical evidence can not support a finding that such impairment met the criteria of listing prior to such date.therefore,it remains for consideration whether mcclanahan was disabled prior to july.
tr.emphasis added.the alj then engaged in a careful review to ascertain whether mcclanahan medical record supported a finding of disability onset prior to july,
consultative examiner robert spangler,noted in january that mcclanahan was oriented in all four spheres,that he had adequate recall of recent and remote events,and that he repeated words after minutes,connoting significant memory capacity.he also performed serial five subtractions without error and showed no loose associations or illogical language.he endorsed preparing his own meals when his wife was at work,watching television with some difficulty in concentration,taking out the trash,and playing with his dog.he endorsed physical difficulties and pain as contributing to his limited activities.the examiner assessed him as having adequate social skills,as well.he had received no specialized mental health treatment prior to january.consistent with spangler findings and assessments,and the opinion of a designated state agency medical consultant in january,the undersigned concludes that the b and c criteria of section of the listing of impairments were not met,in that no more than moderate restriction of activities of daily living or ability to perform social functioning or to sustain concentration,persistence,or pace were present.similarly there is no evidentiary basis for concluding that he was incapable of functioning adequately outside of a highly supportive setting.thus,the undersigned finds that no mental disorder met listing criteria prior to july.
tr.the alj reviewed the record for indications that disability onset occurred prior to the july,diagnosis date,and found that the medical evidence did not support such a finding.while he did not specifically mention ssr,he followed the guidelines set out in the ruling.
mcclanahan claims that pursuant to ssr,the alj should have called on a medical expert to infer the date of onset in his case,because the claimant presented a prima facie case of disability and the burden shifted to the commissioner.appellant br.at.in support of this theory,mcclanahan relies on the following excerpt from ssr 
in some cases,it may be possible,based on the medical evidence,to reasonably infer that the onset of a disabling impairment occurred some time prior to the date of the first recorded examination,the date the claimant stopped working.how long the disease may be determined to have existed at a disabling level of severity depends on an informed judgment of the facts in a particular case.this judgment,however,must have a legitimate medical basis.at the hearing,the administrative law judge alj should call on the services of a medical advisor when onset must be inferred.
id.emphasis added.mcclanahan then attempts to buttress his argument by citing howard commissioner of social security,cir.in howard,this court stated the commissioner has the burden of proof only on the fifth step,proving that there is work available in the economy that the claimant can perform.id.quoting her comm r of soc,cir.the case offers no opinion concerning the burden of proof for the determination of onset date,nor does it even imply that the burden would shift to the commissioner.in fact,it states conclusively that the burden only shifts at the fifth step of the disability determination inquiry.
upon review,we find no merit to mcclanahan claim that the alj erred by not requiring a medical expert to infer an onset date pursuant to ssr.the portion of the ruling that mcclanahan relies on contemplates situations when an individual claims disability and there is no development of the medical record on which the alj can rely to ascertain onset.this is not the case here.in fact,mcclanahan medical record was well developed and carefully reviewed by the alj.
further,the alj did elicit testimony relevant to the disability onset date from buckner,a psychologist.buckner opined that mcclanahan organic brain dysfunction may have been caused by head injuries that he sustained in and,but he could not say so with certainty.during questioning,buckner stated 
buckner you know,the second one,the second head injury could be the cause of most of the problem.i not sure which one was the cause,but either one,you know,could have caused that organic brain dysfunction.and the second one could be the reason that he seemed to get so much worse.
alj but we really do know,do we 
buckner no.it pretty difficult know,with closed head injuries to know for sure.
tr.during oral argument on appeal,counsel for mcclanahan was questioned concerning whether he attempted to elicit testimony from buckner concerning the date of disability onset.he replied that he had not,because he believed the burden was on the alj to establish the onset date,and further,he believed that he had won once buckner had opined that the second head injury could have been the cause of most of the problem.
we disagree with mcclanahan assertion that the alj failed to follow the correct legal st
