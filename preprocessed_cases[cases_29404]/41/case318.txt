josephine cage appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york michael telesca,judge upholding a decision by an administrative law judge alj of the social security administration the ssa denying cage application for supplemental security income ssi benefits.although the alj determined that cage met certain requirements for being disabled under the social security act the act,et,he found cage ineligible for ssi on the ground that drug addiction or alcoholism daa was a contributing factor material to that determination.
on appeal,cage argues that the alj improperly imposed upon her the burden of proving that she would be disabled in the absence of daa,and the record did not support the alj finding that she would not be disabled absent daa,in particular because the alj lacked a predictive medical or psychological opinion to that effect.she therefore asks that the district court decision upholding the alj ruling be vacated,and that the case be remanded to the district court with instructions to vacate the alj decision and calculate retroactive ssi benefits.
we hold that the alj did not err in denying cage benefits,because ssi applicants bear the burden of proving that they would be disabled in the absence of daa,and substantial evidence supported the alj finding that cage would not be disabled absent daa.
background 
factual background 
josephine cage,who was born in,has an extensive medical history.over the course of these proceedings,she has offered evidence of numerous health conditions,including bipolar disorder,depression,suicidal ideation,dizziness,blackouts,memory loss and chest pain.cage has received periodic primary and emergency medical care for her health problems since at least,and with greater frequency beginning in december,when she was admitted to the hospital for a variety of ailments.she has not worked since november.her employment history to that point included work as a retail cashier,hotel maid and home healthcare aide.
cage also has a long history of drug and alcohol abuse,including alcohol abuse on the day she was admitted to the hospital in december.her ongoing medical care has included treatment for both daa and her other conditions.at least one of cage healthcare providers has opined that cage substance abuse made worse her impairments,and cage has acknowledged that her drinking was not helpful to her mental health.there is medical evidence that cage has attempted suicide only when under the influence although she testified that she has felt suicidal even while sober and that on the two occasions she reported hearing voices she had used crack cocaine.cage also once explained to a doctor that she felt depressed because she had spent her money on cocaine.
cage applied for ssi benefits on may,claiming that her various health impairments rendered her unable to work.after her application was initially denied,cage proceeded in may to an alj hearing in rochester,new york,at which she was represented by counsel.
in a decision dated august,the alj issued his findings and conclusions.based on the medical records and cage testimony at the hearing,the alj found that cage suffered from the following severe impairments polysubstance dependence disorder,personality disorder,schizoaffective disorder and syncope.in view of those impairments,he determined that cage met the regulatory requirements for affective disorder,personality disorder and substance addiction disorder,see pt,subpt.p,app.however,the alj further determined that in the absence of her drug and alcohol abuse,cage would not meet the requirements for those disorders.he also concluded,based on the testimony of a vocational expert,that cage would be able to work absent daa.he therefore found her not disabled within the meaning of the act.the record did not contain any consultive opinion predicting cage health and functionality in the absence of daa rather,in making his findings,the alj relied on the record as a whole.
in june,the ssa appeals council denied cage request for review,making the alj ruling the final decision of the commissioner of social security the commissioner on cage may application.
on august,cage reapplied for ssi benefits.in december,the same alj who had denied her first application found cage disabled and entitled to benefits as of the date of her reapplication.in particular,the alj concluded that daa was not a contributing factor material to the second determination of disability because there was no evidence of daa since the august,onset date of cage reapplication.
ii.procedural background 
having received benefits upon her second application,cage in this suit seeks retroactive benefits,for the period between her and applications,to which she believes she is entitled by virtue of her first application.
in august,around the time she reapplied for benefits,cage challenged the alj decision on her initial application in the district court.she contended that the alj had applied the wrong legal standards and that his decision was not supported by substantial evidence.the district court disagreed and granted the commissioner motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to u.g and.c.see cage astrue,cv,wl.relevant to this appeal,the district court held that t here is substantial evidence in the record that supports the alj determination that cage substance abuse was a key factor contributing to her disability cage has the burden of proving that absent her drug and alcohol abuse,she would still be disabled and cage failed to satisfy that burden,wl,at.
cage appealed the district court ruling to this court.at our request,the parties briefed two issues in particular whether cage had the burden of proof before the alj with respect to whether her daa was a contributing factor material to the determination of disability and whether the alj erred by finding that cage daa was a contributing factor where there was no medical opinion specifically addressing that issue.see order appointing counsel,cage comm r of soc,cv cir.
discussion 
standard of review 
when reviewing an appeal from a denial of ssi benefits,our focus is not so much on the district court ruling as it is on the administrative ruling.rivera sullivan,cir internal quotation marks omitted.but we do not substitute our judgment for the agency,see veino barnhart,cir,or determine de novo whether the claimant is disabled,schaal apfel,cir internal quotation marks omitted.instead,this court is limited to determining whether the ssa conclusions were supported by substantial evidence in the record and were based on a correct legal standard.lamay comm r of soc,cir see also moran astrue,cir w e conduct a plenary review of the administrative record to determine if there is substantial evidence,considering the record as a whole,to support the commissioner decision.substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.halloran barnhart,cir per curiam quoting richardson perales,d.in our review,we defer to the commissioner resolution of conflicting evidence.clark comm r of soc,cir.
ii.the burden of proof on daa materiality 
cage first argues that the alj erred by requiring that she prove that she still would be disabled in the absence of her drug and alcohol abuse.she contends that the burden was on the commissioner to prove that she would not be disabled absent daa.
an ssi applicant qualifies as disabled under the act if she is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.d a.this determination is reached through a fivestep process 
first,the commissioner considers whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity.where the claimant is not,the commissioner next considers whether the claimant has a severe impairment that significantly limits her physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.if the claimant suffers such an impairment,the third inquiry is whether,based solely on m
