petitioners marek and jolanta milik collectively,the miliks,on behalf of their son,appeal the final judgment of the united states court of federal claims affirming a special master decision denying compensation under the national childhood vaccine injury act of codified as amended at to the vaccine act.milik sec y of health human.the special master found that the miliks failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a measles,mumps,and rubella mmr vaccine caused to develop a severe neurological condition,involving developmental delay,spastic diplegia,and motor difficulties.milik sec y of health human,wl,special master decision.because the court of federal claims correctly concluded that the special master decision was not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,we affirm.
background 
factual background 
the relevant facts are primarily those found by the special master in his detailed october,decision.was born on december,and was raised in a predominately household.special master decision,wl,at.at routine examination,the pediatrician noted that was doing well and was a well child.id.in december,when was two years old,his pediatrician noted that responded to sound,used to words mama and dada were noted specifically,walked up stairs,and walked independently.id.during subsequent visits in,new pediatrician,mitchell weiler,noted that could speak several words in english.id.
on january,when was four years and one month old,he received his second mmr vaccination.id.eleven days later,returned to weiler office complaining of a sore throat.weiler diagnosed with pharyngitis throat swelling and otitis media ear infection,and treated him with an antibiotic.id.weiler rechecked ears on february.his notes from that appointment stated that had a trauma.and that he had a limp,but he was seen by a podiatrist and the were negative.id.at.
on march,saw joseph maytal,a pediatric neurologist,for complaints of limping.id.maytal made several observations during the examination,including that did not know his last name,he only spoke single words in english,and his parents were unsure if he could use plurals.id.maytal gave a provisional diagnosis of and developmental delay.id.he also opined that had two issues 
one is the longstanding issue of this youngster who is globally delayed mostly in the skills but also in his fine motor and possibly in his gross motor skills the second issue is his acute symptoms of limping.as a precaution i would like to consider the reason for his limping with an mri.
id.emphasis added.according to maytal,the mri showed diffuse white matter demyelination which is consistent with demyelinating process most likely some form of leukodystrophy.id.
in july,saw krystyna wisniewski,a pediatric neurologist who was part of an interdisciplinary team of specialists at the george jervis clinic,new york state institute for basic research in developmental disabilities ibr.wisniewski noted that cognitive function seems to be appropriate for his chronological age.he knows colors,numbers,and follows three step commands.his visual perception seems to be impaired.milik.at.wisniewski diagnosed with spastic diplegia,more right than left.special master decision,wl,at.
maria malinowska,a bilingual psychologist,evaluated in september.id.at.she determined that,at four years and nine months of age,had motor and difficulties as well as attentional problems.id.malinowska concluded that these difficulties are most likely due to an organic brain dysfunction interfere sic with his intellectual and adaptive functioning.id.also saw ricardo madrid for a neuromuscular evaluation.madrid opined that condition was suggestive but not diagnostic of post infectious or post vaccination acute encephalomyelitis.id.but because did not experience seizure,fever,and altered mental state symptoms that are typically expected with a vaccine complication madrid doubted that disorder arose from a neurological complication associated with mmr vaccination.id.
the medical records provide little information regarding care after.a group of physicians condition beginning in.at that time,was and unable to care for himself.in march,when he was eighteen years old,saw a specialist in medical genetics who opined that t he finding of apparently normal development followed by a sudden loss of abilities following an insult with severe demyelination is suggestive of vanishing white matter disease.this often presents during childhood with ataxia following infection or fright.id.at.
procedural history 
the miliks filed a petition for compensation on january,on behalf of,alleging that he suffered injuries including spastic diplegia paraplegia causing him to walk with a permanent and debilitating limp,severe gross and fine motor difficulties as well as difficulties learning,all of which were by administration of the mmr vaccination.milik.at.the secretary filed a report opposing the petition for compensation.at the miliks request,proceedings were delayed for several years to allow time to obtain counsel and file expert reports.
the miliks filed two expert reports,the first of which was a letter from logush,a pediatric neurologist at the ibr where was treated.in that letter,logush stated that history was suggestive but not diagnostic of post infectious or post vaccine,immunologically induced acute disseminated encephalitis encephalomyelitis.special master decision,wl,at.logush offered the same conclusion after he conducted a examination of in february.milik.at.although logush participated in a telephone conference with the special master where he stated that it was very probable that the mmr vaccine caused injury,he did not ultimately testify as the miliks expert.special master decision,wl,at.
the miliks second expert report,filed in november,was from nizar souayah,the neurologist who testified as their expert witness.souayah is in neurology,electrodiagnostic medicine,and neuromuscular medicine.id.at.souayah opined that condition was consistent with an extensive white matter disease that started approximately weeks after mmr vaccination and that suffered an encephalopathy or encephalitis,caused by the mmr vaccine,at that time.id.at.in both his written report and his testimony,souayah opined that the mmr vaccine caused injury because experienced normal health and development before the vaccine days after receiving the mmr vaccination,developed a limp no other cause for injury was identified,despite extensive testing and the mmr vaccine has been suspected of causing central nervous system damage.id.
in response,the government filed two expert reports from michael kohrman,who is in neurology and psychiatry,with a special competency in child neurology and sleep medicine,and also in pediatrics.id.kohrman opined that had a global developmental delay,and that his condition is likely to be a result of a vanishing white matter disease,such as an unidentified form of leukodystrophy,that began around two years of age when the first signs of developmental delay appeared.id.in the alternative,kohrman submitted that,even if symptoms did not appear until after the mmr vaccination,the cause would still more likely have been an infection from which was suffering at the time,rather than his vaccination.id.
in march,the special master held an evidentiary hearing and heard testimony from souayah and kohrman.both parties filed briefs.a year after the hearing,the miliks filed a motion for consideration of new medical evidence,seeking to introduce a letter from maytal,pediatric neurologist.id.at.in that letter,maytal sought to clarify that his use of the term longstanding in reference to global delay should be interpreted as a condition existing prior to examination,and that his group was unable to determine the time length of symptoms.id.at.the special master admitted the letter over the government objection.
on october,the special master issued a detailed decision denying the miliks petition for compensation.at the outset,the special master noted that,although both experts agreed that suffers from a severe developmental disorder,they disagreed as to the cause.weighing the expert testimony,the special master found kohrman the government expert more persuasive,and credited his opinion that the onset of developmental delay preceded the mmr vaccination.id.at.
recognizing that the parties presented condition as a single global entity involving both mental delay and physical problems,and that the miliks never argued that they were distinct injuries,the special master found no evidentiary basis to conclude that part of disability was.id.at accordingly,the special master concluded that the miliks had not shown by preponderant evidence that the mmr vaccination caused disorder.id.at citing althen sec y of health human.in the alternative,the special master found that did not suffer an encephalopathy or encephalitis even if he did,the more likely cause was an infection had at the time and the onset of limping was outside the medically accepted timeframe.id.at.
the miliks sought review of the special master decision in the court of federal claims,asserting three primary arguments.first,they argued that the court of federal claims is constitutionally required to conduct a de novo review of the special master decision.milik.at citing bruesewitz wyeth llc,d.second,the miliks objected to the special master onset finding,and his determination that kohrman was more credible and persuasive than souayah.id.at.finally,the miliks objected to the special master alternative findings.
in a decision dated april,the court of federal claims sustained the special master decision.the court began by dismissing the miliks constitutional argument regarding the applicable standard of review in a footnote,agreeing with the government that the vaccine act does not bar a petitioner from later filing a claim in an article iii federal court,and that petitioners reliance on bruesewitz is misplaced.id.at.
the court then considered the miliks objections to the special master onset finding that global developmental delay preceded his mmr vaccination.although the court found that some of kohrman inferences based on examinations were not,it concluded that the special master decision was not based solely,or even largely,on those records.id.at.instead,the special master based his decision on a number of other records,including maytal march diagnosis of longstanding global delay malinowska september diagnosis of delay in communication,daily living skills,and motor skills parents repeated reports that he suffered no cognitive regression and kohrman interpretation of two mri studies of brain taken in.id.because the special master onset decision was based on reliable evidence in the record,the court concluded that it was not arbitrary or capricious.and,because the court sustained that decision,it found it unnecessary to consider the miliks objection to the special master alternative findings.id.at.
the miliks timely appealed to this court,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a and f.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,the miliks argue that the vaccine act,and its attendant arbitrary and capricious standard of review,is unconstitutional because it deprives petitioners of their right to de novo review in an article iii court and even if the standard of review is constitutional,the special master decision denying compensation is arbitrary and capricious because it is unsupported in the record.we address each argument in turn.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
childhood vaccinations,though an important part of the public health program,are not without risk.terran sec y of health human.recognizing that vaccines can cause serious adverse side effects in rare circumstances,congress became concerned that tort liability and related costs might drive up the prices of vaccines and discourage vaccine manufacturers from staying in this market,and that normal tort litigation might leave many sufferers of injuries uncompensated.id.at citing,at,reprinted in.
accordingly,congress enacted the vaccine act in to increase the safety and availability of vaccines.id.at.the vaccine act created the national vaccine injury compensation program the program,through which claimants can petition for compensation for injury or death.see a.in doing so,the act established a compensation program designed to work faster and with greater ease than the civil tort system.shalala,d.the act requires claimants to seek relief through the program before filing a civil action in a state or federal court against a vaccine administrator or manufacturer for damages in an amount greater than.a a.
as originally enacted,the vaccine act provided the district courts of the united states jurisdiction to determine if a petitioner was entitled to compensation under the program.national childhood vaccine injury act of,pub,a,stat.the district court would designate a special master to prepare proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.id.at c,stat.at.the act provided that,upon objection to the proposed findings of fact or conclusions of law prepared by the special master or upon the court own motion,the court shall undertake a review of the record of the proceedings and may thereafter make a de novo determination of any matter and issue its judgment accordingly,including findings of fact and conclusions of law,or remand for further proceedings.id.at d,stat.at.
the vaccine compensation amendments of transferred jurisdiction from district courts of the united states to the united states claims court.see omnibus budget reconciliation act of,pub,stat,to amending congress subsequently amended the act to establish,within the united states claims court,an office of special masters to review compensation claims.see omnibus budget reconciliation act of,pub,e,stat,amending.at the same time,congress changed the standard of review.rather than de novo review,the amendment provided that the claims court shall have jurisdiction to set aside any findings of fact or conclusion of law of the special master found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law and issue its own findings of fact and conclusion of law.id.at h b,stat.at codified at e b.by statute,the court of federal claims judgment may be reviewed in this court.f.
we review an appeal from the court of federal claims in a vaccine act case de novo,applying the same standard of review that court applied in reviewing the special master decision.broekelschen sec y of health human,citing andreu sec y of health human.although we review legal determinations without deference,we review the special master factual findings under the arbitrary and capricious standard.griglock sec y of health human,see hines sec.of health human,in effect,then,we review the underlying decision of the special master under the arbitrary and capricious standard of e b.
the arbitrary and capricious standard is difficult for an appellant to satisfy with respect to any issue,but particularly with respect to an issue that turns on the weighing of evidence by the trier of fact.lampe sec y of health human.if the special master has considered the relevant evidence of record,drawn plausible inferences and articulated a rational basis for the decision,then reversible error is extremely difficult to demonstrate.hines,at.as this court has recognized 
congress assigned to a group of specialists,the special masters within the court of federal claims,the unenviable job of sorting through these painful cases and,based upon their accumulated expertise in the field,judging the merits of the individual claims.the statute makes clear that,on review,the court of federal claims is not to second guess the special masters conclusions the standard of review is uniquely deferential for what is essentially a judicial process.our cases make clear that,on our review of the judgment of the court of federal claims,we remain equally deferential.that level of deference is especially apt in a case in which the medical evidence of causation is in dispute.
hodges sec y of health human,internal citations omitted.accordingly,we do not reweigh the factual evidence,assess whether the special master correctly evaluated the evidence,or examine the probative value of the evidence or the credibility of the witnesses these are all matters within the purview of the fact finder.porter sec y of health human,citing broekelschen,at.rather,as long as the special master conclusion is based on evidence in the record that is not wholly implausible,we are compelled to uphold that finding as not being arbitrary or capricious.cedillo sec y of health human,citation omitted.
on appeal,the miliks argue that the vaccine act unconstitutionally denies them access to de novo review in an article iii court.specifically,they argue that,by limiting a vaccine injury claimant to filing a claim against the secretary in an article i court,the vaccine act has deprived petitioners of the rights granted in article iii of the united states constitution and the common law protections afforded in state courts for tortious injuries against the manufacturers of vaccines.pet rs br.the miliks point to two recent supreme court decisions which they argue,when taken together,support their argument that the vaccine act is unconstitutional bruesewitz wyeth llc,d,and stern marshall,d.
in bruesewitz,the court held that the vaccine act all claims against vaccine manufacturers brought by plaintiffs who seek compensation for injury or death caused by vaccine side effects.at.there,the court considered b,which provides that 
no vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after october,if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.
given the statutory text,the court concluded that,as long as there was proper manufacture and warning,any remaining side effects,including those resulting from design defects,are deemed to have been unavoidable.claims are therefore preempted.id.at.
the miliks also cite the supreme court decision in stern,which reiterated that 
congress may not withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which,from its nature,is the subject of a suit at the common law,or in equity,or admiralty.murray lessee hoboken land improvement,how.when a suit is made of the stuff of the traditional actions at common law tried by the courts at westminster in,and is brought within the bounds of federal jurisdiction,the responsibility for deciding that suit rests with article iii judges in article iii courts.the constitution assigns that job resolution of the mundane as well as the glamorous,matters of common law and statute as well as constitutional law,issues of fact as well as issues of law to the judiciary.
at citation omitted.applying these principles in stern,the court held that an article i bankruptcy court lacked the constitutional authority to enter a final judgment on a state law counterclaim that is not resolved in the process of ruling on a creditor proof of claim.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court noted that it was not dealing with a situation in which congress devised an expert and inexpensive method for dealing with a class of questions of fact which are particularly suited to examination and determination by an administrative agency specially assigned to that task.id.at citation omitted.instead,the experts in the federal system at resolving common law counterclaims such as vickie tortious interference counterclaim are the article iii courts,and it is with those courts that her claim must stay.id 
the miliks briefing on stern is sparse,and the government response does not address it.at oral argument,counsel for the miliks clarified their position as follows 
under the original understanding of the act,there was an opportunity for a petitioner to reject the judgment in the vaccine court or elect to proceed in a state or federal court under common law or under state statutes.that is now gone.we submit that a litigant bringing these kinds of claims is entitled to de novo review in an article iii court,as it traditionally would be available.
oral argument at,available at http.the miliks suggest that,in light of stern which says that,unless certain exceptions apply,congress can not take away access to article iii courts for resolution of common law claims the supreme court decision in bruesewitz rendered the vaccine act unconstitutional because it does just that.we disagree.
the separation of powers concerns at play in stern are not implicated by bruesewitz.in the vaccine context,the only questions the special master addresses are those related to the fact of injury and causation.no liability issues are determined by the special master it is a no fault statute that assumes the right to recovery whenever injury and causation are established.the design defect question is never addressed by the article i court or its special master program.
the issues that are addressed are not barred from subsequent article iii review.while the legal theories under which questions of injury and causation may be reconsidered by the article iii court may be narrowed by bruesewitz reading of the vaccine act,those questions nonetheless can be revisited.indeed,the miliks could revisit the very issues decided by the special master in the context of a manufacturing defect claim,breach of express or implied warranty claims,or even a contract claim if the predicate for such claims exists.thus,even if stern were applicable to these facts,its limitations would not be violated.
more importantly,however,is the fact that stern is not applicable here.the only constitutional question bruesewitz implicates is whether congress may preempt a cause of action altogether,such that no court may decide the claim.there is no doubt congress has the authority under the supremacy clause to preempt state law causes of action which conflict with the federal standards and policies set forth in a duly authorized federal statute.see lorillard tobacco reilly,d state action may be foreclosed by express language in a congressional enactment,by implication from the depth and breadth of a congressional scheme that occupies the legislative field,or by implication because of a conflict with a congressional enactment.internal citations omitted.that is precisely what the court in bruesewitz said congress did when it passed the vaccine act.see bruesewitz,at.we have no authority to disagree with that conclusion,and do not believe stern provides a vehicle for doing so.stern simply does not address the preemption of state law claims it only addresses who may decide claims that are not otherwise preempted.
because the court decision in stern does not apply in these circumstances,and because the court decision in bruesewitz has no bearing on the applicable standard of review,we continue to review the special master findings of fact under the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard.
b.the special master decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious 
a petitioner seeking compensation under the vaccine act must show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the injury or death at issue was caused by a vaccine.broekelschen,at citing c,a.a petitioner can establish causation in one of two ways.id.if the petitioner shows that he or she received a vaccination listed on the vaccine injury table,and suffered an injury listed on that table within a statutorily prescribed time period,then the act presumes the vaccination caused the injury.andreu sec y of health human.where,as here,the injury is not on the vaccine injury table,the petitioner may seek compensation by proving.id.
to prove causation,a petitioner must show that the vaccine was not only a cause of the injury but also a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.shyface sec y of health human.specifically,the petitioner must show the following by a preponderance of the evidence a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination to the injury a logical sequence of cause and effect demonstrating that the vaccination caused the injury and a proximate temporal relationship between the vaccine and the injury.althen sec y of health human.if the petitioner satisfies this burden,he is entitled to compensation unless the government can show by a preponderance of th
