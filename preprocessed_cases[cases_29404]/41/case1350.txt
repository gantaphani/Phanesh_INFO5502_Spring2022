carol glaser received medical treatment from wound care consultants and was later contacted by an attorney who told her that wound care might have improperly billed medicaid for her treatment.she filed this qui tam action under the false claims act fca,seeking recovery as a relator for money the government paid as a result of alleged false or fraudulent medicare and medicaid claims submitted by wound care.but the government was already aware of the possible improprieties in wound care billing practices and had commenced an investigation more than four months before glaser filed her lawsuit.accordingly,the district court dismissed glaser complaint for lack of jurisdiction under e,which blocks jurisdiction if the fca action is based upon a public disclosure of the alleged fraudulent conduct unless the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.glaser appealed.
the threshold jurisdictional question in this case requires us to determine whether glaser lawsuit is based upon a public disclosure of wound care alleged fraudulent billing practices.we take this opportunity to revisit our prior interpretation of the phrase based upon in e a.in united states bank of farmington,we held that an fca lawsuit is based upon a public disclosure and therefore subject to the jurisdictional bar of e when the lawsuit depends essentially upon publicly disclosed information and is actually derived from such information,cir.although we reaffirmed the bank of farmington holding in united states ex rel.fowler caremark rx,we acknowledged that it is the minority interpretation,cir.to date,eight other circuits have read the phrase based upon in e a more broadly,holding that an fca lawsuit is based upon a public disclosure when the relator complaint describes allegations or transactions that are substantially similar to those already in the public domain.
we now conclude that the majority interpretation of the phrase based upon in the fca jurisdictional we acknowledged in caremark was supported by powerful arguments,at the better one.the approach we adopted in bank of farmington is problematic because it essentially eliminates the original source exception to the bar and therefore upsets the balance struck in e between two competing policy goals blocking opportunistic lawsuits filed by plaintiffs seeking to capitalize on information already in the public domain and encouraging lawsuits by relators who have firsthand knowledge of fraud against the government.
when an fca relator allegations are substantially similar to information about an alleged fraud that is already publicly disclosed,the statute permits the relator to avoid the jurisdictional bar only if he has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing a qui tam action.e b.yet under bank of farmington understanding of when an fca lawsuit is based upon publicly disclosed information,the exception serves no purpose.that is,if the jurisdictional bar kicks in only if the allegations in the relator lawsuit are actually derived from a public disclosure,there is no point in asking whether the relator was an original source of the can not be.under our present approach,the entire whether the relator had direct and independent knowledge of the information and voluntarily provided it to the superfluous.accordingly,we overrule the interpretation adopted in bank of farmington and caremark and hold that an fca relator complaint is based upon publicly disclosed allegations or transactions when the allegations in the relator complaint are substantially similar to allegations already in the public domain 
applying this standard to glaser case,we affirm the district court application of the jurisdictional bar.allegations that wound care was improperly billing medicare and medicaid for services performed by physician assistants were publicly disclosed in early when the government notified wound care that it was investigating these billing practices.glaser complaint is based on this publicly disclosed information in that her allegations of fraudulent billing are substantially similar to those the government had already lodged against wound care in its investigation.glaser can not show she is an original source of the allegations in her complaint because she learned about wound care alleged fraudulent billing from her attorney and then asserted the privilege to avoid divulging how her attorney learned of this information.the district court properly dismissed glaser complaint for lack of jurisdiction.
background 
both medicare and medicaid comprehensively regulate how providers may obtain reimbursement for services provided by physician assistants.there are some differences in the regulatory framework for each program,reflecting the fact that medicare is administered at the federal level by the department of health and human services and is applied uniformly throughout every state while medicaid programs are administered at the state level according to rules each state promulgates.we can simplify our analysis in this case by assuming that the general rule under these programs is that physician assistants must bill medicare and medicaid at a lower rate for the work they do than if the same work had been performed by a doctor.however,a provider may use a doctor identification number to bill medicare and medicaid for services performed by a physician thus obtain reimbursement at the doctor the assistant rendered services incident to the services of a physician.most relevant for purposes of this case,an assistant services are incident to a physician services only if the doctor directly supervises the assistant performance.
steven miller and melissa miller own wound care consultants,which,as its name indicates,provides services.in january,nearly four months before this lawsuit was filed,a nurse with the federal centers for medicare medicaid services cms contacted wound care to discuss billing irregularities that had been identified in a routine agency audit.according to a march letter from cms wound care allowed an advanced registered nurse practitioner to use miller identification number to bill medicare at a higher representing that the nurse practitioner services were incident to the services of a though miller did not supervise the nurse practitioner activity.cms eventually expanded its audit to review all medicare claims submitted using miller identification number.from march to december,cms periodically sent letters asking wound care to repay funds it received at the higher doctor rate rather than at the lower assistant rate.wound care claims it repaid everything cms asked it to.
the relator in this case,carol glaser,is a medicaid recipient with syndrome,respiratory failure,and arthritis.as a result of her conditions,glaser had numerous wounds that required treatment.beginning in,glaser obtained services from wound care on at least occasions,and she says each treatment was provided by a physician assistant.glaser never saw how wound care billed medicaid,and she remained oblivious to wound care billing practices in general until her attorney in this case,mary lapointe,contacted her 
we have no idea how lapointe learned of wound care billing practices because both glaser and lapointe have invoked the privilege to avoid revealing lapointe source.we do know that these conversations inspired glaser to file this suit against wound care under the fca in april.the complaint alleged that wound care recorded glaser treatments as having been performed by a physician assistant incident to miller services.this practice was fraudulent,glaser asserted,because miller was not on the premises when glaser received treatment and therefore could not have directly supervised the assistant performance.
the government declined to intervene,and wound care moved to dismiss glaser suit for lack of jurisdiction under e because it was based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions and glaser was not an original source of cms investigation.glaser testified that she had no knowledge of wound care billing practices until lapointe contacted her,and neither glaser nor lapointe have revealed how lapointe learned of wound care allegedly fraudulent billing practices.glaser and lapointe nevertheless told the district court that they had no knowledge of the cms investigation when glaser filed her complaint in glaser view this was enough to show that her claim was not based upon publicly disclosed information because it was not derived from the cms audit.
the district court disagreed and dismissed glaser suit.the court noted that when glaser filed her suit,cms had already launched an inquiry into the same billing practices that formed the basis of glaser lawsuit.the district court also concluded that because glaser testified that all her knowledge of wound care billing practices came from her attorney and because glaser refused to say how her attorney learned of the billing irregularities,glaser had failed to prove that the lawsuit was not based upon a public disclosure or that she was an original source.the district court denied glaser motion for reconsideration and glaser appealed.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the district court dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.scott trump,cir.the jurisdictional inquiry focuses on glaser most recent amended complaint.see rockwell int l united states,d w hen a plaintiff files a complaint in federal court and then voluntarily amends the complaint,courts look to the amended complaint to determine jurisdiction.
the false claims act prohibits the submission of false and fraudulent claims for payment to the government.a.it also authorizes private citizens called relators to file civil actions on behalf of the government called qui tam actions to recover money that the government paid on account of false or fraudulent claims.id.b.to encourage private citizens to come forward with knowledge of fraudulent activity,the fca entitles prevailing relators to collect a substantial share of the funds they recover.id.d.qui tam actions are subject to a jurisdictional bar when the relator action is 
based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government sic accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
id.e a.as we explained in united states ex rel.gear emergency medical associates of illinois,t he bar is designed to deter parasitic qui tam actions,cir,and once information becomes public,only the attorney general and a relator who is an original source of the information may represent the united states,id.quoting united states ex rel.fallon accudyne,cir.
under e,the district court must conduct a inquiry to determine whether it has jurisdiction to hear a qui tam suit under the false claims act.first,it examines whether the relator allegations have been publicly disclosed.if so,it next asks whether the lawsuit is based upon those publicly disclosed allegations.if it is,the court determines whether the relator is an original source of the information upon which his lawsuit is based.see,caremark,at.at each stage of the jurisdictional analysis,the plaintiff bears the burden of proof.see c hagood sonoma county water agency,cir united phosphorus,angus chem,cir the burden of proof on a b issue is on the party asserting jurisdiction.
have glaser allegations been publicly disclosed 
for purposes of e,a public disclosure occurs when the critical elements exposing the transaction as fraudulent are placed in the public domain.united states ex rel.feingold adminastar,cir.feingold explained that a public disclosure bring s to the attention of the relevant authority that there has been a false claim against the government.id.the bar is designed to prevent lawsuits by private citizens in such situations because w here a public disclosure has occurred,that authority is already in a position to vindicate society interests,and a qui tam action would serve no purpose.id.
glaser contends that the district court erroneously concluded that the cms investigation into wound care billing practices constituted a public disclosure,which is a question of law.she believes that unless the allegations of wrongdoing have been widely disseminated,the government must take some affirmative step to publicize its investigation.nothing in e requires such a showing.to the contrary,we have held that allegations have been publicly disclosed when they appeared in a warning letter from an agency,united states ex rel.gross aids research,cir when they were the subject of a government audit,gear,at when they were included in reports prepared by a government agency,feingold,at or when information about fraudulent behavior has been provided to a competent public official who has managerial responsibility for the very claims being made,bank of farmington,at.
here,the allegations against wound care were publicly disclosed in an administrative audit or investigation,e a,when cms sent a letter to miller in march demanding repayment for wound care improper use of miller billing code.cms also made clear to wound care beginning in january that it was actively investigating its billing practices.although glaser correctly notes that mere governmental awareness of wrongdoing does not mean a public disclosure occurred,see bank of farmington,at,the purpose of a public disclosure is to alert the responsible authority that fraud may be afoot,and that purpose is served where that authority has itself issued documents containing information that substantiates an allegation of fraud,feingold,at.this is not a case where the government was simply aware of wound care billing practices.rather,the appropriate entity responsible for investigating claims of medicare abuse had knowledge of possible improprieties with wound care billing practices and was actively investigating those allegations and recovering funds.see bank of farmington,at d isclosure to a public official with direct responsibility for the claim in question of allegations or transactions upon which a qui tam claim is based constitutes public disclosure within the meaning of a.cms communications with wound care indicate that it had commenced an investigation by march designed to recover money wound care should not have received.when glaser filed her lawsuit challenging wound care billing practices in april,the critical elements exposing the transaction as fraudulent had been placed in the public domain,feingold,at,and therefore the allegations at the heart of glaser lawsuit were publicly disclosed by the time her complaint was filed 
is the lawsuit based upon publicly disclosed information 
to trigger the bar of e,it is not enough that allegations of wrongdoing have been publicly disclosed the relator allegations must also be based upon the public disclosure.glaser argues that her allegations are not based upon the cms investigation of wound care because they neither depend essentially upon publicly disclosed information nor are they actually derived from such information.caremark,at internal quotation marks omitted.
glaser argument rests on the interpretation of the phrase based upon that we adopted in bank of farmington and reaffirmed in caremark.those cases held that a qui tam suit is based upon publicly disclosed information when it depends essentially upon publicly disclosed information and is actually derived from such information.bank of farmington,at.this interpretation rested on a understanding that based upon normally means derived from.accord united states ex rel.siller becton dickinson,cir citing webster third new international dictionary.bank of farmington reasoned that if the purpose of the jurisdictional bar is to block parasitic claims filed by opportunists trying to capitalize on publicly disclosed allegations of wrongdoing,it should not prohibit a suit by a relator who independently uncovers evidence of wrongdoing through his own investigation even though his allegations are the same or similar to allegations in the public domain.at.
although the fourth circuit has agreed with our approach,see siller at,every other circuit to consider this question has adopted a different interpretation of e.under the majority view,a lawsuit is based upon publicly disclosed allegations when the relator allegations and the publicly disclosed allegations are substantially similar.united states ex rel.mistick pbt hous.auth.of the city of pittsburgh,cir accord united states ex rel.boothe sun healthcare group,cir.ass of nurse anesthetists allina health,cir united states ex rel.biddle bd.of trs.of the leland stanford,cir united states ex rel.mckenzie bellsouth,cir united states ex rel.findley employees club,fed.recovery,united states,cir united states ex rel.doe john doe,cir.these decisions generally concede that the approach adopted in bank of farmington is a faithful interpretation of the statute but nevertheless reject it because it renders the exception to the e bar superfluous.in addition,these circuits conclude that a broader interpretation is more consistent with the overall design of the jurisdictional bar,which balances the dual objectives of encourag ing private individuals who are aware of fraud against the government to bring such information forward at the earliest possible time,united states ex rel.barth ridgedale,cir,and deterring opportunists,who do not possess their own insider information,who will try to get in on the action and try to collect on parasitic claims when the allegations have already been publicly disclosed and the insiders have nothing new to add,caremark,at.information brought forward by relators in qui tam suits is less useful to the government once revelations about fraudulent conduct are in the public domain because the government is already aware that it might have been defrauded and can take responsive action.thus,the bar implements the congressional interest in paying relators only for useful information.ass of nurse anesthetists,at.
because our approach in bank of farmington and caremark is out of step with the approach taken by eight other circuits,wound care invites us to revisit it.although we must give considerable weight to our prior decisions,we are not bound by them absolutely and may overturn circuit precedent for compelling reasons.russ watts,cir.we have overruled our prior decisions when our position remains a minority one among other circuits,when the supreme court issues a decision on an analogous issue that compels us to reconsider our position,haas abrahamson,cir or when an intracircuit conflict exists,shropshear.counsel of city of,cir.each of these justifications is present in this case.
we note for starters that only one other circuit the fourth has adopted our interpretation.the third circuit has characterized the circuit split as a clash between two textual arguments one based on the ordinary meaning of the phrase based upon and one based on the precept that a statute should be construed if possible so as not to render any of its terms superfluous.mistick,at.the eight circuits that have rejected the interpretation have done so largely because,as the circuit has aptly observed,it swallows the original source exception whole.findley,at.
the exception permits jurisdiction over an fca action even if the relator lawsuit is based upon publicly disclosed information provided that the relator is an original source of the information.e a.the fca defines an original source as someone who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.e b.if based upon means actually derived from,as bank of farmington says,it is hard to understand the import of the independent knowledge component of the exception a relator who actually derived his allegations of fraud from and therefore based his allegations upon information in the public domain could never avoid the jurisdictional bar by showing that he has independent knowledge of the fraud.put another way,following our minority interpretation of based upon,once a court concludes that a lawsuit is actually derived from publicly disclosed information,asking the question never affects the jurisdictional result 
conversely,consider what happens when a court following the minority interpretation of based upon concludes that a lawsuit is not actually derived from publicly disclosed information.in those cases,the court has jurisdiction over the lawsuit whether or not the relator was an original source of the allegations in the qui tam complaint.thus,under our minority interpretation of based upon,the exception is extraneous no matter how a court resolves the actually derived from question.if a court answers the question in the negative,the exception is not implicated if a court answers in the affirmative,the inquiry is a waste of time.
despite this difficulty,caremark adhered to the bank of farmington acknowledging that the circuits in the majority had powerful arguments for rejecting the minority standard holds the trump card,the plain language interpretation.at.we now conclude that this places too much importance on a dictionary interpretation of the phrase based upon to the exclusion of other significant interpretive considerations.beyond the damage to the exception,other portions of e a would yield baffling results if we read them literally without regard to context.for example,e a refers to audits or investigations by the government accounting office instead of the general accounting office,as well as information obtained from criminal and civil hearing s even though the statutory bar presumably covers information publicly disclosed in trials,which are not commonly referred to as hearings.see also mistick,at describing other examples of poor drafting.as the third circuit noted in mistick,e is hardly a model of careful draftsmanship the drafting errors throughout e should make us hesitant to attach too much significance to a fine parsing of the syntax.id.at.bank of farmington and caremark parsed e finely,but their focus on the dictionary meaning of based upon alone was too narrow in the context of the rest of the statute.pace diguglielmo,d statutory terms are given their ordinary meaning in the context of the statutory scheme in which they appear emphasis added.
ultimately,the interpretation that carried the day in bank of farmington and caremark violates the principle that a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions,so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant a principle the supreme court recently described as one of the most basic interpretive canons.corley united states,d.we might tolerate this result if the inquiry added little or nothing to the jurisdictional analysis.but that is hardly the case.the exception requires relators to establish that they have direct knowledge of fraudulent activity independent knowledge of fraudulent activity and voluntarily provided their information to the government before filing a qui tam action.e b.if a relator allegations are actually derived from a public disclosure,the relator might be able to show that he has independent knowledge of the fraudulent activity and therefore bring himself within the second component of the definition.but to avoid the jurisdictional bar at the stage of the jurisdictional inquiry,the relator must also show he had direct knowledge of the fraud,a phrase usually interpreted to require the relator to establish that his knowledge of the wrongdoing was based on his own investigative efforts and not derived from the knowledge of others.see united states ex rel.laird lockheed martin eng g sci.servs,cir.
in addition,to be considered an original source,the relator must also have voluntarily disclosed the information to the government before filing a qui tam action,a requirement that is designed to reward those who come forward with useful information and not those who provide information in response to a governmental inquiry.see,united states ex rel.paranich sorgnard,cir.yet as we have explained,under the bank of farmington and caremark interpretation of the phrase based upon,a relator can avoid the jurisdictional bar by showing that his information did not actually derive from a public disclosure without a showing that he had direct knowledge of fraudulent conduct or that he voluntarily disclosed what he knew to the government.
to illustrate this,compare our decisions in caremark and united states ex rel.lamers city of green bay,cir,both of which concluded that the had avoided the jurisdictional bar.in lamers,the relator alleged that a city agency lied about its efforts to transport local schoolchildren on public buses in order to obtain federal grant money the relator had acquired this information by personally observing public bus routes to see if they complied with federal regulations.although the federal transit administration had issued an administrative decision several months prior to the qui tam filing finding that the city had violated federal regulations,the relator had conducted his investigation independently before the fta decision was publicized and voluntarily gave the results of his investigation to the fta.we concluded that the jurisdictional bar did not apply because the relator was an original had direct and independent knowledge of fraudulent activity and had voluntarily given that information to the government id.at.by contrast,in caremark we concluded that the jurisdictional bar did not apply because the relator complaint was not actually derived from publicly disclosed information.at.the relators in caremark were thus able to avoid the jurisdictional bar without showing they had direct,independent knowledge of fraudulent activity or that they disclosed their knowledge to the government before filing their lawsuit 
caremark justified its continued adherence to the minority approach of bank of farmington because it struck a balance between two competing policy concerns the fear that opportunistic plaintiffs would try to get in on the action when they have nothing new to add and the desire to encourage those with knowledge about fraudulent conduct to come forward.id.these are,as we have noted,the manifest objectives of e,but caremark went astray in thinking that the threshold based upon language in the statute addresses these competing policies by itself.instead,e must be considered in its entirety.
the threshold jurisdictional bar against lawsuits that are based upon publicly disclosed allegations addresses the first policy concern prohibiting fca lawsuits filed by opportunistic plaintiffs concerning information about fraud that is already in the public domain.by carving out an exception for original sources,the statute preserves the objective of inspiring whistleblowers to come forward promptly with information concerning fraud so that the government can stop it and recover gains.findley,at.the qui tam provisions of the fca are designed to encourage persons with knowledge of fraudulent misconduct,or those who are either close observers or otherwise involved in the fraudulent activity to come forward.barth,at citation omitted.bank of farmington interpretation subverts this goal by allowing relators to avoid the bar without demonstrating that they have direct knowledge of fraudulent activity or that they are not under any governmental compulsion to reveal their knowledge of fraudulent conduct.
we also note that while the minority interpretation tends to resolve the jurisdictional inquiry at the based upon stage,the supreme court recently implied in rockwell international united states,d,that the main jurisdictional focus is on the original source requirement.in rockwell,the court was asked to interpret the requirement of e b.one of the questions before the court was whether the phrase information on which the allegations are based in e b refers to information on which the relator allegations are based or information on which the publicly disclosed allegations that triggered the bar of e a are based.the court adopted the former interpretation and in doing so imagined a hypothetical relator who has direct and independent knowledge of different information supporting the same allegation.the court concluded that such a relator would be considered an original source.at.although rockwell did not address the meaning of the phrase based upon in e a,we think it significant that under our minority interpretation of the phrase,the hypothetical posited by the court would be resolved at an earlier step of the jurisdictional inquiry without ever reaching the question of whether the relator was an original source.yet given the sequential nature of the jurisdictional inquiry required by the statute,the supreme court discussion assumes that its hypothetical relator is subject to the bar,for otherwise there would be no need to address the exception at all.id.at.as this case comes to the court,it is conceded that the claims on which stone prevailed were based upon publicly disclosed allegations within the meaning of e a.see also barth,at a court reaches the original source question only if it finds the plaintiff suit is based on information that has already been publicly disclosed.this is another reason to rethink our interpretation of the based upon language in e a.
the facts of this case aptly illustrate the flaws in the bank of approach.glaser testified that she learned of wound care improper billing from her attorney,and her attorney said she first became aware of possible fraudulent billing practices in august.that means that more than months elapsed from the time that glaser attorney said she first learned of wound care conduct and the time she filed this qui tam action on glaser behalf.in the meantime,cms commenced an investigation of wound care billing irregularities and four months before glaser lawsuit was wound care of its findings.the relator provisions of the fca are designed to encourage private individuals who are aware of fraud against the government to bring such information forward at the earliest possible time.barth,at.the circumstances here illuminate the inconsistencies between the bank of approach and the statutory design.
accordingly,we are now convinced that bank of farmington and caremark gave undue weight to the dictionary interpretation of e without considering the phrase based upon in the context of the rest of the the exception.our interpretation of based upon as meaning actually derived from renders the exception superfluous and ignores the exception role in balancing the fca competing policy goals.the majority interpretation,as the tenth circuit put it,treats the question of whether a lawsuit is based upon a public disclosure as a threshold analysis intended to be a quick trigger for the more exacting original source analysis.united states ex rel.grynberg praxair,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we now adopt the majority position and conclude that a relator fca complaint is based upon publicly disclosed allegations or transactions when the allegations in the relator complaint are substantially similar to publicly disclosed allegations.to the extent bank of farmington and caremark interpreted the statutory phrase based upon differently,those cases are overruled.
applying this standard to glaser complaint,we conclude that her allegations are based upon the allegations that were the subject of cms prior investigation.as the march letter from cms to miller makes clear,the cms investigation focused on whether wound care had properly billed the government for services performed by its physician assistants.like the cms investigation,glaser complaint alleges that wound care overbilled the government for physician assistants services by falsely representing that they had been performed incident to a physician services.these allegations of wrongdoing are virtually pertain to the same entity and describe the same fraudulent is enough for us to conclude that glaser allegations are substantially similar to the allegations that were at the heart of the cms investigation.
glaser argues that her complaint is not based on the cms investigation because her complaint contains particular allegations of fraud that are not mentioned in cms january
