jessica magyar to whom we refer in this opinion using her former last name of houston lost her job at saint joseph regional medical center the hospital after she complained about perceived sexual harassment.she sued the hospital on the theory that it had violated the provision of title vii of the civil rights act of,a.reasoning that the evidence houston submitted in response to the hospital summary judgment motion could not support a finding of causation,or in the alternative could not show that the hospital stated motive for terminating her was pretextual,the district court granted summary judgment to the hospital.if we were the ultimate trier of fact,we would find this to be a close case.we are not,however,and we conclude that the record viewed in the light most favorable to houston would permit her to prevail.we therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.
while attending college,houston took a position on april,as a assistant scheduler in the hospital surgical department.she was classified as a prn employee,which means that her work hours depended on the needs of the hospital she did not need to conform to regular hours,did not receive benefits,and was not required to accept work hours when offered.the equivalent of a surgery scheduler position was covered by three people one regular employee carmen sanchez who worked,and two prn employees houston and mikisha williams,also a college student who together took up the other half of the hours.
one day,dale carl,a male,came into a crowded hospital lounge where there were no free chairs.plopping down on houston lap,he whispered you pretty into her ear.houston was not amused.this happened some time between her april hiring date and late july or early august.that was not the first instance of carl misbehavior.houston testified at her deposition that approximately one week before that incident,carl had also sat on her lap and whispered a comment about her appearance.she explained that i was hoping it was just a occurrence,and i did i did was my first real job and i really did know what to do.and i had to check to see,you know,like what are the exact standards in the work force.and then i knew once he did that the second time that i had to talk to her because it was not a occurrence.when carl repeated the same move,houston concluded that it was time to take action.
around the first week of august,houston reported the second incident to pam goddard,her boss.during this meeting,goddard expressed reluctance to speak to carl about the incident if houston was unwilling to file a formal complaint.in response,houston revealed that she had been a victim of sexual assault in the past and therefore she was sensitive to such behavior.goddard agreed to speak to carl and apparently did so later that day.although the dissent asserts that carl apologized profusely,nothing in the record shows that he ever said a word to houston or that she even heard that he had apologized to goddard.the reason is because goddard actually told him not to apologize to houston when he asked whether he should do so.
the dissent contends that goddard dealt with the sexual harassment complaint effectively,as no further incidents took place.but that is only half the story from houston perspective,there was no evidence that anything effective or otherwise had happened.goddard took no steps whatsoever to communicate with houston regarding any resolution of her complaint,and so a trier of fact could infer that houston especially given the earlier incident of sexual assault was left in fear that at any moment there might be a third incident.goddard does not even allege that she followed up with houston her deposition testimony reveals that she simply assumed that the matter had been put to rest i talked to carl that afternoon regarding houston complaint.i heard nothing more from houston regarding carl and believed the issue had been resolved to houston satisfaction,as i had spoken to carl,as houston requested,and no further incidents had occurred.
houston had every reason to wonder whether any action had been taken at all she probably attributed the lack of further incidents to her own attempts to avoid carl.when asked in her deposition whether carl did anything that houston considered harassing in nature after houston conversation with goddard,houston testified as follows no.but i also tried to stay as much away from any contact with him.you know,i tried to avoid any of the conversations that know,i tried to keep anything i had with him short.although the dissent asserts that houston sent an email to goddard after the meeting to express satisfaction with goddard handling of the complaint the email,this email was sent on july,weeks before the meeting in question,and did not pertain to the carl incident.
therefore,on september,having received no information from goddard about the resolution of the incident,houston complained about goddard failure to respond to her complaint to the hospital general counsel and organizational integrity officer,robert wade.sometime during the following week,wade contacted human resources hr,and hr instructed goddard to meet with houston again.on september,houston and goddard met twice at some point,the discussion turned from the incident with carl to the question why houston felt the need to approach wade.the next day,goddard emailed wade to report that houston issues are resolved.
goddard was mistaken.on september nine days after her first contact with wade,houston sent wade a formal letter addressed to whom it may concern,complaining about the manner in which goddard had handled her initial complaint and the new fact that houston job had been posted on the job listings without notifying her,in apparent retaliation for me turning her goddard in.houston affidavit and her september letter both indicate that she considered it inappropriate that she had to reveal her traumatic past in order to prod goddard into action.on october,goddard submitted to hr a job requisition form to restructure the position covered by prn employees houston and williams into a single regular position with benefits.the dissent defends goddard decision to expend budget funds on the payment of benefits by assuming that,if goddard did not use these funds,they would disappear in the next budget cycle.there is no support in the record for this factual assumption which interprets the record in the light most favorable to the defendant hospital,nor for assuming that this fact,even if true,motivated goddard decision.
in any event,houston was unable to bid for the new position because it conflicted with her class schedule.on october,the hospital gave the job,which now included benefits,to williams,who was the only person to bid for it since she had dropped out of college and freed up her schedule.two days later,goddard told houston that she remained classified as a prn and that she would be called if she was needed.
goddard statement turned out to be only half true.shortly after she told houston that she was still a prn,goddard told williams and sanchez to let her know if they needed someone to cover for them,rather than calling houston.the hospital asserts that the reason for this instruction was goddard business policy of covering shifts with regular employees whenever it is possible to do so without paying overtime,rather than using prns.between october,and april,houston was not called in to work at the hospital a single time.on april,she received notice that she had been formally terminated because she did not work enough hours as a prn employee during the relevant period on the termination form submitted to hr effecting this action,goddard marked no in the box asking whether the employee was eligible for rehire.
believing that the hospital had retaliated against her for complaining about carl harassment and for complaining about its failure adequately to address that harassment,houston filed this suit under title vii.the district court granted summary judgment to the hospital,finding that houston had failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation,and that she failed to show that the hospital assertion that it was planning to restructure her job was pretextual.
before turning to houston arguments on appeal,we should address a procedural point that the hospital has raised in support of its judgment.in the district court,the hospital moved to strike houston affidavit because it was unsigned,bearing instead solely an electronic signature.the district court denied the motion because houston submitted another affidavit on which her actual signature was added near the electronic signature.on appeal,the hospital asks this court to disregard houston affidavit and thus to evaluate houston response to its summary judgment without that information.
a district court ruling on a motion to strike an affidavit is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.mannoia farrow,cir.the hospital was not prejudiced by the initial defect in the affidavit to the extent that it was a defect at all in a world where electronic signatures are regularly honored,see,electronic signatures in global and national commerce act,requiring recognition of electronic signatures,uniform electronic transactions act,and indiana electronic digital signature act,burns ann.in any event,houston immediately substituted a copy with a traditional signature.the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying hospital motion to strike.houston affidavit is thus properly part of the record before us.
the only issue remaining in this appeal is whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the hospital.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.sound of music,cir.
a claim of retaliation under title vii may be established under either the direct method or the indirect method,which is an adaptation of the familiar framework set forth in mcdonnell douglas green,d.see stone city of indianapolis pub.utils,cir.houston has decided to rely on the direct method of proof.to establish a prima facie case this way,she must present direct evidence of a statutorily protected activity,an adverse employment action,and a causal connection between the two.haywood lucent,cir.we consider each element in turn.
statutorily protected activity 
the hospital argues that houston was not engaging in statutorily protected activity because,even by houston allegations,the retaliation was a response to her approaching wade to complain about goddard skills in retaliation for me turning her in,not her earlier approach to goddard to complain about carl alleged sexual harassment.
the district court implicitly rejected this argument,stating that e ven though the hospital is correct that houston complaint to wade about goddard ca be seen as a complaint about sexual harassment or discrimination,houston complaint about inappropriate touching by carl clearly falls within title vii protection.in support of her position,houston cites the district court decision in johnson county of nassau,d.the court there found that the plaintiff,who was director of the office of diversity,had stepped outside his job duties and therefore engaged in protected activity,because in addition to raising employee complaints of discrimination he complained that defendants were not fulfilling their duties under title vii in properly investigating these complaints.while that case is obviously not binding on this court and the facts are somewhat different,we find it persuasive.taking the facts in the light most favorable to houston,as we must at this stage,the complaint to goddard with the complaint to wade made up one continuous complaint process to which houston resorted.in effect,she was asking wade to ensure that the institution do something about sexual harassment there is not a hint that she had another,unrelated,grievance about goddard 
we note that,to succeed on a retaliation claim,houston need not prove that the underlying conduct she perceived as sexual harassment actually was serious enough to constitute a title vii violation.instead,she need only show that,when instituting her grievance,she had a sincere and reasonable belief that she was opposing an unlawful practice.hamner vincent hosp.health care,cir.the objective reasonableness of the belief is not assessed by examining whether the conduct was persistent or severe enough to be unlawful,but merely whether it falls into the category of conduct prohibited by the statute.contrast id.holding that grievance about harassment engendered by homophobia was not objectively reasonable and thus could not form the basis of a retaliation claim,because s exual orientation is not a classification that is protected under title vii.title vii does protect employees from discrimination on the basis of sex,and sexual harassment is a recognized species of such discrimination.
in this case,the record sufficiently demonstrates that houston subjectively felt that she had been sexually harassed.in addition,the lap incidents involved actual touching.this court has often recognized in the past that unwanted physical contact falls on the more severe side for purposes of sexual harassment.as we noted in patton keystone rv,cir 
our precedent provides some guidance on how to evaluate the severity of harassment 
on one side lie sexual assaults other physical contact,whether amorous or hostile,for which there is no consent express or implied uninvited sexual solicitations intimidating words or acts obscene language or gestures pornographic pictures.on the other side lies the occasional vulgar banter,tinged with sexual innuendo,of coarse or boorish workers 
at,citing baskerville culligan int l,cir.see also,worth tyer,cir the fact that conduct that involves touching as opposed to verbal behavior increases the severity of the situation.hostetler quality dining,cir.having a man old enough to be her father plop into her lap and put his lips to her ear to whisper you beautiful is the type of occurrence that,if it happened often enough,could constitute sexual harassment,and so houston grievance was objectively reasonable.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to houston,we conclude that she has shown that she engaged in a statutorily protected activity when she complained up the chain of command.
adverse employment action 
the parties do not dispute that houston suffered an adverse employment action.whether we look to her initial loss of work around october,when her prn position disappeared and williams received the new job,or we focus on her eventual termination on april with the added insult stipulating that she was not eligible for rehire,her case easily satisfies this element.
causal connection 
the last element houston must establish is a causal connection between her statutorily protected activity and the adverse employment action.suspicious timing,together with other facts,can sometimes raise an inference of a causal connection.lalvani cook county,cir paluck gooding rubber,cir.houston and the hospital argue over whether the window of time in this case was narrow enough to be suspicious.we can measure the time in several ways.the way most favorable to the hospital would be from houston early august complaint to goddard to her termination letter almost ten months later.the way most favorable to houston would be from her renewed complaint to wade on september when goddard realized that houston was not going to let the subject drop to the day when goddard submitted the restructuring request to hr,on october mere nine days.or one might look at houston first complaint to wade on september as the and her dismissal from her existing prn job on october,approximately a month later,as the.this court has found a month short enough to reinforce an inference of retaliation.see lang.dep t of children family,cir adverse employment actions began the same month plaintiff filed the racial discrimination grievance with his union.
although the lap incidents took place in early august and perhaps a bit earlier,we think that the approach most favorable to houston is to assume that the clock was restarted on september,because that is when houston complained to wade,the general counsel and integrity officer.from that point,it is at most nine days before the first sign of an adverse employment action,because by the september letter houston already knew that her job had been posted on the job listings.the fact that full execution of the adverse action took a while longer for bureaucratic reasons is immaterial.once the wheels were in motion,goddard submitted the requisition form on october,filled the position on october,denied houston work hours,waited several months,and then terminated her in april for working insufficient hours a flaw that goddard was able to engineer herself.
the hospital attempts to minimize the causal link between houston complaint to wade and goddard allegedly retaliatory restructuring of the job by pointing out that goddard explicitly stated in a conversation that she had no problem with anyone taking anything to the legal department.first of all,no trier of fact would be compelled to believe goddard protestation of.second,while goddard did literally utter these words,they are sandwiched between other words taken as a whole,a rational jury could interpret the conversation in houston favor.here is the full quotation 
i have no problem with anyone taking anything to the legal department but i am just curious when the situation was dealt with i thought it was dealt with very effectively it was a positive out come.you got what you asked for.and yet you still because you do think i said the right words or i phrased the right sentence what was your expectation of what you wanted to see happen after taking it to the hospital department.
hospital.imperfections in transcript of the conversation.a reasonable jury could find goddard statements defensive and accusatory.she comes across as having a substantial problem with houston decision to take the matter to the legal department,despite her perfunctory statement to the contrary.this,together with testimony from houston that goddard tone with her was defensive and irritated,goddard own admission that she felt shocked and bewildered when she learned that houston had complained about goddard handling of the complaint,and the fact that goddard posted houston job on the job listings within a few days of this meeting,is more than mere suspicious timing.it is sufficient to raise an inference of causation.
even if all that is true,the hospital argues,it is still entitled to summary judgment on the basis of what it calls unrebutted evidence that goddard already intended to eliminate houston job for a legitimate business reason.compare stone,at holding that summary judgment in favor of defendant is required when defendant presents unrebutted evidence that he would have taken the adverse employment action against the plaintiff even if he had had no retaliatory motive.
through goddard deposition,the hospital presented evidence that,upon taking the job of director of surgical services in june,goddard learned that two prns houston and williams were doing the job of one regular employee.goddard testified that she regarded this as an undesirable business practice,because the budget allowed for a position with benefits,so it should be filled in that way.the point about benefits was an odd one,given the fact that benefits impose substantial costs on employers.an august study performed for the small business administration reported that about of a business total compensation costs for hourly employees is attributable to benefits.see cost of employee benefits in small and large businesses,at,at www.sba.gov advo research rs tot.pdf last visited.it is unclear why goddard thought that it would be better if her employer shouldered that burden.also,she said,a regular employee would have predictable and reliable hours commitments though there is no evidence that houston and williams were ever unavailable when the hospital needed them.
it is true that houston responded only by commenting that goddard statements were,but this was just another way of saying that a trier of fact would have to evaluate everything goddard said and decide what to accept and what to reject.even without direct rebutting evidence from houston,the hospital evidence fails to establish that houston first would have lost her prn position and then would have been effectively blacklisted for all similar work until her termination in the absence of the retaliatory motive.it merely shows that the job restructuring might have occurred anyway at some point.on the other hand,a trier of fact might have seen goddard explanation of the timing of her action as only a post hoc justification.goddard stated 
i felt the situation i inherited two prn employees filling a regular,position would need to be addressed after dealing with the most critical issues facing the surgical service department through the summer of,i turned my attention to correcting the use of prn employees in a regular position in the fall of.
the hospital can not meet its burden on summary judgment by having the actor say only that she was thinking vaguely of restructuring the job and planned to do it when she got around to it.the fact that the hospital also presented testimony that goddard had not had a situation in which two prns were sharing a job in all her prior management years at the hospital does not compel a different result.to the contrary,the could conclude that the fact that the situation continued without being addressed for over three months indicates that there was no urgency or even inevitability about the hospital decision to terminate houston position.although the dissent contends there is no doubt that goddard intended to convert the prn positions from the time she came on board despite the delay in carrying out this intention,it is able to come to that conclusion only by viewing the evidence in the record in the light most favorable to the hospital.that is not the standard we must apply in our view there is enough in the record to entitle a reasonable jury to find in favor of houston.
because houston has established a prima facie case of retaliation and the hospital has not shown an absence of material fact on the question whether it would have taken the same action even without a retaliatory motive,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the hospital and remand the case for further proceedings.
the plaintiff,jessica houston,contends that the defendant,a hospital that formerly employed her,dismissed her from her job in retaliation for her having complained to the hospital general counsel about the handling of her claim of sexual harassment.there is insufficient evidence of retaliation to allow the case to go to a jury and even if there were sufficient evidence,there is no evidence of retaliation for engaging in protected conduct,and without that,there is no violation of title vii.the district judge was therefore right to grant summary judgment for the defendant,and we should affirm.
shortly after houston was hired as an assistant scheduler in the hospital surgery department,where she and another college student shared a position,pam goddard became the senior director of surgical services.she had worked for the hospital for many years and as senior services director supervised more than employees.the job of assistant scheduler is a responsible one.it includes providing scrubs to physicians,entering information concerning times for surgery that are given to the scheduler by a nurse,and ordering and picking up for use in forthcoming surgical operations.college kids who like houston were working only of a normal work week did not work regular hours and there was no assurance that either she or the other assistant scheduler would be available at all times when they were needed.goddard wanted to replace the two college students with a regular employee,and eventually she did.
but meanwhile there had been an incident at work in which a male employee had sat down in houston lap uninvited and said you beautiful,and another incident in which he had whispered to her an unwelcome sexual comment,though she has not said what the comment was.after the second incident houston complained to goddard.the latter was reluctant to take action because houston had not invoked the hospital prescribed procedure for complaining about sexual houston volunteered the information that she had been the victim of a sexual assault,though not by the same man or at the hospital.the same afternoon that goddard learned this,she spoke to the male employee about whom houston had complained.he was contrite,and there was no repetition of his offensive behavior.so,in a matter of a few hours,houston grievance was successfully resolved.
houston made no further complaints either about the male employee who she claimed had harassed her or about anyone else,and this is compelling evidence that goddard action in response to her complaint had been effective.the statement in the majority opinion that houston probably attributed the lack of further incidents to her own attempts to avoid the alleged harasser is a conjecture that has no basis in the record she did testify that she tried to minimize her contacts with him,but that is the natural reaction to someone who you think has harassed you,whether or not you fear further harassment.there is also no basis for the assertion in the majority opinion that by not reporting the conversation with the alleged harasser,goddard had left houston in fear that at any moment there might be a third incident.no reasonable jury could draw such an inference.houston had made no complaint about the first incident,after the second incident had said that she was in no rush to meet with goddard,filed no complaint against the harasser,made no effort to follow up with goddard,and waited two months before taking the matter to the general counsel.those are not the actions of someone in fear of a third incident of harassment at any moment.when she did eventually complain to the general counsel,she said nothing about fearing a third act of harassment.his notes of their meeting,reporting what she told him,state that actions have stopped.the harassment was a closed book.houston complaint to the general counsel was about goddard handling of her complaint.she told him she should not have had to share with goddard personal information in order to get action on her complaint of harassment.of course,she did have to share anything all she had to do was to follow the procedures specified by the hospital,and not claimed to be inadequate,for complaining about harassment.
at a meeting with goddard shortly after complaining to the general counsel,houston secretly recorded a conversation in which goddard said i have no problem with anyone taking anything to the legal department but i am just curious when the situation was dealt with i thought it was dealt with very effectively it was a positive outcome.you got what you asked for i am sorry that you feel the way you feel that as difficult i felt like it was handled well but obviously you did and you are entitled to your opinion.houston replied i said that at the end you handled it correctly after i told you all the stuff and i stand o n that.notice of the restructured job in place of the two jobs one of which houston had posted a few days later.houston could not apply for the job because a job would not leave her enough time for her college classes.
it strains credulity that goddard would have converted two jobs for college kids into one regular job with benefits merely to get rid of houston because of the latter criticism of goddard handling of her complaint of harassment.even that,as we shall see,would be enough to create a prima facie case.houston was not complaining that goddard had failed to deal effectively with sexual harassment.there was no harassment after she first contacted goddard,and she acknowledges that at the end you handled it correctly.that end came within hours of houston first complaining about harassment.it is true that the restructuring of the job came hard on the heels of the meeting the one houston secretly recorded at which goddard expressed irritation who would at houston having complained to the general counsel.but there is no evidence to contradict goddard claim that she intended the restructuring from the start and that the delay in implementation was due to her having more pressing matters to attend to in her new job.
the majority expresses puzzlement that goddard would prefer having one employee with benefits to two employees without benefits,since benefits are an expense.but her departmental budget allowed for a position with benefits,and it made sense for her to use the funds allotted for that position before they disappeared in the next budget cycle.the majority conjecture is based on a government report concerning average employee benefits,a report that makes no reference to the benefits expense of the joseph regional medical not all employers pay the same benefits.moreover,a employee who receives benefits is bound to be more dependable than one who does not,because jobs with benefits are tough to come by.workers are much less likely to have health insurance than in,percent of workers were covered by health benefits through their own employer,compared with percent of workers.employee benefit research institute,ebri news growing trend of workers feeds into overall decline of health coverage,may,www.ebri.org pdf may.pdf visited,to same effect,see peter fisher,elaine ditsler,colin gordon and david west,nonstandard jobs,substandard benefits,july,visited.and it is preferable from an employer standpoint to have one person doing a job rather than two splitting it,which complicates supervision and increases paperwork two separate personnel files.
houston points out that after the hiring of a regular employee to do her job she was still available for work,since the regular employee was sometimes swamped,but that goddard gave her no work.but goddard testified without contradiction that her practice was to offer work to other regular employees would certainly be the normal that there was nothing left over for the college kids.the majority opinion oddly describes this as blacklist ing houston.
houston argues that the fact that goddard considered her rude and disrespectful notably in secretly recording their conversation in violation of illinois law,ilcs a is evidence of retaliation.no it is evidence that goddard considered houston rude and an infringer of goddard legally protected privacy rights and ungrateful to boot,for goddard could have insisted that houston follow the hospital prescribed procedure for complaining about sexual harassment,but instead she cut the red tape and confronted the alleged harasser without requiring houston to file a complaint.it is not a violation of title vii to refuse to employ a person whom you consider whether or not reasonably rude and disrespectful,but in any event there is no evidence that that was the motive for the restructuring.
the majority thinks it suspicious that goddard felt shocked and bewildered when she learned that houston had complained about her to her employer lawyer.that is the natural human reaction to a groundless complaint to your superior.the majority reasoning places employees such as pam goddard in an impossible position if the employee reacts indignantly to being complained about,this is taken as evidence of retaliation but if she reacts by admitting that the complaint about her to her superior is justified,or by not protesting seems tacitly to admit that,she sets herself and her company up for a lawsuit with the admission as evidence for failing to handle a claim of sexual harassment in accordance with title vii.
the majority bolsters its argument that goddard was conducting a vendetta against houston by saying that after filling the restructured job goddard denied houston work hours,waited several months,and then terminated her in april for working insufficient hours a flaw that goddard was able to engineer herself.but if goddard wanted to punish houston,all she had to do was not give her an assignment.no work,no pay.what additional benefit did goddard obtain by formally terminating her why not have let her twist in the wind,always hoping she might receive an assignment 
i conclude that no reasonable jury could find a retaliatory motive in goddard actions.but if i am wrong and it could,it could not take the next step and find that the retaliation was for statutorily protected activity,that is,for oppos in
