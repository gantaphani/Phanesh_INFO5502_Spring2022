earlier this week,the supreme court decided that eighth amendment challenges to a state method of execution may properly be brought under.see hill mcdonough,d.we have such a suit before us today.in this opinion,however,we only address narrow issues of civil procedure.the result is that we affirm in part and modify in part,remanding for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
angel resendiz is a mexican national who was convicted of capital murder in texas in.his execution date,originally set for march,was reset by the state for june.the nominal plaintiff in this case is carlos magallón,the consul general of mexico,suing as resendiz next friend the consul general brought this lawsuit in march after resendiz failed to appeal timely a district court denial of his habeas corpus petition.see generally resendiz dretke,cir.the complaint alleged,inter alia,that texas lethal injection cocktail violates the eighth amendment because it subjects resendiz to a risk of unnecessary suffering.as to the propriety of the consul general suing as resendiz next friend,the complaint alleged that resendiz was not competent to proceed in his own behalf due to mental illness.
the state moved to dismiss,arguing that the consul general could not properly bring this action on resendiz behalf.in response,plaintiffs submitted extensive documentation in an attempt to establish resendiz incompetence.considering these documents,the district court held that it had not been presented with anything suggesting that resendiz could not pursue this action in his own capacity and noted that he was presently represented by counsel in his habeas appeal.it then dismissed the suit with prejudice for want of standing.the district court,after discussing the dilatoriness doctrine,also expressed the view that,if standing were present,then a serious question about the delay in filing would be raised.however,we do not read its opinion to expressly base the dismissal on dilatoriness.
following the district court dismissal,plaintiffs did not seek leave to substitute resendiz as the proper party in the district court.they immediately appealed to this court and sought an expedited briefing schedule,which this court granted.neither side has requested a stay of execution.in their briefing to us,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by dismissing the complaint for failing to sue in the name of the real party in interest.
ii.standard of review 
a preliminary,objection that the plaintiff is not the real party in interest is analogous to a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b.see charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,fed.prac.proc.ed.it presents legal issues that we will review de novo.see dennis ex rel.butko budge,cir holding that the standing of a next friend is reviewed de novo arguello conoco,cir questions of standing reviewed de novo.
once a district court has decided that an action is not prosecuted by the real party in interest,it must then decide what remedy is appropriate.we review a court decision to employ the sanction of dismissal for abuse of discretion.see wieburg gte southwest,cir.
iii.discussion 
we consider first whether the district court correctly concluded that the consul general could not sue as resendiz next friend.that question we answer in the affirmative.turning then to the appropriate remedy,however,we hold that the court abused its discretion by not affording the plaintiffs an opportunity to offer substitution.
whether the consul general can sue as next friend 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by holding that the consul general could not sue as resendiz next friend.under federal rule of civil procedure rule c,an incompetent person who does not have a duly appointed representative may sue by a next friend.the question for us,then,is whether resendiz qualifies as an incompetent person within the meaning of rule.
we have held that individuals are incompetent for rule purposes if they lack the capacity to litigate under the law of their domicile.see thomas humfield,cir.in texas,the standard is whether individuals,by reason of mental or bodily infirmity,are incapable of properly caring for their own interests in the litigation.lindly lindly,berger berger,dist,no writ.plaintiffs argue that the district court failed to apply this texas law and instead applied the ordinary criminal law standard for competency to stand trial.see.jur d,incompetent persons mental capacity is a comparative term that varies with the character of the act to which it refers.as noted above,however,our review is de novo.as such,if the district court reasoning was erroneous,we can ignore it.we apply the lindly standard recited above.
in response to the state motion to dismiss,plaintiffs presented evidence documenting resendiz mental illness.according to plaintiffs,resendiz frequently engages in,including banging his head on the door until it bleeds and cutting his face,chin,arm,head,legs,feet,neck and penis with a razor blade.he is also apparently delusional.plaintiffs document that resendiz believes he is a that after his execution he will only go to sleep for three days and that he ultimately will awaken with a renovated body to continue to do god work and to vanquish god enemies.
plaintiffs allegations paint a picture of a very troubled individual.the question,however,is not whether resendiz is mentally ill.rather,it is whether resendiz can care for his own interests in this litigation.lindly,at.plaintiffs allegations do not show that resendiz is incapable of doing so.according to plaintiffs own documentation,resendiz realizes that he will be administered lethal injection.he knows that the government will place a needle in his arm in an attempt to stop his heart,lungs,and brain function.he apparently remains able to consult with his attorneys with some understanding about their effort to challenge the lethal injection protocol that he knows will be administered to him.see reply br.at see also magallón,at.in any event,plaintiffs do not argue to the contrary.limited as resendiz faculties may be,he appears to have the legal capacity to maintain this section action in his own name.
plaintiffs argue,however,that resendiz capacity to consult with his attorneys is immaterial.plaintiff br.we disagree.an ability to communicate with your tell them your interests and to give them information to help them effectuate those to show that you have the ability to take care of yourself in litigation.the district court properly took this into account.
plaintiffs also contend that the complaint generalized assertion that resendiz was incompetent should be enough to entitle him to a hearing on the issue.such a boilerplate allegation of incompetency,however,was insufficient.vulcan materials city of tehuacana,cir here,the complaint did not contain a short and plain statement of the claim,only legal conclusions of such generality as to fail to give fair notice.this is especially true where the plaintiffs position on the issue was clarified by subsequent filings in response to the state motion to dismiss.the district court properly assumed that specific statements in plaintiffs response were true.since those allegations about resendiz mental illness,even if true,would not show his legal incapacity,the district court did not need to hold an evidentiary hearing.see united states powell,cir.
we also note that resendiz himself is represented by counsel experienced in death penalty cases,who litigated the habeas appeal in resendiz own name.that reality is fundamentally at odds with resendiz proceeding by next friend in this case.for these reasons,the court below correctly held that resendiz could pursue this action on his own behalf and,therefore,needed no next friend.
we hasten to emphasize the limits of our holding.that plaintiffs have not made allegations sufficient under rule to establish that resendiz is incapable of bringing a section lawsuit does not mean,necessarily,that he is competent to be executed.proceedings currently are pending in state court to determine whether resendiz is competent to be executed under texas code of criminal procedure article and
