in this appeal,we determine the proper standard of care in a case against the government under the federal tort claims act ftca,title,arising from emergency medical treatment provided at a military hospital in the state of florida.the district court held that liability should be decided under an ordinary negligence standard of care,and not the reckless disregard standard codified in the florida good samaritan act.stat.gsa.we also determine whether an administrative claim on behalf of a minor child satisfies the jurisdictional requirements of the ftca as to his parents claims,when the child claim states that the parents have suffered damages,but neither lists the parents as claimants nor provides a sum certain for their claims.the district court held that the child claim satisfied all statutory prerequisites for the parents claims.we reverse in part,vacate in part,affirm in part,and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
on august,at,tracey turner tracey,then a nine boy,presented to the emergency department of naval hospital jacksonville nhj while having a severe asthma attack.earlier that day,tracey his father,tracey turner turner,a naval corpsman and his mother,tracy turner turner,a practical nurse,drove to jacksonville from alabama where they had been visiting relatives.tracey had been suffering from the symptoms of asthma throughout most of the day,and he had made frequent use of his albuterol inhaler during the trip.when tracey arrived at nhj,he was able to see and to walk.lieutenant commander shane cline,cline,assessed tracey condition,found him to be in extremis,and concluded that he was appropriately triaged as an urgent case.turner united states,slip op.at,wl.
cline ordered that tracey receive the following treatments albuterol atrovent nebulizer,solumedrol,and magnesium sulfate.the district court found that at least half an hour elapsed before tracey received solumedrol,he never received the magnesium sulfate,and it is unclear if he received the atrovent.the district court also found that t he failure to administer these medicines as ordered by cline violated the standard of care.id.the nebulizer treatment was not effective,and the parties agreed that tracey needed to be intubated using rapid sequence intubation rsi.experts for both the turners and the government agreed that tracey need for rsi was apparent around and cline testified that rsi was indicated at,when tracey mental state deteriorated.at that time,tracey became violent,grabbed his mother by the hair,and pulled out his iv.the district court found that rsi should have been accomplished within five minutes of apparent need.because of various complications,numerous attempts at rsi were unsuccessful,and tracey was not intubated until.the district court found that the intervening events between the time rsi was indicated and the time tracey was actually intubated demonstrated that the navy was careless.id.at.
tracey survived his asthma attack,but he suffered brain damage and severe injuries resulting from oxygen deprivation.tracey incurred cortical blindness,which has permanently reduced his vision to in each eye,and is.as a result of his blindness,he had to withdraw from regular public school and enroll in the florida school for the deaf and blind.in addition,tracey has suffered problems,a loss of sensory function in his hands,and his performance in school has diminished from to.
in response to tracey injuries,the turners filed three separate standard form with the navy on behalf of three individual claimants tracey,turner,and turner.the first claim was filed on january,naming as the claimant tracey turner,by and through his mother and next friend,tracy turner.at ex.the basis for the claim was described as follows 
tracey turner suffered severe and permanent injury to his eye sight and to his ability for gross motor movement as well as disfigurement,pain and suffering and other intangible losses.and turner suffered tangible damages,including medical expenses past and future,as well as intangible damages consistent with a loss of consortium under florida law.
id.the amount of claim was stated as.id.on january,an attorney for the navy wrote to the turners trial counsel,acknowledging receipt of the first and requesting further information regarding and turner intent to seek damages individually on their own behalf.at ex.on february,the navy received two more,naming turner and turner as the claimants,respectively,containing the same description of the claim as provided in the original claim,and stating as the amount of each claim.after receiving the parents claims,the navy believed that the turners intended to divide the sum certain stated in the original january claim equally between their newly filed claims.an attorney for the navy wrote to the turners trial counsel,confirming that belief.the turners trial counsel responded by letter and explained that 
there are three claims filed in this matter rather than two as indicated in your letter.the first claim was filed on december,on behalf of tracey this claim is for the last two claims were presented and filed on february,on behalf of turner for and turner for,a total of three filed claims,totaling.
on august,after six months had passed from the filing date of the first,but less than six months from the filing date of the two subsequent,the turners filed their original complaint count i is a negligence claim on behalf of tracey count ii is a loss of consortium claim on behalf of turner,and count iii is a loss of consortium claim on behalf of turner.consistent with their administrative claims,the turners sought a total of in damages for tracey claim,and each for and turner claims.on september,after receiving the turners original complaint,the navy denied the turners administrative claims.
the government filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,or in the alternative,a motion for summary judgment.the government argued that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over and turner claims because the complaint was filed less than six months after their administrative claims were filed with the navy.the district court treated the government motion as a motion for partial summary judgment,having reviewed the additional material provided by the government in support of its motion.the district court held that the mention of and turner claims in the original was sufficient to place the navy on notice of their claims for loss of consortium.turner united states,slip op.at,wl.since the turners suit was initiated more than six months from the filing date of that claim,the district court held that it had jurisdiction over all three of the turners claims and denied the government motion.
the case was tried before the district court on counts i,ii,and iii of the turners amended complaint.the government argued that liability should be assessed under the reckless disregard standard of care codified in the gsa,rather than a simple negligence standard of care.the government also contended that and turner were comparatively negligent for failing to seek medical care for tracey earlier in the day.the district court filed its judgment on august.initially,the district court held that the version of the gsa would be operative in this case,if it were applicable to nhj however,since nhj is not a hospital licensed under chapter of the florida code,the district court held that the version of the gsa does not apply to nhj.then,in determining liability under an ordinary negligence standard,the district court concluded that the doctors and nurses at nhj were negligent in their treatment of tracey,proximately causing his injuries.finally,the district court held that there was no legal or factual basis for holding and turner comparatively negligent for failing to seek medical attention for tracey sooner than they did.the turners sought an aggregate maximum recovery of for their three claims.the district court awarded both economic and damages,totaling,consisting of for tracey claim,and each for and turner claims.
the government filed a motion under rules c and e of the federal rules of civil procedure,requesting the district court to find that the gsa applies to nhj in this case,to amend its findings of fact and conclusions of law,and to enter judgment in favor of the government.in response to the government motion,the turners conceded that the government was entitled to the benefit of florida good samaritan act regardless of whether or not nhj was licensed under florida law.the turners recommended that the district court amend its decision to find that the gsa applies to the government and that the government breached the reckless disregard standard of care.the district court denied the government motion and rejected the parties request to reconsider its ruling on the applicability of the gsa.the district court reiterated its holding that the version of the gsa does not apply to nhj because it is not a hospital licensed under chapter of the florida code.further,the district court found that nhj is most analogous to a private hospital which provides services to a select group of patients,rather than a hospital,licensed under chapter,which is required to provide services to all patients.turner united states,slip op.at.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction over and turner claims under the ftca 
initially,we must decide whether the original,submitted on january,was sufficient to notify the navy of and turner claims and fulfill the statutory prerequisites of the ftca.the turners initiated their suit against the government more than six months after the original was filed,but less than six months after the second two were filed.if the original did not provide the navy with sufficient notice of and turner claims,the district court lacked jurisdiction over them.we hold that the original presented only tracey claim,and did not satisfy the statutory prerequisites for and turner claims.
the ftca is a specific,congressional exception to the united states sovereign immunity for tort claims,under which the government may be sued by certain parties under certain circumstances for particular tortious acts committed by employees of the government.suarez united states,cir per curiam.however,this waiver must be scrupulously observed,and not expanded,by the courts.id.a federal court does not have jurisdiction over a suit under the ftca unless the claimant first files an administrative claim with the appropriate agency within two years from the time the claim accrues accompanied by a claim for money damages in a sum certain.dalrymple united states,cir citing,b a.the sum certain requirement of a serves a valuable purpose it informs the government of the maximum amount of a claim,enabling the government to evaluate whether to settle a claim or proceed to trial.see tidd united states,cir.before instituting a federal suit,the claimant must wait either until the administrative agency finally denies the claim or until at least six months have passed after the claim was filed.a.because t he ftca bars claimants from bringing suit in federal court until they have exhausted their administrative remedies,the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over prematurely filed suits.mcneil united states,d.
the ftca requires that each claim and each claimant meet the prerequisites for maintaining a suit against the government.dalrymple,at.thus,in multiple claimant actions under the ftca,each claimant must individually satisfy the jurisdictional prerequisite of filing a proper claim.id.citation omitted.if the claimant fails to provide a sum certain within the claim,the administrative claim fails to meet the statutory prerequisite to maintaining a suit against the government,and leaves the district court without jurisdiction to hear the case.id.at citation omitted.although we have stated that we take a somewhat lenient approach to the sum certain requirement,tidd,at,we have held that the ftca requires,at a minimum,that a claimant expressly claim a sum certain or provide documentation which will allow the agency to calculate or estimate the damages to the claimant.dalrymple,at citation omitted.
it is clear from the record that the turners intended to file three separate claims with the navy tracey claim for and and turner claims for each.tracey claim was filed on january,by the original,and the complaint was filed on august,which was over six months from the filing date of that claim.under the ftca,tracey claim was deemed exhausted and the district court had jurisdiction over it.see a.however,tracey claim did not fulfill the sum certain requirement of a with respect to his parents claims.even if the turners intended their original to present each of their claims,and an aggregate sum certain for those claims,that form was deficient because it neither listed and turner as claimants nor specified the individual amounts of their claims.multiple claimants may submit one form containing all claims,and provide an aggregate sum certain for all of the claims,but only under certain circumstances.see,campbell united states,finding that a single presented claims of mother,father,and minor child,because claimant specifically named both husband and child as claimants,described each claim,and the government treated all three as claimants during settlement process.
we find that and turner claims were not filed with the navy until february,the date on which the navy received and turner individual.these named and turner,respectively,as claimants,explained the basis for their claims,and,most critically,provided the amount of their claims.in this case,unlike campbell,the turners did not designate themselves as claimants in the original the only claimant listed in the original was tracey.further,the navy did not treat the initial as presenting three claims.even though the original may have indicated that and turner could potentially file claims of their own,they were not listed as claimants and no amount was provided for their potential claims.the navy concluded that the only claim contained in that was tracey and requested and turner to submit a separate if they intended to assert their own claims.we find that the navy acted reasonably by seeking additional information in response to the original.and turner each then filed an,establishing,for the first time,that the sum certain of their claims was each until the navy received and turner individual claims,no sum certain ever had been provided for their claims,as opposed to tracey claim.before the navy received and turner,the navy could not have known that they were making individual claims for each,or that the turners were demanding a total of for their claims.in fact,the chain of correspondence between the navy and the turners trial counsel shows that the navy was unaware that and turner were making individual claims for even after those claims were filed.instead,the navy believed that the turners intended to divide tracey claim into separate claims brought by each parent.at ex.the turners trial counsel then informed the navy that there are three claims filed in this matter,one for on behalf of tracey,and two for each on behalf of and turner,respectively.id.at ex.
at trial,the turners sought a maximum recovery of,which is consistent with the three,their complaint,and trial counsel correspondence with the navy.now,on appeal,the turners ask us to ignore the parents individual claims for each,and their affirmative representations to the navy that they filed three separate claims totaling,in order to conclude that and turner claims were properly presented by tracey claim and that the sum certain in his claim applied to all three claims.the turners argument lacks merit and,if accepted,would render meaningless the sum certain requirement.accepting the turners argument would require us to conclude that their three claims were a presented jointly in the original,and worth,and b presented individually in the subsequent,and worth.this is an untenable position.if the turners claims were worth either or,their claims were not for a sum certain.as we have explained,it is clear that the turners original presented only tracey claim for,not three claims with an aggregate value of.it is equally clear that and turner filed their own individual claims for through separate.the turners may not annul their individual claims and recharacterize tracey claim on appeal in an attempt to save the district court jurisdiction.and turner claims were not exhausted when they filed their complaint,and the district court lacked jurisdiction over those claims.see mcneil,at.at.since the turners could have prevailed at trial only upon tracey claim,the district court award as to and turner claims consists of damages to which the turners are not entitled.
we conclude that tracey claim does not satisfy the statutory prerequisites for and turner claims.because the complaint in this case was filed less than six months from the date and turner claims were filed with the navy,the district court lacked jurisdiction over those claims.accordingly,we vacate the district court award of damages on those claims 
standard of care 
next,we must determine the correct standard of care applicable to tracey claim.the government argues that the district court erred in applying an ordinary negligence standard of care to the duties owed to the turners by nhj staff instead of the reckless disregard standard found in the gsa for the reasons that follow,we agree.
we review the application of the ftca de novo.pate oakwood mobile homes,cir.under the ftca,the united states is liable for tortious conduct in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances after applying the applicable law in the same jurisdiction.the supreme court has stated that the words like circumstances do not restrict a court inquiry to the same circumstances,but require it to look further afield.united states olson,d citation omitted.accordingly,along with several sister circuits,we interpret the like circumstances requirement not to be as strict as an identical or same circumstances test,haceesa united states,cir t he like circumstances inquiry requires only that the united states be analogized to a similarly situated private party citation omitted stratmeyer united states,cir when deciding what the liability of a private entity operating under like circumstances would be,we note that the like circumstances comparison is not as demanding as an identical circumstances test would be.doe united states,cir w hat is meant by like circumstances is analogous circumstances not identical ones.congress chief intent in drafting the ftca was simply to provide redress for ordinary torts recognized by state law.pate,at.
whether nhj is liable for tracey injuries depends on whether a similarly situated private hospital would be liable for those injuries under florida law.under florida law,t o prevail in a medical malpractice case a plaintiff must establish the following the standard of care owed by the defendant,the defendant breach of the standard of care,and that said breach proximately caused the damages claimed.gooding.hosp,so d.if a defendant may rely on the gsa,the plaintiff must establish that the defendant acted with reckless disregard for the consequences of his or her actions.stat.b.as of the date of tracey injuries,the gsa provided that 
any hospital licensed under chapter,any employee of such hospital working in a clinical area within the facility and providing patient care,and any person licensed to practice medicine who in good faith renders emergency medical care or treatment shall not be held liable for any civil damages as a result of such medical care or treatment,unless such damages result from providing,or failing to provide,medical care or treatment under circumstances demonstrating a reckless disregard for the consequences so as to affect the life or health of another.
stat.b.in,the gsa was amended to apply to a ny health care provider,including a hospital licensed under chapter,providing emergency services pursuant to obligations imposed by,or.stat.b reckless disregard was defined in the version of the gsa as 
such conduct which a health care provider knew or should have known would be likely to result in injury so as to affect the life or health of another,taking into account a t he extent or serious nature of the circumstances prevailing,b t he lack of time or ability to obtain appropriate consultation,c t he lack of a prior relationship,d t he inability to obtain an appropriate medical history of the patient,e t he time constraints imposed by coexisting emergencies.
stat.b.the definition of reckless disregard was also amended.reckless disregard is defined in the version of gsa as conduct that a health care provider knew or should have known,at the time such services were rendered,created an unreasonable risk of injury so as to affect the life or health of another,and such risk was substantially greater than that which is necessary to make the conduct negligent.stat.b.
according to the district court,nhj can not rely on the version of the gsa because it is not a hospital licensed under florida law,and because nhj is analogous to a specialty hospital,which provides treatment only to a select group of persons,not to all persons.on appeal,the turners argue that neither the nor the version of gsa applies to nhj because nhj does not comply with the florida dumping statute.stat,and does not treat all patients as required by.stat.b.appellees br.according to the turners,the gsa can not be applied to nhj since it does not treat all members of the general public suffering from an emergency condition.id.at.
we conclude that both the district court and the turners seek to hold nhj to a stricter standard than the ftca requires.first,nhj is eligible to benefit from the gsa,even though it is not licensed by the state.second,nhj obligation to provide emergency medical services to all persons within its beneficiary population is analogous to the duty of a hospital licensed under chapter to provide such services to all persons.third,although the turners accept that nhj is similarly situated to a hospital,the turners essentially argue that nhj can not benefit from the gsa unless nhj operates identically to such hospitals.the ftca does not demand this degree of similarity between a military hospital and other florida hospitals in order to grant nhj the benefit of the gsa.haceesa,at stratmeyer,at doe.at.
under the ftca,our inquiry is not focused upon whether nhj operates identically to those entities specifically enumerated in the gsa,but whether nhj is sufficiently analogous to them in order to receive the protection of the statute.we find that it is.as a military hospital,nhj is not situated identically as compared with other florida hospitals.nhj exists primarily to serve the medical needs of members of the navy,and their spouses and dependents,not the general population of the state of florida.nhj mission statement reflects that its primary mission is to serve the medical needs of members of the navy,though i n an emergency,it may provide care to any person to prevent undue suffering or loss of life or limb.a see also.nhj is not licensed by the state,nor does it comply with the florida statutes listed in the gsa.however,the differences between nhj and hospitals do not prevent the government from benefiting from the gsa.in scheib florida sanitarium benevolent ass n,cir,we held that an armed forces medical doctor,exempt from florida physician licensing requirement,was eligible to benefit from the immunity afforded by florida collateral source statute.stat,which reduced a damage award against her.the plaintiff in scheib argued that the state statute did not apply to the government because the doctor was not licensed by the state.in the course of our reasoning,we agreed with the district court that,under the ftca,the most analogous private individual to an armed services doctor is a licensed physician practicing family medicine in the state of florida.id.at.we further recognized that the government was not,and the state could not require it to be,in compliance with the licensing requirements of florida law.id.at see also taylor united states,cir explaining that,by virtue of the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,a state can not require a military
