russell dingle and thomas rempfer relators appeal the dismissal of their qui tam false claims action for lack of jurisdiction due to the public disclosure bar.because we find no error in the district court decision,we affirm it.
background 
relators filed this qui tam false claims action in district court in october of alleging that the bioport corporation bioport made false statements and claims to the government when it supplied anthrax vaccines to the federal government that were manufactured in a manner inconsistent with the process approved by the food and drug administration and inconsistent with fda regulations.the amended complaint specifically alleges that bioport changed the type of filter from a stintered glass filter to a nylon membrane filter and that this change put bioport in breach of fda regulations,the fda approval process,public health service regulations,and bioport contract with the federal government.
bioport moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that public disclosures in the form of congressional testimony on the anthrax vaccine,newspaper articles on the subject,and internet web sites,eliminated the district court jurisdiction over the qui tam action pursuant to e a.bioport also argued that relators did not fall under the original source exception created by e b 
bioport provided the district court the materials it argued were public disclosures under the statute and requested that the district judge take judicial notice of the materials.the district judge took judicial notice of congressional testimony,including congressional testimony by marc zaid an attorney for a serviceman that refused to take the anthrax vaccine and testimony of chan director of special studies and evaluations for the national security and international affairs division of the general accounting office,a house committee on government reform report entitled the department of defense anthrax vaccine immunization program unproven force protection,and a newspaper article from the lansing state journal entitled documents hold anthrax secrets.
all of the judicially noticed items discussed different aspects of the controversy surrounding the vaccination of servicemen and servicewomen,and portions of each source discussed problems with the production of the vaccine at the bioport facility,the sole facility producing anthrax vaccine in the united states.defendant argued that this discussion of problems with the vaccine could lead one to draw an inference that bioport defrauded the government.relators countered arguing that the disclosures did not deal with the specific problems namely the change in the filters advanced by relators in their complaint or that the disclosures did not otherwise qualify under the allegations or transactions test used by this court.
the district court used these documents to determine that a public disclosure had occurred,that the disclosure was of the allegations or transactions that formed the basis of relators complaint,that the complaint was based on the public disclosure within the meaning of e a,and that relators were not original sources under e b.united states ex rel.dingle bioport,d relying on united states ex rel.jones horizon healthcare,cir.based on these holdings,the district court determined that it did not have jurisdiction over the qui tam action and dismissed the complaint.id.at.relators appeal two aspects of the district court ruling.first,relators argue that the district court interpreted the meaning of the phrase allegations or transactions too broadly and in doing so,impermissibly lumped their claim in with the allegations or transactions described in the disclosures.second,relators ask this court to reconsider its understanding of based upon and adopt a meaning relators believe to be better in line with congressional intent.

allegations or transactions 
section e a denies jurisdiction in qui tam actions when publicly disclosed allegations or transactions form the basis for the complaint.e a.an allegation connotes a conclusory statement implying the existence of provable supporting facts.united states ex rel.springfield terminal ry.quinn.a transaction is best represented by a formula created by the dc circuit 
if x y z,z represents the allegation of fraud and x and y represent its essential elements.in order to disclose the fraudulent transaction publicly,the combination of x and y must be revealed from which readers or listeners may infer z,the conclusion that fraud has been committed.
q ui tam actions are barred only when enough information exists in the public domain to expose the fraudulent transaction the combination of x and y,or the allegation of fraud z.id.at adopted by jones,at.
both the circuit and this circuit went on to further describe x as the true state of facts and y as the misrepresented state of facts.roe.at jones,at springfield,at.either a public disclosure which includes an allegation of fraud,or a public disclosure that describes a transaction that includes both the state of facts as they are plus the misrepresented state of facts must be present to eliminate jurisdiction in a case.
this circuit has addressed the question of jurisdiction in qui tam actions several times.in mckenzie,the plaintiff sued bellsouth alleging that it defrauded the government by falsifying trouble reports to make it appear that lines were repaired within hours or that an exception to the hour repair rule applied.united states ex rel.mckenzie bellsouth,cir.mckenzie alleged that bellsouth was falsifying these reports to avoid having to refund money to the government and other customers.id.the district court denied jurisdiction based on filings in two other lawsuits a tort action that alleged a similar fraud and another qui tam action containing similar claims against bellsouth subsidiaries in other parts of the country and the media publicity surrounding those suits.id.although the lawsuits and the publicity did not exactly mirror mckenzie complaint,this court agreed that the allegations were publicly disclosed prior to the filing of the suit.id.at.in jones,this circuit reaffirmed its holding in mckenzie by holding that jones whistleblower action,which was filed prior to her qui tam action,presented sufficient facts to create an inference of wrongdoing on the part of the defendant.jones,at.
in springfield,the plaintiff alleged that an arbitrator in a labor dispute fraudulently billed the government for days on which he did not work on the dispute.springfield,at.the arbitrator moved to dismiss the complaint on the basis that his pay vouchers and telephone records,which had been publicly disclosed,served to bar the qui tam action.id.at.the district court agreed,but the circuit reversed reasoning that the pay vouchers and the telephone records by themselves only met the requirement that the government knew about the misrepresented state of affairs.id.at.because fraud also requires a showing of an actual state of affairs,and the government had no way of knowing from the facially valid vouchers that the arbitrator did not work on the days for which he submitted payment requests,the qui tam action was not barred by those public disclosures.id.
finally,in fine,a relator filed suit against sandia national laboratory alleging that sandia improperly taxed its nuclear waste fund to provide research and development funding for its discretionary budget.united states ex rel.fine sandia,cir.the tenth circuit agreed that his suit was barred based on a public disclosure in this case,a gao report that indicated that,in general,doe laboratories were taxing nuclear waste accounts to fund r d activities.id.at.the tenth circuit determined that despite the fact that fine action alleged the sandia taxing with more specificity,the fact that the gao report described the doe lab practice in general sufficiently put the government on notice as to the potential problem at sa
