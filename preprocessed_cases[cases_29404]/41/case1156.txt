in this facial constitutional attack,cincinnati women services cws and walter bowers,cws medical director,appeal the district court judgment upholding two provisions of ohio house bill,a law enacted by the ohio general assembly in concerning the regulation of abortions.the first of these provisions limits minors seeking a judicial bypass of the statutory requirement to one petition per pregnancy rule.the second challenged provision requires women seeking abortions to attend,for purposes,an meeting with a physician at least hours prior to receiving the abortion rule.following a bench trial,the district court granted judgment in favor of the defendants.
for the following reasons we reverse the district court judgment that the rule is constitutionally valid and conclude that the rule is severable from the remainder of the statute.further,we affirm the district court judgment that the rule is constitutionally valid and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
in,the ohio general assembly made various substantive changes to ohio law regulating abortion,two of which are at issue in this case the rule and the rule.see cincinnati women servs.taft,d,wl,dist.lexis,at.
until,ohio law did not impose any restrictions upon the number of times a minor woman could petition for a judicial bypass of the prior rule.the amendments,however,included the rule,which limits to once per pregnancy the number of times a minor may seek a judicial bypass in lieu of parental consent.ohio law makes it a misdemeanor and a tort for any person to perform an abortion on an unemancipated minor unless the attending physician has secured the written informed consent of the minor and one parent,guardian,or custodian.ohio b the statutory amendment permits a minor woman to petition a juvenile court for a judicial bypass of parental consent if the court finds that the minor is sufficiently mature and well enough informed to decide intelligently whether to have an abortion or that the abortion is in the best interests of the minor.id.c.the rule further provides that n o juvenile court shall have jurisdiction to rehear a petition concerning the same pregnancy once a juvenile court has granted or denied the petition.id.c.
in evaluating the probable impact of the rule,the district court found that m ost judicial bypasses occur in the first trimester of a minor pregnancy.taft,d at,dist.lexis,at.the district court also found that there have been times when it was apparent that a bypass was denied because the minor failed by oversight to adequately discuss facts that the minor knew or could easily learn.id.at,dist.lexis,at.one witness,a magistrate in the cuyahoga county juvenile court in cleveland,testified that in such situations he has advised the minor attorney to file another bypass petition during the same pregnancy.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
the statutory amendment also modifies prior law by requiring women seeking abortions to attend an meeting with a physician for purposes.see ohio b.the meeting need not occur at the facility where the abortion is to be performed or induced,and the physician involved in the meeting need not be affiliated with that facility or with the physician who is scheduled to perform or induce the abortion.id.although ohio prior abortion regulation required informed consent before a woman underwent an abortion,the law did not contain any requirement that the meeting take place in person.see ohio b at least hours prior to the performance or inducement of the abortion,a physician informs the pregnant woman,verbally or by other nonwritten means of communication.ohio attorney general issued an opinion in interpreting the older version of section b to permit videotaped or audiotaped physician statements.see ohio op.att y,wl.the challenged provision thus changed the status quo to require that a woman seeking an abortion receive informed consent,by any physician,rather than verbally or by other nonwritten means.id.
cws is a healthcare provider that provides contraceptive services and performs pregnancy testing and abortions.see taft,d at,dist.lexis,at.when a woman inquires about obtaining an abortion from cws,her first contact is generally by phone.id.at,dist.lexis,at.cws employees inform her of cws abortion process and invite her to schedule two appointments.id.the first appointment is for an informed consent visit and the second appointment is for an actual procedure.id.
in evaluating the impact of the rule on cws,the district court found that the rule will have the practical effect of requiring all of cws own clients to come to its premises twice,once for the meeting with a physician affiliated with cws,and a second time for the procedure.see id.at,dist.lexis,at.the district court found that cws currently excuses approximately to percent of its patients from its normal protocol.id.at,dist.lexis,at.some women are excused from coming because of the distance of their residencies from the clinic,their lack of resources,or because of interference from an abusive partner.id.the district court found that to percent of those excused by cws are excused because of partner abuse.id.excused patients receive all the information about the procedure via mail and are given the opportunity to listen to an audio version of the informed consent video tape,and to speak with cws patient advocates.id.witnesses from two other abortion care clinic in columbus and center for choice clinic in that their clinics excuse to percent of their patients from their own protocols.id.at,dist.lexis,at.twenty to percent of this excused group are abused women.id.
procedural background 
several weeks before the act effective date,cws filed a facial attack against two of the act provisions,naming the governor of ohio and various other government officials as defendants.taft,d at,dist.lexis,at.cws sought injunctive and declaratory relief on the grounds that the statutory provisions are unconstitutionally vague and invalid under supreme court precedent.following a bench trial,the district court upheld both provisions.with respect to the rule,the district court reasoned that supreme court precedent does not require the state to afford a minor virtually unlimited opportunities to petition for a bypass.id.at,dist.lexis,at.assuming that striking down the rule would mandate limitless opportunities to petition for a bypass during the same pregnancy,the district court determined that such a requirement would conflict with casey in that the state could completely prohibit minors from even obtaining an abortion except where necessary to preserve the life or health of the minor.id.at,dist.lexis,at citing planned parenthood of se.casey,d.
the district court also held that the rule does not impose any undue burden even in the context.id.at,dist.lexis,at.to find otherwise,the district court concluded that it would have to engage in speculation and guesswork about the following what fraction of subsequent petitioners bypass petitions had been denied due to a lack of understanding of the abortion procedure whether a petitioner increased understanding in a second proceeding would be enough to tip the balance in favor of granting a bypass and what proportion of subsequent petitioners would develop fetal anomalies after an unsuccessful petition in the first trimester the district court concluded that a minor who discovered such a fetal anomaly likely had access to prenatal care,which leads one to conclude further that she has a parent or guardian involved in her pregnancy to pay the medical bills.see id.at,dist.lexis,at.the district court also determined that it would be pure speculation to conclude that a large fraction of parents would withhold consent for an abortion from a minor.see id.at,dist.lexis,at.finally,the district court held that the rule need not contain a exception,and that the general exception was constitutional even though it had been promulgated in the form of an affirmative defense.see id.at,dist.lexis,at.
likewise,the district court upheld the rule because it does not create a substantial obstacle for women seeking abortions.id.at,dist.lexis,at.while granting that the rule could have the effect of delaying abortions up to two weeks,the district court held that a delay of up to two weeks,however,does not impose an undue burden on women seeking abortions.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the district court relied on the supreme court ruling in casey,which upheld pennsylvania similar statute.
addressing the most difficult question to answer,the district court rejected cws argument that the rule would increase the probability that abusive partners would learn about the pregnancy or the attempt to obtain an abortion,thereby causing an undue burden on the woman constitutional right to an abortion.see id.at,dist.lexis,at.after reviewing the testimonial and record evidence received at trial,the district court concluded that the evidence did not establish what proportion of the abused women would be blocked from obtaining abortions.see id.at,dist.lexis,at.the district court thus concluded that it could not strike down the rule under casey large fraction test.see id.at,dist.lexis,at.
this timely appeal followed.enforcement of the rule,but not the rule,has been enjoined pending resolution of this appeal 
ii.the large fraction test 
planned parenthood of se.casey,d,sets the standard that we are bound to apply in facial challenges to abortion restrictions.in casey,the supreme court set forth the test that must be applied in analyzing whether a restriction placed on a woman constitutional right to an abortion is an undue burden on that right,thereby rendering the restriction facially unconstitutional.id.at.the supreme court determined that,because l egislation is measured for consistency with the constitution by its impact on those whose conduct it affects,when analyzing abortion restrictions,t he proper focus of constitutional inquiry is the group for whom the law is a restriction,not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.id.at.therefore,if,in a large fraction of the cases in which the abortion restriction is relevant,it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman choice to undergo an abortion,then reviewing courts should find that the restriction is an undue burden,and therefore invalid.id.at.this test has come to be known as the casey large fraction test.
in the intervening decade,the supreme court has not abandoned casey.see,planned parenthood casey,d souter,denying application for stay of mandate if an abortion restriction interposes a substantial obstacle on a large fraction of the affected population,it is an unconstitutional violation of the exercise of the right to reproductive freedom guaranteed by the due process clause and affirmed in th e court casey opinion citations omitted fargo women health org.schafer,d,concurring w e made clear that a law restricting abortions constitutes an undue burden,and hence is invalid,if,in a large fraction of the cases in which the law is relevant,it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman choice to undergo an abortion.internal citation to casey omitted 
in united states salerno,d,the supreme court held that,to succeed in a facial constitutional challenge,the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the law would be valid.however,in considering facial challenges to abortion restrictions,every circuit,with one exception,has applied casey test rather than salerno more restrictive no set of circumstances test.see abortion fed gonzales,at walker,concurring as it stands now,however,the supreme court appears to have adopted the large fraction standard for those who seek to challenge an abortion regulation as facially unconstitutional.richmond med.ctr.for women hicks,cir holding that salerno no set of circumstances standard does not apply in the context of a facial challenge to a statute regulating a woman access to abortion planned parenthood heed,st cir,vacated on other grounds by ayotte planned parenthood,d determining that casey test is properly applied to facial challenges a woman.side women clinic newman,cir an abortion restriction will be deemed valid unless,in a large fraction of the cases in which the law is relevant,it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman choice to undergo abortion internal citation omitted planned parenthood of cent.farmer,cir a plaintiff must show that an abortion regulation would be an undue burden in a large fraction of the cases in which that regulation is relevant planned parenthood of lawall,amended on denial of reh g,cir following the great weight of circuit authority holding that casey has overruled salerno in the context of facial challenges to abortion statutes jane bangerter,cir noting that the casey court did not apply the salerno test,but rather evaluated the regulations under the undue burden standard planned parenthood,sioux falls clinic miller,cir opting to follow what the supreme court actually than what it failed to apply the test which requires a court to invalidate an abortion restriction if the law operate s as a substantial obstacle to a woman choice to undergo an abortion in a large fraction of the cases in which it is relevant quotation omitted.the fifth circuit stands alone in its rejection of the large fraction test.see barnes moore,cir holding that a plaintiff must establish that no set f circumstances exists under which the act would be valid quoting salerno,at.
like the majority of other circuits,this court too has followed casey test in analyzing facial attacks on abortion regulations.in deciding whether a abortion restriction passes facial constitutional muster,we determine whether in a large fraction of the cases in which the ban is relevant,it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman choice to undergo an abortion.women med.prof l voinovich,cir quoting casey,at.this has been our repeated and continuous practice.see,women med.prof l baird,cir following casey holding that a regulation is an undue burden if in a large fraction of the cases in which the regulation is relevant,it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman choice to undergo an abortion quoting casey,at.memphis planned parenthood sundquist,cir when considering whether a statute that regulates abortion is unconstitutional on its face,we must analyze the factual record to determine whether the challenged regulation in a large fraction of the cases in which it is relevant,will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman choice to undergo an abortion citing casey,at.emphasis added see also women med.prof l taft,cir holding that a state may regulate abortion before viability as long as it does not impose an undue burden on a woman right to terminate her pregnancy,and that an undue burden exists when a state regulation has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus citing casey,at.
thus,our path is clear we must follow casey test in analyzing the facial challenge to the two abortion restrictions before us.accordingly,we asses whether ohio abortion restrictions present a substantial obstacle to obtaining an abortion for a large fraction of the women for whom the restrictions are relevant.casey,at.
iii.the rule 
constitutionality of the rule 
if a state requires parental consent before an unemancipated minor woman receives an abortion,it must provide for a judicial or administrative procedure so that a minor woman who satisfies certain conditions may bypass the consent requirement.see bellotti baird,d plurality opinion bellotti ii.if a minor woman establishes either that she is mature enough and well enough informed to make the abortion decision independently or that the abortion would be in her best interests,the reviewing court or agency must issue the bypass.lambert wicklund,d citation omitted.otherwise,the attendant bypass procedure is constitutionally invalid.see bellotti ii,at.
ohio provides for a procedure that apparently encompasses the procedural requirements set forth in lambert and bellotti ii.ohio,however,seeks to limit a minor woman to filing one petition for a bypass per pregnancy.the supreme court has never determined whether an abortion restriction preventing a minor woman from filing multiple bypass petitions violates the constitution.we must,therefore,analyze whether ohio restriction to the procedure constitutes an undue burden under casey test.
in casey,the supreme court analyzed a law that required a married woman who wished to abort her pregnancy to first notify her husband,unless she fit into a statutorily exempted category.casey,at.the supreme court held that,in determining whether this restriction was an undue burden,the proper focus of constitutional inquiry is the group for whom the law is a restriction,not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.id.at.therefore,while the restriction ostensibly affected all married women seeking an abortion,the restriction was only relevant to married women seeking an abortion who did not fit into a statutory exception to the notification requirement and did not desire to inform their husbands about the abortion.id.at.of the women for whom the restriction was actually relevant,many of whom were at risk for spousal abuse,the restriction would operate as a substantial obstacle to a.id.casey thus requires courts to determine whether a large fraction of the women for whom the law is a restriction will be deterred from procuring an abortion as surely as if the government has outlawed abortion in all cases.id.at.the law in casey was facially unconstitutional because it satisfied that test.id.at.
applying casey to the rule before us,we find that the group of women for whom the restriction actually operates are women who are denied a bypass and who have changed circumstances such that if they were able to reapply for a bypass,it would be granted.the group of women who will be deterred from procuring an abortion because of the restriction are women with changed circumstances who would apply for another bypass if allowed.the record shows that second petitioners exist under ohio current bypass scheme,and that practically all second petitioners allege changed circumstances such that,if believed,a reviewing court must issue a bypass.the changed circumstances that affect minors include increased maturity,increased medical knowledge about abortion,and pregnant minors who discover that their fetus has a medical anomaly such as gastroschisis the record further shows that most women who are denied a bypass but who experience a change in their circumstances will subsequently seek another bypass procedure.because ohio law preventing more than one petition per procedure acts as a substantial obstacle to a woman right to an abortion in a large fraction of the cases in which the single petition is relevant,we find that the rule is an undue burden and,therefore,is facially unconstitutional.
in sum,because the rule fails under casey test,we hold that it is facially unconstitutional.
severability of the rule 
the rule is severable from the remainder of ohio statute regulating abortion.therefore,our finding that the rule does not survive constitutional scrutiny is not fatal to the remainder of the regulations.
in ayotte planned parenthood of new,d,the supreme court held that a reviewing court need not invalidate an entire statute when the court may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief.the normal rule is that partial,rather than facial,invalidation is the required course.id.at quoting brockett spokane arcades,d.so long as the reviewing court is faithful to legislative intent,the court can issue a declaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting the statute unconstitutional application.id.at.
whether a portion of a state statute is severable is determined by the law of that state.see voinovich,at.in ohio,statutory provisions are presumptively severable.id.ohio law provides that 
if any provisions of a section of the revised code or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid,the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the section or related sections which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application,and to this end the provisions are severable.
ohio.a provision may be severed only if severance will not fundamentally disrupt the statutory scheme of which the unconstitutional provision is a part.voinovich,at citing state ex rel.maurer sheward,ohio.
ohio has devised a test that determines whether severance will cause such a disruption 
are the constitutional and the unconstitutional parts capable of separation so that each may be read and may stand by itself is the unconstitutional part so connected with the general scope of the whole as to make it impossible to give effect to the apparent intention of the legislature if the clause or part is stricken out is the insertion of words or terms necessary in order to separate the constitutional part from the unconstitutional part,and to give effect to the former only 
id.quoting geiger geiger,ohio.
applying this test,we find that the rule may be severed.as to the first part of the test,the rule can be read independently.nothing in the remainder of the bypass scheme inherently requires a limit on the number of petitions.the rule is therefore capable of separation.as to the second part of the test,excising the rule is not so connected to the general scope of the bypass scheme that other provisions would not have their intended effect if the court removed it.under the final part of the test,we need only eliminate,not add,words to strike down the rule.the rule can simply be deleted.the invalidity of the rule does not affect the remainder of ohio parental consent law and,therefore,is severable.
iv.the rule 
we now turn to the rule.although casey upheld both an requirement and a notification requirement,the record in casey as to these two issues was sparse.in the casey court words,there is no evidence on this record that requiring a doctor to give the information as provided by the statute would amount in practical terms to a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion.casey,at.therefore,the court concluded that the requirement did not constitute an undue burden.id.at.see also id.at.hence,on the record before us,and in the context of this facial challenge,we are not convinced that the waiting period constitutes an undue burden.
the sum of the evidence before the casey court concerning the notification requirement was as follows 
the findings of fact indicate that because of the distances many women must travel to reach an abortion provider,the practical effect will often be a delay of much more than a day because the waiting period requires that a woman seeking an abortion make at least two visits to the doctor.i n many instances this will increase the exposure of women seeking abortions to the harassment and hostility of protestors demonstrating outside a clinic.as a result,for those women who have the fewest financial resources,those who must travel long distances,and those who have difficulty explaining their whereabouts to husbands,employers,or others,the waiting period will be particularly burdensome.
id.at.on the basis of these facts,and without reference to abused women,the supreme court declined to find an undue burden.the record evidence concerning abused women available to the casey court centered entirely on the impact on such women of the requirement.see casey,at.these admittedly extensive facts did not discuss the impact on abused women of the requirement.id.
the appellants in the case at bar were obviously aware of the casey court reliance on the paucity of the record concerning how the requirement affected abused women in declining to find an undue burden.in an attempt to establish that there are abused women who effectively can not obtain informed consent with a physician at least hours prior to receiving an abortion,the appellants amassed an impressive amount of data,akin to the data available in casey on the issue of spousal notification.
the record shows that three ohio abortion providers,by their own policies,currently require women to come in for an meeting prior to obtaining an abortion.this meeting does not have to be with a physician.some women request to be excused from the meeting.some of these requests are denied by the clinics.attendance is excused for women who simply live too far away or have income or other hardship reasons.women excused from the meeting constitute to percent of women.according to appellants,the meeting is all but impossible for women in abusive situations,who constitute approximately percent of the women excused by the clinics requirement.of this percent,percent would be precluded altogether from obtaining an abortion as a result of the rule.for abused women,appearing in person twice is difficult and,in some cases.any woman who is excused from the meeting receives videos and literature through the mail sent to her or another address of her choice.all other women are required to come in for an meeting prior to obtaining an abortion.
therefore,of every women who seek an abortion,to are excused by the clinic from an meeting.according to the facts provided by the clinics,to of those to excused women will face a substantial obstacle in obtaining an abortion if forced to comply with the rule.therefore,for approximately to women out of every women seeking an abortion,the state rule would likely deter them from procuring an abortion as surely as if ohio has outlawed abortion in all cases.casey,at.
thus,appellants have improved on the casey record,at least with respect to the issue of informed consent.nevertheless,we find that the restriction survives constitutional scrutiny.the parties agree that the group of women who will be deterred from obtaining an abortion because of the restriction are the women who,due to domestic abuse,can not meet the requirement without grave risk of retaliation.the parties disagree,however,over the definition of the group for whom the law is a restriction.appellants argue that the women who will not obtain an abortion as a result of the restriction should be compared against all women actually affected by the requirement,defined as all women who are presently excused by the clinic from the clinic own requirement.ohio argues,on the other hand,that the group for whom the law is actually relevant is all women seeking an abortion.
unlike the parties,we find that the group for whom the law is a restriction for purposes of applying casey large fraction test is all women who seek an exception to the clinic requirement.the record does not reflect this number.
yet,even accepting the definition urged by appellants,we do not find a substantial burden under casey.this court has previously found that a large fraction exists when a statute renders it nearly impossible for the women actually affected by an abortion restriction to obtain an abortion.voinovich,at.importantly,in voinovich,a large fraction was found because all women upon whom the restriction actually,women seeking effectively be barred from exercising their constitutional right to obtain an abortion.id.other circuits that have applied the large fraction test to facial challenges to abortion regulations have,likewise,only found a large fraction when practically all of the affected women would face a substantial obstacle in obtaining an abortion.see,heed,at farmer,at miller,at see also newman,at coffey,concurring in applying the test it is clear from casey that a law which incidentally prevents some of the women for whom the abortion restriction will actually be a burden from obtaining abortions passes constitutional muster.the casey court itself was not persuaded to invalidate pennsylvania requirement by record evidence showing that the requirement would altogether prevent some women from obtaining an abortion.casey,at.see also planned parenthood casey,finding that in some of the percent of cases where a minor can neither obtain parental consent nor obtain a judicial bypass,the law may act in such a way as to deprive the minor of her right to have an abortion.
to date,no circuit has found an abortion restriction to be unconstitutional under casey test simply because some small percentage of the women actually affected by the restriction were unable to obtain an abortion.although a challenged restriction need not operate as a de facto ban for all or even most of the women actually affected,the term large fraction,which,in a way,is more conceptual than mathematical,envisions something more than the out of women identified here.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court upholding the rule is reversed,the judgment upholding the rule is affirmed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i concur in parts i,and iv of the majority opinion,and entirely in the result.i write separately concerning the single petition rule because,as a categorical limitation on whether an abortion is permitted at all,the rule defies application of the large fraction test.the supreme court has used the large fraction test instead to examine state regulation of how an abortion is to be performed or of what information should be given a woman who is legally allowed to get an abortion.it is not necessary in this case to apply the test to the single petition rule,however,because supreme court holdings regarding judicial bypass procedures directly compel invalidation of that rule.
requiring a minor to get parental consent for an abortion,without the possibility of an administrative or judicial bypass procedure that meets defined standards,unduly burdens the minor right to an abortion.this is the holding of bellotti baird,d plurality opinion bellotti ii,reaffirmed by the supreme court in many subsequent cases.see,lambert wicklund,d per curiam planned parenthood casey,d ohio akron ctr.for reproductive health,d.to survive constitutional challenge,a law requiring parental consent for a minor abortion must contain a procedure that allows the minor to bypass the consent requirement if she establishes that she is mature enough and well enough informed to make the abortion decision independently,allows the minor to bypass the consent requirement if she establishes that the abortion would be in her best interests,ensures the minor anonymity,and provides for expeditious bypass procedures.see lambert,at.
the supreme court in bellotti ii stated that a minor possesses an absolute right to a proceeding where she may establish her entitlement to a bypass 
a pregnant minor is entitled in such a proceeding to show either that she is mature enough and well enough informed to make her abortion decision,in consultation with her physician,independently of her parents wishes or that even if she is not able to make this decision independently,the desired abortion would be in her best interests.
bellotti ii,at.emphasis added.the bellotti ii court explained that every minor must have the opportunity to establish that she should not have to seek parental consent based on her current level of maturity or her current best interests 
we conclude,therefore,that under state regulation such as that undertaken by massachusetts,every minor must have the she so go directly to a court without first consulting or notifying her parents.if she satisfies the court that she is mature and well enough informed to make intelligently the abortion decision on her own,the court must authorize her to act without parental consultation or consent.if she fails to satisfy the court that she is competent to make this decision independently,she must be permitted to show that an abortion nevertheless would be in her best interests.if the court is persuaded that it is,the court must authorize the abortion.if,however,the court is not persuaded by the minor that she is mature or that the abortion would be in her best interests,it may decline to sanction the operation.
under a fair reading of bellotti ii,a minor right not to seek parental consent depends on the current level of her maturity or interest in abortion.see id.at.bellotti ii also provides that this right must be protected by judicial proceedings.see id.but if the right is to be adequately protected,such proceedings must account for material changes in the petitioner state after a first,unsuccessful bypass proceeding.accordingly,under bellotti ii,the single petition rule is facially invalid because,after a failed first petition,the rule does not permit
