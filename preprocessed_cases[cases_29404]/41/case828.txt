rickey lynn lewis appeals the denial,pursuant to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,of his claim,under atkins virginia,d execution of defendant cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by eighth amendment.the issue for which the district court granted a certificate of appealability coa is whether,based on the evidence submitted in the atkins proceeding,and pursuant to our deferential review under aedpa,the following decision by the texas court of criminal appeals tcca was unreasonable that lewis failed to establish,by a preponderance of the evidence,that he had significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning.in april,this panel denied lewis request to certify other issues for appeal.lewis quarterman.cir unpublished.
primarily at issue is the district court refusal to consider an affidavit,first offered in that court,challenging the administration of an iq test to lewis.the affidavit was offered in reply to the state response to lewis federal habeas application.vacated and remanded.
in september,during the burglary of a residence,lewis murdered one person and sexually assaulted that person fianc√©e.a jury convicted lewis in april of capital murder he was sentenced to death.holding the trial court had not applied the recently revised special issues,the texas court of criminal appeals tcca upheld the conviction but remanded for a new hearing.lewis state.unpublished.
on remand,lewis was again sentenced to death the tcca affirmed.lewis state.unpublished.lewis did not petition for review by the supreme court of the united states.
while his direct appeal was pending,lewis requested state relief.it was denied.ex parte lewis.unpublished.
lewis then requested federal habeas relief,which was denied in.our court affirmed that denial.lewis cockrell.cir unpublished.the supreme court denied review in october.lewis dretke,d.
following the atkins decision,lewis filed a application in state court,contending he is mentally retarded and thus,in the light of atkins,he is ineligible for execution.the tcca,in july,stayed lewis scheduled execution and remanded the matter to a trial court to consider the atkins claim.ex parte lewis,wl.unpublished.
the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing in december.in february,it rendered proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,and recommended denying relief.the tcca agreed,based on the trial court findings and conclusions,and on the tcca independent review.ex parte lewis.unpublished.
between the trial court february recommendation and the tcca denial of relief that june,and concerned about aedpa limitations period,our court permitted lewis to file a successive federal habeas application for his atkins claim,conditioned on the denial of relief by the tcca.in re lewis,cir.unpublished.lewis filed that application in district court on april.therefore,when the tcca denied relief that june,which prompted lewis execution being set,the federal district court granted lewis unopposed motion to stay execution.
in april,lewis filed the application at issue.it did not mention roid or an affidavit by him discussed below and primarily at issue here.in february,the state responded,advising there was no exhaustion issue and asking the district court,inter alia,to deny relief.in september,lewis filed his reply to the state response.in it,lewis supplemented his atkins claim with the affidavit of roid,which provides rosin committed nine procedural errors in administering an iq test to lewis and the test rosin administered was invalid.on december,the state moved to strike that reply,asserting that roid affidavit is a new,and unexhausted,exhibit.
the district court did not rule on the motion to strike.instead,in june,it ruled,under aedpa,that the decision was not unreasonable that lewis failed to establish he is mentally retarded all relief was denied.lewis quarterman,wl unpublished.in a footnote,citing d,the district court ruled it would not consider roid affidavit because it was not presented in the state court proceeding.that cited section provides that habeas relief shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d emphasis added.
that august,the district court granted a coa for whether,based upon the evidence submitted in the proceeding,the following tcca decision was unreasonable lewis failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he had significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning.
lewis requested a coa from this court on three more issues.those requests were denied in april.one of those issues was whether the district court should have considered the affidavit of roid new evidence offered in district court,challenging rosin administration of an iq test.we ruled the admissibility,vel non,of roid affidavit was an evidentiary issue that did not concern the denial of a constitutional right and,as such,it was possible evidence to be considered when the merits were addressed for the issue on which the district court granted a coa.lewis.at.
pursuant to aedpa,where a state court has rejected a habeas claim,a federal court may grant relief only where the decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.the court fact findings are presumed correct lewis can rebut the presumption only by clear and convincing evidence.e.
we apply the same d standard of review to the decision as did the district court.along that line,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error its conclusions of law,de novo,martinez johnson,cir.
in atkins,at,the supreme court held that the execution of defendants violates the eighth amendment.the court acknowledged disagreement will often arise in determining which offenders are in fact retarded and,therefore,left to the states the task of defining mental retardation and developing appropriate ways to enforce th is constitutional restriction.id.at.
accordingly,the tcca has held that petitioners must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that they are mentally retarded,as defined by the american association of mental retardation aamr and texas health and safety code.ex parte briseno.the definition of mental retardation referenced in atkins and briseno has three elements significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning,generally defined as an iq of about or below accompanied by related limitations in adaptive functioning and onset prior to the age of.atkins,at.briseno,at.
the trial court recommended that lewis failed to prove he is mentally retarded.that court proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,adopted by the tcca,stated that lewis failed to prove each of the three elements required for finding mental retardation.with regard to the one element for which coa has been granted significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning,the trial court received evidence placing lewis iq at,or.the trial court sided with the state experts higher estimates on the basis that rosin and gripon were more credible,reliable,and unbiased than martin and garnett,lewis experts.
the score of,the highest of the four scores,was recorded by rosin following administration of the v iq test to lewis on october,fairly close to the evidentiary hearing that december.the score of resulted from garnett one of lewis experts the test administered to lewis by rosin.the score of is a result of gripon assessment,having reviewed all the available evidence and test results but not having administered a test to lewis.the score of was recorded by martin,following administration of the wais iii iq test to lewis on september.
rosin recorded score of resulted from the most recent iq test administered to lewis.obviously,this fact,along with an iq of about generally being the
