mary hospital and the rochester memorial hospital filed suit in the district court against the secretary of health and human services.the suit sought review of the secretary denial of the hospitals claim for approximately million in medicare reimbursements.the district court granted the secretary motion for summary judgment.the hospitals appeal and we affirm.
background 
a.the medicare.drg payments and bundling 
medicare is health insurance funded by the federal government for the aged and disabled.before,the government reimbursed hospitals for the actual costs of treating medicare patients,subject to a limitation.in,the government changed its method of reimbursement to a prospective payment system.social security amendments of,title vi,stat.that change instituted a set of reimbursements for hospitals treating medicare patients.the reimbursement rates were set according to historic costs in a given region and applied on a prospective basis to the hospitals during the upcoming fiscal year.these new payments were made according to patients diagnoses.thus,with regard to a medicare patient,treating hospitals would get a payment that was tied to the patient diagnosis related group drg.
for some hospitals,outside entities provided ancillary services to the hospitals,laboratory,radiology,and physical therapy services.before,medicare allowed such ancillary providers to bill medicare directly,under part b,for the reasonable costs those providers incurred in providing their services.the hospitals would bill their own charges to medicare separately,under part a.in,as part of instituting the prospective payment system and its reimbursement scheme,congress required hospitals to bundle or refrain from unbundling the expenses associated with patient care,including the costs of services furnished by outside providers.a,a h.
keeping costs together,however,posed significant problems to hospitals that had followed a practice of having ancillary providers furnish services and seek reimbursement from medicare separately because their accounting and billing systems would have to be changed.so congress provided a waiver of the bundling requirements for hospitals that needed time to change.the waiver k of,stat.at,which was later included in the as a note to supp.i gave the secretary the power to allow such hospitals and their ancillary providers to continue their practice of separately billing unbundled charges for any cost reporting period beginning prior to october.stat.at.according to the section k waiver provision,any such waiver shall provide that the ancillary providers billing may continue to be made under part b of such title but that the payments to such hospital under part a of such title shall be reduced by the amount of the billings for such services under part b of such title.id.at.the part b payments to the ancillary providers were not calculated according to the patient drg.rather,those payments were calculated on a basis.thus,medicare would reimburse ancillary providers according to what it cost the ancillary provider to provide the services.under the waiver provision,then,a waiver hospital drg payment was reduced by the reasonable costs of ancillary services billed by and paid to the ancillary provider.
teaching hospitals 
when congress implemented the drg system,it was concerned that those payments would not adequately reimburse teaching hospitals because such hospitals typically have higher costs per patient than hospitals,at,reprinted in,at,reprinted in.thus,the drg on average costs in a particular not reflect teaching hospitals increased expenses.the prior reimbursement system also had this problem because the limitations it used were similarly calculated,though not on a prospective basis.under the prior system,congress had allowed adjustments to the limitations if a provider could show its increased costs were due to its educational activities.under the new system,congress carried forward the policy of paying teaching hospitals more,allowing their increased expenses to be separately reimbursed by medicare.three types of increased costs were identified direct medical education dme expenses,capital expenses,and indirect medical education ime expenses.dme expenses are expenses like residents expenses directly related to teaching.capital expenses are those expenses like depreciation and rents.and ime expenses reflect the general inefficiencies associated with patient care provided by residents and interns,including the additional tests and procedures ordered by residents as well as the extra demands placed on other staff as they participate in the educational process.id.
ime expenses are not easily quantified.so the secretary created a formula to calculate how much money teaching hospitals would get for ime expenses.that from a statistical analysis of teaching hospitals costs compared to hospitals costs that takes into account the ratio of residents and interns to beds,basically allows teaching hospitals to get a payment that represents a fraction of their drg revenue.for example,if the secretary is now codified in d b yields an indirect teaching adjustment factor of,then a teaching hospital that has of drg revenue in a given cost reporting period,fiscal year would get an additional payment of as reimbursement for ime expenses.
b.the mayo system and the hospitals ime reimbursements 
mary,rochester,and the mayo clinic are all teaching facilities.the two hospitals house patients who are treated by the mayo clinic physicians,residents,and interns.the mayo clinic also provided ancillary services to the hospitals patients.before the changes took effect,the mayo clinic billed medicare separately for the ancillary services that it provided to the hospitals patients.under the bundling provisions,however,those charges would need to be billed by the hospitals,who would then pay the mayo clinic for its services.but mary and rochester were given a section k waiver.thus,during the cost reporting periods at issue the mayo clinic billed medicare for the reasonable cost of the ancillary services it provided to the hospitals patients.and these payments reduced the hospitals drg payments.
mary and rochester disputed their medicare reimbursements for the relevant cost reporting periods with their fiscal intermediary,blue cross and blue shield of minnesota,claiming that they had been deprived of reimbursement for dme,capital,and ime expenses that they had incurred.blue cross sought advice from the health care financing administration hcfa the hcfa responded on august,with a letter from michael angellotti,the chief of the reimbursement and recovery branch of the division of financial operations.
angellotti dealt with two issues that blue cross had apparently raised,both of which questioned the extent to which the mayo clinic charges should reduce the hospitals drg payments.the first dealt with dme and capital expenses.angellotti reasoned that the mayo clinic payments,the amount of which was determined on a basis,included some amount of capital and dme costs that the mayo clinic had incurred and billed to medicare as reasonable costs.i n the interest of equity,angellotti concluded that the hospitals should not be charged with the mayo clinic capital and dme costs through a reduction in the hospitals drg payments.in other words,angellotti concluded that the offset that the section k waiver required had to be reduced.to make that reduction,he concluded that blue cross should determine what portion of the mayo clinic total charges were attributed to dme and capital costs.this was to be done by multiplying the total nonphysician charges by the ratio of capital and direct medical education cost to total cost of the mayo clinic.the resulting amount was not to be included in the reduction of the hospitals drg payments.thus,he told blue cross to reduce the k waiver offset by the amount of the charges that were attributed to the mayo clinic dme and capital costs.
the second issue that angellotti dealt with was whether the hospitals were entitled to an indirect teaching adjustment based on an unreduced drg,an ime payment calculated from the drg payment before the k waiver offset for the mayo clinic payments.angellotti concluded that 
the hospitals do not incur indirect medical education costs in the ancillary departments where the ancillary services are provided by the mayo clinic.therefore,the indirect teaching adjustment factor should be applied to the hospitals medicare payments net of the billings of the mayo clinic,after the reduction of the billing offset to reflect capital and direct medical education costs incurred by the mayo clinic.
mary and rochester appealed that decision to the provider reimbursement review board prrb,claiming they were owed over million in ime reimbursements.the prrb affirmed the hcfa decision it concluded that a amendment to the k waiver provision showed a congressional intent to leave in place the secretary interpretation of how the k waiver affects the ime reimbursement scheme for the cost reporting periods beginning before january,effective date of the amendment.consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of,stat.
after exhausting their administrative remedies,mary and rochester sought review in the district court.the district court affirmed the prrb decision,and so do we.

we review the district court decision de novo.shalala med,cir.
congressional intent 
under chevron,natural res.def.council,d,the question we must first address,always,is whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.so we look to the statute plain language.and if we,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertain that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.id.at.
mary and rochester argue that the decision not to calculate their ime reimbursement from an unreduced drg payment was contrary to congress unambiguously expressed intent.we disagree.we have reviewed the legislative history accompanying the original version of section k and the provisions.we conclude that neither the statutes plain language nor any discernible congressional intent on the precise question at issue resolves this case.the hospitals arguments,however,are premised primarily on the amendment to the k waiver provision.that amendment,among other things,added a new subsection to k 
in the case of a hospital which is receiving payments pursuant to a waiver under paragraph,payment of the adjustment for indirect costs of approved educational activities shall be made as if the hospital were receiving under part a of title xviii of the social security act all the payments which are made under part b of such title solely by reason of such waiver.
stat.at.the amendment also included effective dates for both the new subsection,and the new subsection a 
b effective dates.section k of the social security amendments of as added by subsection a shall apply to cost reporting periods beginning on or after january.
section k of the social security amendments of as added by subsection a shall apply to items and services furnished after the end of the period beginning on the date of the enactment of this act.
id.in sum,congress implemented the very construction of the statutes that the hospitals now champion.but congress did go all the way back to.instead,it chose to use specific effective dates for the provisions it was adding.and,with regard to subsection,congress chose cost reporting periods that began over four months before the law enactment on april.
both the district court and the prrb hung their hats on the statute effective date.we agree that the amendment plainly states how k waiver offsets affect a hospital ime reimbursements for cost reporting periods beginning on or after january.but,as we explain below,that does little to settle the question presented or not the secretary could reach a different conclusion for cost reporting periods beginning before january.so we disagree with the district court and the prrb insofar as they ruled that congress amendment closed the door on the hospitals claim.
congress,when it made the k waiver amendment in,did not speak to those prior years in the statute.it neither expressly endorsed nor prohibited the secretary construction of the statute by spelling out how ime reimbursements should be calculated for the cost reporting periods at issue in this case.see red lion broad.fcc,d subsequent legislation declaring the intent of an earlier statute is entitled to great weight in statutory construction.emphasis added consumer prod.safety comm gte sylvania,d distinguishing between subsequent legislation and statements made in hearings and committee reports johnson united states dep t of hous.and urban,cir.
the legislative history to the amendment is similarly unavailing.the amendment was part of legislation that took a storied path in the congress.the legislation originated in separate bills.in the house of representatives,began with no provision regarding the interaction of ime reimbursements and the section k waiver.in the senate,had such a provision,but in a much sparser form than was eventually passed

we need go no deeper into the legislative history to evaluate the parties arguments.the hospitals argue that the k waiver amendment was a clarifying amendment,geared at overruling the secretary construction of the statute under the rubric of declaring congress original intent.the secretary,on the other hand,argues that the k waiver amendment was a changing amendment,geared at changing the way in which the statute dealt with ime reimbursement from the effective date on.
