adrienne bennett bennett filed an action under the employee retirement income security act erisa,against kemper national services,kemper,lumbermens mutual casualty company lumbermens,broadspire services,broadspire,and platinum equity,platinum collectively defendants arguing that the decision to deny her ltd benefits was arbitrary or capricious.the district court granted a judgment in favor of the defendants,and bennett appealed.because we conclude that the decision to deny benefits was not the result of a deliberate and principled reasoning process supported by substantial evidence,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to remand to broadspire for a full and fair review consistent with this opinion.
background 
bennett was employed as a project manager and master plumber by the henry ford health systems hfhs until may,when,at the age of,she went on disability leave due to multiple sclerosis ms and related conditions as an hfhs employee,bennett participated in the hfhs short and long term disability plan plan.
the plan provided for an initial months of paid disability if the disability prevented bennett from performing her own occupation.at the end of the months,the plan paid benefits only if bennett disability prevented her from performing the essential functions of any gainful occupation that her training,education and experience would allow her to perform.joint appendix at plan at.at the time that bennett initially applied for benefits,the plan was insured by lumbermens and was administered by kemper,a subsidiary of lumbermens.
bennett neurologist,robert lisak lisak wrote a letter explaining that,due to bennett ms and respiratory infections,she should be off work indefinitely.kemper asked neurologist gerald goldberg goldberg his opinion,and he agreed that the medical records demonstrated that bennett could not perform her own occupation.after a mandatory waiting period,kemper approved ltd benefits for bennett effective november.kemper also referred bennett to allsup,allsup,a company specializing in assisting people with their applications for social security disability benefits.kemper informed bennett that she would not have to pay for allsup services,but that any ltd benefits would be reduced by the amount of any social security disability benefits that she was awarded.
lisak examined bennett on february,finding that she continued to do poorly,but mainly with depression and cognitive symptoms.at lisak clinic note.he recommended that bennett undergo neuropsych testing to see how much of the problem is depression,and if there is a significant amount of cognitive problem.at lisak clinic note at.in accordance with lisak recommendation,on april,bennett saw keenan keenan who conducted a series of neuropsychological tests.keenan noted that bennett exhibited variable degrees of motivation and effort in the tests,but stated that bennett profile is more suggestive of depression than frank malingering,which was corroborated by objective personality test results.rather than a conscious attempt to feign cognitive symptoms for monetary secondary gain,bennett has presented as having difficulties adjusting to and accepting the limitations associated with at keenan rpt.at.as the result of bennett inconsistent effort,keenan was unable to determine her neuropsychological status.
on bennett visit on may,lisak noted that her neurologic exam demonstrated a normal mental status.at lisak clinic note.according to lisak,e verything was an effort and seem ed to take forever for her to do or answer,but he did not believe it was a true apraxia.id.it took bennett seconds to walk feet unassisted.
bennett next visit to lisak on november,revealed an abnormal mental status.at lisak clinic note.lisak noted that he was unable to determine whether bennett was showing secondary progression,or whether it continue d to be her depression.at lisak clinic note at.at this visit,it took bennett seconds to walk feet.
on december,bennett was admitted to the emergency room for seizures.bennett was released from the hospital on december,whereupon she spent fifteen days in an rehabilitation program.her exam upon admission revealed quadriparesis and debility.
lisak filled out an attending physician statement provided by kemper on january.he indicated that bennett physical impairment was class.marked limitation of functional of sedentary work.at aps.bennett mental impairment was class marked limitation unable to engage in stress or interpersonal relationships.id.lisak also indicated that bennett could sit for only two hours of an day and could not continuously stand or walk for any length of time.according to the completed form,bennett could occasionally lift up to ten pounds and reach above shoulder level,and could never drive an automobile.lisak indicated that bennett could not work or.
bennett next visit to lisak on february,revealed a normal mental status,and an abnormal gait.at lisak clinic note.it took her seconds to walk feet.in lisak opinion,bennett had experienced a relapse.at lisak clinic note.
by june,lisak reported that bennett needed seconds to walk feet,and that she was walking with a cane however,he also reported that she was back to driving.at lisak clinic note.he also described the results of bennett recent mri scan as showing two new lesions in the hemispheres,with preexisting lesions unchanged or less prominent.the lesion on her cervical spine was more prominent and obvious on,but it was not larger and there was no enhancement.lisak found that bennett had experienced an unequivocal relapse however,he wondered whether there might be psychologic reasons that it seemed to be as severe as it was.at lisak clinic note at.
on july,lisak filled out another attending physician statement provided by kemper.he again indicated that bennett physical and mental impairments were both class that she could sit for only two hours of an day,and could not continuously stand or walk for any length of time that she could occasionally lift up to ten pounds and reach above shoulder level,that she could never drive an automobile and that she could not work or.
as the month period for disability benefits was drawing to a close,kemper began the process of determining whether bennett was qualified for ltd under the standard.although the plan entitled kemper to require bennett to submit to a physical examination by a physician,kemper instead chose to rely on peer reviews of bennett medical files.both goldberg and clinical neuropsychologist,elana mendelssohn conducted the initial file reviews in july,and both determined that the records failed to support a finding of a functional impairment that precluded bennett from working.
goldberg summarized the lisak and keenan files,and concluded that bennett did have ms and accompanying physical impairments.however,he also found inconsistencies in her examination.at goldberg rpt.at.according to goldberg,i n lisak attending physician statement he did indicate an impairment that would be consistent with sedentary work.the objective data overall does not indicate a functional impairment that would preclude the claimant from either doing her own job or working at any job,particularly in a sedentary capacity.id.goldberg indicated that he believed r easonable restrictions and limitations would include not working at any unprotected heights or driving automotive equipment in the workplace or doing excessive walking or standing.id.
mendelssohn noted that lisak indicated that the claimant reported relapse in her ms had an underlying psychological component,but that bennett had denied that she was depressed.at mendelssohn rpt.at.citing the inconclusive results from keenan examination of bennett,mendelssohn concluded that there was no recent objective examination findings documenting a severity and intensity of cognitive difficulties that would preclude work,including bennett own occupation.at mendelssohn rpt.at.
relying on the goldberg and mendelssohn file reviews,on october,kemper determined that bennett was not disabled under the standard,and thus,she was not entitled to further ltd benefits after november.the denial letter explained that bennett could appeal the decision by filing a written request for a review of her claim.
meanwhile,bennett social security disability application was percolating.on september,on behalf of bennett,allsup wrote a letter containing proposed findings of fact to the alj assigned to bennett case.on november,the social security administration ssa determined that,because of her ms,as of may,bennett was disabled within the meaning of the social security act.
also in the record is unclear as to the exact date,lumbermens sold kemper to broadspire,a company independent from lumbermens or kemper.at notes to statutory fin.statements.broadspire which was owned by platinum assumed responsibility for administering bennett claim.see id.
in,bennett supplied broadspire with additional documentation in support of her appeal.broadspire commissioned two more file reviews,this time from vaughn cohan cohan and donald rose rose.the additional information submitted for review,in cohan and rose opinion,did not support an impairment from november,through november.neither cohan nor rose report made any mention of the ssa finding that bennett was disabled except to mention the decision in a list of information that they had received.
in a letter dated december,broadspire informed bennett that it was upholding kemper original determination that bennett did not satisfy the standard for disability.having exhausted her internal appeals,bennett filed a complaint against the defendants in state court seeking ltd benefits under erisa.the defendants removed the case to federal district court and later filed a motion for entry of judgment.bennett filed a motion to reverse the defendants administrative decision.on september,the district court entered a judgment in the defendants favor and against bennett.bennett filed a timely notice of appeal on october.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court judgment on the administrative record.evans unumprovident,cir.when,as is the case here,the benefit plan gives the plan administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits,we will reverse the administrator decision only if it is arbitrary or capricious.gismondi united techs,cir.under this standard,we uphold the administrator decision if it is the result of a deliberate,principled reasoning process and if it is supported by substantial evidence.glenn metlife,cir internal quotation marks omitted,cert.granted,d,wl,cert.granted solely regarding issues.although this standard is deferential,it is no mere formality.id.rather,application of the standard requires us to review the quality and quantity of the medical evidence and the opinions on both sides of the issues.id.quoting mcdonald.life ins,cir.
when determining whether a decision was arbitrary or capricious,we also factor in whether there existe d a conflict of interest,whether the plan administrator fail ed to give consideration to the social security administration determination that the applicant was totally disabled,and whether the plan administrator based its decision to deny benefits on a file review as opposed to conducting a physical examination of the applicant.calvert firstar,cir.such findings do not change our standard of review,but they do factor into our analysis when determining whether the administrator decision was arbitrary or capricious.id.context and context glenn,at failure to consider the ssa determination of disability.we address each of these three factors below.
conflict of interest 
on appeal,bennett contends that,although the district court acknowledged a conflict of interest,it failed to give that conflict adequate weight.in contrast,the defendants argue that the district court erred in finding any conflict.because of our disposition of the case based upon bennett other assignments of error,we find it unnecessary to address the parties arguments regarding whether a conflict of interest existed.
ssa disability determination 
bennett argues that the district court gave inadequate consideration to the fact that broadspire,in its final benefits determination,failed to discuss the ssa determination that bennett was disabled under the social security act.recently,we addressed a situation where the administrator assisted the plaintiff in obtaining social security disability benefits,and then,without explanation,determined that for purposes of ltd benefits,the plaintiff was not disabled.this sequence of events raised two overarching concerns 
t he fact that metlife and the social security administration reached contrary conclusions regarding glenn disability status has two ramifications for this appeal.the first stems from the fact that metlife assisted glenn in obtaining social security benefits and reaped a financial benefit of its own when that assistance was successful.the second issue relates to the fact that,in denying glenn continuation of her benefits,metlife failed to address social security contrary determination of glenn status.
glenn,at.we further explained in glenn that an erisa plan administrator failure to address the social security administration finding that the claimant was totally disabled is yet another factor that can render the denial of further disability benefits arbitrary and capricious.id.at.we concluded that h aving benefited financially from the government determination that glenn was totally disabled,the plan administrator obviously should have given appropriate weight to that determination.id.
similarly,in the case at bar,kemper provided bennett with assistance in obtaining social security disability benefits,and under the plan,was entitled to reduce the amount of benefits it paid to bennett by the amount bennett received from social security.when broadspire issued its decision denying ltd benefits,it failed to explain why it reached a conclusion contrary to that of the ssa 
conspicuously absent from the district court discussion on this point is any reference to our glenn decision decided four weeks earlier.rather,citing an unpublished case,the district court stated that a plan administrator is not required to refer to an ssa disability decision in its own decision denying ltd benefits.the district court also stated that silence by a plan administrator with regard to a decision by the social security administration does not necessarily mean that it was not considered and evaluated.furthermore,a plan administrator decision can not be considered arbitrary and capricious solely because the social security administration rendered a different decision.at order at citing hurse hartford life accident ins,cir.while technically correct,the district court fails to explain further that if the plan administrator encourages the applicant to apply for social security disability payments financially benefits from the applicant receipt of social security and then fails to explain why it is taking a position different from the ssa on the question of disability,the reviewing court should weigh this in favor of a finding that the decision was arbitrary or capricious.glenn,at.
more importantly,the district court failed to demonstrate,through its application of law to the facts,that it appreciated the gravity of broadspire failure to discuss the ssa disability determination.instead the district court inquired into whether the defendants act ed maliciously in helping bennett to obtain social security disability benefits.at order at.this question is irrelevant and demonstrates that the district court did not properly synthesize broadspire failure to discuss the ssa disability determination into the analysis.we conclude that broadspire silence as to the ssa disability determination weighs in favor of finding that broadspire failed to engage in a deliberate,principled reasoning process.glenn,at.
file review 
bennett also takes issue with the defendants decision to conduct only a file review.although we find nothing inherently objectionable about a file review by a qualified physician in the context of a benefits determination,calvert,at,a plan decision to conduct a review especially where the right to conduct a physi
