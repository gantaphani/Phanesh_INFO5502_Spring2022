this appeal compels us to weave a decisional tapestry from several doctrinal strands that help define the margins of jurisdiction,including eleventh amendment immunity,abstention,and standing.the appellants a psychologist and a third party challenge a state administrative proceeding that resulted in the imposition of professional discipline against the psychologist.the district court determined that it could not grant relief on any of the myriad claims presented and,accordingly,dismissed the action.after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
lynn lesueur is a psychologist licensed to practice in massachusetts.when a boy who was enrolled in an elementary school in norfolk,massachusetts,began to experience behavioral problems,the school retained lesueur to evaluate him.lesueur examined the child and interviewed several people at the school.she then prepared and submitted a written report 
some family background helps to explain the etiology of this litigation.the child whom lesueur had examined came from a broken home.when his parents divorced,the court awarded custody to his mother and granted his father visitation rights.the parents relationship was incendiary.lesueur report added fuel to the fire upon reviewing it,the boy mother lodged a complaint against lesueur with the massachusetts board of registration of psychologists the board.
the board is the licensing and regulatory authority for psychologists in massachusetts.see.laws ch.after receiving the complaint,it held a formal adjudicatory hearing.see id.ch.in due course,it circulated a tentative decision,to which lesueur objected.
the board considered this objection and issued its final decision on september.in substance,the board determined that lesueur had exceeded the scope of her competence in compiling the report which contained,among other things,recommendations pertaining to custody arrangements and to a restraining order that the boy mother had obtained against his father.in reaching this conclusion,the board found that lesueur actions violated several provisions of the american psychological association code of code previously adopted by the board.see regs.see also.laws ch.as a sanction,the board placed lesueur on probation for a period of two years.
dismayed by the board ukase,lesueur petitioned for judicial review in the state superior court.see.laws ch.her petition alleged a salmagundi of federal constitutional and grounds for setting aside the board order.it also sought a declaration that certain regulations on which the board had relied were unconstitutionally vague 
lesueur moved for judgment on the pleadings.after considering lesueur legal and constitutional arguments and her charge of evidentiary insufficiency,the superior court denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings and,on july,dismissed the petition for judicial review.lesueur appealed,but the massachusetts appeals court upheld the judgment.lesueur bd.of regist.of psychologists,table.lesueur did not seek further appellate review before the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc.see.authorizing petitions for discretionary appellate review by the sjc.
during the pendency of the proceedings,lesueur and coggeshall repaired to the federal district court and,on august,instituted an action,pursuant to,against the board and its members the federal complaint asserted claims that paralleled those asserted in the state courts,including multiple challenges to the constitutionality of the board actions and the regulations.like the petition,the federal complaint sought both declaratory relief and vacation of the sanction imposed by the board.
despite these similarities,this action differed from the earlier proceedings in two noteworthy respects.first,the federal action encompassed a more diverse group of parties.in the federal court,coggeshall appeared as a party for the first time,and the members of the board were named as additional defendants.second,the action sought a wider panoply of relief,including money damages and an injunction barring the board from enforcing the challenged regulations.
the named defendants moved to dismiss the federal suit.see.b,b.the district court obliged.with respect to lesueur claims for nonmonetary relief,the court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction because those claims sought vacation of a decision involving functionally identical claims.coggeshall.bd.of regist.of psychologists,wl,at.in support,the court cited the doctrine.see court of appeals feldman,rooker fidelity trust.as an alternate basis for dismissal,the court held that even if it had jurisdiction,it would be constrained to abstain.coggeshall,wl,at citing younger harris.at the same time,the court dismissed coggeshall nonmonetary claims for a perceived lack of standing to sue.id.finally,the court dismissed the claims for money damages on immunity grounds.id.at.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
before grappling with the appellants asseverational array,we pause to delineate our analytic framework.first,we segregate the appellants monetary claims from their nonmonetary claims.we then address the two sets of claims in that order.
our standard of review is uncontroversial.although the district court rulings implicate different subsections of rule b,we review all of those rulings de novo.see mccloskey mueller,cir.in undertaking this review,we are not wedded to the district court rationale,but,rather,may affirm a particular order on any independent ground made manifest by the record.id.
money damages.
we start with the appellants claims for money damages.these claims are preferred against both the board and its members.the board itself,as an arm of the state government,enjoys eleventh amendment immunity from suits for money damages brought in federal court,absent consent,waiver,or the like.see alden maine,vaquer√≠a tres monjitas,irizarry,cir see also const.amend.xi.massachusetts has neither consented to be sued for damages in a federal court in the circumstances of this case nor waived its eleventh amendment immunity here.consequently,that immunity demands the dismissal of the damages claims against the board 
with respect to the damages claims against the members of the board,there is a threshold ambiguity the appellants sued the members of the board without specifying whether those defendants were named in their official or individual capacities.as we explain below,we need not resolve this ambiguity.
to the extent that the members of the board are sued in their official capacities,they stand in the shoes of the state and enjoy the same immunity as does the board.see,rosie ex rel.john swift,cir.thus,any claims against the members of the board in their official capacities must be dismissed.
to the extent that the appellants claims for money damages are brought against the members of the board individually,the key question involves the applicability of the doctrine of immunity.in general,that doctrine provides absolute immunity for public officials,including agency officials,who perform functions.butz economou.the rationale for the immunity is that the due performance of an adjudicative role require s a full exemption from liability.id.at see also destek group,pub.utils.comm n,cir.
we do not write on a pristine page.this court addressed a virtually identical issue in an earlier case.see bettencourt bd.of regist.in,cir.there,we held that the members of the massachusetts board of registration in medicine were entitled to immunity for their actions taken as adjudicators in disciplinary proceedings.id.at.in reaching this result,we performed a functional analysis.see id.at see also butz,at.
in bettencourt,this analysis led us to conclude that the board members were functionally comparable to judges because their roles involved weighing evidence,making factual findings,reaching legal determinations,choosing sanctions,and expounding reasons for their decisions.at.the board members also resembled judges because their duties required them to make determinations likely to provoke litigious reactions from affected parties.id.finally,we observed that board members resembled judges because they carried out adjudicatory functions in structured proceedings replete with procedural safeguards id.
the board of registration in medicine,which was at issue in bettencourt,is responsible for professional discipline of medical doctors.see.laws ch.the adjudicatory functions of its members are the same as those of the members of the board,except that the board purview concerns psychologists rather than physicians.for present purposes,that is a distinction that makes no meaningful difference.
in the last analysis,what matters is that the functions of the members of the two board of registration in medicine and the board of registration of legally indistinguishable.because this is so and because the acts for which the defendants have been sued were performed by them as adjudicators,bettencourt controls here.see united states platte,cir explaining that a prior,panel decision normally binds subsequent panels.accordingly,we hold that the members of the board,individually,are shielded from the damages claims by reason of immunity.see bettencourt,at.
nonmonetary claims.
we divide this portion of our analysis into two segments,one for each appellant.
lesueur claims.in dismissing lesueur claims for nonmonetary relief,the district court elaborated two grounds the doctrine and younger abstention.we examine these alternative holdings.
the doctrine precludes the losing party in state court from filing suit in federal court after the state proceedings have ended,complaining of an injury caused by the judgment and seeking review and rejection of that judgment.exxon mobil saudi basic indus.the district court erred in relying upon the doctrine because,at the time that the appellants filed their federal complaint,the state case was still pending before the massachusetts appeals court.it is a condition precedent to the application of the doctrine that,at the time the suit is commenced,the proceedings have ended.federaci√≥n de maestros junta de relaciones del trabajo,cir.here,the proceedings had not yet ended,so the doctrine was inapposite 
the district court other rationale for dismissing these claims is more persuasive.this rationale involves the younger abstention doctrine.if certain conditions are met,that doctrine requires a district court to stay or dismiss the federal action in favor of the continued prosecution of the litigation.exxon mobil,at.the district court thought that those conditions were satisfied here.we agree.
abstention is a device designed to facilitate the operation of federal and state courts,balancing their respective interests in the spirit of comity.see younger,at.there are several branches of the abstention doctrine.see.river water conserv.dist.united states,burford sun oil,comm of pullman.our concern here is with younger abstention.
under younger principles,a federal court must abstain from hearing a case if doing so would needlessly inject the federal court into ongoing state proceedings.brooks supreme court,cir.although the younger case itself dealt with federal interference in an ongoing state criminal prosecution,at,younger principles apply to noncriminal state proceedings that are judicial in nature see,cir see also ohio civil rights comm dayton christian.
courts have developed a tripartite model for determining the appropriateness of younger abstention.this model requires that the ongoing state proceedings are judicial as opposed to legislative in nature they implicate important state interests and they provide an adequate opportunity to raise federal constitutional challenges.bettencourt,at.these three elements all must be assessed as of the date when the federal complaint is filed.id.
in this instance,it is beyond peradventure that the relevant state proceedings were judicial in nature.see id.at.it is likewise undeniable that lesueur petition for judicial review was still pending before the massachusetts appeals court when the appellants commenced the federal case and,thus,that the state proceedings were ongoing at the relevant time.
similarly,it needs little embellishment to establish that the state has a profound interest in the licensure of professionals such as psychologists and the maintenance of appropriate standards of practice for such professionals.the decided cases describing the state interest in the licensing and disciplining of physicians spell out the reasons,see,id.at weinberg bd.of regist.in,and it would serve no useful purpose to repastinate that ground.
this leaves the third element of the model.on this point,lesueur strives to convince us that massachusetts does not provide an adequate forum in which to litigate federal constitutional challenges.we are not persuaded.
we are,of course,obliged to presume that state courts are fully capable of safeguarding federal constitutional rights.brooks,at.here,moreover,the statutory scheme that massachusetts has enacted to provide for judicial review of administrative actions specifically directs reviewing courts to inquire into allegations of constitutional violations.see.laws ch,a,d,g.massachusetts courts have shown no reluctance to carry out this mandate.see,weinberg,at considering a first amendment challenge and other constitutional claims.to the extent that lesueur argument is that the mere allegation of a federal constitutional infraction automatically renders state procedures inadequate,that argument is hopeless.ohio civil rights comm n,at.
we need not delve into the merits of lesueur cavalcade of first amendment,vagueness,equal protection,and due process claims.for the purpose of younger abstention,the only question is whether the state courts provide an adequate opportunity to litigate such claims fully and fairly.duty free shop,administrati√≥n de terrenos,cir.that the massachusetts courts provide such an opportunity can not seriously be questioned.indeed,lesueur presented the majority of her constitutional claims,including the claim that state law affords insufficient protections to satisfy the federal constitutional minimum,in state she could have presented the rest,had she elected to do so.
we hasten to add that any argument that the state courts erred in deciding these issues could have been presented by lesueur through a petition for a writ of certiorari to the supreme court of the united states.the lower federal courts can not be used as a substitute forum for federal appellate review of final decisions of state courts.the supreme court is the only federal court empowered to reverse a final judgment of a state court.see exxon mobil,at.by eschewing any effort to secure further appellate review before the sjc,lesueur closed the door to supreme court review of the state courts decisions.see flynt ohio,per curiam.that,in turn,closed the door to any review of those decisions 
to say more on this point would be supererogatory.this case is a paradigm for younger abstention.the fact that the state proceedings are now ended does not alter that reality.see bettencourt at.consequently,we uphold the order of dismissal on that ground.
coggeshall claims.we next consider coggeshall nonmonetary claims.the district court ruled that coggeshall lacked standing to pursue his claims because he had no legally cognizable stake in the outcome.coggeshall argues that he has standing because the sanction imposed in the disciplinary proceeding transgressed his first amendment right to receive medical advice on behalf of his minor child 
standing is both a constitutional and a prudential limitation on federal jurisdiction.right to life pac gardner,cir.to satisfy the constitution case or controversy requirement,const.art.iii,a party seeking relief in federal court must show that he has suffered an actual injury,which is fairly traceable to the defendant conduct and redressable by a favorable judicial decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,right to life,at.
in the case at hand,we need not look beyond the first of these requirements.in contemplation of law,coggeshall has not suffered any injury in fact because he has not shown a deprivation of any constitutionally protected property or liberty failing that goes to the very heart of the standing requirement.see,lujan,at.
to illustrate,he has shown no interference with any contra
