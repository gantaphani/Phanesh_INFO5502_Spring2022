this appeal stems from parents laudable efforts to provide the best possible education for their profoundly disabled daughter.after disagreements arose over the contents of the child proposed individualized education program iep,a state hearing officer overruled the parents objections and concluded that the proposed iep complied with the strictures of the individuals with disabilities education act idea,a federal district court affirmed that decision.
on appeal,we hold that the local school district and the state educational their responsibilities under the idea,that the delays complained of were attributable to the parents and,thus,afford no grounds for relief,and that the iep at issue here satisfied the applicable statutory imperatives.consequently,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
at the heart of this litigation stands a young woman named stephanie lessard,who was eighteen years of age at the time of the relevant events.we rehearse the facts pertaining to stephanie plight as supportably found by the district court.see lessard coop.sch,wl,at.
stephanie lessard has been diagnosed with moderate mental retardation she possesses an iq of,cognitive delays,speech impairments,a seizure disorder,scoliosis,a discrepancy,and partial paralysis of her left side.since,she has been a day student at crotched mountain rehabilitation center,a new hampshire facility providing special needs services to the cooperative school district the school district.
in april of,stephanie mother,linda lessard,met with representatives of the school district to map out stephanie iep for the coming school year.between that inaugural meeting and december of the same year,lessard and the iep team huddled on at least four occasions to discuss the iep,but progress was slow.in the interim,the school district continued to implement stephanie iep.
of particular pertinence for present purposes is the meeting that took place on august.on her own initiative,lessard brought a psycholinguist kemper to the meeting.he explained to the assemblage why the phoneme processing system lips was in his view the most effective way to teach literacy to a child with learning disabilities as pronounced as stephanie.the iep team declined to adopt that view,noting that none of those assembled was schooled in that particular pedagogical methodology.the team nonetheless agreed to look into the matter.
at the same meeting,the school district gave lessard a proposed iep for the upcoming school year and requested that she sign it.the iep did not contain a component specifically addressing the correction of stephanie behavioral problems that component was under ongoing review by personnel at crotched mountain.curiously,a transition plan the last page of the iep ended abruptly in.
lessard refused to sign the proffered iep after the meeting,the school district sent her a letter requesting that she make clear what portions of the iep engendered dissatisfaction.the school district also offered to schedule additional meetings to discuss and perhaps reshape the iep.the lessards kept their own counsel and did not communicate their specific objections to the iep.
another meeting took place in october.it soon became apparent that a schism existed whereas the school district envisioned the task at hand to be putting the finishing touches on the proffered iep,lessard envisioned the iep process as in its infancy.yet,despite her evident displeasure,lessard again declined to chronicle any specific criticisms of the iep as it stood.after the october meeting,the school district again requested by letter that lessard delineate in writing her objections to the proffered iep.no such delineation ensued.
persistent scheduling conflicts prevented the protagonists from reconvening until december.at that time,the school district presented a new version of the iep,which contained both the behavioral plan as well as a transition plan that is,a plan designed to transition the disabled child into independent,adult life.lessard refused to sign the december iep,complaining that the team had yet to develop the iep.this reaction prompted the school district to invoke its right to a due process hearing,see admin.ann.ed.c,as a means of determining the suitability of the recently submitted iep.
that hearing took place over two days,during which eight members of the iep team testified on behalf of the school district.in rebuttal,the parents introduced the expert testimony of a reading specialist and a physical therapist another literacy expert kemper testified solely through the medium of written findings.in a decision dated march,the state hearing officer ruled that the december iep suffered from neither procedural nor substantive faults.he therefore ordered it placed into effect and denied the parents for compensatory education and other relief.
the lessards rejoined by filing an action in the united states district court for the district of new hampshire.see i.their suit raised the same procedural and substantive objections that had been advanced in the due process hearing and sought compensatory education for the alleged deprivation of the free appropriate public education fape owed to stephanie lessard under the idea.the suit added a claim that the administrative hearing,as conducted,violated the lessards procedural due process rights.
in the court case,had declined to testify before the state hearing the witness stand otherwise,the evidence before the district court largely replicated the evidence in the administrative record.the district court found no fault with the conduct of the administrative hearing,upheld the hearing officer findings and conclusions,and denied the lessards requests for relief.see lessard,wl,at.
the lessards,qua appellants,prosecuted this timely appeal.before us,they do not challenge the district court resolution of their procedural due process claim.they do,however,press the other objections that were raised below.
ii.the statutory scheme 
the idea declares that,as a condition for receiving federal funds,states must provide all disabled children with a fape.see,a a.the primary vehicle for delivery of a fape is the child iep.the iep must include,at a bare minimum,the child present level of educational attainment,the short and goals for his or her education,objective criteria with which to measure progress toward those goals,and the specific services to be offered.see id.d a lenn portland sch,cir.
an iep is subject to both procedural and substantive requirements.those requirements can flow from either federal or state law at least to the extent that the latter is not incompatible with the former.see roland concord sch,cir.
as an example of a procedural requirement,the idea specifically confers upon parents a right to be part of the iep team,that is,the group of individuals charged with formulating a particular child iep and which comprises educational professionals who either possess specialized knowledge about or will be involved in the child education.see d b.an example of a procedural requirement is the new hampshire regulation stipulating that parents must annually consent to and sign their child iep.see admin.ann.ed.a b imposing the lesser requirement that the school district give notice to the parents of proposed changes to an extant iep.federal and state law converge in demanding that an iep be in effect by the commencement of the school year.see d a a admin.ann.ed.c.
there is no mechanical checklist by which an inquiring court can determine the proper content of an iep ieps are by their very nature idiosyncratic.me.sch.admin.dist.v,cir.one thing is clear the substance of an iep must be something different than the normal school curriculum and something more than a generic,program for children with special needs.in the supreme court phrase,an iep must be individually designed to provide educational benefit to a particular handicapped child.hendrick hudson bd.of educ.rowley,d.
it is worth emphasizing that the obligation to devise a iep does not imply that a disabled child is entitled to the maximum educational benefit possible.see id.at.five town cmty.sch,cir warwick sch,cir.an iep need only supply some educational benefit,not an optimal or an ideal level of educational benefit,in order to survive judicial scrutiny,at see roland,at.
serial review mechanisms present the means for enforcing these procedural and substantive rights.by statute,parents may file a complaint with the state educational agency,which must convene a hearing sometimes called a due process hearing to pass upon the adequacy of a proposed iep.f.under new hampshire law,the school district also may pursue a due process hearing to test the validity of a proposed iep.see admin.ann.ed.c.either side may then appeal from the hearing officer final decision to either a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction.i a.
iii.the standard of review 
in reviewing the hearing officer decision,the district court is tasked with determining the iep appropriateness on the basis of the preponderance of the evidence.see id.i b.judges are not trained pedagogues,and they must accord deference to the state agency application of its specialized knowledge.see renner bd.of educ.of pub.schs.of ann arbor,cir remarking that federal courts are generalists with no expertise in the educational needs of handicapped children citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also gonz√°lez dep t of,cir noting that a district court,faced with conflicting expert testimony anent educational placement,may justifiably feel bound to affirm the state agency determination.as a result,judicial review falls somewhere between the highly deferential standard and the de novo standard.see roland,at see also nack orange city sch,cir observing that district court may give some deference to the fact findings of the hearing officer,especially when educational expertise is essential to the findings.
in this case,the district court appropriately engaged in a bounded,independent review of the state hearing officer decision,see,hampton sch.dist.dobrowolski,cir,giving due deference to the hearing officer determinations.because the court findings and conclusions are consistent with those of the hearing officer,we for the most part abjure separate reference to the hearing officer decision and focus on the decision of the district court.
with respect to that decision,we grant its factual findings the deference implicit in review,see gonz√°lez,at,while evaluating its answers to abstract questions of law de novo,see five town,at.determinations as to an iep appropriateness and adequacy present mixed questions of law and fact.these questions are handled on a continuum,and the exact standard of review depends on whether and to what extent a particular determination is law or.see id.at me.sch.admin.dist,cir.absent an error of law,we will reverse only if the district court determination,when seen in light of the record as a whole,is clearly erroneous.see,at roland,at.
iv.analysis 
the appellants raise both procedural and substantive objections to the decision below.their procedural objection rests on an allegation that the district court improperly excused the school district delay in proffering a completed iep.their substantive objection has twin foci first,they assert that the district court used an incorrect standard in evaluating the iep second,they assert that the final version of the iep failed to provide for adequate literacy,transition,and behavioral services.we address these objections sequentially.
a.the procedural objection.
the appellants claim that the august iep was incomplete and that the december iep was so tardy as to constitute a per se denial of stephanie right to a fape.in mounting this argument,they emphasize the idea requirement that a t the beginning of each school year,each local educational agency shall have in effect,for each child with a disability in its jurisdiction,an individualized education program.d a.
this assault depends entirely on the alleged incompleteness of the august iep.that allegation is grounded on two perceived shortcomings in that document the truncated transition plan and the absence of a behavioral plan.the appellants contend that these shortcomings eloquently attest that the august iep offered stephanie only a fraction of what she was entitled to receive.
this contention substantially misconceives what the idea requires.the transition plan contained in the august iep consists solely of background information and performance goals,and suddenly ends.that is hardly a transition plan.the rub,however,is that the idea does not require a transition plan as part of an iep.
sections d a vii i and ii,reproduced in the margin require that ieps contain statements of transition services.but neither section requires that those statements be articulated in a separate component of the iep.in fact,section d a vii i specifically contemplates the inclusion of statements of transition services under the applicable components of the child iep.thus,merely pointing to the absence of a transition plan can not form the basis for a founded claim of procedural error.
to be sure,the statutory provisions quoted in the margin implicitly acknowledge that transition services must be provided to disabled children who need them,in accordance with the rowley standard.see,browell lemahieu,d.here,however,the appellants have made no claim that the august iep lacks sufficient transition services which,in fact,are integrated throughout the iep various components.we thus reject the transition plan claim of error.
an even more egregious misunderstanding of the idea requirements undermines the claim of procedural error based on a missing behavioral plan.the idea only requires a behavioral plan when certain disciplinary actions are taken against a disabled child.see k a b see also alex forrestville valley sch,cir.the appellants make no claim that the necessary disciplinary predicate had transpired in this instance.
the other statutory provision cited by the d b i also falls short of requiring a behavioral plan as an ubiquitous feature in every iep.that statute,in terms,directs iep teams to consider,when appropriate,formulating such plans.the record is pellucid that,by the time the august iep was prepared,the iep team already had considered and formulated a behavioral plan but had opted not to include it in the iep pending crotched mountain approval.
in a effort to turn the tide,the appellants call our attention to a federal regulation,c,which states if the iep team determines that a child needs a particular device or service including an intervention,accommodation,or other program modification in order for the child to receive fape,the iep team must include a statement to that effect in the child iep.although such a regulation is entitled to judicial deference,see greenland sch.dist.amy,cir,this regulation did not require the august iep to encompass a behavioral plan,merely to consider formulating one.here,the iep team mulled the matter and determined that a behavioral plan was not necessary in order to afford stephanie a fape.no more was exigible.
that effectively ends this aspect of the matter.we conclude,without serious question,that the district court did not err in finding that the absence of either a transition or behavioral plan did not constitute a procedural defect within the meaning of the idea.
once it is determined that the august iep was complete,the appellants argument quickly unravels.all that remains is the lack of a signed iep at the start of the school year.but even in a regime in which parental assent is required before an iep can become effective,it can not be that a school system transgresses the idea whenever a whatever to sign a completed iep before the school year commences.otherwise,school systems would be at the mercy of obdurate result plainly at odds with the collaborative relationship fostered by the idea framework.see,five town,at the development of an iep is meant to be a collaborative project.mm sch.dist.of greenville county,cir explaining that it would be improper to hold a school district liable for the procedural violation of failing to have the iep completed and signed,when that failure was the result of the parents lack of cooperation citation and internal quotation marks omitted.consequently,a parent obstruction of the iep process,caused by his or her unreasonable delay in acting upon a completed iep,can relieve a school system from its obligation to have an iep in place at the start of the school year.see doe defendant i,cir see also roland,at the law ought not to abet parties who block assembly of the required team and then,dissatisfied with the ensuing iep,attempt to jettison it because of problems created by their own obstructionism.
the case at bar presents a paradigmatic example of a situation in which a delay in having a signed iep in place is fairly laid at the parents doorstep.on august,the school district presented stephanie mother with a completed iep that covered every essential component.from that point forward,the record discloses a consistent pattern in which the school district would strive to identify the parents specific concerns and the parents would refuse to say more than that they wanted further meetings.the school district made numerous attempts to arrange such meetings and succeeded in holding two extended sessions with stephanie mother.these meetings proved fruitless the most that could be gleaned from lessard was her opinion that the proffered iep was,for some unexplained reason,still in the developing stage.
given this,we can discern no clear error in the district court conclusion that whatever delays plagued the signing of stephanie iep were the product of her mother own intransigence see lessard,wl,at.those delays,in turn,justified the court in exonerating the school district with respect to the iep late implementation.the interactive process constructed by congress was not intended to deal a trump card to parents bent on prolonging iep negotiations indefinitely.see mm,at.
the appellants object to this finding,citing our remonstrances in there,we cautioned that i n mounting a challenge to a current or proposed iep,the most that parents can be expected to do is to point out areas in which the iep is deficient.at.the appellants suggest that,under this precept,they can not be faulted for having failed to respond to the school district requests for insight.this suggestion is baseless.
is often difficult,and in the iep context it is impossible to draw a precise line separating healthy requests for parental input from impermissible demands that parents do the school system work.here the record leaves no doubt as to where along that continuum the present case falls.when the school district contacted stephanie mother following her rejection of the august iep,it asked her to state specifically what you agree or disagree with.such an entreaty,which the school district essentially repeated in letters of inquiry sent to her on august,october,november,and november,respectively,strikes us as the functional equivalent of a request to point out deficiencies in an iep.
b.the substantive objections.
we turn next to the appellants substantive objections,which are addressed to the december iep.we subdivide this discussion into four segments to match the appellants asseverational array.
incorrect legal standard.the appellants insist that the lower court erred by applying an incorrect legal standard.specifically,they argue that,in the area of transition services,the rowley standard has been supplanted by the amendments to the idea,see idea amendments for,stat,but the court failed to recognize this development.
to put this argument into perspective,we start with the rowley court mandate that iep components must be reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.at.the appellants contend that congress,in,raised the bar for iep transition services,directing that those services must result in actual and substantial progress toward integrating disabled children into society.
existing precedent forecloses this contention.in,the parents advanced a similar though slightly more ambitious thesis they posited that,given congress statement of goals,the amendments must have replaced the rowley standard across the board with a requirement that an iep furnish a disabled child with the maximum benefit available.at.we flatly rejected that thesis,noting that it had no support in the text of the amendments and that no other court of appeals,had exhibited a willingness to scuttle the rowley standard.id.for aught that appears,the decision in remains good law 
to the interpretive mix presented in,the appellants add only an allusion to the amendments definition of transition services.in relevant part,the amendments defined that term to mean a coordinated set of activities for a student with a disability that is designed within an process,which promotes movement from school to activities.a.the appellants theorize that an process must mean a process that actually achieves substantial progress toward that outcome and,thus,the amendments must to this extent have superseded the rowley standard.
the appellants read far too much into congress definition of transition services.it seems obvious to us that the word process denotes a praxis or procedure it does not imply a substantive standard or a particular measure of progress.the adjectival phrase is similarly agnostic with respect to ultimate results it specifies the perspective that participants in the process should strive to attain but does not establish a standard for evaluating the fruits of that process.
for these reasons,we decline the appellants invitation to defenestrate the rowley standard.the district court did not apply an incorrect legal rule in evaluating the adequacy of the transition services limned in stephanie final iep.
literacy.the appellants next claim relates to stephanie proposed reading program.in their view,the school district literacy methodology produced a level of progress categorically beneath what their daughter was capable of attaining.since superior methodologies were readily available in particular the lips system advocated by kemper,the school district chosen methodology denied stephanie a fape.
it is difficult to prevail on a claim of this nature.the supreme court has pointed out with conspicuous clarity that the idea confers primary responsibility upon state and local educational agencies to choose among competing pedagogical methodologies and to select the method most suitable to a particular child needs.rowley,at.rehnquist,writing for the majority,added that it seems highly unlikely that congress intended courts to overturn a state choice of appropriate educational theories in a proceeding conducted pursuant to the idea.id.at.after all,courts lack the specialized knowledge and experience needed to resolve persistent and difficult questions of educational policy.id.at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,once a court determines that the requirements of the idea have been met,questions of methodology are for resolution by the states.id.
rowley sends a very clear message.the short of it is that courts are entrusted with ascertaining the adequacy of an iep educational components but not with weighing the comparative merit of the components when stacked against other heuristic methods.see,at westmoreland sch,cir.
in an effort to expand the scope of judicial intervention,the appellants resort to an esoteric definition of appropriate educational theories,which they equate with theories that produce results.they do not contest that stephanie was the beneficiary of a standard,multisensory reading methodology.nevertheless,they argue that since kemper concluded that stephanie had progressed very little under that methodology,it was,a fortiori,inappropriate.
this construct inverts the rule of decision.actual educational progress can and sometimes will demonstrate that an iep provides a fape.see,rowley,at.nack,at see also roland,at explaining that actual educational results are relevant to determining the efficacy of educators policy choices.but to impose the inverse of this a lack of progress necessarily betokens an iep contradict the fundamental concept that a n iep is a snapshot,not a retrospective.roland,at.where,as here,a school system develops an iep component in reliance upon a methodology,an inquiring court ought
