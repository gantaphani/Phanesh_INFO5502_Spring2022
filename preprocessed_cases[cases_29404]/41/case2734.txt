barbara hurlbert,executor of the estate of thomas hurlbert,appeals the district court order granting summary judgment to thomas hurlbert hurlbert former employer,mary health care system,mary,on hurlbert claims under the family and medical leave act of fmla or the act the district court determined that hurlbert could not establish statutory entitlement to fmla leave,and that his fmla interference and retaliation claims must therefore fail.with respect to hurlbert retaliation claim,the court further found hurlbert had failed to present sufficient evidence that mary proffered reason for his termination was pretextual.we hold that the district court erred in construing pertinent regulatory language,and in assessing the evidence of pretext.as a result,we reverse and remand for further proceedings on both the interference and the retaliation claims.
background 
hurlbert started working for mary in,as a paramedic.in addition to fulfilling his duties at mary,hurlbert worked with the rockdale county fire department rockdale.his duties at rockdale included firefighting and dealing with hazardous materials,although he was also able to employ his paramedic skills as needed.
shortly after being hired by mary,hurlbert was promoted to a supervisory position that involved the maintenance of mary emergency medical services ems vehicles.approximately five years later hurlbert duties changed,and he became responsible for supervising one of mary three emergency medical technician emt shifts.among other things,hurlbert was required to ensure that ems units were adequately staffed during his shift,to visit and check on the various duty stations from which the units operated,and to transport linens.
hurlbert suffered a heart attack in october of.after he underwent a successful angioplasty and stent replacement,he was released by his cardiologist,thomas murphy,to return to work at mary on november,and at rockdale on november.prior to his release,hurlbert was diagnosed with depression and anxiety,as well as sinusitis.among the medications he was prescribed was paxil,for anxiety and stress hurlbert did return to work,however,at both mary and rockdale.
in february of,mary underwent an internal reorganization.the oversight of ems was transferred from marilyn hill to executive director bonnie butler,who had been directing various other services at mary for eight years.after conducting a departmental review of ems,butler concluded that its director position should be replaced by that of a working manager.in july of,butler eliminated the position of ems director held by frank sparky wilson,and promoted jeff sosby to the new working manager position 
as part of butler departmental review,she reassessed a number of unresolved patient complaints,including one about medical services rendered by hurlbert to a old child back in late february of.butler ultimately concluded that hurlbert had falsified his account of events,and should have been terminated by sparky wilson.given the age of the complaint,however,she issued hurlbert a disciplinary letter instead of terminating him.hurlbert,who denied engaging in any falsification,filed a grievance regarding the disciplinary action.during the early stages of the grievance process,butler decided to have hurlbert undergo a competency evaluation 
around that time hurlbert also learned that his mother would have to undergo open heart surgery,and used several vacation days in early august to go visit her.on august,the ems medical director,jerome howell,administered a skills competency test to hurlbert.although each of the seven competency areas on the exam was only,and hurlbert passed five,howell did not mark either pass or fail in two of the competency areas.instead,howell commented that hurlbert seemed rusty in his use of the lifepak and was not familiar with the use of the lifepak,and needed to review the use of drugs contained in the ems drug bag,as well as how those drugs are administered.howell does not recall discussing the results of the examination with butler,but did tell education director mike mcelhannon that hurlbert needed to do some additional review.hurlbert likewise recalls howell telling him to brush up on the drug bag portion of the test.
on september,hurlbert received a hearing before an internal committee on his grievance.the committee upheld butler disciplinary action,but removed her reference to falsification.later that same day,hurlbert met with howell to complete the lifepak and drug bag portions of hurlbert earlier competency exam hurlbert remembers making a mistake in describing one drug,but claims howell told him it did matter because mary was going to remove that drug from the drug box altogether.hurlbert also contends that howell never said that hurlbert failed the test.howell recollection is that hurlbert had clearly studied and was making his best effort,but had not necessarily established that he was prepared to perform the duties of his position.howell was concerned about hurlbert ability to perform under stress,and suggested to hurlbert that he might need to tak e some time off or tak e a break or maybe,you know,stay off the truck and do something else for a while.similarly,hurlbert recalls discussing with howell the increasing stress and exhaustion created by hurlbert heavy workload,the feeling of being singled out for discipline,and his mother health.hurlbert remembers stating that he needed to visit his mother,and did want to continue working as a paramedic until he had done so.according to hurlbert,howell advised him to relax and assured him that he howell would help hurlbert get some time off to visit his mom.
after finishing with hurlbert,howell went to speak with mike mcelhannon about hurlbert status.howell explained to mcelhannon and jeff sosby,who also was present that he howell thought hurlbert was showing signs that his confidence in his own knowledge and experience was in doubt and i think under stress,he was wavering a little.howell recalls stating that it would be helpful if hurlbert could take on a more job,but denies ever saying that hurlbert should not serve as a,or that hurlbert should be terminated.at some point after howell finished speaking with mcelhannon and sosby,hurlbert located sosby and asked about taking leave 
i indicated to him that i wanted to put in for a leave.and he told me he did know how to do that,that he was new at that job,which he had just been put into it sic.he was really familiar with it and he did know if he had paperwork and all this other sic.and i says,well,okay.well,i surely would appreciate it if you would make the arrangements because i would just like to take off and get out of here and go see my mom.
sosby replied that he would look into the matter,and later obtained a leave form for hurlbert.
at some point between the end of hurlbert examination on september and the morning of september,bonnie butler met with howell.according to butler,howell explained that hurlbert had improved in his understanding of medications,but became confused about how to use them when given certain scenarios.butler contends that howell could not recommend putting hurlbert back on the truck.howell did ask,however,whether there were other jobs within mary system that hurlbert could perform,and butler replied that she would check and see.it appears that butler also met with mary vice president of human resources and support services,jeff english,who testified in his deposition that butler told him howell felt like it was the right thing to do to put tom hurlbert back on the truck.according to english,butler also discussed with him several options she had been thinking about regarding hurlbert try to help hurlbert find a different job within mary system let hurlbert resign and provide him thirty days severance pay or terminate hurlbert employment.english acknowledged that leave was not discussed as an option in his conversation with butler,but explained that he was not then aware of hurlbert desire to go on leave.
on september,hurlbert again met with sosby in order to fill out paperwork.according to hurlbert,sosby initially agreed to help with the paperwork,but when hurlbert returned to sosby office after leaving to use the restroom,sosby informed him that plans had changed hurlbert could either resign and receive a month severance pay,or be fired hurlbert described his response as follows 
sosby,my answer to that is i not going to resign.i absolutely refuse to resign.so i would think by default that i terminated,so i suppose my next step,which i fixing to go do,is go clock out and i going to go home.i do intend to stay here for free.
when hurlbert arrived at his home,however,he received a phone call from bonnie butler.according to hurlbert,butler stated that he was fired and asked him to come to her office that afternoon.when hurlbert arrived,butler and another mary employee named karen were present.butler explained that hurlbert could no longer serve as a paramedic at mary,and hurlbert then inquired about his leave 
and i says,well,butler,i have one question before we keep going on in this anymore.i figured right then i was terminated,but i asked her also,i says,what important to me now,i says,the leave is going to happen,is it and she says,no,it not.talking about my medical leave that i requested sic.
hurlbert then stated that the meeting was over,the refusal of leave was illegal,and he would be speaking to his attorney sosby,who was also present during the meeting,testified that after hurlbert left,he sosby probably told butler that hurlbert had requested fmla leave and that sosby had brought the paperwork with him.
on september,sosby received a letter from hurlbert.the letter purported to be a follow up to hurlbert request to take fmla leave as was recommended by howell last week.hurlbert explained in the letter that he had been treated by his family physician,samuel griffin,and that griffin agreed hurlbert needed to take a day leave of absence because of the mental stress hurlbert was under and its impact on his health.hurlbert attached a note from griffin,dated september,which indicated that hurlbert was under griffin treatment and could return to work on october.in the letter hurlbert also expressed his understanding that leave papers had been sent to sosby for hurlbert to complete,but that hurlbert meeting with butler prevented these papers from being completed and submitted.hurlbert asked if he needed to complete any paperwork to formally request leave,and requested that his accrued paid sick and vacation leave be applied during the day period.
although sosby and butler discussed hurlbert letter,butler advised that mary could not grant leave after hurlbert had been terminated a corrective counseling action form dated september,which was stamped received by human resources on september,appears to have been signed by butler,sosby,and one karen joyce.the form states that hurlbert was discharged due to his inability to pass the competency review.butler name also appears on a personnel action request form par dated september.although the par indicates that hurlbert was terminated,and that termination requires the completion of certain additional sections on the form including the reason for termination,these sections are blank.according to jeff english,the issuance of corrective counseling action form and par formalize the termination process,and human resources will typically prepare a separation notice within a day or two of receiving the par.although hurlbert par is stamped received by human resources on september,his separation notice was not issued until september,though it was backdated to september the notice identifies the reason for hurlbert separation as f ailure to meet competency requirements.
approximately months after receiving his separation notice,hurlbert filed suit against mary under the fmla,pleading for damages and declaratory and injunctive relief.hurlbert alleges that mary terminated him following his request for leave,thus interfering with hurlbert right to take fmla leave and retaliating against him in violation of the fmla.
the district court granted mary motion for summary judgment on both claims.although the court found genuine issues of fact on whether hurlbert had requested fmla leave before or after termination,the court determined that hurlbert could not establish statutory entitlement to the leave because the stress suffered by hurlbert was not a serious health condition under the statute hurlbert could not link the stress to the period of incapacity caused by his heart attack in and hurlbert could not rely on his mother health condition because he had not raised it in his complaint.without statutory eligibility for leave,the court concluded,hurlbert interference claim must fail.hurlbert retaliation claim likewise failed,the district court determined,because hurlbert could not have availed himself of fmla rights that he did not possess.even if hurlbert could bring a retaliation claim,the court added,hurlbert only evidence of pretext was his own subjective belief about the basis for his termination,which is insufficient to survive summary judgment.hurlbert appeals both determinations.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards that bound the district court,and viewing all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.cruz publix super,cir internal quotes and emphasis omitted.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
iii.discussion 
the fmla grants an eligible employee the right to take up to workweeks of unpaid leave annually for any one or more of several reasons,including b ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.a d.the act creates a private right of action to seek equitable relief and money damages against employers who interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise fmla rights.a,a see.dep t of human res.hibbs,d.we have recognized that a creates two types of claims interference claims,in which an employee asserts that his employer denied or otherwise interfered with his substantive rights under the act,and retaliation claims,in which an employee asserts that his employer discriminated against him because he engaged in activity protected by the act.strickland water works and sewer bd.of the city of birmingham,cir internal citations omitted.
interference claim 
to establish an interference claim,an employee need only demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to the benefit denied.id.at.the employee need not allege that his employer intended to deny the benefit the employer motives are irrelevant.id.at.hurlbert contends the district court erred in determining that he did not suffer from a serious health condition,and thus was not entitled to fmla leave.as defined in the fmla,serious health condition means an illness,injury,impairment,or physical or mental condition that involves a inpatient care in a hospital,hospice,or residential medical care facility or b continuing treatment by a health care provider.hurlbert points to the fact that he was diagnosed with anxiety following his heart attack as evidence of a mental condition involving continuing treatment by a health care provider.we must consider this argument not only under the language of the statute,but also under pertinent regulations promulgated by the department of labor 
a for purposes of fmla,serious health condition entitling an employee to fmla leave means an illness,injury,impairment,or physical or mental condition that involves 
continuing treatment by a health care provider.a serious health condition involving continuing treatment by a health care provider includes any one or more of the following 
i a period of incapacity,inability to work,attend school or perform other regular daily activities due to the serious health condition,treatment therefor,or recovery therefrom of more than three consecutive calendar days,and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition,that also involves 
a treatment two or more times by a health care provider,by a nurse or physician assistant under direct supervision of a health care provider,or by a provider of health care services,physical therapist under orders of,or on referral by,a health care provider or 
b treatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion which results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider.
see russell north broward,cir 
hurlbert argues that he meets the requirements of a i,because his october heart attack resulted in a period of incapacity exceeding three calendar days,and his subsequent treatment for anxiety related to that condition and involved a regimen of continuing treatment,a paxil prescription the district court found this argument unpersuasive,because it found no evidence that hurlbert heart attack and that period of incapacity almost three years prior was sufficiently related to the events at issue.we agree,in that hurlbert argument tends to conflate his heart attack and his anxiety.section a i refers to a period of incapacity due to the serious health condition and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition emphasis omitted.although hurlbert was incapacitated by his heart attack,the summary judgment evidence is not that hurlbert was prescribed paxil for his heart attack,but rather for anxiety,with which he was separately diagnosed before returning to work.thus,we are not persuaded that any treatment for or period of incapacity caused by hurlbert anxiety relates to his heart attack for purposes of a i.
even if this is so,hurlbert argues,he still meets the conditions described in a i,because his anxiety was itself the cause of a period of thirty day period described in hurlbert september letter which stated that he needed a thirty day leave of absence due to mental stress and evidenced by griffin note.the district court rejected this argument on the grounds that hurlbert was not incapacitated within the meaning of,because hurlbert had continued to work at rockdale during the thirty day period in question.in reaching this conclusion,the district court held that hurlbert showing of incapacity must be made in accordance with the americans with disabilities act ada,et,and the regulations at n.under these provisions,the court reasoned,one must show that he is substantially limited or significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs,or a broad range of jobs in various classes,as compared to an average person with comparable training,skills,and abilities.while hurlbert may not have been able to work as a paramedic at mary,the court explained,his work at rockdale was sufficiently similar to preclude him from establishing the requisite period of incapacity.
the district court erred when it conducted an incapacity analysis under the ada and corresponding regulations.section does refer to the ada and n as relevant for purposes of determining whether an employee is unable to perform the functions of the position of the employee under a d,but that statutory inquiry is distinct from the inquiry into whether an employee has a serious health condition,which is where the term incapacity comes into play.see,stekloff john mercy health,cir.as the eighth circuit pointed out in stekloff,there may be some parallels between the ada and fmla,but applicable regulations explicitly state that ada disability and the fmla serious health condition are different concepts,and must be analyzed separately.id.at quoting b.
the definition of incapacity is set out in a serious health condition includes a period of incapacity,inability to work,attend school or perform other regular daily activities due to the serious health condition,treatment therefor,or recovery therefrom a for the reasons stated above,however,we decline to identify the meaning of inability to work with the ada inquiry into whether a person is unable to perform the major life activity of working,j.instead,we agree with the analysis of the eighth circuit in stekloff 
upon consideration of the declared purposes of the fmla and its legislative history,we hold that a demonstration that an employee is unable to work in his or her current job due to a serious health condition is enough to show that the employee is incapacitated,even if that job is the only one the employee is unable to perform.
at emphasis added.but j i explaining that under the ada t he inability to perform a single,particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.we therefore reject mary claim that,as a matter of law,hurlbert could not have experienced an inability to work in his position at mary within the meaning of a i when he continued to perform similar duties for rockdale 
mary argues that summary judgment was nevertheless appropriate,because hurlbert presented no medical evidence of an inability to work for three days or more,or an inability to perform the functions of his position.having reviewed the record in the light most favorable to hurlbert,including the testimony of howell and hurlbert note from griffin,we find that there are genuine issues of fact precluding summary judgment for mary on these grounds.we must therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment on hurlbert interference claim and remand it for further proceedings.
in addition to the theories discussed above,hurlbert asserted two other arguments in support of his interference claim.one was that he could satisfy a iii,because his anxiety amounted to a chronic serious health condition described therein like hurlbert claim under a i,the district court found this argument unavailing because a chronic serious health condition requires a period of incapacity and,under the district court interpretation of the applicable regulations,hurlbert work at rockdale precluded such a finding.as we disagree with that aspect of the district court interpretation,and as mary has presented no further argument other than those already discussed above on why a iii could not apply,hurlbert is free to reassert this theory on remand.however,the district court correctly rejected hurlbert final he was entitled to fmla leave in order to care for his mother,who was recovering from heart surgery.
the fmla authorizes leave i n order to care for the parent,of the employee,if such parent has a serious health condition.a c.hurlbert complaint,however,provided no notice whatsoever that he believed he was entitled to leave on this basis.indeed,the only person in the complaint alleged to have a experienced a serious health condition is hurlbert.we have previously held that rule a liberal pleading standard is inapplicable once discovery has commenced,and that a t the summary judgment stage,the proper procedure for plaintiffs to assert a new claim is to amend the complaint in accordance with.a.gilmour gates,mcdonald and,cir per curiam.hurlbert argues that this rule is inapplicable,because his allegations about his mother do not raise a new claim,and are merely additional facts asserted in support of the interference claim already pled in his complaint.we disagree.the sole basis for entitlement to fmla leave pled in hurlbert interference claim was his alleged serious health condition.see a d.thus,the subsequent assertion of an additional,separate statutory basis for entitlement to leave caring for a parent serious health condition effects a fundamental change in the nature of hurlbert interference claim.see id.at a c.having proceeded through discovery without amending or seeking to amend his complaint to reflect that fundamental change,hurlbert was not entitled to raise it in the midst of summary judgment.see gilmour,at a plaintiff may not amend his complaint through argument in a brief opposing summary judgment.
retaliation claim 
where,as here,a plaintiff alleges an fmla retaliation claim without direct evidence of the employer retaliatory intent,we apply the burden shifting framework established by the supreme court in mcdonnell douglas green,d.st
