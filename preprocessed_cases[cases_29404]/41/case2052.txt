kelechi ajoku ajoku,convicted of four counts of making false statements relating to health care matters and sentenced to thirteen months incarceration plus restitution,appeals,arguing the district court erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on all counts because the government presented insufficient evidence to support the convictions failing to instruct the jury that a duty to disclose is an element of false statements by concealment improperly instructing the jury on the elements of willfulness and materiality and admitting inflammatory and unduly prejudicial evidence concerning the scope of the alleged billing fraud.he also argues that the cumulative effect of these errors requires reversal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm.
facts and procedural history 
in,ajoku,a licensed vocational nurse,was offered a job to serve as the exemptee for the santos medical supply company santos at a salary of per month.under california regulations,an exemptee,acting like a pharmacist,is responsible for maintaining and distributing prescription medical devices for retailers like santos.cal.health safety code.santos did not require ajoku,who was working hours a week at two other jobs,to actually perform the functions of exemptee as a condition of compensation.rather,ajoku was required only to complete paperwork and remain on call to come into the business and answer questions if government inspectors visited the facility.
ajoku agreed to the arrangement and prepared an application for his exemptee license.when his first exemptee application was rejected due to insufficient information,ajoku supplemented the application by signing a backdated employment contract and an affidavit that stated he would be present whenever prescription devices were dispensed and he would have exclusive control over the items facts ajoku knew to be false.after ajoku received his license,he was paid a bonus,and put on the santos payroll.santos immediately began to bill medicare for device sales something it could not lawfully do without a state licensed exemptee.
although ajoku was unaware that santos was entirely organized and executed to defraud medicare by billing the program for medical devices never delivered,santos sham transactions would not have been possible with a real exemptee ensuring the prescription devices were distributed in accordance with state regulations.santos ultimately billed medicare for million in fraudulent claims,for which it was paid approximately million.
ajoku never performed the duties of an exemptee but would visit santos from to complete paperwork for the group.in,ajoku completed and signed multiple training forms certifying to medicare that he had delivered and trained patients to use motorized wheelchairs even though he had not done so.ajoku renewed his exemptee license annually from through,each year certifying to california that he was working as a proper exemptee for santos.
on april,a california department of public health inspector visited santos and ajoku was summoned to answer his questions.though santos passed the inspection,the investigator tipped off medicare officials of possible fraud at the company.on may,two agents of the department of health and human services visited santos wearing hidden video and audio recorders.ajoku was again called in to pose as an active exemptee for santos.answering the agents questions,ajoku asserted that he had responsibility for storing and distributing the prescription goods and training patients on their use.after a few minutes,ajoku ended the line of questioning by telling the agents he had to go.
a federal grand jury subsequently returned an indictment against ajoku and other members of the santos operation,the final version of which alleged health care fraud,conspiracy to commit health care fraud,and false statements.by the time of trial,everyone but ajoku had entered guilty pleas.the government proceeded to trial on the false statement counts and ajoku was convicted on each count.
discussion 
sufficiency challenges 
we review de novo claims of insufficient evidence,asking whether the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecutor,could allow any rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states nevils,cir quoting jackson virginia,d emphasis omitted.
a.the jurisdictional element 
there was sufficient evidence to convict ajoku of making a false statement relating to a health care benefit program for his communication with california officials under a.that section provides 
whoever,in any matter involving a health care benefit program,knowingly and willfully 
falsifies,conceals,or covers up by any trick,scheme,or device a material fact or 
makes any materially false,fictitious,or fraudulent statements or representations,or makes or uses any materially false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement or entry,
in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care shall be punished accordingly.
a plain reading of a reveals that the jury was required to find that the matter involved a health benefit program,not that the particular statement falsified or covered up involved a health benefit program.id.the jury was presented with evidence that ajoku statements and writings were made in connection with the delivery of and medicare payment for prescription devices because santos could not bill medicare for devices without employing and utilizing a qualified exemptee under california law.
we need not address the outer limit of whether a statement involv es a health care program for the purposes of because there was sufficient evidence to determine that ajoku statements to california authorities were made in a matter involving medicare.while ajoku made his statements to california rather than federal authorities,we have held that false statements that are not made to federal authorities but that concern matters of interest to the federal government may fall within federal oversight.for example,is substantially identical to,which sanctions anyone who knowingly and willfully makes any materially false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement or representation concerning any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive,legislative,or judicial branch of the government of the united states we have previously held that encompasses statements involving matters of federal concern,even when those statements were made to state investigators.see united states king,cir,cert.denied,d holding that false statements made to an idaho agricultural inspector were sufficiently tied to federal interests to violate.we have also held that encompasses false documents that were never actually provided to any governmental entity,so long as they were intended to be used in a matter of federal concern.see united states balk,cir under section,the falsified documents did not have to be submitted to the navy it is only necessary that their intended use be related to a matter within the jurisdiction of the navy.given our precedent,it is immaterial that ajoku statements were made to california investigators rather than directly to federal authorities.instead,it is sufficient for the purposes of that the statements were made to state authorities in a matter affecting the delivery of federal medicare payments.
materiality to medicare of state regulatory compliance 
ajoku was charged in count one with falsifying,concealing,or covering up that santos maintained and distributed syringes outside his presence and control.a statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence,or be capable of influencing,the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed.united states gaudin,d quoting kungys united states,d.the jury heard sufficient evidence that ajoku statements and concealment were addressed to medicare.among other things,ajoku concedes that some of his statements to investigators were directed to medicare.his other statements included his application for the exemptee license,the annual renewals,and his participation in a regulatory compliance inspection.thi
