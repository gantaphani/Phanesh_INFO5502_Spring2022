jaime ochoa baldovinos appeals from his convictions and sentence in the western district of north carolina on three drug offenses and a firearms offense.baldovinos makes two contentions on appeal,both of which are constitutionally based that he is entitled to a new trial because he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel and that his sentence must be vacated because he was involuntarily medicated with antipsychotic drugs for the purpose of rendering him competent to be sentenced.as explained below,we reject the ineffective assistance claim because it does not conclusively appear from the record that baldovinos lawyer was constitutionally ineffective.in resolving the involuntary medication claim,we conclude that our analysis is governed by the principles of sell united states,d,we accept the prosecution concession of plain error,and in the exercise of our discretion we decline to correct the error.
on september,the grand jury charged baldovinos with a single count of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine,two counts of possessing with intent to distribute cocaine a,and one count of using a firearm during and in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense c.baldovinos proceeded to trial and,on march,a jury convicted him on all four offenses.
on june,prior to his sentencing,baldovinos filed a motion in the district court seeking a transfer from the mecklenburg county jail the jail to the federal correctional institution at butner,north carolina butner for a mental health evaluation.by order of june,the court directed,pursuant to the provisions of a and that baldovinos undergo an evaluation at butner or a like facility,to determine whether he was suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to proceed with sentencing.
on august,the physicians at butner submitted a report concerning baldovinos condition the first report to the district court.based on the information available to them,the butner physicians concluded that baldovinos mental health problems began in june,after his trial had concluded.that information included the statement of a probation officer who had interviewed baldovinos in may and remarked that he appeared normal,and the statement of his counsel that baldovinos had exhibited no signs of mental illness during his march trial or during his may interview with the probation officer.
the first report described in detail baldovinos troubled behavior after his transfer to butner.shortly after his arrival there,baldovinos was placed on suicide watch due to the severity of the behavioral disturbance.specifically,baldovinos 
remained curled into the fetal position,on the concrete floor,under the bed,and he did not respond to verbal intervention.he would alternatively crouch for several hours in the corner of his room or in the shower.when he was touched by the staff,he would further cower,moan,become tearful,and withdraw in a frightened manner.he consumed little food and soiled himself.he resisted staff members efforts to move and clean him.
id.at.when baldovinos refused to eat and drink on his own,leading to dehydration,the physicians emergently treated him with haldol and antipsychotic drugs.although the medication temporarily improved baldovinos condition,making him alert and reactive,he quickly decompensated.some days later,after being treated for head lice which involved cutting off much of his hair,baldovinos beseeched the staff to kill him and smeared feces on the windows of his room.he was once again emergently treated with haldol and ativan,and he showed the same small but unsustained improvements in his condition.
based on interviews with baldovinos and observations of his behavior,the butner physicians concluded that he suffered from catatonia.the cause of his catatonia,however,was unclear.the physicians principally diagnosed baldovinos with a psychotic disorder,such as schizophrenia,but also explained that his catatonia could result from a neurological problem,a mood disorder,depression,or stress disorder.the doctors advised the court that,in order to make an accurate diagnosis of baldovinos illness,they needed his medical records and other documentation of his behavior from the jail.
in the first report,the physicians ultimately concluded that baldovinos was not competent to be sentenced.however,given his brief positive responses to the earlier emergent treatments with haldol and ativan,the physicians asserted that there was a substantial probability that they could restore baldovinos competency for his sentencing if the court extended his commitment period and authorized them to involuntarily administer antipsychotic medication.
referencing the supreme court decision in sell united states,d,the physicians articulated several reasons in support of their request for permission to treat baldovinos with antipsychotic drugs.they first explained that treatment of psychotic symptoms,such as catatonia,with antipsychotic medication was medically appropriate.they also asserted that such treatment would be unlikely to significantly interfere with baldovinos ability to assist his counsel at sentencing,given that baldovinos neither complained of,nor did the staff observe,any adverse side effects to his earlier emergent treatment.the physicians expressed hope that,after a period of treating baldovinos with typical antipsychotic drugs,his condition would improve to the point that he would consensually take atypical drugs,which could only be administered orally and are generally associated with less severe side effects than their typical counterparts.id.finally,the physicians concluded that baldovinos was not amenable to other therapies at this time.id.at.
the butner physicians predicted that,after four months of treatment,baldovinos would be restored to competency and could be finally sentenced under the sentencing guidelines,rather than provisionally sentenced,pursuant to d,to a suitable facility for care and treatment for the maximum authorized term.they warned that,if the court returned baldovinos to the jail,precautions would have to be taken to protect his safety,including possible sedation and careful attention to ensure that he attends to activities of daily living,eating,drinking,toileting,showering,and does not harm himself.
by order of august,the district court found,for the reasons spelled out in the first report,that baldovinos was legally incompetent,and the court t herefore extended his commitment period for continued treatment.the court also authorized the butner physicians to involuntarily medicate baldovinos and directed officials at the jail to furnish the butner physicians with any documentation concerning baldovinos that they requested.at no time did baldovinos or his lawyer object to his being medicated.
on january,the butner physicians submitted a second report to the court the second report,again concluding that baldovinos was not competent to be sentenced,but expressing hope that his treatment with different antipsychotic medication would meet with greater success should the court extend baldovinos commitment period based on information obtained from the jail and on further observation of baldovinos behavior,the physicians diagnosed him with schizophrenia.among other things,the records from the jail revealed that baldovinos had not experienced his first psychotic break in june,but rather in august while being housed at the jail.at that time,he had been treated with antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs and had responded positively,exhibiting no further signs of mental illness until may.the second report concluded by requesting that the court defer provisionally sentencing baldovinos under d until attempts to restore his competency had been exhausted.
on june,the butner physicians submitted a third report to the court the third report,concluding that baldovinos was incompetent to be sentenced,but asserting a different predicting that a hybrid treatment of risperidone an antipsychotic drug and antidepressants would produce better results.on august,the physicians submitted yet another report to the court the fourth report,concluding that baldovinos competency had been restored.the physicians explained that,with an increased dosage of medication,baldovinos no longer exhibited psychotic symptoms,that he expressed himself with ease,and that he was logical,coherent,and goal directed.they warned,however,that baldovinos competence was contingent on medication compliance.id.at.because the physicians surmised that baldovinos would stop taking his medication if given the opportunity,they recommended that he remain at butner until his hearing was imminent.
the court thereafter scheduled a hearing in charlotte for september,to assess whether baldovinos was competent and,if so,to impose sentence on his four convictions.on september,baldovinos was transferred from butner to the jail to await the hearing.the court was unable to proceed with the hearing due to an apparent decline in baldovinos mental health,and,on september,it recommitted him to butner for further evaluation.
on december,the butner physicians issued their fifth report to the court the fifth report,again concluding that baldovinos was competent to be sentenced.they reaffirmed their diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder,but also included a provisional diagnosis of malingering,the intentional production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms,motivated by external incentives.specifically,the physicians observed that,while baldovinos cried,trembled,and looked sad when with butner staff,he laughed and joked,and seemed full of energy when with his peers.id.furthermore,although baldovinos had ceased taking his medication when transferred to the jail,the physicians found it suspicious that he had decompensated so quickly.despite their concerns that baldovinos could be malingering,the physicians recommended that the court hearing on competency and sentencing be conducted via videoconference so that he could remain at butner.
the court accepted the butner physicians recommendation and conducted his hearing on february,by videoconference.after determining that baldovinos was competent,the court proceeded to sentencing.on the conspiracy offense,the court departed from the applicable guidelines range on the basis of baldovinos mental illness,and it sentenced him to the statutory minimum term of sixty months in custody.it also imposed sentences of sixty months on each of the drug offenses,to run concurrently with the sixty months imposed on the conspiracy offense.finally,the court sentenced baldovinos to the statutory minimum of sixty months on the firearms offense,which was required by law to run consecutive to the conspiracy and drug sentences.baldovinos thus received a total prison term of months,the minimum sentence he could have received on the offenses for which he was convicted.
baldovinos has filed a timely notice of appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
as noted,baldovinos makes two constitutionally based contentions on appeal.specifically,he asserts that he is entitled to a new trial because his lawyer was ineffective in failing to investigate his mental health before trial and that his sentence should be vacated because the district court authorized the butner physicians to involuntarily medicate him with antipsychotic drugs.we address these contentions in turn.
baldovinos first asserts that his lawyer was constitutionally ineffective in failing to properly investigate baldovinos mental condition prior to trial,a contention we may address on direct appeal only if the lawyer ineffectiveness conclusively appears from the record.see united states russell,cir.in support of this assertion,baldovinos emphasizes that the jail records indicated that he first suffered a psychotic break in august,well before his march trial.unfortunately for baldovinos,the record fails to demonstrate that his lawyer was aware of his august illness,or that the lawyer otherwise performed in a constitutionally ineffective manner.indeed,the first report indicates that the lawyer did not discern any signs of baldovinos mental illness until june,and there is nothing in the record to suggest otherwise.in these circumstances,constitutional ineffectiveness does not conclusively appear from the record,and the ineffective assistance claim is unreviewable at this stage 
baldovinos next maintains that the district court erred in authorizing the physicians at butner to medicate him with antipsychotic drugs against his will,and that such error requires us to vacate his sentence.because baldovinos makes this contention for the first time on appeal,we review it for plain error only.see united states ruhbayan,cir.in order to prevail under a plain error analysis,a defendant must show an error,that such error was plain,and that it affected his substantial rights.id.citing united states olano,d.even if a defendant satisfies this test,we should exercise our discretion to correct the error only if it seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.olano,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
the government asserts that the supreme court decision in washington harper,d,governs our analysis of this issue,because the government purpose in medicating baldovinos least in prevent him from harming himself and others.if the government is wrong on this point,and if we proceed instead under the principles of sell united states,d,the government concedes that the plain error test would be satisfied.that is,it concedes that the district court erred in authorizing baldovinos involuntary medication for sentencing,that such error is plain,and that the error affected his substantial rights.the government nevertheless maintains that we should decline to exercise our discretion to correct the error.as explained below,the sell principles apply here,we assume that plain error has occurred,and we decline to correct the error.
as an initial matter,we must assess whether this proceeding is governed by the principles of harper or by those enunciated by the court in sell.as explained below,the purpose of medicating baldovinos was to render him competent to be sentenced,and the sell principles thus control our analysis.
in its harper decision,the court was presented in with the question of whether and when the government could administer antipsychotic drugs to a dangerous prisoner against his will.the court recognized that a prisoner possesses a significant liberty interest in avoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs under the due process clause,at,quoted in sell,at,but stressed that infringements on that interest must be viewed with an eye to the unique prison context and with the deference traditionally accorded the judgments of prison officials,see harper,at.citing turner safley,d.the court ultimately determined that the government may constitutionally treat a prison inmate who has a serious mental illness with antipsychotic drugs against his will,if the inmate is dangerous to himself or others and the treatment is in the inmate medical interest.id.at.
in its sell decision in,the court was again confronted with a situation in which the government was seeking to administer unwanted antipsychotic drugs to a person in its ward.in sell,however,the government did not seek to medicate the defendant to prevent him from harming himself or others,but in order to render him competent to stand trial.in that situation,although the prosecution generally possesses an important interest in bringing to trial an individual accused of a serious crime,it is not enough that the court finds medicating the defendant to be in his medical interests.sell,at.the prosecution is also obliged to prove that involuntary medication will significantly further the government interest in prosecuting the defendant,that the medication is substantially likely to render the defendant competent and substantially unlikely to have side effects that significantly interfere with the defendant ability to assist counsel that involuntary medication is necessary to further the government interest and that the medication is medically appropriate,that is,in the defendant best medical interests.id.at.emphasis omitted 
the court in sell emphasized that its principles we
