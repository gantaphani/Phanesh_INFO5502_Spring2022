timothy sain has been civilly committed to the custody of the illinois department of human services idhs since.raymond wood,the defendant,is one of several individuals whom sain sued under,claiming that his conditions of confinement violate the fourteenth amendment.wood moved for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity.the district court denied his summary judgment motion,and wood appeals the denial of qualified immunity.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
backgrounda.
timothy sain,a repeat sex offender,was civilly committed to the custody of the idhs under the sexually violent persons commitment act,ilcs.from to,sain was held at the department joliet treatment and detention facility.sain is hiv positive,and he has a history of sexual interactions with other inmates.
raymond wood was employed by liberty healthcare corporation,a private organization,as the clinical director of the joliet facility.he was the physician in charge of the treatment program for residents found to be sexually violent under illinois law.as the clinical director,he did not have responsibility for the physical building or room assignments,although he did serve occasionally on the rooming committee.issues regarding the room conditions generally were handled by the idhs facilities director,tim budz.
the joliet facility is comprised of two units a new unit,built in,and an old unit,built in the late.sain was housed in the old unit.the cells in the old unit are small and contain two bunks,a sink,a toilet and a small window.the paint was chipping off the walls of sain room,and the outdated plumbing in the unit emitted a foul odor the cells in the old unit also are not air conditioned.residents can not control the temperature of their cells in the heat of summer,and sain cell often became very hot.residents were told to open their windows for ventilation,but some windows,including sain,did not have screens.opening the window allowed bees,wasps and spiders to come into his cell.
even during the winter,sain cell was infested with roaches.he claims that he saw roaches crawling around his cell,coming from under his bed and out of cracks in the wall and sink.he also states that he was bitten several times and was treated for bites by the facility physician an exterminator visited the joliet facility on a regular basis,however,and he frequently sprayed sain room.
sain alleges that he repeatedly requested to be moved to the air conditioned new unit.each time his request was considered,however,it was denied by the facility rooming committee.a variety of reasons were given for the denials,including sain status,his history of sexual interactions with other residents and his failure to participate in treatment.wood,as clinical director,was a member of the rooming committee and attended placement meetings on occasion it is unknown,however,whether he was present at the meetings in which sain requests were discussed.
sain claims that he wrote a letter to wood regarding the conditions in his cell,including the roaches,flies,bees,wasps,spiders,water odor and falling paint chips.additionally,sain alleges that he had a discussion with wood about his desire to move,although he admitted that he did not tell wood that the reason he wanted to move to the new unit was related to the conditions of his room.he also did not mention bugs or water quality in this conversation.sain also sent a number of official requests to speak with wood,but they were each denied,and his complaints presumably were forwarded to his primary caseworker according to facility policy.
no letter to wood from sain ever was produced,and wood denies ever seeing any such letter.he also does not recall discussing sain requests at any of the few rooming committee meetings that he attended.wood claims that he does not remember any conversations with or letters from sain,and that he was not aware of the problems with sain living conditions.such complaints generally were handled by a patient primary caseworker.
sain sued wood and a number of other joliet officials for violations of his fourteenth amendment due process rights.wood moved for summary judgment,contending that sain had not produced any evidence showing that wood had known of sain conditions of confinement or that wood had been deliberately indifferent to his plight.additionally,wood contended that he was entitled to qualified immunity.
the district court concluded that the evidence presented,viewed in the light most favorable to sain,could support a reasonable inference that wood knew of sain conditions of confinement,wood could have addressed his complaints by moving him to the new facility,and his decision not to do so exhibited deliberate indifference.therefore,a genuine issue of material fact existed for trial.
the district court also denied wood invocation of qualified immunity.it stated 
the supreme court articulated a constitutional right to humane conditions of confinement woods sic was clinical director of the joliet facility.he supervised the associate clinical director and indirectly supervised the clinical staff.as the individual with the highest level of clinical responsibility,a reasonable person in woods sic position would have known sain purported living conditions were a constitutional deprivation.wood is not entitled to qualified immunity under harlow fitzgerald,d.
sain budz,wl at internal citations omitted.accordingly,the court denied wood request for summary judgment.wood now appeals the district court refusal to grant him qualified immunity.
discussiona.
generally,this court lacks jurisdiction under to review a district court denial of summary judgment.an exception to the final judgment rule exists,however,for defendants requesting summary judgment based on qualified immunity.via lagrand,cir.under the collateral order doctrine,a denial of qualified immunity is an immediately appealable final decision to the extent that it turns on legal rather than factual questions.id.
inviting our attention to johnson jones,d,sain contends that we lack jurisdiction over wood qualified immunity appeal because it involves a mixed question of fact and law rather than an abstract question of law.see id.at.johnson held that a party may not appeal a district court summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial.at.wood allocates a significant number of pages in his brief to parsing the facts regarding his knowledge of the allegedly inhumane conditions this approach,sain contends,illustrates that wood is asking us to resolve genuine issues of material fact contrary to the supreme court holding in johnson.
sain reading of johnson has been rejected on numerous occasions,by both the supreme court and this court.see,behrens pelletier,d mckinney duplain,cir via,at.it is well settled that johnson did not prohibit appellate review of a district court application of law to merely prohibited an appellate court from parsing the record to determine whether the proffered evidence was sufficient to prove a material fact.behrens,at.denial of summary judgment often includes a determination that there are controverted issues of material fact,and johnson surely does not mean that every such denial of summary judgment is nonappealable.johnson addresses only those cases in which the issue on appeal is nothing more than whether the evidence could support a finding that particular conduct occurred.id.johnson does not preclude appellate review of a district court legal application,even if the court decision necessarily involves mixed questions of fact and law.see,sallenger oakes,cir engaging in a totality of the circumstances inquiry into the reasonableness of a seizure knox smith,cir accepting jurisdiction because probable cause and by analogy,reasonable suspicion is normally a mixed question of law and fact,but where,as here,one side concedes the other facts as to what happened,it is a question of law.
for the purpose of this appeal,wood can assume sain version of the,that wood had actual knowledge of sain living conditions and the ability to address he may still maintain that his subsequent refusal to order relocation in those circumstances did not amount to legally actionable deliberate indifference.mckinney,at t he real question was whether,taking the facts as assumed by the district court,defendant actions violated the constitution.whether wood knew of sain living conditions is a disputed question of fact,but for the purpose of this inquiry,we shall accept the plaintiff assertions of actual knowledge.whether wood actions based on that knowledge amounted to deliberate indifference is a mixed question of fact and law properly resolved by this court.therefore,we have jurisdiction over this appeal.
for the first time on appeal,sain contends that wood is not a state actor,and therefore he is not entitled to invoke qualified immunity.he relies on richardson mcknight,d,which held that privately employed prison guards could not receive qualified immunity because they were not public officials for the purposes of the qualified immunity doctrine.similarly,sain submits,because wood is employed by liberty healthcare,a private firm managing the joliet detention facility,he is not entitled to invoke qualified immunity.
richardson involved private prison guards employed by a large firm specializing in providing security for correctional facilities.the guards,although they were not directly employed by the government,contended that they should enjoy qualified immunity because they performed the same functions as state prison guards,who did receive immunity.the court rejected this functional approach.id.at.instead,it looked at the two purposes underlying government employee immunity to determine whether immunity should be extended to private employees performing public or functions.these factors were a firmly rooted tradition of immunity,and the special policy concerns involved in suing governmental officials,at,namely protecting the public from unwarranted timidity on the part of public officials and ensuring that talented candidates were not deterred by the threat of damages suits from entering public service,id.at.
the court in richardson concluded that no firmly rooted tradition of immunity existed for a private prison guard,an occupation that had been in existence in a private capacity and without immunity throughout most of our nation history.id.at.additionally,it found that the special policy considerations justifying government employee immunity were not present in that case the threat of competition from other organized private corrections firms would prevent unwarranted timidity from the guards,and readily available insurance and private compensation packages ensured that talented employees would not be deterred by this type of service.id.at.
the court specifically noted,however,that its determination in richardson was limited to the facts of that case,in which a private firm,systematically organized to assume a major lengthy administrative task with limited direct supervision by the government,undertakes that task for profit and potentially in competition with other firms.id.at.it further clarified the case does not involve a private individual briefly associated with a government body,serving as an adjunct to government in an essential governmental activity,or acting under close official supervision.id.
prior to,we twice granted qualified immunity to privately employed prison psychologists because they were performing a government function.williams,cir sherman four county counseling,cir.however,we have no comparable cases,and richardson specifically rejected the public function analysis.at.the law in this circuit is therefore far from conclusive on this question.
other circuits have encountered cases involving similar circumstances,however,and have determined that certain private medical personnel working in public facilities are not entitled to qualified immunity under richardson.in jensen lane county,cir,the ninth circuit held that a contract psychiatrist in a county facility was not entitled to immunity because there was no firmly rooted tradition of immunity for psychiatrists,private market forces operate to ensure psychiatrists adequately perform their duties,or fear replacement,the psychiatrist role in that case was a complex administrative task rather than a discrete public service task,and the threat of distraction by lawsuits was insufficient because private psychiatrists often deal with such lawsuits.id.at.in hinson edmond,cir,the eleventh circuit,following the same richardson analysis,held that the privately contracted medical director of a county jail was not entitled to qualified immunity.id.at.the court emphasized that the physician had a good degree of autonomy in his medical treatment and policies,external market forces would ensure adequate treatment,and private salaries and insurance would prevent deterrence of qualified candidates.there are two first circuit cases reaching an opposite conclusion however,both failed to cite richardson,and their analysis of the issue was cursory.see burke town of walpole,cir hoyos,cir.
it is extremely difficult to apply the richardson standard to the facts of this case.this difficulty stems not only from the lack of seventh circuit guidance on the issue,but also from the lack of relevant factual development in the record.the history of sex offender detention programs in illinois,the extent of liberty control over the facility,the details of its interaction with the state,and the robustness of market competition in liberty field are not readily ascertainable,either from the district court opinion or from the record.wood attempts to address these issues in his reply brief,claiming that he had limited autonomy under the relevant statute,that he served as an adjunct to idhs,and that no competitive market exists for his specific type of sexually violent persons specialty.the sparse record,however,neither supports nor negates these assertions.
this dearth of information in the record stems directly from sain failure to contest wood assertion of qualified immunity before the district court.in fact,despite numerous opportunities to do so,there was never a mention of wood status as a private contractor until sain brief on appeal.the parties and the district court apparently assumed that wood was an appropriate party to assert qualified immunity the briefs to the district court,as well as the district court decision,discussed only whether wood had disqualified himself from immunity by violating a clearly established constitutional right.because the issue of wood status as a private employee was never raised at the district level,the record is silent on the facts necessary to determine whether he nevertheless may invoke qualified immunity under richardson.
sain failure to raise at the district court level the issue of wood ineligibility for qualified immunity because of his private employment resulted in a forfeiture of the argument,which we review only for plain error.see,united states thigpen,cir.given the absence of any record addressing richardson test,the district court did not commit plain error in assuming albeit implicitly that wood was entitled to assert qualified immunity.we therefore decline to address the merits of this argument and assume,for the purpose of this case only,that wood is entitled to assert qualified immunity.see perez oakland county,cir adopting a similar approach.
governmental and actors performing discretionary functions are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.sallenger oakes,cir quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.in saucier katz,d,the supreme court articulated a test for determining whether an actor is entitled to qualified immunity taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right if a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties submissions,the next,sequential step is to ask whether the right
