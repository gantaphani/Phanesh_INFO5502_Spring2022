appellant louanna appeals the district court decision affirming the commissioner of social security denial of her application for disability insurance benefits under the social security act.we affirm.
first applied for supplemental security income ssi benefits in.the commissioner approved her application and received ssi benefits from until roughly,at which time her benefits were terminated as a result of her incarceration.she was in prison from roughly to and,upon release,she unsuccessfully applied for ssi benefits.protectively filed the present application in.
in,was years old.she had a high school education,having taken special education classes and worked briefly as a telemarketer after her release from prison.based her application on claimed mental and physical limitations.relevant here are evaluations conducted by two physicians and one psychologist.
in december,bryce mccollum evaluated and diagnosed her with borderline intellectual functioning and said she showed good persistence,but a slow pace in thought and action.mccollum observed that could follow instructions.iq testing resulted in scores that fell within the borderline range of intellectual functioning.mccollum noted functions in the low average range for verbal comprehension,perceptual organization,reporting the meaning of words,thinking abstractly,holding content in short term memory while sorting and reporting,copying symbols,reasoning with spatial relationships,and reasoning.
in april,injured her left wrist,left leg,and back in an automobile accident.showed degenerative changes in her lumbar spine.later that month,lawrence neville,examined her and diagnosed a lumbar strain and left leg bruises.he concluded that her standing,walking,and sitting limitations would soon resolve.
in may,bruce eather,a state agency reviewing psychologist noted mccollum observation about claimant slow pace and likewise indicated claimant has several mental limitations.eather stated claimant could perform simple work without public contact.
the commissioner denied application initially and on reconsideration.requested,and was granted,a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.the alj took testimony from and a vocational expert.the alj subsequently rendered a decision denying the application in.
the alj used the required sequential framework to analyze whether was disabled.see.at step one,the alj found that had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the alleged disability onset date.at step two,the alj concluded that although some of the alleged impairments were not severe within the meaning of the applicable regulations,lumbar degenerative disc disease,borderline intellectual functioning,adjustment disorder,and obesity were severe.at step three,the alj found that none of conditions met or medically equaled a listed impairment in the regulations.finding that allegations regarding her limitations were not entirely credible,the alj determined that retain ed the residual functional capacity to perform simple,routine,repetitive sedentary work,requiring no interaction with the public.at step four,based on the residual functional capacity assessment,the alj found that had no past relevant work.at step five,the alj relied on the guidelines and the testimony of the vocational expert to conclude that could perform work as a small products assembler,with jobs available regionally and available nationwide,and as a,with jobs available regionally and over available nationwide.the alj,therefore,concluded that was not disabled.
the social security appeals council denied request for review of the alj decision,which renders the alj decision the commissioner final decision.the district court affirmed the alj decision,and this appeal followed.
we review de novo a district court judgment upholding the denial of social security benefits.we may set aside a denial of benefits only if it is not supported by substantial evidence or is based on legal error.lingenfelter astrue,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
argues the alj failed to give any res judicata effect to her prior disability finding improperly rejected the opinions of her treating doctors and improperly found testimony was not credible and failed to meet his burden of identifying specific jobs,available in significant numbers,which could perform despite her impairments.
preclusive effect of prior disability determination 
as discussed above,received ssi benefits from until her incarceration in,which resulted in termination of benefits.she argues the alj erred in failing to apply a presumption of disability based on this earlier receipt of benefits.
in warren bowen,cir per curiam,this court held that while the social security administrator may be foreclosed from reevaluating the disability determinations for current beneficiary recipients,the administrator is not required to presume that a previous disability has continued through a related termination of benefits.id.at.we examined regulations which provided that an applicant whose benefits were terminated for a reason would not be required to resubmit evidence of his disability if the came within one year of the prior termination.id.citing b.we reasoned that such regulations supported the position that a presumption of disability should not extend to an applicant whose came almost three,more than one a termination.id.
the existing regulations compel the same result in this case.the current regulations state that a claimant benefits are suspended upon incarceration,and after months of continuous suspension,benefits are terminated.see.while the regulations provide for the resumption of suspended benefits upon an otherwise eligible recipient release from custody,see b,they provide for no such reinstatement where a recipient eligibility has been terminated after consecutive months of suspension.accordingly,there is no basis for applying a presumption of continuing disability where,as here,a claimant reapplication comes at least years after a termination of benefits and more than years after her previously successful application.
our decision in chavez bowen,cir,does not compel a contrary result.in chavez,we observed that principles of res judicata apply to administrative decisions regarding disability and impose an obligation on the claimant,in instances where a prior alj has made a finding of,to come forward with evidence of changed circumstances in order to overcome a presumption of continuing.id.at.we also explained that a previous alj findings concerning residual functional capacity,education,and work experience are entitled to some res judicata consideration and such findings can not be reconsidered by a subsequent judge absent new information not presented to the first judge.id.at.has cited no authority extending the principles of chavez,which applied preclusive effect to a prior finding of,to the present context,an attempt to apply that same presumption to a prior finding of disability.further,has not established that the alj improperly reconsidered prior findings,reconsidered prior findings based strictly on information already presented to the first judge.the entirety of the medical evaluations presented with respect to the present application were conducted after initial disability determination.these evaluations necessarily presented new and material information not presented to the first alj.
alj rejection of certain testimony 
next argues the alj improperly rejected the opinions of the treating and examining doctors as well as own subjective complaints.contends the alj failed to account for a number of significant functional limitations assessed by the doctors of record,including difficulties in maintaining pace,and failed to provide reasons for rejecting those doctors opinions.she also asserts the alj excluded various postural limitations on bending,stooping,and crouching assessed by the disability determination services physicians who reviewed the file.
i.the alj hypothetical question did not improperly reject the opinions of doctors
