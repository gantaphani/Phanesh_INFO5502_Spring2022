richard armstrong,in his official capacity as director of the idaho department of health and welfare,lisa hettinger,in her official capacity as medicaid administrator of the idaho department of health and welfare,and the idaho department of health and welfare collectively,department,appeal from the district court order expanding a preliminary injunction forbidding the department from decreasing the individual budgets of a class of participants in and applicants to idaho developmental disabilities waiver program dd waiver program without adequate notice.the department also seeks review of the district court order denying its motion to approve a proposed budget notice to the class.
on appeal,the department argues that the plaintiffs claims are not ripe because calculating a lower individual budget does not trigger the fair hearing provisions of the medicaid act,a,or deprive a participant of property under the due process clause,const.amend.xiv.the department also argues that the plaintiffs failed to show that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and that the injunction violated the eleventh amendment.
we affirm the district court extension of the preliminary injunction to the class and hold that we lack pendent jurisdiction to review the order regarding the proposed notice.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
the medicaid act allows states to apply for a waiver to provide home and services to developmentally disabled medicaid beneficiaries to help them avoid institutionalization.see.the federal government has approved idaho dd waiver program,which supplants traditional medicaid plan services for idaho beneficiaries with support services,including residential habitation services,chore services,supported employment,transportation,specialized medical equipment,home delivered meals,and skilled nursing.idaho admin.code.as of july,there were participants in the dd waiver program.
the department assigns each dd waiver program participant an individualized budget.the budget is set according to an individualized measurement of the participant functional abilities,behavioral limitations,and medical needs,related to the participant disability.id.participants select the services they wish to receive by crafting an annual plan of service based on their individualized budgets.id.
the plaintiffs represent a class of participants in and applicants to the dd waiver program.they allege that the department failed to give adequate notice when their individualized budgets were decreased.the plaintiffs contend that the notices the department sent violated both the due process clause and the fair hearing requirements of the medicaid act.
eligibility and annual reevaluation 
to be eligible for dd waiver program services,an adult medicaid participant must have a developmental disability impairing mental or physical function or independence.see id.rr.those interested in receiving dd waiver services must submit an application,and current participants are reassessed annually to determine whether they remain eligible.during the annual reevaluations,the department administers several assessments to determine a participant eligibility and level of need.
budget calculation and notice 
if the department determines that an individual is eligible for services,it must calculate the participant individualized budget.see id.rr.to do so,the department enters information gathered during the participant assessments into an adult budget calculation tool budget tool.the budget tool is a statistical model designed to predict a participant needs based on the participant characteristics.once the department has calculated a participant budget for the upcoming plan year,it sends a budget notice to the participant confirming eligibility and specifying the budget amount.the budget notices the department sent in budget notices are the subject of this dispute.
c.the service plan 
if the participant does not appeal the calculated budget,the participant works with a plan developer or support broker to submit a service plan to the department.the service plan lists the type and frequency of services and outlines their cost relative to the participant calculated budget.
after the participant submits a service plan,the department determines whether it meets the needs of the participant,safeguards the participant health and safety,and is within the calculated budget.if the plan is inadequate or,the department may refer the plan back to the developer for adjustment.if the plan still does not meet the participant needs or is not within budget,the department may either authorize some of the services or deny all of the services in the plan.
in such cases,the department notifies the participant about which services,if any,were approved.the participant may then request an administrative appeal within days.if a participant requests an appeal,a hearing officer is appointed and a hearing is held.the hearing officer may not approve eligibility,modify the budget,or approve denied services.rather,the hearing officer may only uphold the department decision or remand to the department to update assessment documents,recalculate a participant budget,or reexamine a service denial.if the participant or the department disagrees with the hearing officer decision,either may seek a director review.the director decision may be appealed to the district court.
the approved and finalized cost of services in the service plan becomes the participant authorized budget.a participant may change his service plan with the department approval,but may not spend more than his calculated budget.
changes to the budget tool 
the department periodically evaluates and adjusts its budget tool.in july,the department made several changes to the budget tool in a purported effort to capture a participant living situation.although the record does not disclose exactly how the changes accounted for living situation,it makes clear that a number of the changes were dramatic.
first,the weights assigned to the inputs from the various assessments used to calculate the.second,some previous variables were dropped entirely.for example,before july,needing assistance with mobility was a weighted variable used to calculate budgets it no longer is 
additionally,the constant coefficient used in the budget tool changed.the constant coefficient before july was.after living situation became a weighted variable,the constant coefficient decreased to.
notice of decreases in class members calculated budgets 
numerous class members individualized budgets decreased in the fall of.the department notified participants of these cuts by sending budget notices.the budget notices did not explain why the budgets had been cut,but instead simply stated using information from the individual needs inventory and a complete case file review conducted by the regional independent assessor,your individual budget is calculated to be.
ii.prior proceedings 
on january,twelve plaintiffs filed this action in the united states district court for the district of idaho seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,claiming,among other things,that the budget notice failed to provide meaningful notice of the reasons for the reductions in their budgets.on january,the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order requiring the department to restore the plaintiffs medicaid services to prior levels and barring the department from reducing these services without providing adequate notice and a fair hearing.the district court entered a temporary restraining order on these terms on february,and the parties stipulated to entry of a second,supplemental temporary restraining order on february.
pursuant to another stipulation,the district court entered a preliminary injunction on march,providing that 
the defendants shall restore and continue the plaintiffs medicaid services under the idaho developmental disabilities waiver as provided in the individual support plans in place for each plaintiff prior to july,and before the last annual level of care and dd eligibility approval notice and budget assignment notice sent to them,and are prohibited from reducing or terminating medicaid services under the idaho developmental disabilities waiver to the plaintiffs based on their most recent assigned budget limits unless and until the defendants first provide adequate advance notice,approved by this court,and the opportunity for a fair hearing prior to the reduction or termination of services.
emphasis added.
on march,the department moved for approval of a proposed budget notice proposed notice informing the plaintiffs of their individual budget amounts.the proposed notice informed participants that they were eligible for the dd waiver program,explained in general terms how budgets are calculated,and set forth the specific budget amount for each individual.the proposed notice included an attachment with a copy of the budget calculation and inventory of needs for the participant.
on august,the district court denied the department motion to approve the proposed notice.see armstrong,wl,at.the court found the proposed notice inadequate,both under the applicable medicaid regulations and the due process clause,because it failed to explain why participants individual budgets had changed.id.at.
on may,the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification,and a motion to extend the stipulated preliminary injunction to cover the class.the proposed class consisted of all persons who are participants in or applicants to the adult developmental disability services program administered by the idaho department of health and welfare as part of the idaho medicaid program,and who undergo the annual eligibility determination or reevaluation process.
before the district court ruled on the plaintiffs motions,the department filed a motion for approval of a new proposed budget notice proposed notice.
on march,the district court issued a memorandum decision and order rejecting the proposed notice.see armstrong,as clarified.the order also certified the proposed class and extended the preliminary injunction to cover the class.id.at.
the department filed a timely notice of appeal on april.the department challenges the extension of the preliminary injunction to cover the class and seeks review of the denial of its motion to approve the proposed notice.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction to review the modification of the preliminary injunction under a.whether we have jurisdiction to review the order denying the motion to approve the proposed notice depends on whether we can exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over this issue in conjunction with our review of the modification of the preliminary injunction.see meredith oregon,as amended by cir.
we review the district court legal conclusions de novo,the injunction scope for abuse of discretion.armstrong brown,cir citing scott pasadena unified sch,cir.
discussion 
the department first argues that this dispute is not ripe for resolution because the mere preparation of a budget does not entitle a participant to notice under either the due process clause or the medicaid act.the department contends that the plaintiffs will not suffer a deprivation of property under the fourteenth amendment until services are actually denied.
a determination that this dispute is not yet fit for judicial resolution would divest us and the district court of jurisdiction.as the supreme court has observed,
r ipeness is a justiciability doctrine designed to prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies,and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.
park hospitality ass dep t of interior,d quoting abbott labs.gardner,d.
we reject the department ripeness argument.whatever the final determination of budget amounts,the plaintiffs allege that they suffered a deprivation of services without adequate notice when their budgets were decreased.therefore,the plaintiffs allege that they have already felt the effects of the department actions in a concrete way.see see also alaska airlines,city of long beach,cir noting that w here the threat of action is very real,challenges to legislative enactments that lack procedural protections may be ripe even if no deprivation has occurred yet.postponing adjudication of this dispute would not bring greater clarity to whether the department budget notices were adequate.this dispute is ripe for adjudication.
ii.whether preliminary injunctive relief was available 
a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish likely success on the merits likely irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief that the balance of equities tips in the plaintiff favor and that an injunction is in the public interest.pimentel dreyfus,cir per curiam citing winter natural res.def.council,d.we review the district court decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.our review is limited and deferential.sw.voter registration educ.project shelley,cir en banc per curiam citation omitted.
the department contends that the district court abused its discretion in finding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims under the due process clause and the medicaid act.because the notice requirements of the medicaid act are not identical to the requirements of the due process clause we address the plaintiffs statutory and constitutional claims separately.
likelihood of success on the plaintiffs claim under the medicaid act fair hearing provisions 
to assess whether the district court abused its discretion in holding that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their claim under the medicaid act,we must first determine de novo whether the district court identified the correct legal rule to apply to the relief requested.united states hinkson,cir.we find that it did.
the fair hearing requirements of the medicaid act are defined both by statute and by regulation.the medicaid act requires that a state plan for medical assistance must provide for granting an opportunity for a fair hearing before the state agency to any individual whose claim for medical assistance under the plan is denied.a.medicaid regulations in turn require state agencies to provide notice to participants of their right to a hearing under some circumstances.see.the regulations provide that an agency must inform every applicant or beneficiary in writing o f his right to a hearing a t the time of any action affecting his or her claim.id.b c.the notice must contain,among other information,t he reasons for the intended action.id.b.the regulations define an action as a termination,suspension,or reduction of medicaid eligibility or covered services,or other specified adverse determinations.id.
the district court applied the correct standard to the plaintiffs claim when it inquired whether the department calculation of new budgets was an action under the medicaid regulations.see id.c.as the district court recognized,this question turns on whether calculating a lower budget amounts to a reduction of covered services.see id.the court concluded that calculating a lower budget is an action because the practical effect is a reduction in the amount of services the participant receives.
under the second step of our abuse of discretion test,we must assess whether the district court conclusion on this point was illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.hinkson,at quoting anderson city of bessemer city,d.we find that it was not.
the district court reasonably found that participants services are capped by their individual budgets under idaho law.idaho code e ii provides that t he department shall allow budget modifications only when needed to obtain or maintain employment or when health and safety issues are identified and meet the criteria as defined in department rule.and,idaho administrative code rule provides that a participant plan of service is based on the individualized participant budget.
there was ample evidence in the record that,absent an appeal,the cost of a participant service plan could not exceed the calculated budget.service plans must be reviewed by a care manager,who may authorize the plan only if it is within the calculated budget.if the plan exceeds the calculated budget,the care manager must either authorize only services within the budget or deny the plan altogether.it does not appear that a participant may craft a service plan that exceeds the calculated budget specified in the initial budget notice without appealing either his budget determination or the decision of a care manager to reject his service plan.it was therefore reasonable for the district court to conclude that,as a practical matter,calculating a lower budget decreases a participant medicaid services,thereby triggering the notice requirements of the medicaid regulations.
the district court also did not abuse its discretion in holding that the plaintiffs were likely to show that the budget notices did not comply with the notice requirements of the medicaid regulations.a notice required under.c,c,or c must contain t he reasons for the state intended action.b.the budget notices did not specify why individual budgets had decreased 
likelihood of success on the plaintiffs due process claim 
we also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their claim that they were denied adequate notice under the due process clause.
the requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of interests encompassed by the fourteenth amendment protection of liberty and property.bd.of regents of state colls.roth,d.therefore,t he first inquiry in every due process challenge is whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a protected interest in property or liberty.am.mfrs.mut.ins.sullivan,d.it is well settled that a person can have a property interest in continuing to receive government benefits.see,goldberg kelly,d rosas mcmahon,cir explaining that goldberg applies to a reduction of benefits.to have a property interest in a benefit,a person must have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it,not just an abstract need or desire for it.roth,at.
the district court held that because calculating lower budgets had the practical effect of reducing the plaintiffs waiver services,the plaintiffs were entitled to adequate notice under the due process clause.we reach the same conclusion,but for different reasons.the district court conflated the medicaid act standards governing fair hearings with the standards governing constitutional due process claims.while the medicaid act fair hearing requirements are triggered by actions,including reductions in benefits,the requirements of procedural due process are triggered by deprivations of property.compare.c,with am.mfrs.mut.ins,at.however,because the plaintiffs had a legitimate claim of entitlement to waiver services as capped by the calculated budgets,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their due process claim.see erickson ex rel.dep t of health human,cir noting that the district court order granting an injunction to redress an alleged due process violation did not address whether medical provider plaintiffs possessed a liberty or property interest in continued participation in medicare,and proceeding to consider the issue de novo.
as we stated in orloff cleland,e ntitlements are created by rules or understandings from independent sources,such as statutes,regulations,and ordinances,cir quoting roth,at.idaho regulations provide that the department sets an individualized budget for each participant according to an individualized measurement of the participant functional abilities,behavioral limitations,and medical needs,related to the participant disability.idaho admin.code.the regulations further provide that the participant plan of service is based on the individualized participant budget.id.and,the idaho statute authorizing s ervices for persons with developmental disabilities provides that t he department shall allow budget modifications only when needed to obtain or maintain employment or when health and safety issues are identified.idaho code e ii.the idaho regulations specifically enumerate the services covered under the dd waiver program.see idaho admin.code.thus,participants in the dd waiver program are entitled to a service plan featuring covered services with a total value equal to or less than a participant individual calculated budget.because participants have a legitimate claim of entitlement to this benefit under idaho law,they have a property interest in continuing to receive it.see roth,d.
the department argues that even if the plaintiffs had a property interest in their benefits,that interest was narrowly circumscribed.the department contends that participants have no basis for expecting that their budgets will continue beyond the current year because idaho regulations require that a participant individual budget be reevaluated each year.
we reject this argument.the department would have us define the substance of the plaintiffs entitlement by the department procedures for evaluating and modifying the participants level of services.but these procedures are precisely what the plaintiffs challenge.if a state grants a property interest,its procedures for terminating or modifying that interest do not narrow the interest scope.see cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d.as the supreme court has observed,
p roperty can not be defined by the procedures provided for its deprivation any more than can life or liberty.the right to due process is conferred,not by legislative grace,but by constitutional guarantee.while the legislature may elect not to confer a property interest,it may not constitutionally authorize the deprivation of such an interest,once conferred,without appropriate procedural safeguards.
id.quoting arnett kennedy,d powell,concurring in part and concurring in result in part.were the rule otherwise,the due process clause would be reduced to a mere tautology.id.because the yearly reapplication process is merely a procedure for evaluating eligibility,it does not define the substance of the plaintiffs property interest in their benefits.
having found that the plaintiffs have a property interest in their benefits,we must now examine whether providing a lower calculated budget to participants deprives them of this property interest.we find that it likely does.if a participant new calculated budget is lower than his current budget,the participant has lost the right to craft a service plan that is equal in value to his current service plan.
the department contends that merely calculating a lower budget for the upcoming year does not deprive a participant of property because the participant continues to receive the services to which he is entitled under the current plan for some time after the budget notices are circulated.according to the department,any reduction in services can not occur until after a participant new service plan has been developed,discussed,and approved.but there is ample evidence in the record that participants calculated budgets effectively capped the value of services participants could receive.therefore,once a lower budget is calculated,a participant has already effectively been deprived of the right to receive the same level of services in the coming year.
the department also argues that merely calculating a lower annual budget does not deprive a participant of property because the budget may be increased through appeal.but just because a party deprived of property may recover it by exercising procedural rights does not mean that no deprivation occurs.a primary purpose of providing adequate notice to participants is to enable them to prepare a defense for a hearing.see barnes healy,cir.it would be illogical if the availability of a hearing deprived the plaintiffs of their right to receive the notice they need to challenge benefits reductions at that hearing.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the budget notices were inadequate under the due process clause.due process requires notice that gives an agency reason for its action in sufficient detail that the affected party can prepare a responsive defense.id.citing goldberg,at.the budget notices were inadequate because they did not specify why participants budgets had decreased.
likelihood of irreparable injury 
the district court determined that the plaintiffs established a likelihood of irreparable injury.the department argues for the first time on appeal that the plaintiffs failed to show that the proposed class was likely to suffer irreparable harm.the department waived this argument by failing to raise it before the district court.see int l union of bricklayers allied craftsman local union,afl cio martin jaska,cir 
iii.the eleventh amendment 
the department argues that the injunction violates the eleventh amendment by awarding retrospective relief against the state.we disagree.
the eleventh amendment shields unconsenting states from suits in federal court.see seminole tribe of florida,d.to ensure the enforcement of federal law,however,the eleventh amendment permits suits for prospective injunctive relief against state officials acting in violation of federal law,frew ex rel.frew hawkins,d citing ex parte young,and courts may also order measures ancillary to appropriate prospective relief,id.citing green mansour,d.but f ederal courts may not award retrospective relief,for instance,money damages or its equivalent,if the state invokes its immunity.id.citing edelman jordan,d.equitable relief is impermissible if it will likely require payment of state funds and is measured in terms of a monetary loss resulting from a past breach of a legal duty on the part of the defendant state officials.edelman,at.
the classwide injunction grants only prospective relief allowed under the eleventh amendment,by restoring class members to the individualized budgets they had prior to the department defective budget notice.the injunction does not compensate class members for any loss of services that occurred prior to the date it was entered.thus,the relief granted is not measured in terms of a past monetary loss.see id.we therefore join a number of our sister circuits in rejecting eleventh amendment challenges directed at orders reinstating social assistance benefits prospectively.see,turner ledbetter,cir coalition for basic human needs king,cir w e see no eleventh amendment impediment to an order which enjoins the state defendants to resume payment of afdc benefits prospectively.kimble solomon,cir holding that reinstating medicaid benefits prospectively does not violate the eleventh amendment.
iv.pendent jurisdiction to review denial of motion to approve notice 
we now turn to the department argument that the district court abused its discretion by failing to approve the proposed notice.we must first determine whether we have jurisdiction to review this issue.the order denying the motion to approve is not final under,see quackenbush allstate ins,d a decision is final and appealable under only if it ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.internal quotation marks omitted does not fit within the collateral order exception to the final judgment rule,see mohawk,carpenter,d and is not an appealable interlocutory order,see.the department urges that we exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction to review the order rejecting the proposed notice in conjunction with the appealable order expanding the injunction.we conclude that we may not.
pendent appellate jurisdiction refers to the exercise of jurisdiction over issues that ordinarily may not be reviewed on interlocutory appeal,but may be reviewed on interlocutory appeal if raised in conjunction with other issues properly before the court.cunningham gates,cir.t he supreme court has declined to settle definitively whether or when it may be proper for a court of appeals,with jurisdiction over one ruling,to review,conjunctively,related rulings that are not themselves appealable.meredith,at quoting swint chambers cnty.comm n,d.we have consistently acknowledged that we must exercise restraint in reviewing on interlocutory appeal otherwise orders,lest litigants use collateral orders as appeal tickets,id.quoting swint,at see also poulos caesars world,cir noting that we took pains to cabin our holding in meredith to the unique facts of the case.we may exercise pendent jurisdiction over an otherwise issue only in two narrow circumstances if it is inextricably intertwined with or necessary to ensure meaningful review of the order properly before us on interlocutory appeal.see meredith,at quoting swint,at.
the adequacy of the proposed notice is not inextricably intertwined with whether the district court abused its discretion in expanding the preliminary injunction.to justify the exercise of pendent jurisdiction,the legal theories on which the issues advance must either a be so intertwined that we must decide the pendent issue in order to review the claims properly raised on interlocutory appeal,or b resolution of the issue properly raised on interlocutory appeal necessarily resolves the pendent issue.cunningham,at emphases added.we have consistently interpreted inextricably intertwined very narrowly,id.at,and o ur cases make clear that if the properly appealable order can be resolved without necessarily resolving the pendent order,then the latter is not inextricably intertwined with the former,hilton hallmark cards,cir citing batzel smith,cir,as amended.
it is not necessary for us to decide whether the proposed notice was adequate in order to resolve whether the district court abused its discretion in expanding the preliminary injunction.the proposed notice had not been circulated to the class when the preliminary injunction was expanded.whether the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the sole winter factor the department has properly contested on on the notice they had already received,not the notice the department might provide in the future.even if the district court had approved the proposed notice,it still would have been appropriate to expand the preliminary injunction to protect the status quo until that notice was circulated.therefore,the adequacy of the proposed notice was not inextricably intertwined with whether the preliminary injunction should be expanded.
nor is it necessary to review the adequacy of the proposed notice to ensure meaningful review of the order expanding the preliminary injunction.we construe the related necessary to ensure meaningful review prong narrowly.see poulos,at stating that the second prong is restrictive and requires that the pendent decision have much more than a tangential relationship to the decision properly before us on interlocutory appeal.pursuant to our narrow construction of ensure meaningful review,we may exercise pendent jurisdiction to consider issues that call into question the district court authority to rule on a party motion for a preliminary injunction.hendricks bank of am,cir emphasis omitted quoting meredith,at.but we have declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over rulings that were not a logical predicate to the issues properly raised on appeal and did not implicate the very power of the district court to issue the rulings on appeal.id.quoting wong united states,cir.
the district court ruling on the proposed notice did not affect its authority to expand the preliminary injunction.even if the department was willing to circulate a notice the district court found adequate,a preliminary injunction still would have been necessary to protect the status quo until that notice was circulated.therefore,ruling on the proposed notice was not a logical predicate to ruling on the preliminary injunction.see wong,at.we accordingly decline to exercise jurisdiction to review the district court order denying the motion to approve the proposed notice.if the department believes that the district court erred in denying approval of that notice,it may seek a final judgment from the district court in this litigation and appeal that order under.but the department can not have it both to litigate this case in the district court and simultaneously seek appellate review of an inte
