dianna elder applied for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income ssi,claiming that her fibromyalgia rendered her disabled as that term is defined by the social security act the act,et.the administrative law judge alj denied elder claims in november.after the social security appeals council appeals council declined elder request for review,the district court affirmed the alj decision.elder now argues that the alj decision was wrong in elder view,the alj erroneously concluded that her descriptions of the severity her ailments were not credible,and improperly evaluated the medical opinions of two of her treating physicians.we affirm.
elder filed an application for disability and ssi claims in november,alleging that her fibromyalgia and depression rendered her disabled as of august.as elder explained in her application,she was years old on her claimed onset date,had a high school education,and had worked at a factory operated by eaton corporation as a mold operator and bench assembler.she also stated that she was five feet,eleven inches tall a measurement that,for some reason,changes throughout the record,and weighed pounds however,as her attorney repeatedly stated at oral argument,elder based her claims on the severity of her fibromyalgia and depression,and not on her obesity.
elder claims of disability originated in august,when she sought treatment from her family doctor,james hanus,for pain in her arms and legs.aware that elder had complained of similar pain in the past,hanus provided a preliminary diagnosis of fibromyalgia.he then referred elder to steven ko,a rheumatologist,to confirm his assessment and to provide treatment for her pain.
ko diagnosed elder with fibromyalgia when he first treated her in september.when ko inquired about the severity of her condition,elder explained that,because of the pain,she had difficulty walking,climbing stairs,sitting,and accomplishing everyday activities,such as cooking,washing dishes,and doing laundry.elder also stated,however,that she was able to maneuver up and down the stairs at her home,and that she did most of the housework and shopping for her family.in all,elder stated that her ability to function was a on a scale of to,which,ko stated,was okay.ko prescribed to elder pain medication,and instructed her to exercise regularly.
elder visited ko eight times over the following year,and during this time she provided mixed reports regarding the severity of her condition.on occasion,elder reported to ko that her fibromyalgia had gotten much worse at other times,she stated that her pain had subsided.and although elder descriptions of her pain fluctuated,she regularly told ko that she was following his instructions to exercise.for instance,in november,elder informed ko that she had participated in an class,but stopped attending for a while after overdo ing it one day.however,she also stated that she went out three times a week for approximately twenty minutes at a time without any problem,and that she was able to walk about half miles.at an appointment in january,elder reported that she had returned to the class,and had since been able to participate in the program three times a week without any pain.likewise,in june,elder informed ko that she was exercising on a machine at home three times a day for five to ten minutes each time.
in response to elder reports of her ability to exercise regularly,ko opined at the june appointment that elder could probably go back to work on a basis or at a reduced capacity.he therefore advised elder to obtain a functional capacity evaluation from a physical therapist so she could seek an alternative vocation.but at elder final appointment with ko in august,she informed him that she was not able to obtain the functional capacity evaluation for her work,and had not pursued any type of vocational rehab.elder did state,though,that she was still exercising walking almost a mile a day,and continuing to participate in a water exercise program.ko noted that he had done all that he could for elder,including having encouraged her to look into vocational rehab programs where she could look into alternative work.he thus concluded that there was no other treatment that he could provide to her,and discharged her from his care.shortly thereafter,elder returned to hanus to discuss the status of her treatment and to review her medical records so she could prepare her disability and ssi application.
elder filed her application,and while it was pending she underwent a consultative medical examination by michael holton.elder did not complain to holton about any debilitating pain she instead informed him that she could walk about blocks level at a leisurely pace or up less than flight of steps generally without increased discomfort or difficulty.based on elder statements and his own examination,holton determined that,although elder had fibromyalgia,she had no difficulty walking,had normal muscle strength and tone,and could grip pounds with both hands.
also during this time,elder continued to seek treatment from hanus for various ailments,such as vertigo,sinus infections,and issues related to her diabetes mellitus.she also saw hanus for,as she put it,a recheck of her fibromyalgia,although hanus medical records from this period show that he did nothing more than note elder complaints of pain,prescribe her different kinds of pain medication,and provide her with medical excuses from work.nevertheless,hanus sent a letter to the social security commission,in which he stated that elder had one of the worst cases of fibromyalgia that he had ever seen,and further opined that she was disabled.
the alj held a hearing on elder claims in october.elder testified at the hearing that her fibromyalgia caused her pain all over,and that the pain sapped her energy,caused her to be depressed,and prevented her from doing anything.shortly thereafter,the alj denied elder claim.however,elder sought review from the appeals council,and in may the appeals council remanded her case to allow the alj the chance to obtain additional medical evidence both explaining how elder fibromyalgia contributed to her depression and specifying the nature and severity of elder ailments.the appeals council also stated that the new evidence could include additional consultative medical examinations.
on remand,the alj obliged the appeals council,and ordered elder to undergo additional consultative medical examinations.accordingly,elder was examined by,among other doctors,bhuependra shah,who focused his examination on elder neurological health and muscle strength.as relevant here,shah opined that hanus and ko medical records revealed that elder fibromyalgia was unremarkable.ko further stated that elder strength was normal,and that she could lift and carry pounds occasionally and pounds frequently.hanus also submitted additional information to supplement his earlier statements supporting elder disability claims.specifically,hanus stated that,because of her fibromyalgia,elder could rarely lift more than pounds and never could lift more than pounds.
the alj held a second hearing on elder claims in march,and at that hearing elder provided a much more detailed description of the severity of her fibromyalgia than she did at her first hearing.she described that,on a good day,she could do the laundry and wash the dishes,but on days when her fibromyalgia the pain was so intense that the only thing that she could do was lie in bed and periodically walk to the restroom.but when elder was confronted with ko medical records from november,she denied having told him that she was able to walk a a day as elder put it,t here was no possible way that she could have walked that far.and although elder admitted to having participated in some classes,she stated to what ko was unable to complete more than five to ten minutes of the classes because of her pain.
shortly after the second hearing,the alj again denied elder claims.the alj reached its conclusion after he conducted the sequential analysis required by a i v.specifically,the alj found that elder had not performed substantial gainful work since seeking treatment for her fibromyalgi
