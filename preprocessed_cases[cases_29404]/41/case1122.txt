battle creek health system battle creek and trinity trinity health,doing business as mercy general health partners,are hospitals and participating medicare providers located in southwestern michigan.plaintiffs brought the present action against michael leavitt,secretary of the united states department of health and human services defendant or the secretary,pursuant to title xviii of the social security act,the medicare act and the administrative procedure act,et the apa,challenging the final administrative decision of defendant denying medicare reimbursement for certain bad debts incurred by plaintiffs during the fiscal year.the district court affirmed the secretary decision,granting summary judgment in favor of defendant and denying plaintiffs similar motion.see battle creek health thompson,d.plaintiffs now appeal.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
plaintiffs are,hospitals located in southwestern michigan that provide services to persons covered by medicare medicare beneficiaries.the medicare act provides a system for payment of health services to eligible elderly and disabled persons.medicare providers participate in medicare by entering into an agreement with the secretary and the department of health and human services center for medicare and medicaid services cms,formerly the health care financing administration hcfa,which administers the program for the secretary.both plaintiffs are parties to a medicare participation agreement with defendant.
the present case implicates only medicare part a reimbursement for hospital services.part a authorizes payments primarily for institutional care,including hospital inpatient services and skilled nursing facility services.see.medicare beneficiaries are responsible for paying a portion of the cost of hospital services in the form of deductibles and coinsurance.
before,the medicare act based hospital reimbursement upon a retrospective determination of reasonable cost as defined in the secretary regulations and identified in a provider annual cost report.v et.in,congress established a prospective payment system pps,whereby hospital operating costs are reimbursed on a per discharge basis through prospectively fixed rates that are based upon the diagnostic related group assigned to the discharge.d et.certain medicare payments to hospitals,however,continue to be determined retrospectively and reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis included in this latter category are the unpaid deductible and coinsurance obligations of medicare beneficiaries medicare bad debts at issue herein.a.
the regulations pertaining to medicare declare that amounts due to providers from other parties that providers can not recover are generally not reimbursable under the medicare program because these bad debts are deemed deductions from revenue and are not to be included in allowable cost.a the secretary will nonetheless reimburse a provider for certain bad debts attributable to deductible and coinsurance amounts related to covered services received from beneficiaries.a.such reimbursable bad debts are defined at b 
bad debts are amounts considered to be uncollectible from accounts and notes receivable that were created or acquired in providing services.accounts receivable and notes receivable are designations for claims arising from the furnishing of services,and are collectible in money in the relatively near future.
bad debts are reimbursed in order to prevent the costs of services from being shifted to patients or their payors.d.consequently,a provider may receive reimbursement for medicare bad debt if it meets all of the criteria set forth in e 
e criteria for allowable bad debt.a bad debt must meet the following criteria to be allowable 
the debt must be related to covered services and derived from deductible and coinsurance amounts.
the provider must be able to establish that reasonable collection efforts were made.
the debt was actually uncollectible when claimed as worthless.
sound business judgment established that there was no likelihood of recovery at any time in the future.
e see also provider reimbursement manual reiterating these four criteria.
the secretary provider reimbursement manual prm contains guidelines and interpretative rules to assist providers and intermediaries in the implementation of the medicare regulations relevant to the present case,prm addresses the reasonable collection effort s that must be undertaken by providers when seeking to recoup bad debts 
to be considered a reasonable collection effort,a provider effort to collect medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts must be similar to the effort the provider puts forth to collect comparable amounts from patients.it must involve the issuance of a bill on or shortly after discharge or death of the beneficiary to the party responsible for the patient personal financial obligations.it also includes other actions such as subsequent billings,collection letters and telephone calls or personal contacts with this party which constitute a genuine,rather than a token,collection effort.the provider collection effort may include using or threatening to use court action to obtain payment.see for indigent or medically indigent patients.
prm.a further explains 
a provider collection effort may include the use of a collection agency in addition to or in lieu of subsequent billings,letters,telephone and personal contacts.where a collection agency is used,medicare expects the provider to refer all uncollected patient charges of like amount to the agency without regard to class of patient.the like amount requirement may include uncollected charges above a specified minimum amount.therefore,if a provider refers to a collection agency its uncollected patient charges which in amount are comparable to the individual medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts due the provider from its medicare patient,medicare requires the provider to also refer its uncollected medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts to the collection agency.where a collection agency is used,the agency practices may include using or threatening to use court action to obtain payment.
in addition,prm provides for a presumption of noncollectibility 
if after reasonable and customary attempts to collect a bill,the debt remains unpaid more than days from the date the first bill is mailed to the beneficiary,the debt may be deemed uncollectible.
the amounts uncollectible from specific beneficiaries are to be charged off as bad debts in the accounting period in which the accounts are deemed to be worthless.f.consistent with this regulation,prm provides that uncollectible debts and coinsurance amounts are recognized as allowable bad debts in the reporting period in which the debts are determined to be worthless.prm also requires the provider to document its claimed bad debts the provider should have the usual accounts receivable cards and source support its claim for a bad debt for each account included.see also prm.b t he provider collection effort should be documented in the patient file by copies of the bill s,letters,reports of telephone and personal contact.these guidelines are in keeping with regulations that require documentation.see,and a t he principles of cost reimbursement require that providers maintain sufficient financial records and statistical data for proper determination of costs payable under the program.
prm further addresses the recovery of bad debts and provides in pertinent part 
amounts included in allowable bad debts in a prior period might be recovered in a later reporting period.treatment of such recoveries under the program is designed to achieve the same effect upon reimbursement as in the case where the amount was uncollectible.
where the provider was reimbursed by the program for bad debts for the reporting period in which the amount recovered was included in allowable bad debts,reimbursable costs in the period of recovery are reduced by the amounts recovered.however,such reductions in reimbursable costs should not exceed the bad debts reimbursed for the applicable prior period.
fiscal intermediaries under contract to the secretary serve as claims managers for the medicare program and make the initial determination regarding the amount of reimbursement to be paid to the health care provider.at the close of a fiscal year,a medicare provider submits a cost report to its fiscal intermediary setting forth its incurred costs and the proportion of the costs to be allocated to medicare.the fiscal intermediary audits the report and ascertains the final amount of medicare reimbursement owed to the provider.the fiscal intermediary then issues a notice of program reimbursement npr.
the secretary has issued guidelines for fiscal intermediaries to follow when auditing cost reports.the intermediary manual instructs in part 
if the bad debt is on the provider books days after the date of the bill and then turned over to a collection agency,the amount can not be claimed as a medicare bad debt on the date of the.it can be claimed as a medicare bad debt only after the collection agency completes its collection effort.
intermediary manual,part.
an hcfa policy memorandum dated june,further elaborates on the bad debt policy.the memorandum states in pertinent part 
u ntil a provider reasonable collection effort has been completed,including both efforts and the use of a collection agency,a medicare bad debt may not be reimbursed as uncollectible.this is in accord with the fourth criterion in section which provides that an uncollected medicare account can not be considered an allowable medicare bad debt unless sound business judgment established that there is no likelihood of recovery at any time in the future.we have always believed that,clearly,there is a likelihood of recovery for an account sent to a collection agency and that claiming a medicare bad debt at the point of sending the account to the collection agency would be contrary to the bad debt policy in sections and 
if a medicare provider is dissatisfied with the fiscal intermediary determination of reimbursement and otherwise satisfies applicable criteria,it is entitled to a hearing before the secretary provider reimbursement review board prrb,within days of receipt of the npr.a,b.the prrb decision is subject to review,upon written request by one of the parties,by the deputy administrator of cms the administrator,pursuant to.the administrator decision,which constitutes the final decision of the secretary,is in turn subject to review by the appropriate federal district court.f.
in this case,the fiscal intermediary audited plaintiffs fiscal year fy cost reports for the period ending june,and disallowed and in bad debts claimed by plaintiffs battle creek and trinity health,respectively.the intermediary determined that plaintiffs had included and written off as bad debts on their cost reports any medicare accounts that were at least days old by the end of the cost reporting period,including debts that had been referred to the collection agency.the intermediary concluded that the debts that were sent to the collection agency,but not returned to plaintiffs as uncollectible,did not meet the requirements of e and,because these debts had never been determined to be uncollectible and collection efforts could be expected to continue after the accounts were written off.according to the fiscal intermediary,the fact that the bad debts remained at a collection agency constituted evidence that plaintiffs did not consider the accounts to be worthless or that there was no likelihood of recovery at any time in the future.
plaintiffs appealed these disallowances to the prrb which,following a hearing on the matter,concluded that the intermediary determination was erroneous and held that plaintiffs were entitled to reimbursement for the bad debts invalidated by the fiscal intermediary the prrb found that the evidence at the hearing established that plaintiffs undertook reasonable collection efforts in accordance with e.the prrb was unable to reconcile the intermediary position with either the presumption of noncollectibility set forth in prm or with prm.a,which states that a provider use of a collection agency may be in addition to or in lieu of collection efforts undertaken by the provider itself.thus,according to the prrb,the intermediary argument that the provider use of an outside collection agency obligated the provider to engage in its collection efforts for a period greater than the days set forth in prm is not supported by the applicable medicare regulations or manual instructions.the prrb further concluded that 
prm indicates that when a provider,in a later period,recovers amounts previously included in allowable bad debts,the provider reimbursable costs in the period of recovery are reduced by the amounts so recovered.thus,it is reasonable to infer that the medicare program expects that providers will continue to pursue collection activities with respect to debts that have been deemed uncollectible for medicare reimbursement purposes.
the prrb therefore held that plaintiffs were entitled to medicare reimbursement for the bad debts at issue.
upon further review by the administrator,the prrb decision was reversed.in a final decision of the administrator issued on november,the administrator held that the language of prm implies discretionary rather than mandatory application of the presumption,the debt may rather than shall be deemed uncollectible if it remains unpaid for more than days.consequently,the administrator found that the presumption of noncollectibility does not relieve a provider from meeting the regulatory documentation requirements for ascertaining bad debts and only applies where a provider has otherwise demonstrated through appropriate documentation that it engaged in reasonable collection efforts.relying upon the intermediary manual,part ib,and the june,policy memorandum,as well as the relevant regulations and prm sections,the administrator concluded that if a provider continues to attempt collection of a debt either through efforts or a collection agency,
it is reasonable to conclude that the provider still considers the debt to have value and not worthless.thus,contrary to the provider argument,the administrator finds it reasonable to expect a provider to demonstrate that it has completed its collection effort,including outside collection,before claiming debts as worthless.
under the circumstances,the administrator found the requisite documentation had not been provided 
the administrator notes that the provider testimony suggested that the collection agency furnished a report telling the provider which of its accounts were uncollectible and worthless,and which ones the collection agency still pursued.however,the provider admitted that it did not request such reports and indicated that it had not attempted to compare what it had written off as bad debt and what the collection agency was actually still collecting on.in addition,the record contains no evidence reflecting the point in time when the debts were actually uncollectible.there is no documentation of when,or if,the collection agency returned the debts to the provider,or otherwise informed the provider that collection efforts were terminated.
in light of these documentation deficiencies,the administrator concluded that the presumption of noncollectibility did not apply because plaintiffs had failed to establish that the accounts were actually uncollectible when claimed as worthless or that sound business judgment established that there was no likelihood of recovery at any time in the future,pursuant to e and.the administrator therefore disallowed reimbursement for the fy bad debts 
on january,plaintiffs filed the present suit in federal district court,challenging the administrator final decision.in response to for summary judgment,the district court denied plaintiffs motion and granted defendant summary judgment motion,affirming the secretary final decision denying medicare reimbursement for the fy bad debts claimed by each plaintiff.the district court found that the secretary interpretation of of the prm gave effect to each of the four requirements of e,and therefore was not arbitrary and capricious nor inconsistent with medicare policy.battle creek health,d at.this appeal followed.

battle creek and trinity health,with the support of amicus curiae michigan health and hospital association,a membership organization representing michigan hospitals,argue that the secretary determination that plaintiffs failed to satisfy regulatory requirements for reimbursement of the bad debts at issue is arbitrary and capricious,not only because plaintiffs had no notice of the new standard,but also because the decision purportedly has no basis in,and conflicts with,the secretary current published regulations and reimbursement guidelines issued to medicare providers.specifically,plaintiffs complain that t he secretary requirement that providers discontinue collection agency efforts before seeking reimbursement of debts outstanding for more than days is inconsistent with the presumption and with medicare requirement that its beneficiaries bear the costs of deductibles and set forth in v a.
plaintiffs,however,have failed to persuade us that the secretary action in denying reimbursement to plaintiffs for the fy bad debts in question,based upon his interpretation of the germane regulations,is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accord with law.clark reg l med,at.in affirming the secretary decision,we have carefully considered the following arguments advanced by plaintiffs and amicus curiae regarding the significant regulatory issue raised in this case.
battle creek and trinity health first maintain that they are entitled to rely upon the presumption of noncollectibility set forth in prm.according to plaintiffs,this presumption establishes a mandatory,rule that a provider may deem bad debts uncollectible and worthless after at least days of reasonable collection efforts and,so interpreted,eliminates the administrative costs that otherwise would be incurred by having to demonstrate noncollectibility on a basis.they argue that the secretary providers discontinue collection agency efforts before seeking reimbursement of debts outstanding for more than abolishes the presumption and renders prm meaningless.
plaintiffs further posit that to the extent that the presumption in prm is discretionary,the presumption only has significance if it is the provider,not the fiscal intermediary,that has the discretion to apply the presumption,because the fiscal intermediary does not audit cost reports until a year after the close of the cost reporting year.consequently,a provider would not know if the presumption would be applied until it was too late to rely upon it.as a result,a provider purportedly would have no option but to ignore the presumption and make a determination of noncollectibility,precisely the task that the presumption was meant to obviate.
in rejecting plaintiffs argument,we initially note that the medicare act grants the secretary broad discretion to determine which reasonable costs may be reimbursed to medicare providers,v a,and what information is required from providers as a condition of reimbursement,a.pursuant to this broad statutory authority,the secretary promulgated the various regulations implicated herein pertaining to bad debt reimbursement and the documentation required to substantiate reimbursement requests.a requires providers to maintain sufficient financial records and statistical data for proper determination of costs payable under the program.related to this requirement,e,the focal point of this litigation,provides that bad debts may be reimbursed as reasonable costs only if four criteria are met,including the two criteria at issue in this case the debt was actually uncollectible when claimed as worthless and s ound business judgment established that there was no likelihood of recovery at any time in the future.e and the presumption of noncollectibility set forth in prm states that,i f after reasonable and customary attempts to collect a bill,the debt remains unpaid more than days from the date the first bill is mailed to the beneficiary,the debt may be deemed uncollectible.emphasis added.this interpretive guideline must be read in such a way that it is consistent with the plain language of the regulation.see guernsey mem l,at.interpretive rules do not have force and effect of law and do not effect a substantive change that is inconsistent with existing regulations.
the secretary opined that the presumption of noncollectibility is discretionary in nature and was not to be applied automatically for the benefit of plaintiffs in this case despite the passage of days,because the accounts in question had been referred to a collection agency and not yet returned to the provider as uncollectible.thus,according to the secretary,plaintiffs failed to show that the debt was actually uncollectible when claimed as worthless and that s ound business judgment established that there was no likelihood of recovery at any time in the future,as called for by e.
we find the secretary interpretation of e to be eminently reasonable.first,it conforms to the plain language of the regulation and prm.plaintiffs debts did not meet the criteria for reimbursement because the debts at issue were being serviced by a collection agency when claimed as worthless.the very fact that a collection agency was still attempting to collect the bad debts at issue indicates that these debts had not yet been determined to be actually uncollectible when claimed as worthless and certainly contraindicates that s ound business judgment established that there was no likelihood of recovery at any time in the future.e and.these criteria can not be met until the collection agency completes its collection effort and returns the debts to plaintiffs as uncollectible.moreover,as the secretary determined properly,the language in prm is discretionary in nature may be deemed,rather than mandatory.see matovski gonzales,cir t he regulation employs the term may not shall,implying that the grant of authority bestowed by the regulation is permissive not mandatory.thus,application of the presumption is not inevitable in every instance due to the mere passage of days following a provider use of reasonable collection efforts.
second,from a practical standpoint,if the presumption of noncollectibility is characterized as mandatory,as plaintiffs argue,then the third and fourth criteria of e would be rendered nugatory.we agree with the district court assessment that 
t o permit a provider to deem a debt uncollectible after days for medicare reimbursement purposes,but to continue its efforts to collect the debt would be inconsistent with the requirements that the debt was actually uncollectible and there was no likelihood of future collection.such an interpretation would transform the statute e into a statute the debt must be related to covered services and derived from deductible and coinsurance amounts,and the provider must be able to establish that reasonable collection efforts were made for days.the court can not conclude that it was arbitrary or capricious,or inconsistent with medicare policy for the secretary to interpret section of the prm in a manner that gave effect to each of the four requirements.
battle creek health systems,d at.
prm neither expressly nor implicitly excuses a provider from satisfying the specific criteria of e.indeed,when read in tandem with the regulation,we agree with the district court that the secretary has interpreted the presumption of noncollectibility in a manner that is consistent with,and most effectively enforces,all of the criteria of e.
likewise,the presumption of noncollectibility does not relieve a provider from fulfilling the specific documentation requirements of prm and.plaintiffs argue that the secretary reliance upon prm and as a basis for his decision is misplaced,because neither guideline imposes any requirement that providers cease collection efforts before deeming the debts uncollectible pursuant to the presumption of noncollectibility.battle creek and trinity health contend that prm.a,which states that a provider use of a collection agency may be in addition to or in lieu of its own collection efforts,actually encourages providers to use collection agencies to recoup medicare bad debts and thus reinforces their argument that there is no regulatory basis for requiring a medicare provider to recall a bad debt from a collection agency before the debt can be deemed worthless pursuant to e.again,we disagree.
these prm provisions are part of the overall framework of the medicare reimbursement scheme,implemented by the secretary to provide guidance regarding specific methods of collection and documentation.prm addresses the reasonable collection effort that must be undertaken by providers when seeking to recoup bad debts,prm.a states that a provider collection efforts may include the use of a collection agency,prm.b provides that the provider collection effort should be documented in the patient file by copies of the bill s and other letters or reports,and prm states that a provider should have the usual accounts receivable cards and source documents to support its claim for a bad debt for each account included.while these sections of the prm do not address explicitly the issue of finality of collection efforts,conversely,nothing in the text of these manual provisions contradicts or precludes the secretary mandate that,for documentation purposes,a provider must show concretely,when a collection agency is used by the provider,that those debts in the hands of the collection agency are truly uncollectible before the presumption will apply.as the secretary properly held,prm does not suggest that this presumption relieves the provider from meeting the general regulatory documentation requirements or the specific documentation requirements in sections.b and of the prm.
battle creek and trinity health further argue that the secretary decision is contrary to prm,which,according to plaintiffs,encourages providers to continue collection efforts after the provider has been reimbursed by the medicare program for a bad debt.plaintiffs maintain that the secretary decision appears to be grounded in part in a concern that providers would be able to obtain double recovery for bad debts that are paid after reimbursement.plaintiffs note,however,that this concern is addressed expressly in prm,which requires a provider to reimburse medicare for bad debts that are collected in a later reporting period after cms has reimbursed the provider for the same.section therefore supports the obvious inference that seeking reimbursement for bad debts does not require discontinuation of collection efforts 
however,this provision merely recognizes that if a provider recovers amounts previously included in allowable bad debts,it must reduce reimbursable costs in the period during which the debt was recovered by the same amount.as the district court found,section is not incompatible with the secretary decision that debts are not reimbursable until collection efforts have ceased and it is not unreasonable for the secretary to include guidelines to govern that situation.battle creek health systems,d at.
plaintiffs also challenge the sources underlying the secretary decision,claiming that the intermediary manual should be disregarded because it is issued only to fiscal intermediaries,not providers,and,from a substantive standpoint,part ib,of the intermediary manual allegedly conflicts with prm and deprives a provider of the discretion to use its sound business judgment in determining which accounts are worthless and uncollectible.plaintiffs likewise assert that the secretary reliance upon the june,hcfa policy memorandum is arbitrary and capricious because the memorandum actually imposes more stringent requirements than called for in e and.
to the contrary,the intermediary manual and the hcfa policy memorandum serve to bolster the secretary interpretation of e.the intermediary manual advises that a medicare bad debt can not be claimed as reimbursable until after the collection agency completes its collection effort.intermediary manual,part ib.the policy memorandum similarly provides,in accord with the fourth criterion in section,that until a provider reasonable collection effort has been completed,including both efforts and the use of a collection agency,a medicare bad debt may not be reimbursed as uncollectible.as noted previously,these interpretive tools are entitled to respect to the extent that those interpretations have the power to persuade and,so long as these interpretive sources are not inconsistent with promulgated regulations or outside of coverage of the act,they are valid.clark reg l med,at.in this case,the provisions of the intermediary manual and policy memorandum are persuasive,consistent with the regulatory provisions,and thus valid sources upon which the secretary can legitimately rely.
plaintiffs contention that the intermediary manual is not a usable interpretive source because providers are not given notice of its provisions is without merit.although it is directed to fiscal intermediaries for auditing purposes,the intermediary manual is often referenced by
