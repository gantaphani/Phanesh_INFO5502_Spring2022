plaintiff warre appeals from the district court affirmance of a decision to terminate the supplemental security income ssi benefits of her minor son.we hold that the commissioner of social security permissibly interpreted listing a,which defines a growth impairment to be a disability,to require a continuing reduction in a child growth velocity,rather than a mere continuation of shorter stature and substantial evidence supports the finding that plaintiff son had medically improved to the point where he no longer met listing accordingly,we affirm the decisions below.
facts and procedural history 
the pertinent facts are,for the most part,undisputed.plaintiff applied for ssi benefits in on behalf of her son iv,who was then seven months old.see defining eligibility for a child ssi benefits.the child is diagnosed with isovaleric acidemia,a rare metabolic disorder that causes concentrations of protein in the blood and tissues.upon consideration of the application,an administrative law judge alj found iv to be disabled because his impairment met the criteria of listings and c,pt,subpt,app.his head size was below the fifth percentile,his height was at the percentile,and his development was at a level that was less than fifty percent of his chronological age.by the age of seven months the child had been hospitalized approximately times due to his condition.
the social security administration ssa conducted a continuing disability review in.see explaining that the agency must evaluate recipients of ssi benefits from time to time to determine their continuing eligibility for benefits.the ssa found that iv had experienced medical improvement and that he was no longer eligible for ssi benefits.see a stating that ssi benefits may be terminated if the recipient has medically improved and is not currently disabled.
plaintiff requested a hearing,which took place on october.see providing for a hearing before an alj.plaintiff,the child father,and medical expert perry grossman testified.the alj also considered documentary evidence from the child treating physicians and his school.
at the time of the hearing,iv was seven years old.according to the evidence,he slept excessively,experienced periods of lethargy,urinated frequently,sometimes wet his bed and,because of the medications that he was taking,smelled fishy when he perspired.iv had not been hospitalized since,although he was taken to the emergency room once in due to lethargy.he missed days of school during the academic year because of his illness.
the child parents testified that he was very forgetful and learned slowly,but his teachers reported that he functioned at grade level,had a normal attention span,and showed continued growth in his academic and social skills.he was found to socialize well and to be generally an active child with normal strength,coordination,and gait.
in,iv height was in the fiftieth percentile.in he dropped to the percentile in stature.in and,his height remained in the percentile.early in,his weight was in the percentile as well by october of that year his weight had risen to the fiftieth percentile.at the time of the hearing,his head circumference also was near the fiftieth percentile.
at the hearing,grossman testified that iv did not meet the criteria for listing a because that listing requires a sustained decrease in the growth velocity.for this child,the change did persist.what persisted was his height at the new percentile.in other words,for more than two years iv height had remained stable at the percentile,rather than continuing to slow down.grossman testified that the child prognosis was good and that he gotten over the most difficult period in his life.
due to his condition,iv had to follow a strict diet and take medications daily.his medications included carnitine,which cost per month glycine,which cost per month and calcium carbonate and iron supplements,which cost per month.without those medications,iv is at high risk of brain damage or death.even with proper treatment,he is at risk for developmental delay or brain damage in the event that he is affected by an acute episode of illness that results in extreme metabolic acidosis that can not be controlled.at the time of the hearing,plaintiff and the child father did not have health insurance apart from the child eligibility for ssi benefits.
the alj determined that iv had experienced medical improvement.he found that iv impairment no longer met or medically equaled listing because,a lthough the claimant has had a fall of greater than percentiles in height,the medical records document the claimant has been growing along the percentile since february.next,the alj found that iv impairment was severe,but not disabling although the child was a t risk for medical decompensation death without his medications,his ability to function in an age appropriate manner is only mildly impacted.the alj also considered whether the impairment was functionally equivalent to any listed impairment.he found that iv was markedly limited in the domain of health and physical but,because he did not have extreme limitations in any one domain of functioning or marked limitations in any two domains of functioning,the impairment was not functionally equivalent to any listed impairment.see a providing standard.accordingly,the alj concluded that iv was no longer eligible for ssi benefits.
plaintiff appealed to the district court,which affirmed the alj decision.plaintiff now timely appeals to us.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court decision upholding the denial of social security benefits.moisa barnhart,cir.we must affirm the decision if it is supported by substantial evidence,which is more than a mere scintilla but not necessarily a preponderance.connett barnhart,cir.
discussion 
a.the meaning of listing a 
the principal issue in this appeal is whether the district court and the alj properly interpreted listing a,which requires a f all of greater than percentiles in height which is sustained.emphases added.plaintiff argues that the italicized phrase plainly means that a person must sustain a fall in height that is never recovered.by contrast,the commissioner of social security argues that sustained in this context means accompanied by a continuing reduction in growth other words,not merely that the child remains shorter in stature,but that his growth rate has slowed.
in our view,listing a is ambiguous.it is unclear whether the fall reduction in percentiles must be sustained,as the commissioner argues,or whether only the reduced height must be sustained,as plaintiff contends.the text of the listing reasonably supports the meanings urged by both parties.
in that circumstance,the commissioner plausible interpretation of her agency own regulation is entitled to deference.holohan massanari,cir.here,the commissioner interpretation is consistent with the wording of the regulation and the governing statute indeed,it is the more sensible reading in terms of what the listing is trying to child who is not just short in stature,but whose growth pattern is so abnormal that he should be defined as disabled.were we to adopt plaintiff interpretation,many a nondisabled child who simply ends a growth spurt would be defined as disabled.
the commissioner interpretation also is more consistent with the listing context.listing b defines a growth impairment involving a f all to,or persistence of,height below the third percentile.listing a omits persistence of height more than percentiles below a child previous height yet this is the reading that plaintiff would have us adopt.see sec mccarthy,cir it is a canon of statutory interpretation that the use of different words or terms within a statute demonstrates that the drafter intended to convey a different meaning for those words.
finally,in support of the alj and the district court holdings,the commissioner relies on the program operations manual system poms,an internal ssa document.poms section di states that a child whose growth delay satisfies the criteria specified in listings a or but whose fall in growth is not also accompanied by a continuing reduction in growth velocity,does not meet the severity l
