jurisdiction 
jurisdiction in the district court was based upon f jurisdiction on appeal is based upon.the notice of appeal was timely filed pursuant to fed.a.
background 
the undisputed facts of this case relate to in home request for reimbursement from the secretary for the costs of physical therapy services provided to medicare recipients in excess of the amounts set forth in the guidelines created by the secretary.
pursuant to the medicare act,et,the health care financing administration hcfa,a branch of the department of health and human services hhs,delegates to contracting intermediaries the task of determining the appropriate reimbursement for home health services provided to medicare beneficiaries based upon an annual cost report submitted by the provider.see a b a provider is entitled to recover the reasonable cost of the services it provides to medicare beneficiaries.see a a i reasonable costs are defined as the cost actually incurred,excluding any cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services,to be determined in accordance with the secretary regulations.id.v a.
in,congress authorized the secretary to establish limits for reasonable costs for certain services,including the physical therapy services at issue in this appeal as a result,the secretary promulgated the regulations at issue,codified at,which base the reasonable cost of physical therapy services upon published salary equivalency guidelines the guidelines,to be determined on a periodic basis.the regulation directs hcfa to determine the guideline amounts by adding together the prevailing hourly salary rate based on the percentile of salary ranges paid by providers in the geographical area,the amount of fringe benefits generally received by an employee physical therapist,and the amount of expenses generally incurred by a physical therapist.see b,and.
from to,the secretary increased the guideline amounts approximately every one to two years,using new wage data,inflation factors,and other recalculations.in,the guidelines were recalculated on the basis of new wage data and included an automatic monthly increase annually.these guidelines remained in place until,covering the years at issue in this appeal.
if a provider disputes the intermediary reimbursement decision,it may initiate an administrative review process.first,the provider may request an exception from the intermediary based on special circumstances,such as where the guidelines are inappropriate due to unique circumstances or special labor market conditions.id.f.to qualify for this exception,a provider must prove that the going rate in the area for this particular type of service is higher than the guideline limit,and such services are unavailable at the guideline amounts.hcfa pub.if an exception does not apply or if the intermediary rejects the exception request,the provider may appeal to the provider reimbursement review board the board.see g the board decision becomes final unless the secretary decides to review it,in which case the secretary decision is final.when a decision becomes final,a provider may request judicial review pursuant to f 
in this appeal,in home,a minnesota corporation with offices in many cities,filed a group appeal to the board,requesting reimbursement for costs in excess of the guidelines for five offices for the years and four different intermediaries handled the various reimbursement requests.after receiving notification from the intermediaries regarding each reimbursement determination,in home consolidated its claims and appealed directly to the board,seeking reimbursement for its actual expenses incurred for services performed by outside contractor physical therapists in excess of the cost limits set by the guidelines in home did not request an exception under f from the intermediaries to approve its excess costs,instead relying on the administrative procedure act,to contend that the guidelines were arbitrary,capricious,and contrary to law because they were outdated,as they had not been reevaluated since.
the board found that the guidelines were properly promulgated by the secretary and correctly applied by the intermediaries.furthermore,the board determined that in home could not seek relief from the application of the guidelines because it had not exhausted its administrative remedies by requesting an exception before appealing to the board.the board concluded that the purpose of the exception process is to supply an administrative remedy for providers to contest the reasonableness of the guideline amounts.the board assessed that in home failed to adequately pursue its administrative remedies by neglecting to submit evidence concerning whether the guidelines were reasonable and whether it was able to obtain physical therapy services in its geographical areas at or below the guideline rates,as required by the exception process.the secretary did not review the decision of the board and the board decision became final for purposes of judicial review.
in home then filed this action for judicial review in the district court,and moved for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of in home.the district court found that in home failed to request an exception under f,and therefore had not exhausted its administrative remedies.however,the district court determined that in home failure to exhaust its administrative remedies was excusable due to the futility of seeking the exception,explaining that the guidelines were inappropriate not because of unique circumstances or special labor market conditions,but rather because they were outdated and therefore inappropriate in all situations.on the merits,the district court concluded that the guidelines violated the plain language of the regulations and thus were contrary to law because they were not determined on a periodic basis and did not reflect the percentile of prevailing salary ranges in the years at issue.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the secretary argues that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because in home had not exhausted its available administrative remedies.the secretary contends that,by failing to request an exception from the intermediaries,in home bypassed the appropriate administrative avenue for its grievance,and may not raise the issue in federal court when it was not adjudicated through the secretary.the secretary further asserts that the district court erred in excusing in home failure to exhaust its administrative remedies because the exception process,rather than being futile,offered in home the opportunity to request the exact relief it seeks in this judicial costs it incurred in excess of the amounts authorized by the secretary guidelines.
in home counters that the district court was correct in excusing its failure to exhaust administrative remedies because it was not contesting the guidelines based on its unique circumstances or special labor market conditions,as required by the language of f.instead,in home relies on the district court conclusion that the validity of the guidelines is a separate and distinct issue unrelated to in home specific circum
