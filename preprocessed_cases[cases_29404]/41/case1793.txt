synergetics,a company that designs,manufactures,and sells ophthalmic equipment used in eye surgeries,sued former employees appellants charles richard hurst,and michael mcgowan for trade secret misappropriation,breach of contract,intentional interference with business relationships,and breach of fiduciary duty.a jury found for synergetics and awarded compensatory and punitive damages.the district court entered judgment consistent with the jury findings,enjoined hurst and mcgowan from using or disclosing synergetics trade secrets for two years,required hurst and mcgowan to destroy the misappropriated information and products developed from that information,and denied the motion for remittitur and proposed judgment.on appeal,hurst and mcgowan argue that the district court should have granted their motion in limine to exclude the testimony and reports of a synergetics expert witness,motion for summary judgment or motion for judgment as a matter of law,and proposed judgment and motion for remittitur.we affirm.
because the jury ruled in synergetics favor on all four claims,we provide the following recitation of facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,giving all reasonable inferences to synergetics.see goss int l man roland druckmaschinen aktiengesellschaft,cir,cert.denied,d.
synergetics specializes in the sale of precision instruments and disposable laser probes used during vitreoretinal procedures,which are surgeries performed at the back of the eye typically involving the of the retina.synergetics was formed in by gregg scheller,who had previously worked as a mechanical and design engineer for other ophthalmic instrument manufacturers.scheller hired christopher lumpkin to work as an engineer developing prototypes.lumpkin later left synergetics as an employee and moved to colorado,but he maintained a consulting arrangement with synergetics.through this arrangement,lumpkin continued to develop products for synergetics on a basis and continued to work at synergetics missouri plant one week per month.synergetics also employed michael auld as head of research and development.
in the vitreoretinal industry,there are four major laser manufacturers.of the four,iridex also referred to in the record as iris employed a technology that prevented the use of competitors laser probes on its lasers.because of its high quality,the iridex laser is the laser most widely used by hospitals and doctors.after almost four years of research and development,synergetics began marketing an system that allowed the connection of synergetics laser probes to iridex lasers as well as to other laser brands.thus,synergetics became the only company,other than iridex,that provided laser probes that could be used on iridex lasers.auld was the direct inventor of this system.
in,synergetics hired hurst and mcgowan to fill sales positions with the company.hurst was responsible for management of personnel and accounts in the southern and western united states.mcgowan handled personnel and accounts in the eastern united states.through these positions,hurst and mcgowan had access to confidential sales,marketing,research,and development information,and they were members of synergetics presidential advisory council,the company most strategic committee.on february,hurst and mcgowan entered into separate,but identical,confidentiality agreements with synergetics,in which each agreed employed or after the termination of their would not disclose or use in any manner whatsoever,any of the confidential information acquired during their employment with synergetics.the agreements further provide that hurst and mcgowan must return all company materials such as records,files,and photographic materials upon termination of their employment.
while still employed by synergetics,hurst and mcgowan decided to form a competing company.in furtherance of this plan,they hired lumpkin to build a competing system for the iridex laser.by using spare parts from synergetics,lumpkin was able to do this in six hours.while maintaining their employment with synergetics,hurst and mcgowan entered into a confidentiality agreement with peregrine surgical,one of the manufacturers used by synergetics,enabling hurst and mcgowan to enter into discussions with peregrine surgical concerning production of competitive items,contacted synergetics customers to discuss the formation of the new company,and constructed prototypes of products for testing and evaluation.hurst and mcgowan did not reveal these plans and actions to synergetics,realizing that to do so would jeopardize their employment.due to poor job performance,however,hurst resigned his employment in july,and mcgowan was terminated in september.two weeks after mcgowan termination,hurst and mcgowan incorporated their new company,innovatech surgical,with mcgowan serving as president and hurst serving as secretary.innovatech sought to market and sell ophthalmic medical equipment,including a directional ophthalmic laser probe in direct competition with synergetics laser probe.
because lumpkin did not possess the necessary skills to create the design drawings required for production of the system and other competitive products,he contacted synergetics employee,auld,to obtain help in creating design drawings for innovatech following hurst and mcgowan termination from synergetics.auld did this,in large part,by copying synergetics drawings.such copies included specific,detailed measurements and tolerances.hurst and mcgowan were aware that auld was still employed by synergetics and that auld was assisting lumpkin in creating these drawings.as a result of these actions,only synergetics,innovatech,and iridex had the technology and products to attach disposable laser probes to the iridex laser unit.
on february,synergetics filed suit against hurst and mcgowan in missouri state court.the case was removed to the united states district court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.in september,a jury trial was held,and the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs.the jury found,by a preponderance of the evidence,that hurst and mcgowan had misappropriated synergetics trade secrets concerning pricing of products,product selections,sales data,prioritization of products,and technical information regarding the tolerances and torque of the system,synergetics suffered harm as a direct result of the misappropriation of the trade secrets,either hurst or mcgowan intentionally interfered with synergetics business relationships with separate businesses from which synergetics suffered damages,hurst and mcgowan breached their confidentiality agreements with synergetics,and hurst and mcgowan breached a fiduciary duty of loyalty while employed by synergetics.the jury determined that synergetics suffered actual damages in the amount of.the jury further awarded punitive damages against hurst and mcgowan in the amount of per defendant.following denial of appellants motion for remittitur and proposed judgment,the district court entered judgment against hurst and mcgowan in accordance with the jury verdict and enjoined hurst and mcgowan from using or disclosing the trade secret information for two years.
appellants first assert that the district court erred in denying their motion in limine to exclude the expert testimony and report of ronald vollmar,a certified public accountant,financial analyst,and fraud examiner.vollmar testified about the economic damages synergetics suffered due to appellants actions.appellants contend that vollmar testimony should not have been admitted because his opinions were based on an incorrect assumption regarding the number of suppliers in the relevant market.
federal rule of evidence provides that if expert testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,an expert may testify where the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.see.trial courts serve as gatekeepers to ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant,but reliable.see daubert merrell dow,d see also kumho tire carmichael,d we conclude that daubert general forth the trial judge general gatekeeping not only to expert testimony based on scientific knowledge,but also to expert testimony based on technical and other specialized knowledge.in exercising this gatekeeping function,the trial court must first make a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue,focusing specifically on the methodology and not the conclusions.see daubert,at.second,the court must ensure that the testimony is relevant and will aid the trier of fact.see id.at.
appellants do not contest vollmar qualifications or whether the subject of his proposed testimony would aid the jury.instead,appellants contend that vollmar methodology was unreliable because the key assumption upon which his opinion is based,essentially that the relevant market is a two supplier market,is false and ignores the existence of significant competition in the market.br.of appellant at.using sales information provided by innovatech and synergetics,vollmar identified the common customers of both companies.then,he identified lost sales on products sold by innovatech that were previously purchased from synergetics and products sold by innovatech that were only previously available from synergetics.pl.ex.where innovatech sold,the calculations also included related sales of laser probes.id.during at trial,vollmar explained that he did not consider possible competition from iridex because he focused only on those innovatech customers who had previously been synergetics customers.thus,vollmar did not include any portion of innovatech customers,other than those who had previously been synergetics customers,in the damages assessment.tr.
as a general rule,the factual basis of an expert opinion goes to the credibility of the testimony,not the admissibility,and it is up to the opposing party to examine the factual basis for the opinion in.bonner isp,cir quoting hose chicago northwestern transp,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.decisions concerning the admission of expert testimony lie within the broad discretion of the trial court,and these decisions will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.peitzmeier hennessy,cir,cert.denied,d.an expert opinion should be excluded only if that opinion is so fundamentally unsupported that it can offer no assistance to the jury.bonner,at.vollmar testimony was not so fundamentally unsupported that it could offer no assistance to the jury.he explained his methodology in calculating the damages,and the appellants had the opportunity to challenge vollmar assumptions and methodology,both through and by presenting their own expert witness on damages.while other methods for calculating damages may be available,so long as the methods employed are scientifically valid,appellants mere disagreement with the assumptions and methodology used does not warrant exclusion of expert testimony.see daubert,at.vigorous,presentation of contrary evidence,and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.efco symons,cir no abuse of discretion in allowing plaintiff expert witness to testify as to damages where defendant expert,who disputed plaintiff expert methodology,also testified jury left with ultimate decision as to which damages theory was more sound.
the district court did not abuse its considerable discretion in permitting vollmar testimony.
appellants next argue that the district court erred in denying their original motion for summary judgment and their motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all evidence on the claims of trade secret misappropriation,intentional interference with business relationships,breach of contract,and breach of fiduciary duty.
after a full trial on the merits,we do not review a denial of summary judgment as such denial is interlocutory in nature.see eaddy yancey,cir citing bakker mckinnon,cir.thus,our review here is only from the denial of judgment as a matter of law.we review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law,applying the same standard as the district court.canny bottling group,cir.to grant judgment as a matter of law,the court must find that there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis to support a jury verdict in the party favor.see.a.all factual inferences are drawn in favor of the party,and the court avoids making credibility assessments or weighing the evidence.see first union bank benham,cir quoting phillips collings,cir.

appellants argue that synergetics failed to offer any evidence that appellants knew or had reason to know that the engineering drawings prepared by auld were copied from synergetics material.further,appellants contend that the information claimed to have been misappropriated is the type that grows stale relatively quickly and,thus,should not be afforded protection over two years after appellants termination.
the jury found that synergetics owned a trade secret for,inter alia,dimensions and tolerances information regarding its system,and that appellants misappropriated this trade secret.at trial,the jury watched the videotaped deposition of michael auld.auld testified that lumpkin had given him some crude pencil drawings of the lumpkin had constructed using spare synergetics parts and asked auld to make the necessary engineering designs.auld admitted that he created these by copying,or cutting and pasting from,synergetics engineering drawings while employed by synergetics.mcgowan testified at trial that lumpkin informed him that auld was assisting with the engineering drawings and that mcgowan knew auld was employed by synergetics at the time he was assisting.after learning of auld involvement,mcgowan then began communicating on a monthly basis with auld about the drawings.additionally,the jury was presented testimony from scheller that synergetics had taken years to design and develop its system,but lumpkin testified that he needed only six hours to design a similar product.clearly,there is sufficient evidence supporting the jury verdict that appellants misappropriated synergetics trade secrets pertaining to the specifications found in the engineering drawings.
while appellants only challenge whether there was sufficient evidence to support a finding of misappropriation of trade secrets pertaining to auld actions of copying synergetics engineering drawings,the jury also found that synergetics owned trade secret information pertaining to product pricing information,product purchases,quantities of products its customers purchased,and prioritization of its products which appellants also misappropriated.such information would have been commonly known and used by appellants through their employment responsibilities as salesmen.
appellants further argue that the misappropriated information grew stale and thus was not deserving of trade secret protection.it is unclear from their brief exactly what
