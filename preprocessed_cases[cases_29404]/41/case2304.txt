the district court found kyulle jay strong incompetent to stand trial and committed him to the custody of the attorney general for treatment and restoration pursuant to d.strong appeals the district court commitment order,arguing that d is unconstitutional because it requires mandatory confinement without giving the district court an opportunity to assess a defendant individualized circumstances.we conclude that d comports with the due process clause of the constitution and affirm the commitment order of the district court.
background 
on november,a grand jury in the district of arizona indicted strong and two for assault with a dangerous weapon in violation of and a,and assault resulting in serious bodily injury in violation of and a before trial,strong filed a motion with the district court for determination of his mental competency.after reviewing psychiatric reports submitted by strong and the government,the district court concluded that strong was incompetent to stand trial and committed him to the custody of the attorney general for treatment and restoration pursuant to d strong argued before the district court that commitment under d violated his due process rights,because the statutory provision required mandatory commitment and did not give the district court an opportunity to assess strong individualized circumstances,such as whether strong is,in fact,restorable to competency,and whether inpatient treatment is the least restrictive means to restore him.the district court rejected strong argument and held d to be constitutional.accordingly,it ordered strong transferred to a federal medical facility in butner,north carolina,under the terms of that statutory provision.strong timely appealed the district court commitment order,renewing his argument that d is unconstitutional.
while awaiting transfer,the district court permitted strong to remain at recovery homes,a local inpatient facility where strong had been residing while receiving drug and alcohol treatment.when strong was initially granted release,the district court warned him and defense counsel that strong release to recovery homes would be contingent upon strong strict adherence to his release conditions.specifically,the district court emphasized to defense counsel 
strong will have to sign the release order,but i want him to do that only,only after you have reviewed it thoroughly with him,reviewed the nature of the charges against him,and made sure in your own mind that he is fully aware of the consequences of his violation of the slightest degree of anything in this release order.
because strong undisputedly had an alcohol and substance abuse problem,one of the conditions of his release was that he refrain from the consumption of alcohol.
before this court heard strong appeal of the d commitment order,strong violated a condition of his release by consuming a beer.consequently,he was terminated from the treatment program at recovery homes and brought before the district court for release revocation proceedings.at the revocation hearing,the district court concluded that strong violation of the release condition represent ed the wors t type of conduct that the court can imagine taking into consideration the nature of the charges.it therefore ordered strong detained as a danger to the community pursuant to before the district court issued the detention order,defense counsel urged the district court not to consider its prior commitment order in deciding whether or not to detain strong.although it is not entirely clear from the record,it does not appear that the district court heeded defense counsel request.as will be discussed in more detail below,when asked specifically by defense counsel whether its decision to detain strong was influenced by strong impending commitment under d,the district court answered in the affirmative.
strong timely appealed the detention order,which this court affirmed.united states strong,cir,unpublished order goodwin,mckeown,fisher,jj.in light of the detention order,the government filed a motion to dismiss strong d appeal on mootness grounds.on december,this court denied the government motion without prejudice to renewing the arguments in the answering brief.united states strong,cir,unpublished order mckeown,fisher,jj.the government renewed its mootness argument in the present appeal.
the issue before us is the validity of the district court september,commitment order.we have jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine.see united states friedman,cir.we conclude that the matter is not moot and affirm the district court order on the merits.
ii.mootness 
mootness is a jurisdictional issue which we address at the threshold.see foster carson,cir.the inexorable command of the constitution confines us to deciding only actual cases and controversies.bean,cir citing const.art.iii,cl.for a case to fall within our limited judicial power,it is not enough that there may have been a live case or controversy when the case was decided by the court whose judgment we are reviewing.burke barnes,d.rather,a live case or controversy must be extant at all stages of review.steffel thompson,d.otherwise,the case is moot and must be dismissed.see paulson city of san diego,cir.
an appeal is moot when,by virtue of an intervening event,a court of appeals can not grant any effectual relief whatever in favor of the appellant.calderon moore,d per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.the party asserting mootness bears a heavy burden of establishing that there is no effective relief remaining for a court to provide.united states dist.court,cir.here,the government argues that strong appeal is moot because the district court subsequent detention order foreclosed strong ability to seek less restrictive means of treatment or restoration under d.according to the government,e ven if there were some merit initially to strong argument that the district court should have considered alternatives to the temporary hospitalization commitment and study required by d,this is not an effective remedy or alternative for an defendant.
we agree with the government argument in principle,but disagree that the argument should be applied in the specific context of this case.the government has failed to carry its heavy burden of persuading us that,even in the absence of the d commitment order,the district court would nevertheless have adjudged strong to be a danger to the community and detained him pursuant to.see,at.while the record below is somewhat ambiguous,it indicates that the district court relied on the terms of the commitment order in deciding to take strong into custody,perhaps because it believed that d required confinement in any event.when asked by defense counsel whether its decision to detain strong was influenced by strong impending commitment under d,the district court responded 
well,yes,the court did take into consideration the commitment.and it,in the court mind,justifies the precise language of the statute that requires a mandatory commitment to the custody of the attorney general for the obvious reason that you ca have people who are found by the court to be incompetent and have them loose in the society.
if the district court had answered defense counsel question with a no,then we could conclude that the commitment order before us now had been overtaken by subsequent events,rendering this appeal moot.but that was not the answer the district court gave when asked the critical question.instead,the court said that its decision to detain strong was based,at least in part,on strong impending commitment under d.accordingly,we can not say with certainty that the district court might not issue a different order if we were to remand the matter after holding the mandatory confinement provision of d to be unconstitutional.
in prior cases,we have held that where the district court has the statutory discretion to modify a defendant term of supervised release following a successful sentencing challenge,the possibility that the district court may exercise such discretion following this court decision is sufficient to prevent an appeal from becoming moot.see mujahid daniels,cir the possibilit
