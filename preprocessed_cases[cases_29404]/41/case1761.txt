a.the arrest 
on october,a little after,van buren,arkansas,police officer michael sharum responded to an accident report involving a vehicle in a creek.he found grayson standing next to the creek,soaking wet,and reporting that his vehicle was going to blow up.sharum tried to arrest grayson for driving while intoxicated,and grayson became combative.sharum,struggling to gain control of grayson,struck grayson on the head with his duty weapon,and then grayson cooperated with the arrest.sharum placed grayson in the back of his unit and transported him to the jail.
b.the intake 
following the arrest,sharum drove his vehicle into the sallyport at the jail.he walked with grayson into the jail and had grayson sit on a bench in handcuffs.sharum told the jailers that he was pretty sure grayson was under the influence of some narcotic.sharum also told the jailers that he would have to come back later to perform a blood draw for a toxicology screening and asked that grayson be changed into dry clothing.while he was filling out a probable cause sheet,sharum observed grayson calmly sitting on the bench,coherently answering questions from the jailers about his name,address,date of birth,and social security number.sharum also spoke to grayson mother,who explained that grayson had a history of methamphetamine use.sharum left the jail.at the time of their interactions,sharum was not sure if grayson was actually experiencing any hallucinations,such as grayson reported belief that his vehicle would blow up.when grayson arrived at the jail,he appeared normal,was responsive and attentive,and did not display any signs that he was having hallucinations.
grayson was brought to the jail at approximately,shortly before the first shift ended at corporal bobby josenberger was supervising jailers roy bass and gena bowles.when gena bowles first observed grayson,he was sitting quietly on a bench in handcuffs.she had a difficult time getting his attention.she asked him if he had been doing drugs,and he replied that he had lost something.bowles initially refused to accept grayson,and sharum complained to her that taking grayson to the hospital would take a lot of time.bowles told josenberger that she thought grayson should not be booked into the jail,but should be taken to the hospital.bowles called grayson mother,and put his mother on the phone with josenberger.
after talking to grayson mother,josenberger conferred with sharum and corporal john mcallister.because mcallister would be supervising the next shift starting at,mcallister visually evaluated grayson to determine whether to accept him at the jail.he asked grayson if he had been doing drugs,and grayson told mcallister that he had lost his straw.mcallister decided to book him into the jail,stating that the jail had booked detainees in worse condition.bowles told mcallister that she thought that grayson would become more intoxicated,but he assured her that grayson would be all right.mcallister was not informed that grayson had been struck in the head or that grayson had claimed his vehicle was going to explode.
bass,mcallister,and a third jailer accompanied grayson to the dressing room inside the jail.grayson complied with their instructions and changed into a dry prison uniform by himself.at approximately,bass,jailer chris porter,and mcallister escorted grayson to cell,which was used as an observation cell for prisoners who were intoxicated,to make sure that a jailer could readily observe him.

sharum returned to the jail at to take grayson blood.again,at that time,sharum observed that grayson was not acting abnormally and sharum did not observe evidence that grayson was hallucinating.sharum read grayson his rights on implied consent for drug testing,and grayson stated that he did not understand,would not submit to testing,and did not want to sign anything.mcallister accompanied sharum to witness the reading of the implied consent form and noticed that grayson was acting like he did not want to be disturbed,a reaction to the implied consent form,but nothing about the event signaled that grayson needed to go to the hospital.
porter was stationed at a desk located in a hallway common to all cells,approximately fifteen to twenty feet from cell.porter checked on all men in the jail at and at and noticed nothing unusual about grayson.until,grayson was quiet and behaved normally.
