the tennessee department of finance appeals the district court denial of its motion to vacate a settlement between the parties in a suit for medicaid benefits.tennessee argues that the agreed order approving the settlement should be treated as a consent decree and vacated under federal rule of civil procedure b because an intervening decision of this court,westside mothers olszewski,cir westside mothers ii,eliminated the legal basis for the settlement and thus made it inequitable to enforce prospectively.we reverse in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
this appeal stems from the settlement of a suit brought by a class of mentally disabled tennessee residents.in the underlying suit,the class members alleged they were eligible for services under the medicaid act either in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded or in a host or group home through tennessee home and community based services medicaid waiver program hcbs but had been denied the opportunity to apply for waiver services,had their applications denied,or had been determined to be eligible for services but were put on a waiting list.in so doing,the plaintiffs argued that tennessee violated medicaid law in five ways by failing to provide medical assistance in adequate amount,duration,and scope in violation of a by failing to provide eligible defendants a choice between and hbcs waiver services in violation of c by failing to inform eligible individuals of the application process with reasonable promptness in violation of a by failing to serve individuals with reasonable promptness in violation of a and by failing to provide written notices and an opportunity to be heard when services are denied in violation of a and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.
following the district court denial of for summary judgment,the parties negotiated a settlement that was later approved by the district court in an agreed order it issued june.under this settlement,tennessee agreed that it would overhaul its administrative system,expand funding and programs for the mentally disabled,and develop program infrastructure with the goal of increasing program enrollment and substantially reducing or eliminating the waiting list for waiver services.the agreement prescribed tennessee objectives for the first two years of the agreement,and provided that its goals for years three through five would be negotiated within two years.the agreement would then expire at the end of the fifth year,on december.
after the initial two year period,the parties disagreed as to whether tennessee had met the goals set for the first two years and they were unable to reach an agreement as to goals for years three through five.the magistrate judge supervising the case thus declared an impasse and referred the matter back to the district court as provided in the settlement.tennessee then moved to vacate the agreed order approving the settlement and dismiss the suit based upon an intervening sixth circuit decision,westside mothers olszewski,cir westside mothers ii.in westside mothers ii,this court rejected a suit alleging that michigan had violated the medicaid act by failing to ensure the provision of diagnostic services to eligible children because medicaid is a reimbursement scheme,not a scheme for medical services.at a the term medical assistance means payment of part or all of the cost of covered care and services.in its motion,tennessee argued that the settlement was intended to remedy its alleged noncompliance with the medicaid statute by failing to ensure eligible individuals had access to waiver services,but that westside mothers ii had since established that no such duty exists.this,tennessee argued,constituted a change in circumstances that entitled it to relief from prospective enforcement of the agreement under the supreme court decision in rufo inmates of suffolk county jail,d,which held that it is inequitable under rule b to enforce a consent decree when the violation it intends to remedy has ceased to be illegal due to a change in law.see at.the district court denied this motion,and tennessee now appeals.
medicaid requires participating states to provide medical assistance to eligible individuals,a,and that it be provided with reasonable promptness.a.but what medical assistance means in this context has been the subject of disagreement in the federal courts.the district courts that initially addressed this issue took the view that medical assistance means medical services,and held that states had a duty to ensure that eligible individuals received medical services with reasonable promptness.see,sobky smoley,a requires medical assistance under the plan to be furnished with reasonable promptness,and this can only mean medical services.
the initial courts of appeals to address this issue followed suit without much discussion.see doe chiles,cir following sobky bryson shumway,cir following doe.but in bruggeman blagojevich,cir,the seventh circuit offered an alternative interpretation.observing that medical assistance is defined in the statute as financial assistance,judge posner suggested that the state has no duty to ensure that individuals receive services,but only to provide reimbursement for their costs.id.at.this distinction,he noted,was missed in bryson shumway and doe chiles.id.
in westside mothers ii,this court followed judge posner dicta in bruggeman and rejected a suit by a class of children who argued that michigan was violating federal law by failing to provide or arrange for the provision of certain screening,diagnostic,and treatment services.at.observing that the medicaid act defined medical assistance as payment of part or all of the cost of care and services,a,we concluded the most reasonable interpretation of a is that all eligible individuals should have the opportunity to apply for medical assistance,financial assistance,and that such medical assistance,financial assistance,shall be provided to the individual with reasonable promptness.id.at.thus,we held that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim under either section a because they sought to compel the state to arrange for the provision of such services or provide them itself.id.
most recently,in mandy owens,cir,the tenth circuit applied our reasoning in westside mothers ii to a suit brought by a class of eligible individuals seeking services under a home and services waiver program the same program as here.explaining that medical assistance is defined as financial assistance,the mandy court held that the state duty was limited to pay ing promptly and evenhandedly for medical services when presented with the bill.id.at.thus,the class members failed to state a claim because they were on a waiting list for services,not payment.id.at.
we believe that the tenth circuit application of westside mothers ii in mandy accurately states the law of our circuit on a state obligations to provide medical assistance under the medicaid statute and applies with equal force to this case absent more,a waiting list for waiver services does not violate federal law because the state duty is to pay for services,not ensure they are provided.
federal rule of civil procedure b authorizes a court to grant relief from final judgment if applying it prospectively is no longer equitable.whether prospective enforcement is no longer equitable under rule b is a inquiry within the broad equitable powers of a district court.accordingly,we review a district court denial of a motion for relief from judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b for abuse of discretion.ford motor mustangs unlimited,cir.under this standard,we defer to the district court ringside view of the proceedings,including its understanding of the underlying complaint and the meaning and purpose of the settlement,and we will affirm absent a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.davis jellico cmty.hosp,cir citations omitted.
