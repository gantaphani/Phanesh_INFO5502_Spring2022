on august,the commissioner of the minnesota department of corrections department moved to terminate the decree pursuant to b.initially,the district court concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to terminate the decree and dismissed the motion without prejudice.we reversed that order and remanded the case on december.see hines anderson.cir.on november,the magistrate judge to whom the case was assigned issued a report and recommendation that the district court grant the department motion to terminate the decree.after reviewing their objections,the district court granted the inmates leave to engage in additional discovery for the purpose of presenting evidence of ongoing eighth amendment violations at the oak park heights facility.the order permitted the parties to take five depositions each and serve interrogatories.it further allowed the inmates to file unlimited pro se submissions until september,and to retain a medical expert whose expenses of up to would be paid by the defendants.
following discovery,both parties submitted supplemental memorandums and exhibits with respect to the motion to terminate the decree.the inmates filed the report prepared by their expert,and individual inmates filed numerous submissions regarding the alleged inadequacies of their medical care.in turn,the department submitted the medical records pertaining to those individuals.the matter was again submitted to the magistrate judge for review.
the claims in the inmates declarations typically described personal experience with deficient medical care as well as general complaints such as staff shortages,delays in receiving medication,and the unfairness of the for medical services.after evaluating the evidence,the magistrate judge submitted a report and recommendation detailing the procedural history of and the factual foundation for the parties respective positions.the report addressed each of the individual inmate declarations.we highlight a few of the individual submissions below.
inmate complains that he has a painful lump in his left breast he notified health services of the lump in early april and was not examined until may.health services ordered laboratory tests that revealed the lump was benign,but inmate was not notified of the cause of the lump or the outcome of the examination.in response to the inmate grievance,the department acknowledged that there was no indication that this information was conveyed to him.although the inmate wanted the lump removed,health services concluded that surgery was not appropriate.
inmate has a history of unstable mental health.on june,he cut his left arm with a staple and inserted an ink pen under the skin.after a nurse discovered this,she bandaged his arm and placed him on observation status.the following day,the inmate was taken to health services for and an examination by stephen craane.the inmate complains that craane did not immediately remove the pen and instead left it in place for more than two weeks.in his affidavit,craane states that the pen was not in contact with any nerves or blood vessels and that he chose to leave it in place after weighing the risks of bleeding and infection that might result from removing it.once the area became inflamed,craane conducted a surgical procedure to remove the pen.
inmate has a history of kidney failure and receives dialysis three days per week at the prison.he alleges that the nurses are inattentive,that a technician rather than a nurse performs the dialysis,that officials do not wash their hands prior to handling the equipment,that officials allow blood to clot in the dialysis machine,and that prison personnel do not properly clean spilled fluids.the department has since investigated the inmate concerns and the health services administrator has met with the dialysis service provider.the health services administrator now provides increased supervision and communication and maintains regular contact with the provider.
at least nine current inmates criticize the lack of care they are receiving for hepatitis c.in each of these cases,the inmate notes that he is not getting proper treatment for the disease.the department explained that it follows its hepatitis c treatment eligibility criteria and antiviral treatment guidelines.these guidelines require that certain criteria,such as significantly elevated liver function levels,must be met before health services provides treatment to those diagnosed with hepatitis because the inmates in question did not meet the standards set forth in the guidelines,the department did not provide treatment.
the report noted that the strongest comment offered by the expert is that he had found several examples of substandard care,but went on to find that the expert submission did not support the inmates argument that there were current and ongoing eighth amendment violations.additionally,the report found that the inmates declarations did not establish the existence of such violations.further,the report found that the record established through individual prisoner complaints does not represent evidence in support of ongoing violation s of eighth amendment rights to medical care with respect to medications,or treatment.finally,the report found that the decree was the antithesis of narrowly constructed,that it was broad and comprehensive,addressing concerns that are certainly related,but largely ancillary to core eighth amendment medical treatment issues.the report concluded by recommending that the decree be terminated.
after conducting a de novo review,the district court adopted the report and denied the inmates request for further discovery and an evidentiary hearing.it is from this judgment that the inmates now appeal.
