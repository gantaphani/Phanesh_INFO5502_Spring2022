petitioner ohio cast products,ohio cast contests citations issued to it by the secretary of labor secretary for failure to protect its workers against respirable dust containing crystalline quartz silica pursuant to c.ohio cast contends that the secretary method of calculating actual crystalline quartz silica exposure was an unreasonable interpretation of c and that it did not have fair notice of the secretary calculation method.the occupational safety and health review commission oshrc affirmed the citations,holding that the secretary method of calculating actual crystalline silica exposure was reasonable and that ohio cast did have fair notice of that method.we affirm.
background 
ohio cast is a manufacturer of iron automotive products in canton,ohio.as an employer engaged in a business affecting commerce,ohio cast is subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health act of,osh act.
in may,the secretary cited ohio cast for several alleged violations under the osh act.these violations were detected during a inspection of its facility by marc snitzer,a compliance officer with the occupational safety and health administration osha.ohio cast and osha subsequently entered into a settlement agreement on all matters except one.they continued to disagree about the correct method of calculating actual employee exposure to crystalline quartz silica respirable pursuant to c and,as a result,ohio cast contested citations received for crystalline quartz silica overexposure.
during the osha inspection,snitzer and william nixon,ohio cast industrial hygiene consultant and a former osha compliance officer,sampled the respirable dust around employee rick hill.ohio cast knew that hill work activities involved the use of sand containing silica,but it provided him with no respiratory protection.snitzer osha determined that hill was overexposed to crystalline quartz silica,while nixon ohio cast determined that he was not overexposed.air samples collected by osha and ohio cast differed slightly,but that difference did not explain their disagreement about whether ohio cast overexposed hill to silica pursuant to c.their difference of opinion about silica overexposure resulted from different methods of calculating hill actual exposure to silica.
arguing that its method of calculating actual worker exposure to crystalline quartz silica was the only reasonable one,ohio cast and the secretary each respectively filed for summary judgment before an administrative law judge alj.the alj,and then oshrc on review,granted summary judgment for the secretary.ohio cast was fined for failing to protect its workers against overexposure to respirable dust containing crystalline quartz silica.
ii.discussion 
ohio cast argues that the secretary interpretation of how actual workplace exposure to respirable silica is calculated under c is contrary to the plain language of that regulation,and that enforcement of that interpretation constitutes a denial of due process because it had no notice that osha would calculate silica exposure according to that interpretation.therefore,it argues that citations issued for hill overexposure to silica should be vacated.
no federal court has previously addressed whether the secretary method of calculating actual workplace exposure to crystalline quartz silica respirable,see c,table,is reasonable.in fact,there is no precedent regarding calculation of actual exposure for any of the regulated substances listed in table.we hold that the secretary method of calculating actual workplace exposure to silica under c,table derives from a reasonable interpretation of that regulation,that ohio cast had fair notice of how the secretary enforced that interpretation,and that the citations received by it for silica overexposure were valid.
i standard of review 
this court sets aside agency action that is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a reich general motors,cir.an administrative agency interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to substantial deference.see udall tallman,d.this court accords substantial deference to the secretary construction of an osha standard if it is ambiguous and the secretary interpretation of it is reasonable.see martin oshrc,d.the secretary interpretation need not be the only reasonable interpretation for it to be sustained.see fluor constructors,oshrc,cir.
but,where an alternative reading is compelled by the regulation plain language or by other indications of the secretary intent at the time of the regulation promulgation,this court need not defer to the secretary interpretation.see gardebring jenkins,d.when an agency promulgates regulations,it is bound by those regulations,and it may not attempt to subvert the rulemaking process through interpretation unsupported by the regulation language.see fluor,at.
ii silica standard 
because overexposure to silica can cause silicosis with permanent lung damage and disability,see urie thompson,workplace exposure to respirable silica is regulated.see c.in,the secretary adopted a workplace silica exposure standard as an established federal standard under section a of the osh act,a.section a exempted the secretary from making detailed factual findings and regulatory announcements supporting and explaining the silica standard.see osha,cir.the silica exposure limit adopted by the secretary derived from the walsh healey public contracts act,which required compliance with exposure levels developed by the american conference of governmental industrial hygienists.now codified at c,the crystalline quartz silica respirable standard provides that an employee exposure to respirable crystalline quartz silica,as listed in table,in any work shift of a week,shall not exceed the time weighted average limit given for that substance in the table.table contains a mathematical formula for calculating the permissible exposure limit pel for various mineral dusts,including crystalline quartz silica respirable.pel reflects the maximum amount of a contaminant in the air to which workers may be exposed over a given time period.
because of its manufacturing activities,ohio cast is clearly regulated under c.three calculations,based on a single sampling of respirable dust,determine whether a worker is overexposed to silica pursuant to c.first,the pel formula for crystalline quartz silica respirable,is employed to calculate a pel.see c,table.second,actual exposure is calculated.and,third,pel and actual exposure calculations are compared.when actual exposure exceeds pel,an employer is in violation of c.
a pel formula 
as expressed in table,the pels for crystalline quartz silica and for inert or nuisance dust are interrelated.the pel formula operates to regulate silica exposure by determining its concentration in respirable dust and setting variable limits on exposure to the respirable dust depending on its silica concentration.the numerator in the silica pel formula,represents the weight of the total respirable dust sample,and its denominator,represents the percentage of silica therein.where equals,representing dust with no quartz silica in it,the pel formula yields a pel of.a pel is the fixed pel listed in table for inert or nuisance dust,which demonstrates that the pel for silica works in harmony with the pel for inert dust.see id.where there is no silica detected in the air,the pel yielded should logically be and is equal to that allowed for inert dust.and,where equals,representing dust that is pure quartz silica,the pel formula yields a pel of.the only variable in the pel formula is sio,the percentage of the total respirable dust sample that is silica.
thus,the pel formula 
operate s in such a way as to create a sliding scale of pel depending on the percentage of the total respirable fraction of the dust that is crystalline quartz silica.in this way,the pel are lowered as the percentage of silica in the dust becomes higher.the upper limit of the sliding scale is the pel for inert or nuisance dust containing no quartz the lower limit is the pel for pure quartz dust.
