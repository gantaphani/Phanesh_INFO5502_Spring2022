plaintiff thomas klepsky claimed that he was terminated from defendant united parcel service ups in violation of the ohio whistleblower protection act and ohio public policy.the district court granted ups motion for summary judgment.we now affirm that decision for the following reasons.
the district court determined that the relevant facts were largely undisputed,and summarized them as follows 
the lawsuit stems from klepsky termination in january of.klepsky was hired by united parcel services,ups as a seasonal driver in.he began full time work in.as part of the employment application process,klepsky was required to undergo a department of transportation dot physical examination,and to fill out a medical history information form.the form expressly requires an applicant to list all medications including medications used regularly or recently.
klepsky had a past history of seizures and was,throughout his employment with ups,taking dilantin,an medication,on a daily basis.klepsky did not disclose either of these facts on his medical history information form.klepsky contends that during his original qualifying physical examination he told the doctor that he had suffered two seizures or years earlier.according to klepsky,because the seizures occurred more than six months ago,the doctor said do even open up a can of worms,and so he did not disclose the past seizures on his form.there is no evidence that klepsky advised the examining doctor that he was still taking dilantin on a daily basis.
the information forms specifically state that any deliberate false statement may be cause for disciplinary action up to and including termination.klepsky also signed forms noting that inaccurate,false or missing information may invalidate his medical certification.a person with a history of seizures who takes medication is not medically qualified to drive under dot regulations.b the advisory criteria to b.
ups became aware of klepsky daily use of dilantin in november of.the information was contained in records sent by klepsky doctor in connection with an unrelated medical leave of absence.klepsky contends that ups should have been aware of this information as early as august of because dilantin was listed as one of his medications in worker compensation records submitted to the company during that time frame.ups admits that this record was in its possession but contends that because it was submitted with a request for payment,the medications listed were not reviewed or noted.
after receiving notice of klepsky dilantin use,he was immediately advised that he could not drive,and ups requested that he submit additional information from his doctor.this information was received in late january of.upon review of the records,ups decided to terminate klepsky for dishonesty.he was discharged on january.
klepsky contends that he was fired in retaliation for various complaints he made against ups over the years.these complaints include reports made in spring of to the ohio state highway patrol and to the middleburg heights police alleging that a ups supervisor had forged his signature on a dot application for a triples permit card.klepsky also submitted several complaints internally at ups relating to allegations that equipment was faulty hazardous materials documents were in the wrong place in the trucks and trailers were not being loaded properly.there is no evidence of any such complaints being filed after fall of.more than a year and a half after the last recorded complaint,klepsky injured his rotator cuff and took a year long leave of absence which was covered by worker compensation.klepsky was fired a little over six months after he returned from his medical leave.
klepsky grieved his discharge to the union.the union state panel upheld his termination.
klepsky filed suit against ups in the cuyahoga county court of common pleas charging two counts.the first count alleged a violation of ohio whistleblower act,and.the second count alleges wrongful discharge in violation of ohio public policy.ups removed the case to this federal court,claiming that klepsky claims were preempted by the labor management relations act.
the district court granted ups motion for summary judgment,ruling that klepsky did not meet the requirements of the whistleblower protection act,and that he could not bring a cause of action under ohio public policy exception to the doctrine because he was a union member.klepsky now appeals from that judgment.
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,and must view the facts and any inferences that can be drawn from those facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.bennett city of eastpointe,cir citing matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
federal subject matter jurisdiction 
prior to oral argument,we asked the parties to be prepared to discuss the issue of federal subject matter jurisdiction.although neither party raised the issue in its briefs,subject matter jurisdiction may be raised sua sponte at any juncture because a federal court lacks authority to hear a case without subject matter jurisdiction.thornton southwest detroit,cir.klepsky claims do not raise a federal cause of action under,and neither party pled the presence of diversity jurisdiction under.instead,ups removed the case to federal court in reliance on section of the labor management relations act,alleging that the dispute required interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement cba to which klepsky was subject as a teamsters union member and a ups employee.klepsky filed a motion for remand,which was denied without an opinion by the district court.in its summary judgment opinion,the district court explained that ups removed the case to this federal court,claiming that klepsky claims were preempted by the labor management relations act,lmra.op.at.
under the complaint rule,the presence of federal jurisdiction turns on whether a plaintiff properly pleaded complaint presents a federal question on its face.smolarek chrysler,cir en banc.the possibility that federal law might be raised in defense is generally not enough to justify removal to federal court.id.thus,if a plaintiff chooses to only seek relief under causes of action,as klepsky has done here,he usually can intentionally avoid federal jurisdiction.id.an exception to this rule exists,however,where federal law completely preempts state law on the relevant subject matter,as the lmra does in cases that require interpretation of a cba.id.thus,removal to the district court was proper only if klepsky state law claims are indeed preempted by the lmra.
the supreme court has cautioned strongly against upholding removal jurisdiction based solely on the defendant interjection of a defense based on the cba 
a defendant can not,merely by injecting a federal question into an action that asserts what is plainly a claim,transform the action into one arising under federal law,thereby selecting the forum in which the claim shall be litigated.if a defendant could do so,the plaintiff would be master of nothing.
caterpillar,williams,d.as ups correctly noted in its notice of removal,a claim that requires interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement is completely preempted,and subject to removal to federal court under section.smolarek,at.but not every dispute tangentially involving a provision of a agreement,is preempted by.lingle norge div.of magic chef,d.in the context of tort claims that could potentially be preempted by the act,the proper focus is on whether the cause of action confers nonnegotiable rights on employers or employees independent of any right established by contract,or,instead,whether evaluation of the claim is inextricably intertwined with consideration of the terms of the labor contract.smolarek,at quoting lueck,d.
relying on supreme court precedent,this court has articulated a test in evaluating claims of complete preemption.we first look to whether resolving the claim would require interpretation of the terms of the collective bargaining agreement,and,alternatively,whether the rights claimed by the plaintiff were created by the collective bargaining agreement,or instead by state law.mattis
