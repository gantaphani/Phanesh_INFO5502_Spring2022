alice bias appeals from the order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of officer frank moynihan,police chief joseph kitchen,and the city of san leandro.she contends that the district court erred in concluding that she failed to demonstrate that there were genuine issues of facts in dispute regarding whether the appellees detained her for psychiatric evaluation without probable cause in violation of her federal and state law rights.bias also claims that the district court abused its discretion in its evidentiary and procedural rulings.we affirm because we conclude that probable cause existed to justify detaining her on two occasions,and the district court evidentiary and procedural rulings do not compel a reversal of the judgment.
the record shows that in may,bias was the plaintiff in a civil action before alameda county superior court judge kenneth burr.she wrote a letter dated may,to judge burr in which she stated if i lose this case,i shall kill myself.
on or about may,the alameda sheriff office requested that the san leandro police department contact bias.officer moynihan was dispatched to interview bias about her letter to judge burr.officer moynihan alleged in his declaration that when he asked bias if she was going to kill herself if she lost her case,she responded that she would do what she wanted to herself when her case was over.she appeared to be depressed and emotional.officer moynihan observed that bias did not have anyone in her home to watch her.officer moynihan became concerned that bias might hurt herself.bias testified during her deposition that she told the interviewing officer that she was very depressed and that she could not guarantee whether an arab terrorist might kill her.officer moynihan detained bias pursuant to california welfare and institutions code section he reported his observations in an application for emergency psychiatric detention and signed the report bias was transported to a psychiatric hospital and released later that same evening after being examined.
on may,officer moynihan was parked near a shopping center.bias approached officer moynihan as he sat in the driver seat of a marked police vehicle.she appeared to be extremely agitated.she asked officer moynihan to take a report about her neighbors.she reported that they were out to get her for disturbing a meeting and were plotting against her and mistreating her.officer moynihan spoke with bias neighbor who reported that bias constantly accused her of plotting to ruin bias life.
as officer moynihan questioned bias,she became increasingly agitated and visibly angry.officer moynihan asked her to calm down.instead,she began grabbing at him.officer moynihan stated in his declaration that at this point a bystander became alarmed.officer moynihan concluded that bias paranoid and angry behavior could escalate to the point that she would attempt to injure herself or harm others.as a result of these observations,officer moynihan determined that she should be evaluated by a mental health professional as being a danger to herself or others.as he filled out the application for emergency psychiatric detention,bias attempted to run away.
bias behavior caused officer moynihan to recall that he had been asked on or about may,to determine whether bias should be detained for medical evaluation for being a danger to herself or others because she had stated she would kill herself if judge burr ruled against her.based on bias behavior on may,and his earlier interactions with bias regarding her threat to commit suicide,officer moynihan again detained bias pursuant to section bias was examined at a psychiatric hospital and released later that same evening.
on november,bias filed a pro se complaint against appellees in alameda superior court.appellees removed the case to federal court.on june,bias filed an amended complaint in which she alleged violations of her federal constitutional rights pursuant to,and state law causes of action for assault and battery,false arrest,illegal imprisonment,intentional infliction of emotional distress,negligence,and racial discrimination pursuant to california civil code section.
on june,bias filed a motion to compel the deposition testimony of officer moynihan.on june,appellees filed a motion for summary judgment.bias filed an opposition to the motion for summary judgment without filing an affidavit,a declaration,a deposition,answers to interrogatories,or responses to requests for admissions showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial.in her opposition to summary judgment,bias objected to the admission of three exhibits the application for emergency psychiatric detention dated may,her medical records and her deposition testimony.on july,and,appellees filed notices of errata concerning two of the exhibits filed in support of appellees motion for summary judgment.on july and,bias filed two which the district court did not consider because she had filed them without prior approval from the district court as required by northern district of california civil local rule d.on july,the district court overruled bias objections to the three exhibits and granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees.
bias filed a timely notice of appeal we have jurisdiction to review the district court final order pursuant to.
bias contends that the district court erred in determining that officer moynihan was entitled to summary judgment based on the doctrine of qualified immunity with respect to her claim.she claims that there are genuine issues of material facts in dispute regarding whether officer moynihan had probable cause to detain her for a psychiatric evaluation on both may,and may.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we review de novo a district court decision to grant or deny summary judgment.prison legal news lehman,cir.we also review a grant or denial of qualified immunity de novo.id.
to evaluate whether officer moynihan has demonstrated that he is entitled to the defense of qualified immunity with regard to the claim,we must first determine whether there are genuine issues of material facts in dispute.if there are no disputed material facts,we must then determine if,based on the undisputed facts,in the light most favorable to bias,a reasonable officer could believe that he had probable cause to detain bias.see saucier katz,d a court required to rule upon the qualified immunity issue must consider,then,this threshold question taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right.
bias argues that officer moynihan was not the officer who detained her on may.she also argues that her statement that she would kill herself if she lost her case was hyperbole.regarding the may,incident,bias maintains that there are genuine issues of material facts in dispute as to whether officer moynihan twisted what she told him about people trying to get her.she also disputes officer moynihan statement regarding when she grabbed him.
summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in opposing summary judgment,a nonmoving party must go beyond the pleadings and,by her own affidavits,or by the depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.celotex catrett,d citing.e.
to avoid summary judgment,bias was required to present significant probative evidence tending to support her allegations.bus.am.philips,cir quoting first bank of cities serv,d.as noted above,bias failed to present any evidence to support her opposition to the appellees motion for summary judgment.
bias concedes that she did not present any evidence to the district court to support the claims in her amended complaint.appellant reply br.at.she maintains,however,that as a pro se litigant the district court should have searched the entire record to discover whether there was any evidence that supports her claims.we disagree.a district court does not have a duty to search for evidence that would create a factual dispute.see carmen unified sch,cir holding that it would be unfair to the district court to require it to search the entire record if a party fails to disclose where in the record the evidence for the factual claims can be found.a district court lacks the power to act as a party lawyer,even for pro se litigants.
the hazards which beset a layman when he seeks to represent himself are obvious.he who proceeds pro se with full knowledge and understanding of the risks does so with no greater rights than a litigant represented by a lawyer,and the trial court is under no obligation to become an advocate for or to assist and guide the pro se layman through the trial thicket.
jacobsen filler,cir quoting united states pinkey,cir.because bias failed to present any evidence in opposition to appellees motion for summary judgment,she has failed to demonstrate that there are any genuine issues of material facts in dispute.
bias argument that her statement i shall kill myself should be construed as hyperbole also lacks merit.in support of this contention,bias relies on cases where the statements at issue were political statements that implicated protected speech.see watts united states,d holding that the statement,if they ever make me carry a rifle the first man i want to get in my sights is,was political hyperbole when it was made at a public rally roy united states,cir per curiam holding that a marine statement i hear the president is coming to the base.i am going to get him constituted a threat given the context that it was common knowledge that president of united states was expected to arrive at the marine base.these cases are not dispositive because bias letter to judge burr does not implicate political speech.rather,bias wrote the letter to judge burr complaining that the counsel she retained was ineffectively litigating her case.she ended her letter by stating that if she lost the case,she would kill herself.a reasonable person would not construe this statement as hyperbole because nowhere in the letter does she claim that this statement was a joke or a figure of speech.see,lovell poway unified sch,cir holding that a reasonable person would construe a student statement to a guidance counselor,if you do give me this schedule change,i going to shoot you,as a true threat not entitled to first amendment protection.
bias contends that based on the undisputed facts in the record,officer moynihan is not entitled to qualified immunity from liability under because no reasonable officer could have believed that probable cause existed to detain her on may,or may,for psychiatric evaluation pursuant to section.in deciding whether defendants are entitled as a matter of law to qualified immunity,we must accept the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs and then determine whether,in light of clearly established principles governing the conduct in question,the officers objectively could have believed that their conduct was lawful.mena city of simi valley,cir.
in determining whether officer moynihan is entitled to qualified immunity,we must ask two questions was the law governing the officer conduct clearly established under that law,could a reasonable officer believe that the conduct was lawful case kitsap county sheriff dep t,cir quoting mena,at emphasis added see also anderson creighton,d holding that a law enforcement officer who participates in conduct that violates the fourth amendment may not be held personally liable if a reasonable officer could have believed that the conduct comported with the fourth amendment kennedy city of ridgefield,cir explaining that it may be difficult for a police officer to determine how to apply the relevant legal doctrine to the particular circumstances he or she faces if an officer makes a mistake in applying the relevant legal doctrine,he or she is not precluded from claiming qualified immunity so long as the mistake is reasonable.
only the second prong of the qualified immunity analysis is at issue in this matter.there is no dispute that bias constitutional right to be free from detention without probable cause was clearly established prior to.see maag wessler,cir although there are few decisions that discuss the fourth amendment standard in the context of seizure of the mentally ill,all have recognized the proposition that such a seizure is analogous to a criminal arrest and must therefore be supported by probable cause.

the undisputed facts demonstrate that a reasonable officer would have believed there was probable cause to detain bias on or about may.bias wrote a letter to judge burr stating that she would kill herself if the court ruled against her.when officer moynihan asked if she was going to hurt herself,she responded that she would do whatever she wanted.bias also stated that she feared that a terrorist was trying to kill her.officer moynihan also observed that bias appeared depressed and did not have family at home to watch her.it was not unreasonable for officer moynihan to conclude that bias might be a threat to herself or others due to a mental disorder.thus,he had probable cause to detain bias under section.
the undisputed facts also show that a reasonable officer would have believed there was probable cause to detain bias on may.bias told officer moynihan that her neighbors were out to get her.a neighbor reported to officer moynihan that bias was constantly accusing her of plotting to ruin bias life.bias became combative and began grabbing officer moynihan,which caused a bystander to become alarmed.during this encounter,officer moynihan observed that bias thoughts were disconnected and she was visibly angry and appeared agitated.officer moynihan recalled bias disturbing behavior on may.see triplett.at explaining that,in determining whether to detain an individual under section,the officer may take into account the past conduct,character,and reputation of the detainee.based on these observations and circumstances,it was not unreasonable for officer moynihan to conclude on may,that bias might be a threat to herself or to others due to a mental disorder.thus,he had probable cause to detain bias under section.
because the undisputed facts,taken in the light most favorable to bias,demonstrate that a reasonable officer could have concluded that detaining bias did not violate her federal constitutional rights,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on bias claim in favor of officer moynihan.see,case,at holding that officers were entitled to the defense of qualified immunity against a claim because a reasonable officer could have believed that arrest was constitutionally permissible.
bias also alleged officer moynihan was liable for assault and battery,false arrest,illegal imprisonment,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and racial discrimination under california law.she contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against her regarding these state law claims.
