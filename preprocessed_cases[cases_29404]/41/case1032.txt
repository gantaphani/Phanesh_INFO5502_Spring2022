plaintiff,perry elam,sued defendant,dhananjai menzies,on june,alleging negligence in a heart operation that menzies performed on elam on july.after removing this action to federal court under diversity jurisdiction,menzies sought summary judgment,arguing that kentucky one year statute of limitations for medical malpractice suits had run.the district court granted summary judgment for menzies.the key issue on appeal is when elam discovered his injury.we find that the record evidence of events and conversations following elam procedure creates a factual dispute as to when elam discovered that menzies may have injured him.because this dispute should be resolved by a jury,summary judgment was inappropriate.
summary of facts 
complaining of shortness of breath,chest pains,and extreme fatigue,in july of,plaintiff elam visited dhananjai menzies,a board certified,cardiac surgeon.after administering a stress test and cardiac catheterization,menzies discovered multiple lesions on elam left anterior descending artery.menzies presented elam with two options a stenting procedure or bypass surgery.he recommended the stenting procedure and elam agreed,expressing a reluctance to undergo an invasive bypass surgery operation.menzies informed elam that if the procedure was not successful he may have to undergo the bypass surgery.thereafter,menzies placed three stents in the affected artery.
initially,the procedure appeared to be a success.but in august of,elam visited menzies office complaining once again of chest pain.elam alleges that menzies said that it was probably scar tissue and stuff like that.elam continued to experience pain.because menzies had moved from kentucky to new york around this time,elam began seeing khaled selah.in october of,selah referred elam to larry breeding at central baptist hospital in lexington,kentucky.
on october,breeding performed a cardiac catheterization on elam.immediately following this elam was lying on a.breeding had a conversation with elam,his wife,and his son.the exact contents of the conversation are highly disputed.it is clear,however,that breeding advised elam to have bypass surgery.four days later,elam underwent quadruple bypass surgery.
some time following his surgery,elam saw television commercials that caused him to question whether there might have been problems with his stents.in late,he met with a lawyer.the lawyer received elam medical records and submitted them to an expert for review.
on june,eighteen months after his conversation with breeding immediately after the second catheterization,elam filed suit in kentucky state court alleging that menzies was negligent in the performance of his cardiac catheterization and the placement of stents.elam sought damages for medical expenses,loss of income and capacity,and pain and suffering.menzies removed the action to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.thereafter,menzies filed two motions for summary judgement.the district court granted summary judgement on the grounds that elam did not file suit within the kentucky statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims.elam petitioned the district court under federal rule of civil procedure e to alter,amend or vacate its previous grant of summary judgment.the district court denied this motion.we review both decisions of the district court de novo.city of wyandotte consol.rail,cir see also wilkins baptist healthcare,cir w hen a rule e motion seeks review of a grant of summary judgment we apply a de novo standard of review.
ii.analysis 
under kentucky law,an action against a physician or surgeon for negligence or malpractice must be commenced within one year after the cause of action accrued.ann.e.the cause of action shall be deemed to accrue at the time the injury is first discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered.ann.
the kentucky supreme court has explained this discovery rule t he statute begins to run on the date of the discovery of the injury,or from the date it should,in the exercise of ordinary care and diligence,have been discovered.wiseman alliant hospitals,citation omitted.the plaintiff must have a basis for a claim before the statute of limitations begins to run.id.the knowledge necessary to trigger the statute is one must know he has been wronged and by whom the wrong has been committed.id.although what the plaintiff actually knew often triggers discovery,the rule can also be satisfied by what the plaintiff should have known.see also davis all care medical,noting in dicta that the discovery rule uses a reasonably prudent person test.in constructing knowledge,however,a court must give special consideration to the patient perspective because o ne who possesses no medical knowledge should not be held responsible for discovering an injury based on the wrongful act of a physician.wiseman,at.elam filed his lawsuit on june,so if he discovered the injury before june,this action is barred.
in kentucky,when there is a disputed issue of fact as to when a plaintiff discovered or should have discovered his cause of action,that factual issue should be resolved by the jury in cases in which the plaintiff has asked for a jury.although the validity of the defense of statute of limitations is determined by the court as a matter of law,where there is a factual issue upon which the application of the statute depends,it is proper to submit the question to the jury.lynn mining kelly,see generally.prac.tort law.we note that,despite the parties stipulation that kentucky law governs,we have previously held that when a federal court sits in diversity,allocation of functions between judge and jury must be made by recourse to federal law.in re lewis,cir citing magenau aetna freight lines.federal law does not present a conflict with kentucky law.byrd blue ridge rural,an essential characteristic of the federal system is the manner in which,in civil actions,it distributes trial functions between judge and jury and,under the not the the seventh amendment,assigns the decisions of disputed questions of fact to the jury.see generally federal civil procedure.thus,both kentucky law and federal procedural law used in diversity cases specify that disputed issues of fact respecting the running of a statute of limitations should be resolved by a jury.
according to its opinion and order of march,the district court denial of elam rule e motion was based on elam knowing three facts before june,elam was aware that unsuccessful stent surgery would necessitate bypass surgery elam was informed by breeding that the stenting procedure may not have been properly performed elam saw advertisements on television pertaining to the harmful effects of stents used in his catheterization procedure 
a.the bypass surgery 
the district court based its decision in part on the fact that elam was aware that an unsuccessful stenting procedure by menzies would necessitate bypass surgery.this was error because there is evidence in the record that elam may have required a bypass even if there had been a successful stenting procedure.as elam understood it,the stents were a first attempt to fix the blockages in his coronary arteries o ften the patient can not know whether the undesirable outcome is simply an unfortunate result of proficient medical care or whether it is the consequence of substandard treatment.harrison valentine.the necessity of the bypass surgery does not,in itself,demonstrate that elam discovered or should have discovered menzies potential malpractice.
b.the conversation with breeding 
the district court primarily relied on the october,conversation with breeding.whether that conversation should have enabled elam to discover menzies potential malpractice is disputed.we note at the outset that while there is nothing in the record demonstrating that elam was impaired during this conversation,the the patient still lying on the gurney immediately following local anesthesia and a cardiac certainly less than an ideal setting for the brain to fully comprehend important medical and legal information.
elam recollection of the conversation with breeding contains statements from which a reasonable juror could find that elam should have discovered menzies potential malpractice.elam stated,i just remember that he told me that some stents were placed in a place that should sic have been placed.and that was the result,that i was going to have open heart surgery.when asked if he understood breeding to be critical of what menzies had done with the stents,elam responded,he seemed to be,a little bit but he did throw nobody under the bus whatsoever.elam dep.
on the other hand,elam recollection also contains several statements from which a juror could find that elam should not have discovered menzies potential malpractice because he reasonably believed that he needed open heart surgery because the stents had become obstructed by blockage through no fault of menzies.asked if he had formed a belief that his problems were related to something that menzies had done,elam replied no,i did form a belief at all.my wife and i talked to it in detail,you know,about that i could have had more blockage.and we did have a clue,you know,what was going on.when asked to clarify if he understood the stents to be in the wrong place,elam replied,well,he said they were ca the main artery comes down,and then he said when you got two vessels going together,that you ca place two stents together,some way or another.he used medical terms,and i did understand all the medical terms or whatever,you know.when asked directly if he suspected that menzies may have done something wrong in caring for him,elam responded,i did never suspect.i told you that i thought the world of menzies.
the recollections of two eyewitnesses to the wife and compound the dispute.elam son,wesley,stated,i wanting to say that he said that the stent was placed in the wrong place to start with,that was what would cause this blockage to occur.wesley elam dep.elam wife,randi,on the other hand,was not sure if breeding was saying that the stents were contributing to the problem or taking,had not taken care of the problem.randi elam dep.
menzies counsel elected not to depose breeding,so we do not have the benefit of his recollection of the conversation while either party could have taken this deposition,it was particularly incumbent upon the party asserting the do so.the absence of this crucial testimony raises an inference that breeding testimony would have been harmful to menzies.some precedent exists suggesting that no adverse inference may be drawn from the failure to depose a witness who was equally available to both parties.see,whitcomb whitcomb.but a witness is not considered equally available if,as in this case,the witness has special knowledge of relevant facts for the party with the burden of proof.see welch cooke chevrolet,d,presumption adverse to party with burden of proof when neither party produced who was only witness to fire see also kostelec state farm fire and cas.co,cir noting that federal courts have softened the definition of equal availability.
furthermore,the more logical view is that the failure to produce is open to an inference against both parties,the particular strength of the inference against each depending on the circumstances.wigmore,evidence chadbourn,emphasis in original cited favorably in dicta in tyler white,cir.because we must draw all inferences in favor of elam,and because menzies has the burden of proof to show that breeding comments triggered the discovery rule,we may draw an inference that breeding testimony would have been adverse to menzies.see also welsh,cir,overruled on other grounds by adkins wolever,cir recognizing that the drawing of inferences adverse to the defendant based on defendant failure to produce evidence that was within its control finds general support in kentucky case law mccormick on evidence ed.when it would be natural under the circumstances for a party to call a particular witness and the party fails to do so,tradition has allowed the adversary to use this failure as the basis for invoking an adverse inference.
neither of the two cases most extensively briefed by the parties is particularly helpful in determining when a factual dispute is significant enough to bar summary judgment in kentucky.in wiseman,supra,relied on by elam,the court found the plaintiff claim against a doctor who left a surgical instrument inside of her was not time barred.in that case,however,the patient doctors misdiagnosed her pain as the result of a broken tail bone,delaying her discovery of the instrument.at.there was no disputed conversation in wiseman analogous to the one that took place between elam and breeding.in vannoy milum,relied on by menzies and the district court,it was undisputed that the patient was aware that the source of his injury was related to his antibiotic therapy.at.hence,vannoy is not instructive when,as in the present case,it is disputed when the patient became aware that he had an injury.
a recent,unpublished decision from the court of appeals of kentucky is much more informative as to how a kentucky court conducts discovery rule analysis at the summary judgment phase in van landingham georgia pacific,wl,a subcontractor filed suit against his former employer after discovering benign plaques caused by asbestos on his lungs.the defendant argued that the statute of limitations barred the suit.there was significant evidence in the record that the plaintiff knew his plaques had been caused by asbestos more a than a year before he filed suit when,during a coronary artery bypass graft,the plaintiff surgeon noticed the plaques.not only did the surgeon testify that it was normal practice for him to tell patients that such plaques were likely caused by asbestos,but his primary physician found a notation in his records questioning whether asbestosis had been found during the heart surgery.the primary physician testified that he would not have made such a notation had it not been provided by the surgeon or the plaintiff.notwithstanding,the court found that a factual dispute existed as to what the subcontractor knew at the time the plaques were removed and what exactly his doctors told him.the court emphasized that it was required to resolve all factual inferences in favor of the subcontractor and that the record did not definitively show that the plaintiff knew of his injury.the court reversed summary judgment and found the dispute proper to send to a jury.id.at.
the defendant in van landingham presented far more evidence that the plaintiff should have known of his injury than menzies has proffered here.furthermore,the defendant in van landingham lacked any that of elam corroborate his description of his state of mind,and his defense was not missing the deposition of a key witness.hence,while not binding,van landingham reinforces our confidence that a kentucky court would find a factual dispute as to when elam discovered his injury.
the driving force of our decision is the summary judgment standard,which requires us to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of elam.taking into account the reasonable inferences that elam believed he needed open heart surgery because the stents had become obstructed,the conflicting testimony of elam son and wife,and the absence of breeding testimony,we find the record sufficient to call into question whether elam should have known he had a claim against menzies.therefore,the application of the discovery rule turns on a factual dispute,and it is proper to submit the question to a jury.
c.the television advertisements 
at some point after his bypass surgery,elam saw television advertisements pertaining to the possible harmful effects of stents and advising that individuals who had certain types of stents may have a legal claim.in its march order,the district court cited the television advertisements as a relevant factor for finding that the statute of limitations had run.in its original dismissal of elam claim,however,the district court did not analyze the effect of television ads on elam state of mind or on the statute of limitations.it does not seem likely that this was a particularly weighty factor for the district court,so we will mention only three reasons why we accord these television commercials little or no weight.
first,television potentially be trusted.typically the information contained therein seeks to persuade the viewer to purchase a product or service.we hesitate to find that the viewing of a television commercial was sufficient to trigger any discovery rule.neither menzies nor the district court points to any case law to support such a finding,and we are disinclined to do so in this case.we have not been able to view the commercial in question because it is not part of the record.
second,elam claimed that the television ads concerned possible malfunctions in medicated stents.it does not follow that the ads alerted elam to a potential medical malpractice claim.at most,the ads arguably informed elam of a potential products liability action against the manufacturer of his stents.in no way did the described in the elam that menzies negligently placed his stents.
finally,it simply is not clear when elam actually saw the advertisements drawing inferences in favor of elam,he did not see the advertisements before june,and they can not have triggered the statute of limitations early enough to his suit.
given elam lack of medical knowledge,the trust and confidence inherent in the relationship,the unreliability of television advertisements,the content of the commercials,and the uncertain date at which elam first viewed them,it is inappropriate to speculate that elam knew or should have known of menzies potential malpractice from these television advertisements.
cumulative effect 
we have rejected each of the three factors the district court cited as bypass surgery,the conversation with breeding,and the television commercials.we also reject any argument that their cumulative effect was sufficient to trigger the discovery rule.each individual factor is sufficiently weak such that their totality does not alter our analysis.moreover,the bypass surgery and breeding comments are sufficiently interconnected that the same inferences prevent them from warranting summary judgment,whether considered separately or together.
our dissenting colleague basically argues that the one statement that elam quotes breeding as saying i just remember that he told me that some stents were placed in a place that should have been placed starts the running of the statute of limitation and that nothing else is really significant.the kentucky supreme court,however,says that one must know he has been wronged,and this knowledge should not be presumed,as the dissent argues,by o ne who possesses no medical knowledge.wiseman,supra,at.in light of elam repeated testimony that he did not think he had been wronged,a jury should decide when the statute begins to run in accordance with kentucky law and the seventh amendment requiring a jury trial in civil cases at law.
iii.conclusion 
in light of the differences in testimony between elam,his wife,and his son,the absence of breeding testimony,and the various inferences that a factfinder might make as to elam knowledge and state of mind,we find there is a factual dispute as to whether elam knew or should have known he had a claim after the conversation with breeding.this issue should,therefore,be referred to the jury.we,therefore,reverse the district court,vacate the summary judgment order,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i write separately because i believe that it is undisputed,from elam own deposition,that breeding provided elam with information from which elam should have discovered menzies potential malpractice.since i believe that the relevant content of these statements is not actually in dispute,and that these statements were sufficient to trigger the statute of limitations,i would find that there is no factual dispute and that summary judgment was appropriate,and i would affirm the district court decision.
initially,i agree with the majority that kentucky discovery statute applies,and that it can be triggered either by what the plaintiff subjectively knew importantly in this what the plaintiff objectively should have discovered.ann.wiseman alliant,s,noting that the knowledge necessary to trigger the statute is one must know he has been wronged and,by whom the wrong has been committed.furthermore,i agree that where there is an issue of disputed fact as to when the plaintiff discovered or should have discovered his cause of action,that factual issue should be resolved by the jury.lynn.min.kelly,see also.c.however,w here the pertinent facts are not in dispute,the validity of the defense of the statute of limitations can and should be determined by the court as a matter of law.lynn,at emphasis added.
here,applying the objective standard required by kentucky discovery statute,the facts show that summary judgment should be granted as a matter of law.initially,the majority acknowledges that elam recollection of the conversation with breeding contains statements from which a reasonable juror could find that elam should have discovered menzies potential malpractice.majority op.at.the majority opinion then goes on to quote from elam deposition,which provides what i believe to be the critical statement by breeding 
do you remember what you were told about the results of the cardic cath 
a.the results of the cath i just remember that he told me that some stents were placed in a place that should sic have been placed.and that was the result,that i was going to have to have open heart surgery.
all right.who told you that 
elam dep.emphasis added.this statement clearly shows that elam recollected that breeding,a medical expert,informed him that the stents,which elam knew had been inserted by menzies,had been improperly placed.as a result,he was going to have to have bypass surgery.the language elam recollected breeding using was simple and unambiguous,and breeding clearly found fault with the procedure that menzies had undertaken.at this point,regardless of what he subjectively understood,elam should have discovered menzies potential malpractice,which triggered the kentucky discovery statute.
confronted with this unambiguous language,the majority seeks to create a factual dispute by pointing to three other statements in elam deposition however,none of these statements undermine what elam should have discovered after hearing breeding clear comments,and since kentucky applies an objective,not just a subjective,standard,what elam should have discovered is the critical inquiry.in the first statement,elam was asked,d id you form a belief that your problems that you started experiencing in august were related to something that menzies had done,or not done,in his care of you,to which he replied no,i did form a belief at all.my wife and i talked to it in detail,you known,about that i could have had more blockage.and we did have a clue,you known,what was going on.elam dep.in the second statement,elam was asked if,a round the time that you had your bypass surgery,did you suspect that menzies may have done something wrong in how he cared for you in july and august,to which he replied i did never suspect.i told you that i thought the world of menzies.elam dep.clearly,both of these statements go to elam subjective beliefs,to what he personally believed about menzies and,in particular,to whether he subjectively believed that menzies committed malpractice.however,the kentucky discovery statute can be triggered by what elam should have discovered,not simply by what he subjectively believed.here,breeding comments,as recollected by elam,clearly informed elam that breeding,an expert,believed that the stents had been incorrectly placed.after hearing these comments,elam should have discovered menzies potential malpractice.
furthermore,the majority also points to a third statement,in which elam was asked,i thought you said something,like,the stents had been put in the wrong place,to which he replied 
well,breeding said they were ca the main artery comes down,and then he said when you got two vessels going together,that you ca place two stents together,some way or another.he used medical terms,and i did understand all the medical terms or whatever,you know.
okay.did you understand this physician to be critical of what menzies had done with the sten
