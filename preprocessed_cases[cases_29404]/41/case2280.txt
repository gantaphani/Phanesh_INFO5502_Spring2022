roy allen is a nevada state prisoner who has sued prison officials claiming they denied him accommodation and treatment for his mental illness.the district court dismissed the suit pursuant to the prison litigation reform act plra,as amended,et,for failure to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing suit.appealed.we have jurisdiction under.
to resolve this appeal,we must decide whether the plra requires prisoners to exhaust available administrative remedies before bringing claims under the americans with disabilities act ada and the rehabilitation act.we hold that it does and therefore affirm the district court.
is a prisoner at lovelock correctional center,a nevada department of corrections ndoc prison.he has a history of mental illness,brain damage,and organic personality disorder,which in the past have required medical treatment.
on november,filed a complaint with the department of justice doj alleging ada and rehabilitation act violations based on the prison alleged failure to provide adequate treatment for his mental disability.the complaint was filed on a form entitled title ii of the americans with disabilities of the rehabilitation act of complaint form.the doj sought and received authorization from to investigate these complaints.it is unclear from the record whether the doj took any further action.
after filing his complaint with the doj,filed a pro se complaint in federal district court against the nevada department of corrections and several other defendants collectively defendants on january.he used a form,captioned civil rights complaint pursuant to.he identified his single cause of action under count one as americans with disabilities act,usc et,and rehabilitation act usc et the complaint does not include a cause of action under.under the jurisdiction paragraph he again identified these statutes and added not a civil rights action except as may be covered in the above statutes.
filed an amended complaint on january,again on ndoc complaint form.instead of leaving the default jurisdictional statement under,wrote different rehab act title et,and americans with disabilities act,title,et.as with the original complaint,listed only causes of action under the ada and rehabilitation act.the district court sua sponte dismissed the amended complaint with leave to amend pursuant to,holding that had failed to plead his causes of action sufficiently.
on january,filed a second amended complaint,which is the operative complaint in this appeal.the second amended complaint,like the two prior complaints,used the form complaint.as with the first two complaints,invoked federal jurisdiction based on the ada and rehabilitation act,instead of on.he did not mention.the second amended complaint alleged that was denied participation in services,benefits,and programs solely on the basis of his disability and that he had been denied accommodations for his disability in violation of these statutes.attached his doj act complaint form to the second amended complaint.he also indicated that he had not exhausted the ndoc grievance procedures,stating grievance not applicable to ada rehab act and is not required under these acts.
defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint on several grounds,including failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.in response,argued that exhaustion was not required because prisoners bringing suit under the ada do not have to exhaust prison remedies,and the ndoc own administrative grievance process,administrative regulation,prohibits grievances pertaining to federal law.he also argued that if there were a federal exhaustion requirement,he met it by filing his complaint with the doj.
in her recommendation to the district court on november,the magistrate judge determined that had filed his suit under and had failed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit,as required by the plra.on march,the magistrate judge also determined,after an evidentiary hearing on the issue,that had failed to file ndoc grievances related to mental health treatment.
the district court adopted the magistrate recommendation on march.the district court noted argument that he exhausted his mental health treatment claims after he filed his lawsuit,but held that was required to file a new action to reflect this exhaustion.accordingly,the district court dismissed suit without prejudice.filed a timely notice of appeal.
dismissals based on a prisoner failure to exhaust remedies are reviewed de novo factual findings are reviewed for clear error.see wyatt terhune,cir.in ruling on a dismissal motion,a court may look beyond the pleadings and decide disputed issues of fact.if the district court concludes that the prisoner has not exhausted nonjudicial remedies,the proper remedy is dismissal of the claim without prejudice.id.at internal citation omitted.we may affirm on any ground present in the record.see sherman harbin in re harbin,cir.
key argument is that the plra does not require exhaustion of claims arising under the ada or rehabilitation act claims that the district court erred in characterizing his second amended complaint as bringing claims,rather than ada and rehabilitation act claims,and then compounded this error by dismissing his claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.as explained below,we agree that pleaded claims under the ada and rehabilitation act rather than under,but conclude that the plra requires administrative exhaustion of ada and rehabilitation act claims.
the district court mischaracterized complaint as arising under.complaint clearly pleaded ada and rehabilitation act statutory violations.as discussed above,each of complaints stated that his claims were brought under the ada and rehabilitation act and that he was not filing a civil rights complaint.
further,the factual assertions in the second amended complaint are directly related to establishing elements in his ada and rehabilitation act causes of action.in order to state a claim under title ii of the ada,a plaintiff must allege 
he is an individual with a disability he is otherwise qualified to participate in or receive the benefit of some public entity services,programs,or activities he was either excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of the public entity services,programs,or activities,or was otherwise discriminated against by the public entity and such exclusion,denial of benefits,or discrimination was by reason of his disability.
mcgary city of portland,cir quoting thompson davis,cir per curiam.similarly,to state a claim under the rehabilitation act,a plaintiff must allege he is an individual with a disability he is otherwise qualified to receive the benefit he was denied the benefits of the program solely by reason of his disability and the program receives federal financial assistance.duvall county of kitsap,cir.
in his second amended complaint,alleged that he was an individual with a mental health disability,he was qualified to receive the mental health services provided by ndoc,he was denied the benefits of the program solely on the basis of his mental illness,and ndoc received federal financial assistance.conversely,the only indication that intended to file a claim is the caption on the form which claims the ndoc required him to use.notably,complaint does not allege that defendants deprived him of a constitutional right while acting under color of state law,a necessary element of a claim.see crumpton gates,cir.as we held in bogovich sandoval,when a prisoner complaint asserts only,and details facts related to,potential ada violations,the district court errs in characterizing the suit as a claim,cir.
defendants argue that we should construe the complaint as arising under because can more readily obtain his desired remedies under than under the ada and rehabilitation act.but courts should not undertake to infer in one cause of action when a complaint clearly states a claim under a different cause of action.t he party who brings a suit is master to decide what law he will rely upon.id.quoting caterpillar williams,d.
having determined that pleaded causes of action under the ada and rehabilitation act rather than,we turn to
