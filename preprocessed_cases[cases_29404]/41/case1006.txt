mary buchanan sued wyeth,a corporation,wyeth pharmaceuticals,an unincorporated division of wyeth,and laboratories company and wyeth pharmaceuticals,subsidiaries of wyeth,regarding a diet pill,redux,that the companies manufactured and sold.buchanan claims sound primarily in strict liability and common law negligence.buchanan appeals the district court entry of summary judgment for wyeth on all of her claims.relatedly,buchanan requests a finding that the district court abused its discretion in denying her motion to alter and amend judgment and that the final judgment be reversed.
for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court finding that approval of redux by the food and drug administration fda preempted buchanan negligence claims taking issue with wyeth actions before fda approval,as well as the district court related dismissal of buchanan request for punitive damages,and remand those issues back to the district court.we affirm the judgment of the district court on all other claims.
buchanan alleged that she was prescribed and that she ingested redux for several months during and in order to control her weight.after her november diagnosis with primary pulmonary hypertension she filed a complaint against wyeth in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio on october.she died december,allegedly as a result of having taken redux.
wyeth marketed and sold redux after its approval by the fda in april.redux became available in june and was taken off the market on september.while wyeth sold redux to the public,it provided several warnings regarding the health risks associated with ingesting redux.in april,wyeth sent health professionals a letter stating that a small risk of a serious,potentially cardiovascular condition,primary pulmonary hypertension pph was associated with the use of all types of prescription weight loss drugs.this risk is about cases per users per year.on the first redux label,the warning about pph was written in all bold typeface and contained the information above.
wyeth provided a second warning letter to physicians in august,which explained that a final report of clinical studies indicated that the risk of pph was greater than previously stated and that the risk of pph is calculated to be about times higher for patients using anorexigens for three or more months compared to.it further warned that pph is a serious disorder with an estimated mortality rate of and warned doctors that patients experiencing symptoms should immediately discontinue their use of redux.
new labels were sent to professionals in december along with a third letter reporting changes made to the label.the letter stated that redux increase s the risk of developing primary pulminory hypertension,an often fatal disorder.the new labels provided updated information regarding the increased risk of pph reflected by new studies in boldface capitalized letters.
buchanan amended complaint,filed on january,stated claims for strict product liability encompassing both design defect pursuant to and failure to warn pursuant to negligence and wrongful death pursuant to,et.buchanan also sought economic,and punitive damages pursuant to c.she later withdrew her claims for failure to warn,pursuing only a strict product liability design defect claim,negligence claims,and punitive damages.
wyeth filed three separate motions for partial summary judgment on september,one based on federal preemption one arguing lack of evidence of proximate causation and one related to punitive damages.oral arguments were held on january.
on february,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of wyeth on all claims.longs wyeth longs i,d.the court found that buchanan strict liability and negligence claims relating to wyeth conduct prior to the fda approval of redux for placement on the market were preempted by the fda subsequent approval of the drug and that any claims,which were not preempted,failed on their merits.as relevant to this appeal,the court further held that buchanan strict liability design defect claim failed because buchanan failed to provide evidence refuting wyeth showing that the redux warnings were adequate as a matter of law buchanan negligence claims failed because buchanan did not provide evidence of proximate causation and the request for punitive damages was moot because,as a result of the dismissal of all of the substantive claims,buchanan could not establish liability under any theory for which she could be entitled to any damages,much less punitive damages.as a result of these holdings,the district court dismissed the case.
on march,buchanan moved to vacate the order and judgment and to alter the judgment.buchanan argued that her claims were not preempted in light of the supreme court intervening decision in wyeth levine.wyeth bore the burden of proving that its warnings were adequate rather than buchanan bearing the burden of proving the warnings inadequate wyeth did not properly raise the argument that buchanan lacked evidence showing the inadequacy of wyeth warnings with regard to buchanan design defect claim and wyeth did not properly raise the issue that buchanan lacked evidence of proximate causation in regard to her negligence claim.the court denied buchanan motion on march.longs wyeth longs ii,d.buchanan timely appealed.
buchanan appeals the district court summary judgment order as well as the order denying her motion to vacate and alter judgment.

in ohio,three basic theories of liability exist under which a claimant may assert a product liability action under the ohio product liability act negligence and breach of warranty.christopher ernst,et,baldwin ohio practice,ohio tort law.we will address buchanan design defect claim under the ohio product liability act and her common law theories of negligence first,and then address the district court preemption ruling.
strict liability claims 
strict liability for manufacturers and suppliers is codified by the ohio products liability act,effective january.recent amendments to the act provide that the legislature intended the act to abrogate all common law product liability causes of action.see b,effective april.buchanan initially brought strict liability claims for design defect and failure to warn,though she subsequently dropped the claim.but,dropping the claim did not render the warnings irrelevant.
according to ohio law,so long as adequate warning has been provided for a pharmaceutical product,then the manufacturer can not be strictly liable for design defect under ohio law,regardless of whether there is a causal connection between the plaintiff use of the drug and the plaintiff injury or whether the product was unavoidably dangerous.frey novartis pharm,d,citing seley searle.this is because the common law learned intermediary doctrine is codified in the act 
an ethical drug is not defective due to inadequate warning or instruction if its manufacturer provides otherwise adequate warning and instruction to the physician or other legally authorized person who prescribes or dispenses that ethical drug for a claimant in question and if the federal food and drug administration has not provided that warning or instruction relative to that ethical drug is to be given directly to the ultimate user of it.
c see also meridia prods.liab.litig.abbott,cir explaining that,in a case involving a drug prescribed by a physician,the learned intermediary doctrine provides that the adequacy of a product warning is based on whether the doctor,rather than the patient,would reasonably understand the risks.
the parties disagree as to which party carries the burden of proof regarding the adequacy of warnings in a design defect claim under d.buchanan contends that,as is the case under the common law,adequacy of warning is an affirmative defense on which the defendant carries the initial burden of proof and the plaintiff carries only a burden to produce rebutting evidence.wyeth,on the other hand,claims that the text of section d makes the inadequacy of warnings an element of the prima facie claim for design defect,so the plaintiff carries the initial burden of proof and the defendant carries only a burden to produce rebutting evidence.after considering the authorities,the district court found that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving inadequate warnings in a design defect claim under the ohio products liability act.longs i,d at.we need not pass this question as,regardless of whether buchanan or wyeth carries an affirmative burden of proof or merely a burden of producing rebutting evidence on the question of warning adequacy,wyeth has met its burden and buchanan has not.
wyeth contended at summary judgment that buchanan strict liability design defect claim failed because wyeth had provided adequate warnings to buchanan physician about the risks of redux as information became available,thus qualifying for protection under d codification of the learned intermediary doctrine.wyeth submitted voluminous evidence in support of this argument with its motion for summary judgment.wyeth presented substantial evidence that it had distributed information regarding risks to doctors,including buchanan physician,and that those warnings were adequate to inform a physician of the known risks associated with redux.
in response,buchanan did not specifically point to any evidence in the record that would contradict wyeth evidence,such as expert reports opining that the warnings were inadequate to inform a physician of the true risks of the drug.as the district court summarized,and as is supported by the record,buchanan did not put forward any evidence that defendants did not take appropriate steps in providing adequate warnings about redux,that defendants should have taken redux off the market sooner,or that defendants alleged failure to take redux off the market sooner proximately caused buchanan injury death.id.at.instead,buchanan argued the law,insisting that adequacy of warning was a jury question because wyeth bore the burden of proof on the issue.
but this argument misses the point as,even if buchanan is correct and adequacy of warnings is an affirmative defense for which wyeth bears the initial and ultimate burden,summary judgment is available on affirmative defenses,thornton fed.express,cir.thus,even under buchanan interpretation of section d,wyeth met its burden at summary judgment of providing evidence that its warnings were adequate,at which point it became buchanan burden to point to evidence creating a genuine issue of fact as to the adequacy of the warnings.for whatever reason,buchanan did not point to any such evidence when responding to a summary judgment motion with legal argument instead of factual rebuttal,a litigant takes the risk that she is wrong on the law,leaving her with no factual safety net.because she failed to point to any evidence creating a factual dispute as to the adequacy of warning,the strict liability design defect claim under the ohio products liability act fails as a matter of law.thus,it was proper to grant wyeth motion for summary judgment on this claim.
negligence claims 
because buchanan dismissed her claims and can not show that wyeth is strictly liable for defective design under the act,her only remaining claims are for negligence and for punitive damages.
state law abrogation 
we first address whether buchanan may bring her claims under common law negligence theories at all or whether ohio has abrogated by statute all common law products liability claims.the ohio products liability act defines a statutory product liability claim.m.in addressing whether passage of the act abrogated common law negligence claims,the ohio supreme court in carrel allied prod,ohio,held that in the absence of language clearly showing the intention to supersede the common law,the existing common law is not affected by the statute and that,therefore,the statute did not abolish actions sounding in negligence.id.at.in an amendment to the act effective april,however,the ohio general assembly explicitly eliminated all common law product liability claims or causes of action.b.buchanan claims were brought prior to the passage of this amendment,so her common law negligence claims would be abrogated only if the amendment applied retroactively.see miles raymond,d.
since the amendment came into effect,at least three decisions of the ohio court of appeals have held that the amendment is not retroactive,meaning that buchanan claims would not be abrogated.see doty fellhauer,ohio luthman minster supply,wl,at ohio,unpublished hertzfeld hayward pool,no,wl,at ohio,unpublished all holding that the amendments applied only prospectively and did not apply retroactively.the doty court also noted that rules dictate that a statute is presumed to be prospective and that,although the amendment clearly states the intent to abrogate all claims,it does not provide that causes of action accruing prior to the effective date would be subject to the amendment.doty,n.at.the court therefore held that the amendment did not apply retroactively.id.
buchanan filed her original complaint in,well after the act was enacted but before the amendment expressly abrogated all common law product liability claims.thus,her negligence claims survive the enactment of the ohio products liability act and the amendment and are not abrogated 
merits of the negligence claim 
the nature of buchanan negligence claim is unclear.her amended complaint states that wyeth had a duty 
to manufacture,promote,and sell only safe drugs,and the duty to investigate and disclose material facts about risks associated with their drugs.defendants breached their duty by putting redux on the market in,when defendants knew the active ingredient in th is drug,namely,dexfenfluramine,was unreasonably dangerous.defendants further breached their duty by failing to update the drug labels,failing to adequately monitor the effects of the drug,failing to make timely warning to the medical profession,failing to timely and accurately report to the fda all adverse drug experience information obtained,and concealing and misrepresenting the results of studies to physicians and to the public.
longs i.at reproducing buchanan amended complaint verbatim.the district court noted that at oral argument buchanan characterized her negligence claim as attacking wyeth alleged failure to investigate,prior to fda approval,the early warning signs that led to the drug being taken off the market and wyeth failure to take the drug off the market sooner.id.at.we take this to mean that buchanan negligence claims may be divided into two general categories claims regarding wyeth acts and omissions,prior to the fda approval,in bringing the drug to market and claims regarding wyeth acts and omissions subsequent to the fda approval of redux.
we will address the negligence claims first.as characterized by buchanan and the district court,the negligence claims are either a general negligence claim or a design defect claim.whatever the label,the claim focuses on wyeth actions after the drug went to market,primarily wyeth failure to take the drug off of the market sooner.wyeth moved for summary judgment on the basis that buchanan could not show that wyeth actions or omissions after fda approval caused any of her injuries.specifically,wyeth contended that it had updated its warnings about the risks of redux as information became available and that it removed redux from the market as soon as it became aware of the extent of the risk,and it submitted a substantial amount of evidence in support of this position.
but,just as she did with regard to wyeth request for summary judgment on the strict liability design defect claim,buchanan did not highlight any evidence in the record that would contradict the evidence submitted by wyeth.instead,buchanan again argued the law,insisting that the warnings were irrelevant because wyeth should have known that the drug was so dangerous that no warning could make the drug acceptable.critically,buchanan did not point to any facts or evidence in the record that would reveal why wyeth should have known any of this.the district court found that buchanan failed to present evidence demonstrating proximate cause between wyeth alleged negligence after the fda approved redux and buchanan injury or death sufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment.we agree,for principally the same reasons as we agreed that summary judgment was proper on the strict liability design defect claim.when buchanan failed to point to any actual evidence in a particularized manner,she failed to meet her burden under rule.accordingly,we affirm the entry of summary judgment for wyeth on the negligence claims.
federal preemption 
however,buchanan failure to provide evidence of proximate causation for negligence occurring after the distribution of redux does not dispose of her claims that wyeth was negligent for bringing redux to market at all.doctor notification of potential harms necessarily does not factor into a claim of negligence for bringing a drug to market in the first place buchanan argues 
the theory of causation supporting the remaining negligent introduction and failure to withdraw theories set forth in count ii was completely different.had defendants heeded the persistent and near unanimous consensus of authority and either refrained from seeking approval of the diet medication or at least terminating production by the fall of,the decedent never would have been exposed to redux at all.
appellant br.at.thus,we must address the district court finding that the fda approval of redux preempted all state law claims based on wyeth actions before that approval.
the district court found that buchanan negligence claims were preempted by the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,et,which is enforced by the fda,b.the district court concluded that 
the fda is responsible for regulating which drugs are on the market and the warnings such drugs must provide.as such,plaintiff strict liability and negligence claims that redux was an unreasonably dangerous drug for which no warning would have been adequate directly conflicts with the fda authority to determine which drugs are sufficiently safe and effective to be marketed.although plaintiff asserts that she alleges only that defendants should not have marketed redux,and that she does not argue that the fda did anything wrong,the court finds that her claim that redux should never have been placed on the market interferes with the fda objectives.consequently,all claims relating to approval are preempted by the fda.
longs i,d at emphasis in original.
as the district court framed it,the issue is whether a finding that a manufacturer was negligent in bringing the drug to market conflicts or is inconsistent with the fda subsequent approval of that drug for the market.determining whether this is so requires some degree of understanding of the fda approval process.a recent fifth circuit case summarized the fda role in approving new drugs 
all prescription drugs marketed in this country must first receive fda approval.manufacturers of new drugs must submit a new drug application nda to the fda that demonstrates the drug effectiveness and safety for its intended use.the food,drug and cosmetics act fdca established this avenue for pioneer drugs,with the core objective of ensuring that drugs are both safe and effective the fda has codified the nda regulations at part.new drug approval requires,among other deliverables,the results of successful clinical trials and labeling that accurately portrays the benefits and risks of the drug,as indicated by those trials and other data.
demahy actavis,wl,at cir,internal footnotes omitted.with this basic understanding of fda drug approval in mind,we turn to federal preemption.
federal preemption draws its force from the supremacy clause of the united states constitution.const,cl.here,as in every preemption case,t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone.demahy,wl,at quoting medtronic,lohr,plurality.i n all preemption cases,and particularly in those in which congress has legislated in a field which the states have traditionally occupied,we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.levine.at internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted.although there is a presumption under the supremacy clause that congress did not intend to preempt state law,an assumption of is not triggered when the state regulates in an area where there has been a history of significant federal presence.ventures,surface transp,cir quoting united states locke.the analysis of whether the presumption of applies accounts for the historic presence of state law but does not rely on the absence of federal regulation.levine.at.
here,buchanan is entitled to the presumption that congress did not intend to preempt state law because hers are claims under preexisting state products liability law.desiano,cir stating that tort liability falls squarely within a state prerogative to regulate matters of health and safety,which is a sphere in which the presumption against preemption applies,indeed,stands at its strongest.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted aff,llc kent,per curiam decision.although i t is not a valid argument against preemption to say that the state seeks to impose greater obligations than congress did,smith provident bank,cir,w here possible,a court should try to reconcile federal law and state law.rollins wilson county gov t,cir.
keeping in mind that we operate under a presumption against preemption in this case,we turn to the substance of federal preemption.in general,a federal law may preempt a state law in any of the following three scenarios.first,a federal statute may expressly preempt the state law.second,a federal law may impliedly preempt a state law.third,preemption results from an actual conflict between a federal and a state law.garcia,cir citations omitted.wyeth argues,and the district court based its holding on,the third type of preemption,conflict preemption.
conflict preemption refers to circumstances where compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.state farm bank reardon,cir.conflict preemption analysis should be narrow and precise,to prevent the diminution of the role congress reserved to the states while at the same time preserving the federal role.downhour somani,cir quoting nw.cent.pipeline state.comm n.the supreme court has described impossibility preemption as a demanding defense.levine.at.
in this case,as a general proposition,we can discern no physical impossibility between complying with a state law duty to exercise reasonable care in the process leading up to placing a drug on the market and complying with the federal government process for approving drugs.this is not to say that such a physical impossibility could never exist,for instance if a state duty required that the manufacturer do something that the fda forbade or vice versa.but such a situation would,we think,be the exception to the rule.thus,we are not persuaded that it is always impossible to comply with both state law duties and fda regulations in the process leading up to fda approval.
the only remaining rationale to support conflict preemption,therefore,is that allowing state tort lawsuits would stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the statute.the district court quoted the fdca to find that the purpose of the fda is to 
promote the public health by promptly and efficiently reviewing clinical research and taking appropriate action on the marketing of regulated products in a timely manner 
with respect to such products,protect the public health by ensuring that 
b human drugs are safe and effective 
longs i,d at quoting b.the district court then determined that permitting negligence claims regarding a drug manufacturer conduct would conflict with this function of the fda.
however,we can not agree with the district court conclusion as,not only is there a presumption against preemption,but the case law supports the conclusion that congress did not intend to preempt state tort law claims when it passed the fdca.part of the desiano analysis is applicable here 
significantly,all of the claims advanced by appellants in this case are premised on traditional duties between a product manufacturer and consumers.none of them derives from,or is based on,a duty between a manufacturer and a federal agency.as a result,were we to conclude that appellants claims were preempted,we would be holding that congress,without any explicit expression of intent,should nonetheless be taken to have modified and,in effect,gutted traditional state law duties between pharmaceutical companies and their consumers.we see no reason,nor can we identify any precedent,to justify such a result.
desiano,at.simply because tort liability parallel s federal safety requirements does not mean that liability is preempted.id.at.allowing a state tort claim under the instant circumstances would not interfere with the methods by which the federal statute was designed to reach its goal.verizon north,strand,cir internal brackets omitted quoting gade solid wastes mgmt.ass n.wyeth defends the district court preemption finding by citing two supreme court cases for the principle that s tate tort law disrupts the federal scheme,but these cases are distinguishable.
in geier american honda motor,the court found that the plaintiffs tort suit that would have required manufacturers of all similar cars to install airbags rather than other passive restraint systems,such as automatic belts or passive interiors would have presented an obstacle to the variety and mix of devices that the federal regulation sought and to the gradual passive restraint that the federal regulation deliberately imposed.id.at.such conflicts do not exist here because the state duty urged by buchanan does not create an obstacle to following the federal regulatory scheme.
wyeth also cites riegel medtronic.that case addressed the medical device act,which expressly preempts state requirements different from,or in addition to,any requirement applicable to the device under federal law.riegel,at quoting a.there is no similar express preemption provision for drugs under the fdca.indeed,in the amendments to the fdca,congress expressly limited the preemptive effect of the statute by stating 
nothing in the amendments made by this act to the federal food,drug and cosmetic act shall be construed as invalidating any provision of state law which would be valid in the absence of such amendments unless there is a direct and positive conflict between such amendments and such provisions of state law.
drug amendments of act,stat,see also levine.at as it enlarged the fda powers to protect the public health and assure the safety,effectiveness,and reliability of drugs,congress took care to preserve state law.internal citations omitted.
the supreme court also observed that i n keeping with congress decision not to tort suits,it appears that the fda traditionally regarded state law as a complementary form of drug regulation.levine.at.the court further stated 
if congress thought suits posed an obstacle to its objectives,it surely would have enacted an express preemption provision at some point during the fdca history.but despite its enactment of an express provision for medical devices,see,stat.codified at a,congress has not enacted such a provision for prescription drugs.its silence on the issue,coupled with its certain awareness of the prevalence of state tort litigation,is powerful evidence that congress did not intend fda oversight to be the exclusive means of ensuring drug safety and effectiveness.as justice explained in her opinion for a unanimous court the case for federal preemption is particularly weak where congress has indicated its awareness of the operation of state law in a field of federal interest,and has nonetheless decided to stand by both concepts and to tolerate whatever tension there is between them.
levine.at internal citation and footnote omitted moreover,even before the supreme court clarification in levine,we previously found that the fdca did not preempt design defect claims.tobin astra pharm,cir.finally,we are aware of no federal appeals court decision since levine concluding that fda regulation preempts any aspect of state tort law,though we admit that,until today,there is also no court of appeals authority for the proposition that the levine rationale extends beyond the realm of claims to apply to all state law claims.
for these reasons,we hold that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to wyeth on preemption grounds on buchanan common law negligence claims.in so holding,however,we do not pass upon whether there may be alternative bases for adjudicating these claims short of trial.neither the parties nor the district court have asserted any such alternative,so the issue is not before us.we hold merely that fda approval does not automatically preempt state law tort claims for negligence,and we remand for such further proceedings as may be appropriate under the facts and circumstances.moreover,because we remand for further proceedings on the common law claims,the district court mootness ruling as to punitive damages must also be reversed and remanded 
for the reasons set forth above,we reverse the judgment of the district court as to the negligence claims and punitive damages and remand those issues to the district court for further proceedings we affirm the judgment of the district court on all other claims.moreover,we vacate as moot the portion of longs i,d at,that holds that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the inadequacy of a warning under section d.

helene white,circuit judge,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
i join the majority opinion except part ii c and the related portion of part iii,from which i respectfully dissent.i would reverse the summary dismissal of claims based on wyeth alleged negligence in failing to adequately investigate adverse reports regarding redux after fda approval,and in failing to timely remove redux from the market,and remand such claims to the district court for further proceedings.although i agree with the majority that buchanan failed to present evidence in support of these claims,my review of the record convinces me that this is because wyeth motions for summary judgment did not attack the factual support for these claims.
buchanan amended complaint included claims that wyeth was negligent in failing to adequately monitor the effects of the drug failing to timely and accurately report to the fda all adverse drug experience information obtained,and concealing and misrepresenting the results of studies to physicians and the public.wyeth brought three motions for summary judgment.the only motion potentially related to the negligence claims was wyeth motion for summary judgment based on lack of evidence of proximate causation.wyeth included two arguments in that motion.the majority of the brief was dedicated to wyeth argument that buchanan failure to warn claim is barred by the learned intermediary doctrine.wyeth second argument was that buchanan design defect claim under the opla is barred because wyeth had provided a statutorily sufficient adequate warning under ohio ann.d,and that even if the warnings were inadequate,buchanan had not established that any such claimed inadequacy proximately caused her physician to prescribe the drug to her.these arguments were not addressed to buchanan alle
