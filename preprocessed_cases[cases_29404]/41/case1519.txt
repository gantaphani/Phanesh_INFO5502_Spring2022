as a consequence of brain cancer and a stroke that he suffered at the age of,eric radaszewski requires medical care in order to survive.until he reached the age of,the illinois department of public aid idpa or the department provided funding through a medicaid program for children that enabled eric to receive hours of nursing at home each day.after he turned,eric was no longer eligible to participate in that program.illinois has a separate program providing care for adults who would otherwise have to be cared for in institutions.however,funding under that program is capped at a level that is insufficient to pay for the extent of nursing that eric would need in order to remain at home.consequently,eric faces the prospect of entering a care facility in order to receive the intensive medical care that he needs.eric mother,donna radaszewski,filed this suit against the director of the idpa the director on eric behalf,contending that the idpa failure to fully fund,nursing for eric amounts to disability discrimination in violation of section of the rehabilitation act of,the rehabilitation act,and title ii of the americans with disabilities act of,the ada,in that illinois is refusing to provide the medical services that eric requires in order to remain in the most setting appropriate for his needs,which is his home.the district court entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of the director,reasoning that the ada claim against the director was barred by the eleventh amendment and that the rehabilitation act claim failed as a matter of law because nursing care is not a service that illinois currently provides to any adult individual.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
as this case was resolved on the basis of the pleadings,we accept the facts alleged in radaszewski supplemental complaint as true,midwest gas,indiana gas,cir,cert.denied,d.we also take judicial notice of the contents of certain matters in the public record,including administrative findings about eric medical status and needs.see,menominee indian tribe of wisconsin thompson,cir.
eric was diagnosed with medulloblastoma,a form of brain cancer,in.after undergoing surgery,radiation,and chemotherapy to treat the cancer,eric suffered a stroke in.the cancer,stroke,and medical treatment have impaired eric physical and mental functions and left him medically fragile.in the opinion of his physician,eric requires care by a registered nurse hours per day in order to survive.
since july,eric has received care at his parents home.in august,when his family had exhausted its medical insurance benefits,eric began to receive nursing care through the illinois medicaid program.
medicaid,a program funded jointly by the states and the federal government,provides medical assistance both to disabled individuals and to families with dependent children whose income and resources are otherwise insufficient to pay for the cost of the medical care that they require.see.comp.stat.ann.each state participating in the medicaid program must submit for approval to the secretary of health and human services hhs a plan setting forth the services that the state will provide in its medicaid program,a,a,a.
nursing,defined as nursing services provided to a person who requires more individualized and continuous care than would routinely be provided by a visiting nurse or by the nursing staff of a hospital or skilled nursing facility,is one of the services that a state may elect to include in its medicaid plan.a,a c.a state may choose to provide nursing services at the recipient home,at a hospital,or at a skilled nursing facility.c.prior to this litigation,the illinois medicaid plan included coverage for nursing,provided that such nursing was recommended by a physician,prior approval was obtained from the appropriate state agency,and the care was provided by someone other than the recipient relative the plan imposed no limitation on the cost of such care,nor did it limit where nursing could be provided to the medicaid recipient.see radaszewski ex rel.radaszewski garner,d,supplemented on denial of reh g march.in the course of this litigation,however,illinois drafted an amendment to its medicaid plan to delete all references to nursing and submitted the amendment to hhs for clearance the secretary approved that amendment on february.id,at radaszewski reply br.addendum.the state then initiated rulemaking under the illinois administrative procedure act to implement the change that process was completed as of september.see radaszewski,at.
in addition to the services outlined in their basic medicaid plans,states may seek hhs approval to provide home and services to individuals who would otherwise require institutional care.the hhs secretary may approve these services in the exercise of his waiver authority,so labeled because it empowers the secretary to waive certain medicaid requirements that would otherwise constrain a state ability to offer these,service limitations and financial eligibility criteria.see b h d.this power is often used to authorize innovative and experimental programs.as relevant here,it facilitates state programs designed to provide home and services to persons who would otherwise have to be cared for in nursing homes or other institutions specifically,the secretary may issue waivers permitting a state to offer these services only to individuals who need them in order to avoid institutionalization,rather than to every state citizen who qualifies for medicaid.see c.in seeking approval for a waiver program offering home and community care,however,the state must certify that it is in the sense that the average cost of the care offered through the waiver program does not exceed the average cost of providing that care in an institutional setting.see c d e.
pursuant to this waiver authority,hhs has approved illinois medicaid program for medically fragile,technology dependent children the mftdc program.this program offers a variety of home and services and equipment to medically fragile persons under the age of who would otherwise have to be cared for in a skilled pediatric facility or a hospital.see.admin.code.the services offered by this program include shift nursing and respite care in the recipient home.the amount of services that a person may receive under this program is determined with reference to the cost of the care that he or she alternatively would require in a skilled pediatric facility or a hospital.admin.code c 
eric was found eligible for the mftdc program and began receiving services in.based on the estimated cost of the level of care that eric would require in a medical institution,the idpa approved a care plan for eric that called for hours per day of nursing services provided by registered nurses.eric parents,who were given special training so that they could provide the necessary care for eric,tended to him the remaining eight hours of each day.in order to provide them with periodic relief from that responsibility,the idpa also provided eric an additional hours of respite nursing services per year.the idpa approved this care plan annually until eric reached the age of when,by virtue of his age,he became ineligible for continued participation in the mftdc program.
illinois has a separate waiver program for disabled home services program hsp which,like the mftdc program,offers services not otherwise covered by the state basic medicaid program and which enables such adults to continue living at home in lieu of being cared for in an institution,provided that the cost of care does not exceed the cost of institutional care.see.admin.code a,j.however,the services provided pursuant to the hsp are limited by a service cost maximum scm established by the idpa.admin.code a.the scm is determined with reference to what it would cost to provide nursing care to the recipient in an institutional setting,a hospital or a nursing facility.see see also c.based on his degree of impairment and his need for medical care,an individual who seeks to participate in the hsp is assigned a determination of need don score reflecting his risk of institutionalization.see.admin.code d.eric received a don score of,and at that time,the standard scm for an individual with that don score was per month.see.admin.code b setting forth current scms for participants in hsp.a higher exceptional care rate may be approved for an individual with a complex medical diagnosis.see.comp.stat.ann.a.admin.code a in re appeal of eric radaszewski,appeal,findings of fact of the hearing officer f idpa,hereinafter,idpa hearing officer findings a counselor with the idpa office of rehabilitation service ors,after reviewing eric situation,requested and obtained approval of an exceptional care rate for eric in the amount of per month.however,in the assessment of eric physician,that amount would only be sufficient to cover four to five hours per day of nursing services for eric.the estimated cost of maintaining eric care hours per day is between and per month.however,the ors contended that it was not authorized to pay for medical care in excess of what it would cost to provide exceptional care for eric at a skilled nursing facility.the idpa took the position that if funding at the exceptional care rate was insufficient to provide for eric care at home,then he would to have to move to an institutional setting in order to receive care.it determined that eric could be adequately cared for in a nursing home facility.
eric filed an administrative grievance with the idpa,contending that the department should be required to pay more than the exceptional care rate so that he could continue receiving the care he requires at home rather than in a nursing home.at the conclusion of an evidentiary hearing conducted in july,a hearing officer made a number of factual determinations,including the following findings as to the level of care that eric requires 
h.the uncontradicted evidence submitted by grievant eric is that the grievant would be at risk of danger if he should be placed in a nursing home.grievant doctor testified that grievant needs substantial one on one nursing care to survive.he is medically fragile,prone to infections,immobilized,catheterized and relies on oxygen.a registered nurse is required to look for problems before they become full blown and he crashes,according to grievant doctor.his immunological responses were severely compromised due to earlier radiation and chemotherapy,so skilled nursing care is a question of survival,not a question of doing well.the physician strongly urged that grievant be given the funds to support hours per day of skilled nursing care.placing grievant in a nursing home facility of the type suggested by the state,according to the physician,would result in grievant being seriously medically compromised,which would lead to many hospitalizations.
grievant physician opinion was supported by the registered nurse in charge of grievant care.he described grievant medical needs in detail.grievant has no sense of thirst,so his hydration must be carefully monitored in order to avoid serious medical complications.although grievant has difficulty swallowing,he can be given soft food,but only under careful conditions.his nutrition must be carefully monitored.grievant can not protect his airway by turning his head any aspiration of food,liquid or medicine can become a medical emergency.chronic sinus infections lead to sepsis,which can be rapid and acute.grievant also has osteoporosis and is in danger of breaking bones.his risk of injury is high because he sometimes forgets he can not walk.his memory is not good and he is often confused.he also has difficulty with urination and elimination,which if left untreated,can result in medical emergencies.grievant has to be under constant surveillance.
j.according to the expert witness offered by grievant,grievant could not get the level of required nursing care in a nursing home facility,including the facility suggested by the state alden lincoln park nursing facility.in her assessment for this hearing,the expert contacted several nursing homes including alden and asked about the level of care provided.according to this witness,none would provide the level of care need by grievant hour s per day by skilled clinical nurses.she based her assessment on the grievant medical file,her observation of grievant,and her years of experience as a skilled nursing professional.
idpa hearing officer findings.presented with the hearing officer factual findings and eric grievance,idpa director ann patla concluded that the sole issue that she had the authority to resolve was whether the idpa own rules permit the hsp to pay for an individual medical care at a level greater than the exceptional care rate.she concluded that they do not.in a decision issued in august,she stated i find that the rules set forth do not allow the hsp program to pay greater than the scm at the exceptional care rate in any case.in re appeal of eric radaszewski,appeal,final administrative decision idpa.
on september,radaszewski filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the idpa director in federal court,asserting that a reduction in the level of nursing provided to her son at home would constitute a violation of the federal medicaid statute as well as a deprivation of due process in violation of the fourteenth amendment.she sought and obtained a temporary restraining order obligating the idpa to continue funding eric care.however,the district court subsequently denied radaszewski request for a preliminary injunction,concluding that radaszewski complaint alleged no viable federal claim and that the court consequently lacked authority to award her preliminary injunctive relief.radaszewski patla,c,order.radaszewski appealed the preliminary injunction ruling to this court.while that appeal was pending,hhs on february,approved the amendment to illinois basic medicaid plan eliminating nursing as a service provided under that plan.both parties agreed that the amendment rendered radaszewski lawsuit moot.on that basis,we dismissed her appeal in an unpublished order.radaszewski patla,wl cir.march,unpublished text available in westlaw.
meanwhile,in december,after the district court had denied her motion for a preliminary injunction,radaszewski filed suit against the idpa director in illinois injunctive relief compelling the idpa to fully fund the cost of the nursing care that eric required in order to remain at home.each of the theories that radaszewski asserted in support of this relief was premised on state law.the state court entered a temporary injunction requiring the idpa to restore funding to the radaszewski family sufficient to pay for hours of nursing per day.that injunction,we are told,remains in effect today.nearly one year later,the state court granted radaszewski leave to file a supplemental complaint which added,inter alia,claims under title ii of the ada,and section of the rehabilitation act.radaszewski contended that the idpa refusal to pay for nursing for eric at his home was inconsistent with the state duty,pursuant to regulations promulgated under both the ada and rehabilitation act,to provide care for a disabled person in the most setting appropriate for that person.based on the newly alleged violations of federal law,the director removed the action to federal court.radaszewski asked the district court to remand the case to state court.the district court remanded the claims alone,reasoning that it lacked supplemental jurisdiction over those claims under pennhurst state school hosp.halderman,d.radaszewski garner,c,wl,at.the state circuit court subsequently granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of the director.however,the illinois appellate court reversed that judgment and remanded for further proceedings,concluding there were questions concerning the propriety of the rulemaking the elimination of nursing services from the state medicaid plan that could not be resolved on the pleadings.radaszewski ex rel.radaszewski garner,supra,at.
the district court dismissed radaszewski ada claim and entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of the director on the rehabilitation act claim.radaszewski garner,c,wl,disability.relying on this court opinion in walker snyder,cir,the court determined that radaszewski could not sue the director in her official capacity in federal court for relief under title ii of the ada.walker held that the doctrine of ex parte young,which permits private suits against state officials in federal court for injunctive relief,is unavailable in title ii cases in walker view,the proper defendant in such a case was the state agency itself,which,in light of the eleventh amendment,could only be sued in state court.at.although the district court agreed that case law postdating walker including the supreme court decision in board of trustees of of alabama garrett,d had called into question the validity of walker holding,the court felt constrained to follow walker until such time as either this court or the supreme court overruled it.the court therefore dismissed the ada claim.wl,at.
as for the rehabilitation act claim,the court reasoned that neither the rehabilitation act nor the ada require s that the state create and fund a program that does not already exist in order to enable a disabled person to be cared for in the most integrated community setting possible rather,what the statutes require is treatment as between able and disabled individuals,at.in the court view,it was clear that the idpa had not discriminated against disabled individuals although the state makes,nursing services available to disabled individuals under the age of,no one over the age of or such services through the illinois medicaid program.id in essence,radaszewski was seeking to compel the state to provide services to her son at home that it did not otherwise provide,and this exceeded the scope of the state duty under the rehabilitation act and the ada.t he idpa is not required to provide the handicapped more coverage than the individual to assure adequate health care.id.for that reason the court concluded that the director was entitled to judgment on the pleadings on the rehabilitation act claim.id.
we review de novo the district court decision to enter judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.corman derailment,llc int l union of operating engineers,local,cir.in the course of that review,we accept the truth of the allegations in radaszewski complaint.id.only if radaszewski could prove no set of facts consistent with those allegations that might support her claim for relief may we sustain the judgment entered in the director favor.id.
the district court concluded on the strength of this court holding in walker,that radaszewski could not sue the director for injunctive relief under the ada.however,bruggeman ex rel.bruggeman blagojevich,cir,issued after the district court decision,recognized that walker did not survive the supreme court decision in garrett.garrett explicitly recognized the right of a private plaintiff to assert an ada claim for injunctive relief against a state official in federal court.at.at.the state concedes,in view of bruggeman,that radaszewski may seek injunctive relief from the director consistent with the doctrine of ex parte young.bruggeman,at.we therefore proceed to the merits of radaszewski ada claim as well as her rehabilitation act claim.
title ii of the ada prohibits discrimination against disabled persons by any public entity 
n o qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.
the statute defines a qualified individual with a disability as one who,with or without reasonable modifications to rules,policies,or practices meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.the term public entity is defined to include any state or local government,as well as any department,agency,special purpose district or other instrumentality of a state or local government.a a,b.
pursuant to title ii,the attorney general has promulgated a regulation providing that a public entity shall administer services,programs,and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.d.the most integrated setting appropriate is in turn defined as a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.pt,app.a.this integration mandate does not impose an unqualified obligation on a public agency,however.although an agency must make such modifications as are reasonable in order to avoid unduly segregating the disabled,it is relieved of that obligation if it can show that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,program,or activity.b.
the rehabilitation act,which applies to programs receiving federal financial assistance,contains a similar antidiscrimination provision,a,and a corresponding regulation requiring that an agency administer its programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons,d.the ada integration regulation is modeled after that regulation.see olmstead ex rel.zimring,d.and consistent with the ada regulatory scheme,that integration mandate is limited by regulatory provisions indicating that a recipient of federal funding need not accommodate a disabled person when the proposed accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the recipient,c c.
in view of the similarities between the relevant provisions of the ada and the rehabilitation act and their implementing regulations,courts construe and apply them in a consistent manner.frederick dep t of public welfare of pennsylvania,cir fisher oklahoma health care,cir see also bruggeman,supra,at noting that the statutory and regulatory provisions concerning integrated care are materially identical.although our analysis shall focus on the ada,that analysis applies with equal force to radaszewski rehabilitation act claim.
in olmstead,the supreme court,looking to the terms and legislative history of the ada title ii,along with the integration mandate reflected in its implementing regulations,held that the unjustified institutional isolation of a disabled individual receiving medical care from a state amounts to an actionable form of discrimination under title ii.at.at.that is so,the court concluded,even in the absence of traditional proof that the disabled person is being treated differently from a nondisabled person who is otherwise similarly situated.id.at.at.
recognition that unjustified institutional isolation of persons with disabilities is a form of discrimination reflects two evident judgments.first,institutional placement of persons who can handle and benefit from community settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life.second,confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals,including family relations,social contacts,work options,economic independence,educational advancement,and cultural enrichment.dissimilar treatment correspondingly exists in this key respect in order to received needed medical services,persons with disabilities must,because of those disabilities,relinquish participation in community life they could enjoy given reasonable accommodations,while persons without such disabilities can receive the medical services they need without similar sacrifice.
id.at.at citations omitted.the plaintiffs in olmstead were individuals with mental disabilities who had been institutionalized in state facilities.although their treatment providers had concluded that their needs could be met in programs,their placement into such programs had been delayed,and the plaintiffs filed suit under title ii,seeking to compel the state to transfer them into a community setting.in view of the integration mandate,the court agreed with the plaintiffs that a state is obliged to provide treatment for individuals with disabilities,so long as the state treatment professionals find that such treatment is appropriate,the affected individuals do not oppose treatment,and placement in the community can be reasonably accommodated,taking into account the state resources and the needs of others with similar disabilities.id.at.at.in a footnote,the court disavowed any intent to hold that the ada imposes on the states either a particular standard of care or a requirement that they provide a particular level of benefits to disabled persons.id.at.at.we do hold,however,that states must adhere to the ada nondiscrimination requirement with regard to the services they in fact provide.ibid.
radaszewski contends that illinois unwillingness to continue funding nursing care for eric at home portends precisely the type of unjustified institutional isolation for him that olmstead described as form of discrimination prohibited by the ada.she asserts that eric satisfies each of the three conditions that the court in olmstead cited as prerequisites to the state obligation to provide treatment.indeed,it appears that two of these propriety of care for eric,and the consent of eric and his affected family undisputed.there is little doubt that eric can be cared for appropriately at home he has been receiving care at home since,and according to the complaint,he benefits from the support of and interaction with his parents in that environment.and obviously,neither he nor his family oppose the prospect of him remaining at home that is the point of radaszewski complaint.as for the third state ability to reasonably accommodate care for the disabled asserts that the cost of,nursing for eric is actually less than what the state would spend if eric were transferred to an institution.thus,radaszewski believes that the state reasonably can accommodate continued care for eric without jeopardizing its resources or interfering with the state obligation to care for other disabled individuals.one of the ways that it might do this,radaszewski suggests,is by increasing the cap on the amount that the hsp will pay for the services that disabled individuals need in order to remain at home.
the director,on the other hand,construes radaszewski complaint to require a substantive change in the services idpa currently provides.picking up on footnote of the olmstead opinion,the state emphasizes that the ada does not guarantee that each recipient of state medical benefits will get care precisely tailored to his needs instead,the statute requires the state not to discriminate services that it has chosen to provide.at.at.thus,courts have recognized that a state may violate title ii when it refuses to provide an existing benefit to a disabled person that would enable that individual to live in a more setting,fisher oklahoma health care,supra,at state may violate title ii when it caps the number of drug prescriptions it will fund through medicaid for participants in care programs,but not for persons who live in nursing homes townsend quasim,cir care offered to categorically needy must be offered to medically needy as well,unless doing so would fundamentally alter the state medicaid programs.on the other hand,courts have also held that a state is not obligated to create new services in order to enable an institutionalized individual to live in a more integrated setting,rodriguez city of new york,cir neither ada nor rehabilitation act compelled state to offer safety monitoring to persons with mental disabilities so that such individuals could remain at home,where safety monitoring was not an existing personal care service that city offered through its medicaid program.
here,idpa argues,the state basic medicaid plan by virtue of the amendment approved in does not include nursing services.of course,nursing generally is a service provided,but the particular service that eric requires is,nursing.the only individuals to whom that type of nursing is offered at the level that eric requires are persons under the age of,who may receive such services under the mftdc waiver program.see,supra.funding for nursing is available through the hsp program,but at a level no higher than the exceptional care in this case would permit no more than five hours of nursing per day.thus,in order for radaszewski to obtain the relief she seeks for eric,the idpa either would have to raise the age limit for participation in the mftdc program or raise the level of care covered by the hsp by substantially increasing the exceptional care rate for individuals with disabilities akin to eric.in the state view,neither modification is a reasonable one,and either one would compel the idpa to alter the substance of the services it provides to medicaid recipients and thus to offer a new service that does not currently exist.
a key premise of the state argument is that nursing would not be provided to eric in the institutional setting that the idpa believes is appropriate to his level of,in a nursing home facility.however,from the face of the complaint,the documents in the public record relating to eric idpa grievance,and the briefing in this appeal,there appear to be at least two important factual questions relating to this premise that can not be resolved on the pleadings.
the first of these questions is whether a nursing home facility actually could meet eric medical needs,as the director supposes.as we noted earlier,the idpa calculated the level of benefits for which eric was eligible under the hsp with reference to the cost of care at a nursing home facility and the idpa took the position that eric would have to seek care in that type of facility if hsp funding at the exceptional care rate was insufficient to pay for his care at home.however,the radaszewskis have consistently challenged the notion that eric could receive adequate care at a nursing home facility.when eric filed a grievance with the idpa challenging the exceptional care rate that the department had established for eric,his parents put on evidence that eric could not properly be cared for in a nursing home facility as the state contended,because such a facility could not provide the constant,care that he needs in order to survive.based on that evidence,which apparently was uncontradicted,the hearing officer whose findings we quoted above specifically found that eric would be at risk of danger if he should be placed in a nursing home.idpa hearing officer findings h.in view of that finding,we must assume that radaszewski will be able to prove in this litigation that eric,if institutionalized,would require a more setting than a nursing hospital,for order to survive.that possibility in turn suggests that the type and cost of medical care that eric would receive at a nursing home facility are not the appropriate reference points for assessing whether the nursing that eric seeks to receive at home is a service that would be provided to eric in an institutional setting.
the second question concerns the level of care that eric would require in an institutional it be a nursing home facility,a hospital,or another type of care facility.the state posits that eric would not receive private nursing care in any institutional setting,even a hospital,so that there is no institutional precedent that would support his demand under title ii for nursing at home.fisher,at plaintiffs are simply requesting that a service for which they would be eligible under an existing state program,unlimited medically necessary prescriptions,be provided in a setting rather than a nursing home.they are not demanding a separate service or one not already offered by the state.townsend,at townsend simply requests that the services he is already eligible to receive under an existing state program be provided in the adult home where he lives,rather than the nursing home setting the state requires.here again,however,the evidence presented to the idpa hearing officer,and that officer findings,suggest that eric might well require continuous nursing care if he were cared for in an institutional setting.the hearing officer summary of the testimony provided by eric caretakers,most if not all of which was undisputed,makes it plausible to suppose that eric can not be left attended only by a person lacking significant medical any amount of time.it appears from that summary that he requires skilled assistance in order to safely accomplish many of the bodily functions necessary to remain,eating,eliminating waste,moving about,even breathing.radaszewski may thus be able to show that if institutionalized,eric would require the equivalent of the nursing care that,until now,he has received at home.
the director concedes that if eric were placed in an institution,the idpa would obliged to provide him with the level of care that he needs in order to survive.so if,as the evidence presented to the idpa hearing officer strongly suggests,eric requires constant monitoring and continuous skilled assistance in accomplishing basic bodily functions,then the state will have to provide those services to eric in an institutional setting.it may well be,as the director represents,that an institutional facility would not assign nurses,as such,to provide the care that eric requires.in lieu of one nurse assigned only to eric,for example,a hospital might be able to rely on a variety of monitors to keep eric life signs under surveillance,while a pool of immediately available skilled professionals tending to multiple patients in a unit might be able to provide the frequent,immediate assistance eric requires in order to eat,drink,and so on and to head off any of the medical crises,choking or infections to which he is vulnerable.but if what that level of care adds up to is the equivalent of,nursing care,then radaszewski may yet have a viable claim that eric is entitled to receive nursing care at home.
nothing in the regulations promulgated under the ada or the rehabilitation act or in the court decision in olmstead conditions the viability of a title ii or section claim on proof that the services a plaintiff wishes to receive in a setting already exist in exactly the same form in the institutional setting.although a state is not obliged to create entirely new services or to otherwise alter the substance of the care that it provides to medicaid recipients in order to accommodate an individual desire to be cared for at home,the integration mandate may well require the state to make reasonable modifications to the form of existing services in order to adapt them to settings.some forms of medical example,prescription be virtually the same whether provided to the recipient in an institution or at home.see fisher,at.but particularly when the treatment involves services provided by medical professionals,the care might vary in format depending on whether it is provided to the individual in an institution or a setting.if variations in the way services are delivered in different settings were enough to defeat a demand for more care,then the integration mandate of the ada and the rehabilitation act would mean very little.of course,the state always has the opportunity to show that adapting existing services to a setting would impose unreasonable burdens or fundamentally alter the nature of its programs and services,and for that reason it should not be required to accommodate the plaintiff.b see olmstead,at.at.but so long as it is possible for the plaintiff to show that the services he seeks to receive at home are,in substance,already provided in the institutional setting,then the state is not entitled to judgment on the pleadings based on the argument that the services would take on a different form or method if provided in a community setting.
also relevant to the question of whether continuous nursing is a service that illinois does not presently offer in any setting is the fact that idpa can and does make available a limited amount of funding for nursing to adults participating in the hsp.recall that the purpose of a waiver program like hsp is to enable medically needy individuals to avoid institutionalization by making services available to them that are otherwise not part of the state basic medicaid program.nursing care,which has now been removed from illinois medicaid plan,would constitute such a service.the cap on the level of funding that hsp would provide to eric and his family prevents him from receiving the level of nursing services that he that the exceptional care rate approved for eric would pay for only four or five hours of nursing per day rather than the hours per day that his family seeks.but the fact that the state already provides for some nursing tends to belie the notion that providing such care to eric so that he may remain at home would require the state to alter the substance of its medicaid programs by creating an entirely new service.
insofar as the hsp is concerned,the state contends that eric is ineligible for that program and that radaszewski can not plead or prove otherwise because the cost of the continuous care that he needs admittedly exceeds the cost of exceptional care in a nursing facility,the latter figure being the most that idpa,under its current rules,will pay for eric care.that point is not dispositive of the federal claims that radaszewski has made here.it is true,as the director points out,that the ada only prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities,whom as we noted earlier the statute describes as disabled individuals who with or without reasonable modifications to rules,policies,or practices mee t the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.see olmstead,at.at.for present purposes,it appears undisputed that eric is qualified for the receipt of home services through the hsp in the sense that he has severe,disabilities,he is eligible for medicaid,and he is at risk of placement in an institutional health care facility.see.admin.code setting forth hsp eligibility requirements.it is also undisputed that his home is an appropriate care setting for has lived there since the onset of his disabilities with the support of the services that he received through the mftdc waiver program until he reached the age of very same services that he seeks to continue receiving as an adult.
by no means is eric an unqualified disabled person in the sense that olmstead is not someone who is unable to handle or benefit from community settings,at.at,whom the state medical professionals believe is not able to live in a setting,id.at.at,or who does not want to live in a such a setting,ibid.on the contrary,radaszewski complaint,together with the idpa grievance records,suggest that with appropriate care eric can live at home he has in fact done so for a number of years,that he wishes to continue doing so,and that he profits in that environment from the daily interaction with and nurturing by his parents and the access to learning that he has at home.supplemental complaint count i,count vi,count vii idpa hearing officer findings a eric has been cared for at home for the past years through funding from the illinois division of specialized care for children dscc.this care,plus the admirable efforts of his parents,has allowed grievant to be cared for in his home.grievant wishes to be maintained in his home with his family this is also his parents wish.eric thus appears to meet these essential requirements for care.see townsend,at plaintiff was a qualified individual with a disability for purposes of title ii because he was eligible to receive services through state medicaid program,he preferred to receive such services in a setting,and services were appropriate for his needs.
accepting the allegations of the complaint as true,eric is also qualified for the hsp program in the sense that the cost of his continued care at home would not exceed the anticipated cost of caring for him in an institutional setting.as we have noted,approval for medicaid waiver programs offering care is conditioned on certification that the average cost of or other care does not exceed the average cost of institutional care.see c d e.in view of that federal requirement,one of the eligibility requirements that illinois has specified for participation in the hsp program is that an individual does not require services that are expected to cost more than what the state would pay to provide institutional care to an individual with a similar don score.admin.code h.as we have noted,ra
