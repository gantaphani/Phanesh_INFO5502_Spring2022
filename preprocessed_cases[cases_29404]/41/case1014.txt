in this social security case,plaintiff seeks review of the appeals council decision that he is not entitled to receive disability benefits.because we find that the decision in plaintiff case was entered pursuant to the appeals council authority to reopen and revise the decisions of an administrative law judge,and that the procedures used did not violate plaintiff right to due process,we affirm the district court ruling upholding the appeals council decision.
factual and procedural background 
on may,william ferriell submitted an application for social security disability benefits,claiming that ailments in his back and lungs had rendered him disabled since august.ferriell had worked as an auto mechanic from through,but had not held a job since.his application was initially denied on august,then denied on reconsideration on november.
ferriell requested and was granted a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.alj patrick kimberlin convened a hearing in ferriell case on january,but decided to reschedule it once ferriell representative presented him with amended tax returns for and that she asserted would push back ferriell date last insured.a full hearing was held on february,during which the alj indicated he had recalculated ferriell date last insured as december,rather than the december,date established during the initial determination.after this pronouncement and the conclusion of ferriell testimony,ferriell representative stated that ferriell wished to amend his onset date to may,the date of his application.the alj accepted the amendment,and on april,he issued a decision fully favorable to ferriell,concluding that ferriell was entitled to disability benefits beginning on may.
on june,the assistant regional commissioner for processing center operations from the southeastern program service center referred ferriell case to the office of disability adjudication and review odar.the referral stated that ferriell earning records indicated he did not have enough periods of covered social security income to qualify for benefits on may,though he would have enough covered income to qualify for benefits based on an august,onset date.the assistant regional commissioner recommended that the appeals council initiate review or reopen and revise ferriell case to investigate the issue.
on september,the appeals council notified ferriell via letter that it was reopening and revising the hearing decision in his case.the letter explained that the appeals council had authority to revise ferriell decision because less than four years had passed from the initial determination and good cause to reopen existed since the evidence considered by the alj clearly showed that there was an error.the letter went on to state that the appeals council planned to enter a decision that ferriell was not entitled to disability benefits as of may,because a transpositional error had caused the alj to record his date last insured as december,instead of december.the letter concluded by indicating that ferriell had thirty days to present a statement of the law and facts of his case,new evidence,a request to appear before the appeals council prior to the entry of its final decision in his case.ferriell representative responded to the appeals council notice by sending a letter to the appeals council arguing that ferriell december,date last insured was justified by amended tax returns for the years and,which ferriell had submitted to the irs in in order to report additional income.nevertheless,on november,the appeals council issued a decision unfavorable to ferriell.it rejected ferriell argument for an extension of his date last insured,citing section c c of the social security act,c c,as precluding the retroactive crediting of income after a certain time period had elapsed.since this date was april,for income from,and april,for income,the appeals council concluded that ferriell had not submitted his amended returns in time to be given credit for the earnings recorded therein.it found that ferriell date last insured was december,and,as there was no evidence of disability prior to,that he was not entitled to disability benefits.
ferriell sought judicial review of the appeals council decision in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky,arguing that the appeals council was from considering his case and that the appeals council decision denied him due process.the district court affirmed the appeals council,and ferriell timely appealed to this court.
discussion 
ferriell brief does not contest the substance of the commissioner ruling in his case,but does object to the procedures through which he was determined ineligible for disability benefits.specifically,he asserts that social security administration ssa regulations make the appeals council action in his case untimely,and that he was denied due process in the determination of the onset date of his disability.the district court denied both of these claims,but we review a district court conclusions in a social security case de novo.valley comm r of soc,cir.we consider each issue in turn.
timeliness of appeals council action 
ferriell first argues that his case was not properly before the appeals council when it overturned the alj ruling in his favor,which fact deprived it of jurisdiction to reopen and revise the alj decision.to evaluate his contention as it applies to this case,we must examine the ssa procedures that allow the appeals council to alter an alj disability decision on its own motion under regulations providing for the direct review of alj decisions,the appeals council may initiate review of a hearing decision or dismissal of a hearing request,c,a nytime within days after the date of a decision or dismissal,id.a.the appeals council decision to review a case is established by its issuance of the notice of review,id.d,which is a notice mailed to all parties stating the reasons for the review and the issues to be considered,id.the appeals council will review a case if t here appears to be an abuse of discretion by the alj t here is an error of law t he action,findings or conclusions of the alj are not supported by substantial evidence or t here is a broad policy or procedural issue that may affect the general public interest.id.a.
in addition to the direct review procedures,ssa regulations allow the ssa to reopen and revise some decisions that are otherwise final and binding on its own initiative.id.a decision may be reopened w ithin four years of the date of the notice of the initial determination on a finding of good cause.id.b good cause to reopen a decision exists if n ew and material evidence is furnished a clerical error in the computation or recomputation of benefits was made or t he evidence that was considered in making the determination or decision clearly shows on its face that an error was made.id.a.
the appeals council revised ferriell case more than sixty days after the alj decision,so its action must be authorized by the reopening procedures in order to be lawful under ssa regulations.ferriell asserts that the appeals council can not reopen an alj decision unless the case is properly before it,that is,unless it had previously asserted its jurisdiction over the case under the review procedures.in other words,he contends that the appeals council failure to initiate review of his case within the time limit acts as a jurisdictional bar to its authority to reopen it.the commissioner advances an alternative interpretation the appeals council can reopen an alj decision pursuant to the reopening procedures regardless of whether it had undertaken review proceedings within the period.under this view,direct review of an alj decision is a completely separate process from the reopening of an alj decision,and the appeals council has authority to do either as long as it acts in accordance with the regulations governing its chosen procedure.
the correct interpretation of the appeals council authority to reopen alj decisions after more than sixty days has not been definitively determined in this circuit.in fox bowen,f d cir,this court upheld the appeals council authority to reopen a disability decision more than one year after the alj initial decision,based on a showing of good cause under b.this holding supports the commissioner interpretation of the direct review and reopening procedures,but it does not foreclose ferriell argument.first,the court in fox did not consider nor decide the specific issue in this case,namely,whether the direct review procedures create a jurisdictional limitation on the appeals council reopening authority.therefore,a holding in ferriell favor on this issue would not be precluded by our published decision in fox.see cir.c reported panel opinions are binding on subsequent panels.second,since the decision in fox,the ssa has amended governing review by the appeals council in a manner that speaks to the appeals council power under the reopening provisions.no panel of this court has yet to construe the new regulation impact on the reopening procedures.for these reasons,we proceed to examine the direct review and the reopening regulations in order to determine if there is reason to deviate from the result in fox.
before beginning our analysis,we note that we do not start with a blank slate.an agency interpretation of its regulations must be considered,even on pure legal questions such as this one.davis sec y of health human,cir see also mci telecomms.ohio bell.co,cir.the ssa interpretation of the regulations at issue is entitled to substantial deference it will be upheld unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations.auer robbins,wilson comm r of soc,cir.
the basis for ferriell argument is a potential ambiguity in the reopening regulations,which do not explicitly specify which component level of the ssa possesses the authority to reopen and revise a final decision or determination.the reopening provisions use the general terms we,us,and our to describe who has authority to reopen a decision.see,a determination or decision made in your case which is otherwise final and binding may be reopened and revised by us we may reopen a final determination or decision on our own initiative id.we will find that there is good cause to reopen a determination or decision if.since we,us,and our refer simply to the ssa,id,the reopening regulations seem neither to provide guidance nor to place limits on which level of the ssa may invoke the reopening procedures.in fact,this led the eleventh circuit in butterworth bowen,cir,to adopt the interpretation of the reopening procedures advanced by ferriell.the court upheld the petitioner argument that 
a reading of the regulations in context indicates that a final a determination or a be reopened and revised only by a component level which has jurisdiction over the case first,appropriate conditions as listed in section must exist,and second,the case must be properly before that particular component level before it may exercise reopening authority.t here are several methods by which a decision may be properly before the appeals council,for example it may take the case on its own motion review 
however,the ssa has on several occasions advanced an interpretation of the reopening provisions that rejects ferriell reading in favor of the commissioner.after the decision in butterworth,the ssa promulgated an acquiescence ruling disapproving of the decision as contrary to ssa policy and specifying that it applies only to decisions at the appeals council level and only to cases in which the claimant resides in alabama,florida,or georgia at the time of the appeals council review.social security acquiescence ruling may,available at,rescinded,rescission of social security acquiescence ruling.july.it described its interpretation of the reopening provisions as follows 
use the word we to signify ssa components,including the appeals council,and thus vest the authority to reopen and revise in the appeals council as well as in other ssa components.therefore,under ssa policy,the appeals council may reopen and revise any alj or appeals council decision if the procedures and conditions set forth in and are met.such actions are subject only to the time limits found in those provisions and not the time limits of any other regulations.

more importantly,in the ssa amended governing the appeals council review procedures,and included language with which it sought to codify its interpretation of the appeals council authority under the reopening provisions.section now contains four subsections,the last of which references and

the plain language of these statements indicates that,under the ssa interpretation of the direct review and reopening procedures,the appeals council may reopen an alj decision more than sixty days after the decision is issued,as long as it complies with the requirements of and we see no reason not to defer to this interpretation of,and,as it is consistent with the text of those regulations.though t
