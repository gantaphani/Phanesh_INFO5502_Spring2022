background 
flynn applied for social security disability benefits and supplemental security income in march.she has received treatment for fibromyalgia since,and she contends that she became disabled on october,due to her fibromyalgia,depression and severe headaches.
beginning in,flynn sought treatment from yogesh gandhi for her complaints of achiness,depression,sleepiness and lack of energy.gandhi recommended that flynn see mary radia,a rheumatologist.in november,radia concluded that flynn had fibromyalgia.throughout and,flynn saw radia numerous times for increased pain and stiffness.radia observed that flynn had good muscle strength and mobility.she prescribed flynn prescription and medicine to relieve the pain and encouraged flynn to exercise.

in april,flynn completed a questionnaire detailing her ability to complete daily tasks.she responded that she regularly took care of laundry,dishes and changing sheets with help cooked one meal a day,five days a week,with help grocery shopped one to two times a week watched her grandson occasionally and drove almost daily.
in june,a residual function capacity assessment by claude koons,a state agency medical consultant,determined that flynn could occasionally lift carry ten pounds,frequently lift carry less than ten pounds,stand walk with normal breaks at least two hours in an workday,sit with normal breaks about six hours in an workday,and push pull with unlimited restrictions,other than as described for lifting and carrying.john may,another state agency medical consultant came to the same conclusion in october.
flynn also received treatment for her depression in.suzan simmons,a psychologist who also saw flynn in,examined flynn and noted that flynn had recurrent major depression that was mild and controlled with medication.she believed that flynn was managing her medical issues and doing well psychologically and encouraged flynn to exercise daily.dee wright and herbert notch,two state agency psychologists,observed flynn in.wright found that flynn was moderately limited in her ability to carry out detailed instructions,maintain attention and concentration for extended periods of time,work in coordination with or proximity to others without being distracted by them,complete a normal workday without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms and get along with others without distracting them.notch agreed with wright assessment.

in january,radia completed a questionnaire concerning flynn capabilities for the social security administration in preparation for her hearing.radia responses contained apparent inconsistencies.she rejected the social security administration assessment that flynn could lift carry ten pounds occasionally but then wrote on the form that she believed flynn could lift carry ten pounds occasionally.she rejected the assessment that flynn could lift carry ten pounds frequently but then wrote that flynn could lift carry pounds frequently.she also indicated that flynn could stand and walk only to change positions and not for activities,could sit for less than six hours,and needed to change positions on an hourly basis to relieve pain.radia wrote that flynn and patients with fibromyalgia should not climb,stoop,kneel,crouch or crawl and should seldom reach,handle,finger and feel objects.radia then noted that while medication would help flynn,flynn condition was incurable and would affect her ability to work.
throughout,flynn also sought treatment for her headaches and pains.gandhi diagnosed flynn with a headache and sinus infection.radia suggested that the headaches were a result of flynn use of analgesics.steven reeves determined her headaches were not migranes and prescribed medication for flynn.reeves also found that her fibromyalgia was stable.
