plaintiff eugene terrance terrance,father of everett terrance the decedent and the personal representative of his estate,appeals the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of defendants,northville regional psychiatric hospital nrph,the state of michigan department of mental health,and the named defendants,in a action claiming deliberate indifference to medical needs and lack of due process in violation of the decedent rights under the eighth and fourteenth amendments.the district court held that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the decedent medical needs.the court did not address the due process claim.on appeal,plaintiff argues that the award of summary judgment was in error.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the district court as to certain defendants on the eighth amendment claim,but reverse the district court grant of summary judgment as to other defendants on the eighth amendment claim and as to all defendants on the fourteenth amendment claim,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
on june,everett terrance was involuntarily committed to nrph to receive treatment for auditory hallucinations,depression,erratic mood swings,and paranoid delusions.when the decedent arrived at nrph,he was housed in a room located directly above a main steam line.starting in june,nrph underwent an asbestos abatement program during which asbestos pipe insulation was removed from the steam line and later replaced with fiberglass insulation.the exposure of the bare pipe caused more heat to emanate until the new insulation was applied.
during his hospitalization at nrph,the decedent was treated by several medical professionals.staff psychiatrist lee was the decedent primary psychiatrist.govindan sadasivan covered the decedent unit while lee was on vacation.the decedent was also treated by ardeshir said,who was the primary internist responsible for overseeing all of the decedent medical problems on an as needed basis.said treated and had more contact with the decedent than any other physician at nrph.the decedent was also treated by primary therapist nurse sherley owens and occupational therapist barbara fanning.during the decedent stay in the facility,mehdi almasi served as medical director and,as such,was responsible for drafting all of nrph policies and procedures.
while at nrph,the decedent suffered from a number of medical conditions.he received a variety of treatments for psychological illness,including the administration of psychotropic medications,such as haldol,cogentin,and lithium.these medications can cause hyperthermia,dehydration,heat exhaustion,and heat stroke.the decedent also suffered from heart conditions,including hypertension and diabetes.on june,nurse owens developed a comprehensive nursing assessment for the decedent in which she concluded that he had problems following directions and thus required staff supervision in activities.because of the decedent conditions and his inability to follow directions,he was kept under staff supervision during activities.
on june,at the direction of the medical staff,the decedent began participating in centralized activities cat in the mornings and work therapy in the afternoons.on july,the decedent wandered off from cat,but was apprehended by security and returned to the ward several hours later.the decedent was then placed on escape alert.sadasivan discontinued the escape alert on july after the decedent told the doctor that he did not feel like escaping.of particular note here is that,according to hospital records,the only air conditioning unit within the ward was not working on july and was not repaired until one week later.
on july,the decedent told nurse owens that he wanted to return to the cat program.nurse owens determined that the decedent should not leave the ward until july.on july,the decedent complained of feeling weak.consequently,said ordered tests to be run on the decedent.the tests showed no signs of hyperglycemia despite nurse owens order,the decedent participated in outdoor activity for four hours on the afternoon of july.the next day,the decedent was returned to the ward complaining of chest pain.the decedent blood pressure was elevated and his ekg was interpreted as abnormal.despite these results,said medical plan for the decedent indicated that no action needed.said later noted that the decedent diabetes was uncontrolled,but said took no measures to control the decedent glucose level at that time.
according to hospital records,between july and july,the decedent drank a lot of water,was confused,and became agitated to the point of being.the decedent was also observed talking to himself and responding to voices.on july,lee increased the decedent dosage of haldol.on july,the staff observed the decedent drinking excessive amounts of water and was therefore kept under close observation because the staff suspected that the decedent was dehydrated.
two days later,lee ordered an additional daily injection of haldol,thus increasing again the decedent total daily dosage of the drug.at this time,lee issued a plan to observe the decedent for risk of dehydration.
on july,the decedent complained to nurse owens that his medicine was causing him to sweat profusely and suffer stiffness.the decedent was given cogentin to counteract stiffness and hand tremors,which are side effects of haldol.regarding the pipe repairs,on the same day,the maintenance personnel were installing insulation to the elbows of the bare steam pipes directly below the decedent room,causing additional heat to emanate from the pipes into the ward above.
on july,nurse owens recorded no further complaints of reactions by the decedent and also noted the decedent began to participate in activities with staff,including occasional van rides with fanning.on july,nurse owens noted her intention to refer the decedent back to cat and into the centralized therapy program ctp the following week.
on july,the temperature outside was degrees fahrenheit and the humidity level was above percent.nrph temperature chart,which was distributed to hospital employees during the summer months,indicated that these conditions produced a heat index of degrees.according to nrph advisory guidelines,the decedent was the type of patient who should have been in a cool room and not permitted to go outdoors or to engage in strenuous activity.
at on the morning of july,the decedent complained of dry mouth.nevertheless,some three hours later,lee determined that the decedent should resume participation in more outdoor activities.at approximately,said saw the decedent and realized that the decedent had not received his blood pressure medication over the weekend because the nurses apparently forgot to remind said to renew the order.after two elevated blood pressure readings were obtained from the decedent,said doubled the decedent medication to compensate for the days that the decedent had gone without blood pressure medication.however,said order for this dosage was never carried out.
on that same day,no one at nrph knew of the decedent whereabouts from the time he was seen with said in the morning until about that afternoon,when the decedent was seen staggering in the hallway near the nursing station.lee and fanning assisted the decedent into a treatment room and observed that the decedent was sweating,hot to the touch,and complaining that he did not feel well.lee thought that the decedent was suffering from heat stroke and needed immediate treatment,but had to consult with said before prescribing treatment.
lee instructed nurse owens to page said stat.at approximately,nurse owens paged said and explained that the decedent was sweaty,confused,had a temperature of degrees,and was restless to the point of being uncooperative.nurse owens also informed said that the decedent had been outside.said told nurse owens that he was on his way to the ward where the decedent was located.
at this time,the decedent blood pressure was elevated,and his mental state was deteriorating quickly.lee and nurse owens waited approximately one hour before calling a medical emergency at said arrived at regina pan,ramachandran nair,and kijoon kim responded to the emergency call soon thereafter,but did not provide any direct care to the decedent because said and almasi had already begun treating the decedent.
upon his arrival,said told the doctors to remove the decedent clothing.while the doctors were removing his clothing,the decedent lost consciousness.lee inserted an iv and placed wet towels over the decedent body.lee wanted to administer an ice water enema,but there was no enema equipment or ice water on the ward.lee also requested a rectal thermometer but there was no rectal thermometer available on the ward.in addition,dantrolene,a drug used to treat hyperthermia induced by psychotropic medications,was also requested by lee,but the drug was not available within the hospital.
at,emergency medical services ems was called by one of the doctors who was treating the decedent.ems arrived at and began resuscitation efforts,which were unsuccessful.ems then transferred the decedent to mary hospital,where resuscitation measures continued.the decedent died at approximately.the official cause of death was listed as acute cardiopulmonary arrest and hyperthermia exacerbated by haldol and benzotropine.
on june,terrance,the decedent father and personal representative of the decedent estate,filed suit in the wayne county michigan circuit court,alleging medical malpractice,negligence,gross negligence,and wanton misconduct against all defendants count i and negligence and gross negligence against defendants nrph and the state of michigan department of mental health count ii.on september,plaintiff amended his complaint in the wayne county suit to include a violation of the decedent civil rights under,claiming violations of the decedent eighth and fourteenth amendment rights on the grounds that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to the decedent serious medical needs and violated the decedent right to due process count iii.
on september,defendants removed the action to the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan the district court noted that it had original jurisdiction over count iii and supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims in counts i and ii.at.however,the district court found that the contemporaneous presentation of plaintiff parallel state law claims for relief with the federal civil rights claim would result in the undue confusion of the jury.id.the district court thus remanded counts i and ii to the wayne county circuit court,but retained jurisdiction over count iii.id.
on april,defendants moved for summary judgment,alleging that there was no genuine issue of material fact to be decided and arguing that plaintiff case did not demonstrate a constitutional violation.in the alternative,defendants asserted the defense of qualified immunity.the district court analyzed defendants actions under a heightened standard for deliberate indifference.the court found that defendants did not know of nor disregard an excessive risk to the decedent health and safety.consequently,on the eighth amendment claim,the court held that the named defendants did not act deliberately indifferent in supervising and treating the decedent,and were therefore entitled to qualified immunity.moreover,the court held that nrph and the michigan department of mental health could not be held liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior.accordingly,the district court granted defendants motion.the court did not address the fourteenth amendment due process claim.terrance now appeals the district court order.

summary judgment 
this court reviews an order granting summary judgment de novo.terry barr sales agency,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c terry barr,at.no genuine issue for trial exists when the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.moreover,this court must review the record,and any inferences derived therefrom,in the light most favorable to the party.id.accordingly,when the party presents direct evidence refuting the moving party motion for summary judgment,the court must accept the evidence as true.adams metiva,cir.
plaintiff s claims on appeal 
terrance appeals the district court order awarding summary judgment in favor of defendants in this action.he asserts that defendants violated the decedent eighth amendment right to medical care because defendants acted with deliberate indifference in their treatment and care of the decedent that led directly to his death.specifically,terrance argues that defendants conduct reflected substantial departure from accepted professional treatment and did not respond to the decedent medical emergency in a timely fashion.additionally,he asserts that the decedent fourteenth amendment right to due process was violated because the defendants violated the decedent right to be treated in a facility with safe conditions.moreover,terrance contends that the decedent should have been afforded more considerate treatment because he was involuntarily committed to the defendant facility.
under,state actors are prohibited from violating the civil rights of others.section provides 
every person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state or territory or the district of columbia,subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,suit in equity,or other proper proceeding for redress,except that in any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer judicial capacity,injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.
this court has consistently held that damage claims against governmental officials alleged to arise from violations of constitutional rights can not be founded upon conclusory,vague or general allegations,but must instead,allege facts that show the existence of the asserted constitutional rights violation recited in the complaint and what each defendant did to violate the asserted right.see,chapman city of detroit,cir.this court has adopted the requirement that a plaintiff allege with particularity all material facts to be relied upon when asserting that a governmental official has violated a constitutional right.elliott perez,cir see also dominque telb,cir.
the key issue in this case is whether summary judgment was appropriate.first,we consider whether defendants active and passive treatment of the decedent violated his rights regarding medical care under the eighth amendment.additionally,because the decedent was involuntarily committed to nrph for psychiatric care and treatment,we must consider the substantive due process rights of involuntarily committed persons under the fourteenth amendment.we find that a jury could reasonably conclude that one or more of the defendants violated the decedent constitutional rights in this case,and therefore,summary judgment in favor of all defendants was inappropriate.
eighth amendment 
deliberate indifference standard 
the eighth amendment to the constitution prohibits the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment.const.amend viii.the cruel and unusual punishment provision is invoked here as it applies to prisoners.as the decedent was involuntarily committed to nrph for psychiatric treatment,he was similarly situated to a prisoner with regard to the eighth amendment right to medical care.this court has held that the legal standard for asserting an eighth amendment claim regarding medical care for prisoners is deliberate indifference.williams mehra,cir en banc.
it is well settled that the deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain proscribed by the eighth amendment.estelle gamble,d quoting gregg georgia,d.however,not every claim by a prisoner that he has not received adequate medical treatment states a violation of the eighth amendment.estelle,at.a complaint that a physician has been negligent in diagnosing or treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical mistreatment under the eighth amendment.medical malpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisoner.id.at.in order to state a cognizable claim,a prisoner must allege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.it is only such indifference that can offend evolving standards of decency in violation of the eighth amendment.id.emphasis added.
in estelle,the supreme court established the deliberate indifference standard.the court further clarified the meaning of that term in farmer brennan,d,a decision regarding prison officials duty to protect inmates from violence at the hands of other inmates.in farmer,the court held that a prison official can not be found liable under the eighth amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,and he must also draw the inference.id.at.however,an eighth amendment claimant need not show that a prison official acted or failed to act believing that a harm actually would befall an inmate it is enough that the official acted or failed to act despite his knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm.id.at.further,w hether a prison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk is a question of fact subject to demonstration in the usual ways,including inference from circumstantial evidence and a factfinder may conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was obvious.id.
the federal courts have also held that less flagrant conduct may also constitute deliberate indifference in medical mistreatment cases.for example,the eleventh circuit has held that deliberate indifference may be established by a showing of grossly inadequate care as well as a decision to take an easier but less efficacious course of treatment.mcelligott foley,cir a doctor awareness that plaintiff condition was deteriorating and subsequent failure to treat plaintiff could support a finding of deliberate indifference see waldrop evans,cir a doctor decisions to remove patient from medication and to restore the medication without lithium constitutes deliberate indifference to patient psychiatric condition.moreover,w hen the need for treatment is obvious,medical care which is so cursory as to amount to no treatment at all may amount to deliberate indifference.mandel doe,cir a physician assistant failure to inform his superior or a medical doctor of a prisoner known injured leg constitutes deliberate indifference cooper dyke,cir a prison employee delay in providing medical care to an inmate known to have gunshot wounds constitutes deliberate indifference.
our consideration of whether defendants acted with deliberate indifference to the decedent serious medical needs is guided by the eleventh circuit holding in waldrop.in waldrop,the parents of a state prison inmate brought suit against prison medical personnel under,alleging that the prison officials provided grossly inadequate medical care and were thus deliberately indifferent to the inmate psychiatric needs in violation of the eighth amendment.in its analysis,the eleventh circuit described grossly inadequate medical care as medical treatment so grossly incompetent,inadequate,or excessive as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness.waldrop,at quoting rogers evans,cir.the court stated that the relevant inquiry as to whether the defendants provided grossly inadequate care was whether a reasonable doctor could have concluded his actions were lawful.id.at.in waldrop,the court affirmed the denial of defendants motion for summary judgment in a action finding that a particularized,inquiry was a necessity to the proper analysis of plaintiff claim.here,as in that case,the proper analysis of terrance claim requires a similar inquiry.
application of eighth amendment standard to defendants 
in the instant case,there are several issues of fact as to whether some defendants were deliberately indifferent to the decedent serious medical needs.each defendant is addressed below.
although we find that plaintiff has failed to state a claim as to all defendants,an analysis of this case under the grossly inadequate care standard raises a factual question regarding whether said acted with a deliberate indifference to the decedent serious medical needs.said was aware of the numerous health risks confronting the decedent.he knew that the decedent was an obese diabetic suffering from hypertension and a heart condition with abnormal ekg readings.in addition,he was also aware that the decedent was on medication which placed him at an increased risk for heat stroke.moreover,said also knew that the weather on july,was extremely hot and humid.despite this information and his knowledge of seven or eight prior hyperthermia cases at nrph,as well as the decedent susceptibility to heat stroke,said failed to follow nrph protocol and write an order restricting the decedent to stay within a cool area on the day of his collapse and subsequent demise.as a result of said failure to follow hospital protocol,the decedent went outdoors,himself,and collapsed due to the extreme weather conditions.
said conduct regarding the decedent serious medical needs is not,however,limited to his knowledge and inaction regarding the decedent medical conditions.despite being paged stat by the medical staff at and despite his knowledge of the decedent numerous health risks,said did not arrive at the hospital until approximately one hour after being paged by the nrph staff,without providing any explanation of his whereabouts.said delayed response cost the decedent precious time,during which he could have received medical treatment which may have saved his life.taken in the aggregate,said actions could constitute a finding of deliberate indifference to the decedent serious medical needs because a jury could possibly decide that a reasonable doctor,in said position,would have concluded that a substantial risk of serious harm to the decedent existed.
additionally,an analysis of this case under the grossly inadequate care standard raises a factual question regarding whether lee acted with a deliberate indifference to the decedent serious medical needs.like said,lee was also aware of the numerous health risks confronting the decedent,and knew that the decedent was an obese diabetic suffering from hypertension and a heart condition with abnormal ekg readings.moreover,lee was aware that the ward on which the decedent was located was unusually hot during the summer and knew that the heat became a health danger to patients.in addition,she was also aware that the decedent was on medication which placed him at an increased risk for heat stroke.despite this information and the decedent dehydration symptoms,lee continued to prescribe increasing amounts of psychotropic drugs to the decedent,although she knew that the drugs caused hyperthermia.
furthermore,on july,lee wanted all nrph patients to stay indoors.nevertheless,those patients with activity cards,including the decedent,were permitted to go outside that day.as a result of lee disregard of the decedent susceptibility to extreme temperature conditions,the decedent was allowed to go outdoors,himself,and collapse as a result of his exposure to the abnormally hot environment.when lee discovered the decedent stumbling down the hallway at,she immediately suspected hyperthermia but waited almost an hour for said to arrive on the ward before providing the necessary medical treatment.as such,although she knew about the decedent serious medical condition,lee chose to wait for said instead of immediately contacting another physician or the emergency team.lee delayed action also cost the decedent invaluable time,during which he could have received medical care which may have saved his life.collectively,lee actions could constitute a finding of deliberate indifference to the decedent serious medical needs because a jury could possibly decide that a reasonable doctor,in lee position,would have concluded that a substantial risk of serious harm to the decedent existed.
similar to said and lee,an analysis of this case under the grossly inadequate care standard raises a factual question regarding whether sadasivan acted with a deliberate indifference to the decedent serious medical needs.sadasivan was aware of the risk of the decedent escape.sadasivan knew that the decedent had wandered off from cat,was apprehended and returned by security,and was subsequently put on escape alert.despite his knowledge of the decedent escape risk,sadasivan discontinued the escape alert just four days later based upon the decedent statement that he did not feel like escaping.as a result of sadasivan discontinuance of the escape alert,the decedent did not receive the close supervision that he needed,was permitted to leave the ward,and was exposed to the extreme weather conditions.sadasivan inconsiderate action deprived the decedent of the close supervision that he needed to ensure his own safety and,which may have prevented the decedent from going outdoors in the extreme heat.collectively,sadasivan actions could constitute a finding of deliberate indifference to the decedent serious medical needs as a jury could possibly decide that a reasonable doctor,in sadasivan position,would have concluded that a substantial risk of serious harm to the decedent existed.
nurse owens 
there is also an existing issue of fact regarding whether nurse owens actions towards the decedent constitute a finding of deliberate indifference,when analyzed under the grossly inadequate care.like the aforementioned defendants,nurse owens was also aware of the numerous health risks confronting the decedent,including his obesity,diabetes,hypertension and increased risk of heat stroke.she also knew that the decedent needed supervision when he left the ward.moreover,nurse owens was also aware of the extreme heat and humidity on the day of the decedent death.despite her knowledge of this information,nurse owens referred the decedent to activities without supervision,on an unusually hot and humid day and in direct contravention to nrph own policy.as a result of nurse owens careless actions,the decedent was permitted to go outdoors unsupervised,himself,and collapsed after being outside in the extreme heat.
additionally,nurse owens took other actions with regard to the decedent serious medical needs.despite her knowledge of the decedent susceptibility to heat stroke,nurse owens failed to equip the decedent ward with proper medical equipment,such as ice,an ice water enema,and a rectal thermometer.in addition,nurse owens,acting together with lee,failed to immediately seek alternate medical assistance in light of said delayed response to the stat page.nurse owens delayed response also cost the decedent time,during which he could have received medical care which might have saved his life.taken in the aggregate,nurse owens actions could constitute a finding of deliberate indifference to the decedent serious medical needs because a jury could possibly decide that a reasonable nurse,in nurse owens position,would have concluded that a substantial risk of serious harm to the decedent existed.
e.the ems team 
in contrast to the above defendants,plaintiff has failed to allege with particularity sufficient material facts to support a finding that pan,nair or kim acted with deliberate indifference under the grossly inadequate care standard.pan,nair and kim did not provide direct treatment to the decedent because said and almasi had already begun treating the decedent before the emergency treatment team arrived.each of these defendants involvement with the decedent does not support a finding of deliberate indifference towards the decedent.in the present case,there is no material issue of fact as to whether any of these defendants were deliberately indifferent to the decedent serious medical needs.
similarly,plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient material facts to support a finding that almasi was deliberately indifferent to the decedent serious medical needs under the grossly inadequate care standard.without more,almasi role as medical director and drafter of nrph policies is insufficient to subject him to individual liability under the facts of this case.there is no material issue of fact as to whether almasi was deliberately indifferent to the decedent serious medical needs.
like almasi,fanning actions in her capacity as the decedent occupational therapist,viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff,likewise does not subject her to individual liability.we find that no material issue of fact exists as to whether fanning was deliberately indifferent to the decedent serious medical needs.
michigan department of mental health and nrph 
finally,the michigan department of mental health role as operator of nrph and nrph role as health care provider does not subject either to liability under the doctrine of respondeat superior in the absence of some evidence of a policy or custom that would subject these employers to liability under the facts of the case now before us.monell of social,d.under these facts,there is no material issue of fact as to whether either of these defendants had such a policy and were therefore deliberately indifferent to the decedent serious medical needs.
in light of the foregoing,plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish a question of fact regarding whether one or more defendants were deliberately indifferent to the decedent serious medical needs.the district court analyzed this case under a higher than warranted standard for deliberate indifference.the district court concluded that the individual defendants did respond to the decedent medical needs,and that,although each defendant individual response may not have been immediate,the district court found that plaintiff failed to advance facts to support a showing of deliberate indifference.the district court determined that defendants responses and attempts to treat the decedent foreclosed the possibility of deliberate indifference on defendants part.
the district court analysis ignores the lower grossly inadequate care standard for finding deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.at.under this standard,it is probable that a jury could conclude that reasonable medical professionals in said,lee,sadasivan,and nurse owens positions would have concluded that there was a substantial risk to the decedent safety,and that these defendants exhibited a deliberate indifference in treating and caring for the decedent which directly led to his death.thus,the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of said,lee,sadasivan,and nurse owens was erroneous.accordingly,we remand with instructions to send the plaintiff claims against said,lee,sadasivan and nurse owens to trial to determine whether any of these defendants had a deliberate indifference to the decedent serious medical needs under the grossly inadequate care standard.
accordingly,under the facts of this case,we find that the conduct of pan,nair,kim,almasi,fanning,the michigan department of mental health,and nrph does not support a finding of deliberate indifference.accordingly,we affirm the district court order of summary judgment in favor of these defendants on the eighth amendment claim.
fourteenth amendment 
due process violation 
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment affords incarcerated individuals the right to adequate food,shelter,clothing and medical care.youngberg romeo,d.the involuntarily committed have greater rights regarding confinement under the fourteenth amendment than criminals are due under the eighth amendment.persons who have been invo
