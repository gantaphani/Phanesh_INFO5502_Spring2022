factual and procedural background 
dyack is a physician and a citizen of canada in october,he entered into a employment contract with the cnmi to work for the department of public health at the commonwealth health center chc as an obstetrician gynecologist,for an annual salary of.the contract was entitled an excepted service employment contract,indicating that dyack was considered to be excepted from the cnmi civil service system.the contract included a certification from the director of personnel for the cnmi office of personnel management,mathilda rosario,that the contract qualified dyack as excepted service under cmc section of the commonwealth code executive order,section c.
dyack employment contract incorporated the conditions of employment set forth in a separate document.the conditions of employment provided that t he employer may terminate the employee without cause upon notice sixty days in advance of termination of employment.dyack signed the conditions of employment,as did rosario.
dyack employment at the chc began on october.on july,martin rohringer,chc director of medical affairs,handed dyack a letter of termination from the cnmi secretary of public health,joseph villagomez.the letter stated simply that the department of public health has elected not to continue your employment and that,pursuant to the conditions of employment and the cnmi excepted service personnel regulations,dyack employment would be terminated sixty days from receipt of the letter.the letter stated that the termination is not considered to be for reason of cause,and it expressed the government desire to ensure that you receive timely notification and have an opportunity to respond to this action.the letter informed dyack that he had the right to further discuss the termination with the director of personnel,and it invited him to arrange an appointment with secretary villagomez if dyack wished to discuss his termination.dyack did not contact villagomez or rosario regarding his termination.
dyack subsequently brought an action under against villagomez and the cnmi in the district court of the district of the northern mariana islands.dyack claimed that his termination without notice or a hearing deprived him of his due process rights under the fourteenth amendment because he was a member of the cnmi civil service and therefore protected from termination without notice.he also brought claims for premium pay and wrongful termination.dyack moved for partial summary judgment on the claim,and the defendants for summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity.
the district court denied dyack summary judgment motion and sua sponte granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the merits of the claim.the district court found as a matter of law that dyack was not a member of the cnmi civil service and thus not entitled to notice or a hearing.instead,the court found,dyack fell within the civil service exception of.a,which exempts employees where the service to be performed is special or unique and nonpermanent,is essential to the public interest,and it would not be practical to obtain personnel to perform such service through normal public service recruitment procedures.the court did not address the qualified immunity issue,finding it moot in light of its ruling that dyack was exempt from the civil service.the court dismissed dyack claims,declining to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.

due process claim 
dyack alleges that he was terminated without notice or an opportunity to respond,in violation of his fourteenth amendment right to due process.in order to determine whether dyack termination violated his due process rights,we must first determine whether dyack had a constitutionally protected property interest in continued employment.cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d.this court has held that a state law which limits the grounds upon which an employee may be discharged,such as conditioning dismissal on a finding of cause,creates a constitutionally protected property interest.brady gebbie,cir internal citation omitted.where,however,a state employee serves at will,he or she has no reasonable expectation of continued employment,and thus no property right.id.
