appellants carolyn knowles and joe rodriguez,filed suit in district court challenging the facial constitutionality of two city ordinances that threaten their ability to protest peacefully near an abortion clinic in waco,texas.the district court dismissed their claims.because the challenged ordinances are unconstitutional time,place,and manner regulations,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for entry of appropriate relief against the city.
background 
appellants pray,display signs,distribute literature,and counsel clinic clients on the public sidewalk outside an abortion clinic in waco,texas.rodriguez has been demonstrating outside the clinic for over ten years.
the clinic is located in a school zone,an area subject to two ordinances challenged in this action c of waco code of ordinances school zone ordinance and of waco code of ordinances parade ordinance.waco characterizes both ordinances as traffic regulations the challenged school zone ordinance provides 
school zones and crossing speed limits street activity and parades restricted.
c street activity and parades are prohibited within school zones during the hours that school zones and crossing speed limits are in effect or when warning lights are flashing.street activity shall mean a dance,party,demonstration,or any other type of public assemblage,where persons are collected together in one place,and the collection of persons is reasonably anticipated to obstruct the normal flow of traffic upon a public street,sidewalk,or other public right of way.parade shall mean a procession of pedestrians,vehicles and animals or any combination thereof along or upon a street or sidewalk,park or other public place,which does not comply with normal and usual traffic regulations or controls.the term parade shall also include a race or competition of any kind,which is reasonably anticipated to obstruct the normal flow of traffic upon a public street,sidewalk,or other public right of way.
the parade ordinance provides 
permit required exceptions.
a no person shall engage in,participate in,aid,form,or start any parade or other street activity without first applying for and obtaining from the city a permit for that parade or street activity.
b the requirement to obtain a permit shall not apply to the following 
funeral processions,which shall be regulated by section.
students going to and from school classes or participating in educational or recreational activities under the immediate direction and supervision of the proper school authorities.
a governmental agency acting within the scope of its functions.
processions or demonstrations at a fixed location which is not a street or sidewalk.
because the school zone ordinance prohibits parades and street activity in school zones only when school zone speed limits are in effect or warning lights are flashing,such activities are permitted there at other times subject,however,to the parade ordinance permit requirement.appellants have engaged and plan to engage in both street activity and parades,as defined by the ordinances.their activity does not fall within any of the exceptions to the parade permit requirement,nor are they protected by the extratextual wingspan exception,the city interpretation that excludes from the school zone ordinance people gathered together in school zones who remain at least one arm length apart from each other.
the city passed the school zone and parade ordinances in response to a series of demonstrations that allegedly caused traffic problems and compromised the safety of school children.the recitals in and preamble to ordinance,parts of which were eventually codified as the school zone and parade ordinances,reflect these traffic and safety concerns 
whereas,the health,safety and welfare of persons who use the public rights of way is of paramount importance in the regulation of the public rights of way and 
whereas,those persons who engage in street activity in certain rights of way pose a serious risk and danger to themselves and users of the public rights of way,as well as impede the orderly flow of traffic and 
whereas,those persons who engage in street activity in certain public rights of way located in school zones adjacent to schools during the hours buses and parents are dropping off or picking up children pose a serious risk and danger to the children arriving or leaving schools,as well as impede the orderly flow of traffic and 
whereas,the city council wishes to impose reasonable time and place regulations to safely and effectively control the public rights of way but also provide adequate opportunities for street activities in areas and at times when the risk of danger to children and other users of the public rights of way is lessened 
in march,waco cited approximately twenty of appellants for violating a former,broader version of the school zone ordinance fearing that they would be cited next,appellants filed this lawsuit in june,seeking relief against the challenged ordinances based on the first amendment.in september,waco amended the ordinances to their present form it then moved for summary judgment,arguing that the amendments mooted appellants claims.appellants proceeded to challenge the facial constitutionality of the new versions of the school zone and parade ordinances after taking into account the appellants amended claims and waco response,the district court denied appellants summary judgment motion and dismissed all claims.appellants appeal is before us.
ii.discussion 
whether the district court erred in denying appellants motion for summary judgment and dismissing their claims raises issues that we review de novo,applying the same legal standards as the district court.mayo hartford life ins,cir.appellants maintain that the school zone and parade ordinances are unconstitutional time,place,and manner regulations,are substantially overbroad,and are vague.because we hold that both ordinances are invalid time,place,and manner regulations,we find it unnecessary to reach appellants overbreadth and vagueness arguments.
appellants wish to continue their peaceful protests against abortion while reaching out to clinic employees and clients.the optimum time to protest coincides with school hours,precisely when the school zone ordinance potential ban is in effect.public streets a re the archetype of a traditional public forum and from time out of mind have been used for public assembly and debate.frisby schultz,d quotation marks and citations omitted.thus,the rights of the government to limit first amendment activity in a public forum are sharply circumscribed.perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d.but 
even in a public forum the government may impose reasonable restrictions on the time,place,or manner of protected speech,provided the restrictions are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,and that they leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.
ward rock against racism,d quoting clark cmty.for creative,d.
the district court determined,and appellants do not seriously dispute,that the ordinances are.at issue,therefore,are appellants contentions that neither ordinance is narrowly tailored and that they fail to leave open ample alternative channels for communication.the broad outline of the standards for these contentions is well settled.a regulation is narrowly tailored if it targets and eliminates no more than the exact source of the evil it seeks to remedy.see frisby,at.at.if a substantial portion of the burden on speech does not serve to advance the ordinance stated goals,then the ordinance is not narrowly tailored.see ward,at.at.nevertheless,the regulation need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of furthering the government interest.id.at.at.as to alternative avenues of communication,w hile the first amendment does not guarantee the right to employ every conceivable method of communication at all times and in all places,a restriction on expressive activity may be invalid if the remaining modes of communication are inadequate.members of c
