the missouri department of corrections mdc instituted a policy of prohibiting transportation for elective,abortions mdc policy.plaintiff jane roe roe requested transportation for an elective abortion,and was denied.the district court granted roe request for emergency preliminary injunctive relief,and ordered the mdc to provide roe with transportation outside of the mdc facility referred to by the parties as an outcount.roe amended her complaint and sought injunctive relief on behalf of a class consisting of all women in the custody of the mdc who seek elective,abortions.the district court certified the class plaintiffs.both parties moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted in favor of the plaintiffs.the district court reasoned the mdc policy is unreasonable under the fourteenth amendment using the test established by turner safley,d for reviewing the reasonableness of prison regulations impacting constitutional rights.the district court also found the plaintiffs eighth amendment rights were violated,determining that the desire for an elective abortion constitutes a serious medical need to which the mdc officials were deliberately indifferent.on appeal,the mdc contests both findings.although we conclude the district court erred in its eighth amendment analysis,and on one aspect of the turner analysis,we affirm the ultimate judgment.
background 
before september,the mdc had a policy of providing transportation outcounts for inmates wanting to terminate their pregnancies.on that date,the mdc altered its policy,such that inmates would be transported for abortions only i f the abortion is indicated due to threat to the mother life or health,and if approved by the medical director in consultation with the regional medical director.the mdc cited security concerns and cost savings motivating the change in policy.although treatments for other conditions and injuries may be classified as elective,the attending physician may override the general policy of denying elective medical outcounts and authorize the outcount by determining that the care is in fact medically necessary.however,under the policy regarding abortions,the mdc determined o utcounts for elective abortions will no longer be authorized.
plaintiff roe,on behalf of herself and others similarly situated,challenged the legality of this mdc policy in federal district court.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of roe,reasoning that under the turner reasonableness test,the mdc policy was an unreasonable restriction on inmates fourteenth amendment right to terminate a pregnancy.roe crawford,d.the district court also found roe eighth amendment rights were violated,determining the desire for an elective abortion constitutes a serious medical need to which the mdc officials were deliberately indifferent.id.at.
ii.standards of review 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the record most favorably to the party.tipler douglas county,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c accord knowles citicorp mortgage,cir.
certain guiding principles come into play when federal courts review policy decisions made by a state executive branch.specifically,w here,as here,the exercise of authority by state officials is attacked,federal courts must be constantly mindful of the special delicacy of the adjustment to be preserved between federal equitable power and state administration of its own law.rizzo goode,d quotation omitted see also angela clinton,cir federal courts operate according to institutional rules and procedures that are poorly suited to the management of state agencies.
iii.discussion 
turner supplies the appropriate test 
the district court found the applicable test for determining the constitutionality of the mdc policy was that articulated by the supreme court in turner.roe,d at.roe contended,as she did in her opening brief on appeal,that turner is inapplicable and her fourteenth amendment claim should be subjected to the same standard of review that would apply outside of the prison context.see id.at maintaining that the undue burden test should apply essentially,roe argued that the supreme court decision in johnson california,d should be extended.see roe,d at.in johnson,the supreme court reviewed a policy that separated inmates on the basis of race.at.in so doing,the court articulated that it had consistently held that all racial classifications imposed by government must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.id.at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the court reasoned the turner test had never applied to racial classifications,and applied only to rights that are inconsistent with proper incarceration.id.at.quotation marks and citation omitted.
racial classifications are viewed as immediately suspect,see id.at,and their usage can seriously damage the integrity of a prison system.see id.at.on the contrary,turner applies to prison restrictions relating to rights not typically subject to strict scrutiny.see id.at.listing first amendment rights,access to courts,attendance at religious services,and some due process claims such as involuntary medication and restrictions on the right to marry,as remaining subject to turner.restrictions on abortion are not subject to strict scrutiny,but are void only when they place an undue burden on access to abortion.see planned parenthood casey,d.additionally,like marriage or attendance at religious services,access to abortion involves burdens on the prison system concerning allocation of resources which necessitate either allowing inmates out of the prison setting,or bringing persons into the facilities.simply refraining from classifying prisoners on the basis of race involves no such burden.johnson,at.the right not to be discriminated against based on one race is not a right that need necessarily be compromised for the sake of proper prison administration.the district court thus properly declined to apply the undue burden test in this matter,and turner represents the proper framework for analysis 
applying turner 
prison regulations restricting constitutional guarantees are valid only if the regulations are reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.turner,at.to determine whether a prison regulation is reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest,courts consider whether there exists a valid,rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other inmates,and on the allocation of prison resources generally and the existence,or absence of obvious,easy alternatives that fully accommodate the prisoner rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests.id.at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
reasonable relationship to legitimate penological interests 
roe argues the mdc claim of security concerns was feigned,and the mdc was not entitled to turner deference.the district court noted that,at the summary judgment stage,such a determination would be inappropriate because there existed at least a genuine issue of material fact regarding the sincerity of the mdc asserted security concerns.roe,d at.the district court therefore accepted the security concerns as credible.id.this determination was appropriate,and is supported by the prison administrators testimony articulating security concerns as a motivating factor for the change in the mdc policy.the district court then found the mdc policy does not rationally and actually advance the legitimate security interest.id.
the mdc asserts alternate ways in which the policy purportedly advances security interests.first,the mdc contends any time an inmate is removed from prison,security is at risk.the mdc argues r educing security risks by reducing the number of outcounts is a rational means of furthering the legitimate penological interest in prison security.the problem with this argument is that,based on the record,the mdc policy does not appear to reduce the number of outcounts.for example,other than for those inmates released before carrying their children to term,the mdc would still need to transport the pregnant inmates on outcounts for medical examinations associated with pregnancy,including delivery.during a pregnancy,the mdc refers inmates for outcounts for a number of procedures,including some of the ultrasounds.although the mdc argues abortions may require two days,so do some deliveries.many of these procedures are provided at the expense of correctional medical services,which contracts with the mdc for the care of inmates.inmates tend to have higher factors than the general population,necessitating increased levels of prenatal care,which could increase the number of outcounts necessary during the continued pregnancies.thus,the mdc policy does not necessarily reduce the number of overall outcounts and the related security risk.
second,the mdc claims the existence of protesters and the configuration of the clinic result in higher risks to the guards and inmates,as well as a greater potential for inmates to escape.id.the concerns about heightened risks for the guards and inmates represents a far more defensible argument.accepting,as the district court did,that security concerns formed the basis of the mdc policy,sufficient evidence in the record demonstrates an attempt to minimize outcounts for abortions rationally advances this legitimate concern.for instance,a local planned parenthood president and ceo testified large numbers of protesters regularly picket the facility,write down license plate numbers,and photograph and videotape the entering vehicles.although the district court found it was undisputed that in the past eight years,picketers have never interfered with the safety or security of inmates or staff,this conclusion does not automatically make the mdc policy irrational.prison officials should not be required to wait until a problem occurs before addressing the risk.see turner,at.reasoning prisons should have the authority to anticipate security problems and to adopt innovative solutions to the intractable problems of prison administration.
roe argues that deferring to this security interest would create an impermissible heckler veto,and that the government can not allow protesters to effectively block the exercise of a legally protected activity although logically analogous,the heckler veto has been disapproved more in the context of first amendment freedom of speech,and as it relates to the general public.see,lewis wilson,cir.if the state of missouri banned abortion in general,on the basis of concerns about societal disruption due to protests at the clinics,the principle would no doubt apply and the government would be required to take steps to ensure access,rather than enacting a ban.in the prison context,it is already established that whether or not a policy infringing on constitutional rights is valid depends on a balancing test which grants far more leniency to prison administrators than the government would be granted as to the general public.see turner,at.additionally,the relative availability of the right at issue is appropriately addressed by the second turner factor.see turner,at.
given the deference owed to prison officials in such matters,see rizzo,at,the district court erred in finding the mdc policy is irrational simply because no problems occurred in the past however,the turner analysis does not end here.turner,at.
alternative means of obtaining an elective abortion 
the second factor relevant in determining the reasonableness of a prison restriction is whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates.turner,at.the district court found the mdc policy entirely eliminated plaintiffs access to elective abortions.roe,d at.this determination is correct,and weighs heavily against the validity of the mdc policy.under the mdc policy,transportation outcounts are provided only for medically necessary,therapeutic abortions due to a threat to the mother life or health.once incarcerated in the mdc,an elective abortion,which the supreme court determined is a liberty interest protected under the fourteenth amendment,is entirely unavailable.the mdc recognizes this,and argues alternative means of obtaining an elective abortion exist that is,the inmates can obtain an abortion before incarceration.this contention lacks merit.first,many inmates either will not know of their pregnancies,or will not have elected to terminate their pregnancies,before incarceration.second,the mdc points to no authority,and we find none,indicating the supreme court has determined a right may be entirely eliminated during incarceration,simply because the right could have been exercised before imprisonment.in turner,the supreme court struck down a regulation prohibiting marriage other than in exceptional circumstances.turner,at.under the mdc reasoning,a complete prohibition on marriage would have been valid,because the inmates could have chosen to marry before beginning their prison terms,or after the imprisonment ended.
in the case lending the most support to the mdc position,victoria larpenter,cir,the policy upheld by the fifth circuit did not act as a complete bar to elective abortion.see id.at elective abortion is not prohibited r ather,an inmate can receive the abortion by following a set procedure.the policy in victoria created an administrative hurdle,requiring inmates to obtain a court order authorizing an elective abortion before obtaining one.id.at.the goals of lessening outcounts,and of providing a layer of liability protection for the correctional facility,were recognized as valid.id.at.the policy was rationally related to these goals,and there were alternatives available,because the procedure was not onerous,and did not act as a complete bar to elective abortion.see id.at.the fifth circuit even distinguished monmouth county corr.instit.inmates lanzaro,cir,because the policy at issue in monmouth required inmates to get a court order releasing them on their own recognizance,making it more difficult for inmates to obtain an order of release.victoria,at emphasis added.the fifth circuit recognized that c ritically,the options allowed by the policy at issue,unlike the policy in monmouth,ensure that a pregnant inmate who wants an abortion will obtain a court order.id.emphasis added.the mdc policy goes far beyond the policy upheld in victoria,and beyond the policy struck down in monmouth a requirement that the inmate obtain a court order allowing temporary release without supervision.monmouth,at.by completely eliminating any alternative means of obtaining an elective abortion,the mdc policy represents precisely the exaggerated response to security objectives that turner forbids.turner,at.
impact on other inmates and prison resources 
the third turner factor is the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other inmates,and on the allocation of prison resources generally.id.at.the mdc contends,similar to its argument relating to security interests,that any increase in the number of outcounts places a strain on financial and staff resources that could have a negative impact on services provided to other inmates this argument fails for two reasons.first,as discussed in section iii b,supra,the policy does not logically reduce the overall number of outcounts.second,an mdc official admitted the cost savings would be minimal as compared to our general budget.thus,this factor also weighs against the reasonableness of the policy.the purported impact of the mdc policy is so minimal that it further demonstrates the mdc policy represents an exaggerated response to security objectives.see turner,at.
the existence of ready alternatives 
the fourth prong of turner focuses on the absence or existence of ready alternatives.at.i f an inmate claimant can point to an alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests,a court may consider that as evi
