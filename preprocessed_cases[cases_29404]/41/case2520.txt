background 
crawley was charged in oklahoma state court with possession of a stolen vehicle after former conviction of two or more felonies and driving with a suspended license.though he faced more than twenty years in prison,crawley rejected the state offer of six years incarceration in exchange for a guilty plea and insisted on going to trial.dissatisfied with his first counsel,crawley filed a pro se motion for different counsel.before the court could consider the motion,appointed counsel left the public defender office and crawley case was reassigned to assistant public defender greg graves.
graves requested crawley undergo a competency determination,fearing his obsession with matters not relevant to his defense was interfering with his ability to communicate with counsel.doc,ex.a at quotations omitted.the court appointed william cooper to examine crawley.cooper concluded crawley was able to appreciate the nature of the charges against him but was incompetent to stand trial because he was unable to consult with his attorney and rationally assist in the preparation of his defense.crawley was not satisfied with cooper conclusions he believed he was competent and welcomed a trial.the issue of crawley competence was put to a jury,an odd reversal of government argued crawley was incompetent and graves,suppressing his misgivings,argued the opposite 
at the competency hearing,the government called cooper,who testified crawley was incompetent.without making a formal diagnosis,cooper stated crawley was somewhat guarded and suspicious,was unable to organize his thoughts in a coherent,cohesive manner,heard voices,believed god had been speaking to him,and exhibited paranoid thinking.doc.at.the state also called crawley,who testified to his understanding of the criminal proceedings and explained to the jury that he was,in fact,competent to stand trial and wanted to do so.both cooper and crawley were subject to cross examination.graves called no witnesses on crawley behalf,but did argue,contrary to the state position and in spite of cooper opinion,that the evidence supported a finding of competency so the evidence came down to cooper opinion,which he explained to the jury and crawley testimony,insisting he was competent.crawley demonstrated a knowledge of the pending charges and the possible punishments.he was able to explain motion practice and his dissatisfaction with his prior attorney,who missed deadlines.he told the jury how charges in a prior case were dismissed because the state was not ready when the case was called.he demonstrated a knowledge of pleas and plea bargains.he knew a guilty plea waived appellate review most of the time.as is its prerogative,the jury agreed with crawley,finding him competent.he was later convicted by a different jury of possession of a stolen vehicle and sentenced to years incarceration.
in an apparent case of buyer remorse,crawley appealed to the occa,arguing his conviction should be reversed because,among other things,he was forced to testify against his will at the competency hearing the evidence was insufficient to support the jury finding of competency and his counsel was ineffective at the competency hearing.in an unpublished summary opinion,the occa rejected his claims.
the occa determined it was proper for crawley to be called to testify at the competency hearing because his counsel requested the hearing and,under oklahoma law,a defendant may be called to testify against his will if he initiated the competency proceeding.the occa likewise rejected crawley sufficiency of the evidence argument,concluding that,despite cooper opinion,the jury was within its province in giving greater weight to crawley testimony that he was competent.doc,ex.c at.relying on nelson state,and strickland washington,d,the occa held crawley failed to show that trial counsel conduct was deficient in following his ethical obligation to abide by his client wishes to be found competent and proceed to trial.doc,ex.c at.
crawley filed a pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus under,which the district court denied in a thorough and cogent opinion.we granted crawley application for a certificate of appealability coa and appointed counsel to represent him on appeal.crawley challenges only the occa rejection of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,arguing his lawyer was ineffective by accommodating crawley preference to be found competent despite counsel personal misgivings and the contrary opinions of cooper and the prosecutor.
ii.discussion 
in an appeal of the dismissal of a federal habeas corpus petition,we review a district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.maynard boone,cir quotations omitted,cert.denied,d.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d,establishes the requirements for granting a writ of habeas corpus to a state prisoner.it provides in pertinent part 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in the state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states 
d emphasis added.
crawley argues the state court decision that counsel had to defer to leon crawley on the issue of his own matter the medical proof or counsel own an objectively unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.appellant supp.opening br.at.he contends this conclusion follows inescapably from the supreme court decision four decades ago in pate robinson,d.id.at.
in pate,the court held the trial court deprived robinson of his constitutional right to a fair trial by failing to hold a competency hearing.at.it noted that counsel throughout the proceedings insisted that robinson present sanity competence to stand trial was very much in issue and decided a competency hearing was necessary based on the uncontradicted testimony of robinson history of pronounced irrational behavior.id.at.the court rejected the state argument that robinson waived a competency determination by failing to demand a hearing,saying it is contradictory to argue that a defendant may be incompetent,and yet knowingly or intelligently waive his right to have the court determine his capacity to stand trial.id.at.the court observed while robinson demeanor at trial might be relevant to the ultimate decision as to his sanity competence to stand trial,it can not be relied upon to dispense with a hearing on that very issue.id.at.
the only conclusion inescapably flowing from pate is that,at most,a competency hearing is required where the evidence before the court strongly suggests the defendant competence is questionable.this case is quite the opposite.here,a competency hearing was held and a jury found crawley to be competent.
