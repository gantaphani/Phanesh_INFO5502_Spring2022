procedural background 
this lawsuit was initially filed by edward augustine pursuant to the qui tam provisions of the fca.the department of justice later intervened.on may,the secretary of the united states department of labor also filed a complaint under the employee retirement income security act erisa,against the same defendants,alleging that they had breached their fiduciary duties to the esop.the two cases were later consolidated for discovery and trial.
the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the government,by filing lawsuits under both erisa and the fca,was pursuing inconsistent remedies.following oral argument,the district court denied the defendants motion,holding that the doctrine was inapplicable because the fca and erisa actions address separate injuries to different parties.

liability for false claims 
the purpose of the false claims act is to provide for restitution to the government of money taken from it by fraud.united states hess.liability under the fca occurs where a person or entity 
knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government or a member of the armed forces of the united states a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval 
knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government or 
knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to conceal,avoid,or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government 
a.the fca provides for treble damages and a civil penalty of not less than and not more than for each false claim.id.
for the purposes of this case,the relevant elements of a fca claim are that the claim or record submitted was false or fraudulent,and the person or entity who submitted the claim or record acted knowingly.under the statute,a person will be found to have knowingly committed an act only if he or she acts with actual knowledge,deliberate ignorance,or reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information.b.the fca does not,however,define false or fraudulent.
because the supreme court has held that the fca is intended to reach all types of fraud,without qualification,that might result in financial loss to the government,united states,d,a number of courts have interpreted the phrase false or fraudulent broadly.our own court,for example,in united states midwest specialties,cir,concluded that the maxim that m en must turn square corners when they deal with the government applies fully in the fca context.other circuits have endorsed the implied certification theory of liability first laid out in,united states,holding liable pursuant to the fca after concluding that the company submission of payment vouchers to the small business administration sba represented an implied certification of its continued compliance with the requirements of the sba program in question,aff,unpublished table decision.see mikes straus,cir concluding that implied false certification is appropriately applied where the underlying statute or regulation expressly states that payment is conditioned on compliance shaw aaa eng g drafting,cir holding that the language and structure of the fca itself supports the conclusion that,under a,a false implied certification may constitute a false or fraudulent claim quotation marks omitted.
