responding to growing concerns about widespread abuse of oxycontin,a schedule ii narcotic opioid often prescribed to treat chronic pain,the federal drug enforcement administration dea in launched a public campaign called the oxycontin action plan to ferret out unlawful uses of the drug.david demaret chube ii and his brother charles randall chube david and randy,respectively,or,collectively,the doctors were two of the hundreds of physicians investigated by the dea for possible illegitimate prescribing of the drug.on february,the doctors were charged in a indictment with unlawful distribution of controlled substances,health care fraud,and conspiracy to commit each of those offenses.after a jury trial,the jury acquitted randy of out of charges,and acquitted david of out of charges,rejecting both the conspiracy charges and many distribution charges.it found randy guilty of one count of unlawful distribution and david guilty of four counts of unlawful distribution and two counts of defrauding a health benefit program.
after the sentencing hearing,at which relevant conduct findings played a critical role in enhancing each brother advisory guidelines range,the district court sentenced randy to five years imprisonment and david to years.both men appeal.we affirm their convictions,but we vacate both sentences and remand for resentencing.
the doctors jointly owned a clinic,great lakes family health center,which opened its doors in in gary,indiana they opened a second office two years later in nearby munster,indiana.prior to starting the great lakes clinic,the two had practiced medicine with their father in gary.during the years that the doctors operated their clinics,many patients came to them seeking relief from severe chronic pain.like many practitioners,the doctors treated some of these complaints with oxycontin,a drug that has received praise from organizations and specialists for its ability to alleviate debilitating pain.from to,the drug maker,purdue pharma,openly and,we now know,falsely marketed oxycontin to physicians as a alternative to other drugs.because of an emerging realization that oxycontin was addictive and thus prone to abuse,the drug eventually attracted the dea attention.
the dea was led to the doctors by one of their patients,william perry mitchell,who lived in benton harbor,michigan,about miles from the great lakes clinic in gary.he was one of several patients from that area.although the doctors had several legitimate patients,the proof at trial showed that others had no real medical complaints and went to the doctors clinic solely to obtain oxycontin.mitchell was arrested on september,and charged in the district court for the western district of michigan with knowingly and intentionally distributing oxycontin pills.mitchell and his girlfriend had obtained the pills in question using prescriptions written by either david or randy.in exchange for a provision in his plea agreement offering a possible reduction in his sentence,mitchell agreed to name his suppliers,to testify against them,and to bring more witnesses to the government who would do the same.mitchell fulfilled all parts of his bargain,as did the government.
the parties briefs present starkly different portraits of the defendants and their conduct.we note,however,that at this stage we must view the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.see jackson virginia,d united states thompson,cir.according to the doctors,the evidence demonstrated that they believed,in good faith and with good reason,that their patients were seeking treatment for true medical complaints.the problem they face is that the jury did not have to accept their protestations.but the doctors also raise a legal argument their convictions,they argue,assess their actions by reference to the standard of care applicable in a civil malpractice suit,but the proper standard is the one found in the controlled substances act csa,which authorizes the conviction of a registered practitioner only if the prescription was written without a legitimate medical purpose and outside the scope of professional practice.the government urges us to conclude that the evidence supports a finding that the doctors were not using their medical licenses to treat patients with true complaints,but were acting as common drug dealers,earning substantial amounts of money by prescribing drugs to addicts whom they knew had no legitimate medical complaints and without conducting sufficient physical examinations,diagnostic tests,or other appropriate inquiries or procedures to determine that the prescriptions were warranted.the jury found,the government continues,that this conduct violated the csa and thus went beyond simple malpractice.in other words,it found that the doctors were acting not as physicians,but as profiteering.
the jury drew careful lines in its verdict.it exonerated the doctors on the great majority of the charges,but it did convict randy on one count of unlawful distribution,and david on four counts of unlawful distribution and two counts of health care fraud.on appeal,the doctors support their argument about the erroneous use of the malpractice standard with an attack on two of the government expert witnesses,theodore parran and robert barkin.their testimony allegedly conflated the civil and criminal standards of care and thus created a risk that the jury found liability not because it concluded that the doctors acts of prescribing medications fell outside the scope of legitimate medical practice,but instead because it thought they had been careless.the doctors also argue that the experts testimony should not have been admitted because each impermissibly testified to legal conclusions.
the government case was not limited to these two experts.the jury also heard from patients,of whom testified that they were suffering from true medical problems when they consulted the doctors the other four confessed that they fabricated their complaints solely to obtain painkillers.all said that they reported severe pain to the doctors.those who fabricated their complaints said they did not tell the doctors that they were lying or that they were addicted to the drugs,for doing so would have thwarted their efforts to obtain the pills.the battleground of the litigation,then,was whether the doctors knew that no legitimate medical reason existed for prescribing painkillers to these patients.
at sentencing,the district court relevant conduct findings dramatically enhanced each defendant advisory guidelines range.before adding the relevant conduct,randy was facing an advisory guidelines range of to months imprisonment because this fell within zone a of the guidelines grid,probation alone would have been permissible.david was looking at an advisory guidelines range of to months in prison.relying primarily on spreadsheets of alleged unlawful prescriptions compiled by the government,which included any prescription for a controlled substance found in any of the patient files seized in the government searches of the defendants clinics,and on the expert testimony of parran,the district court found that each defendant was responsible for all controlled among others oxycontin,vicodin,and either doctor had prescribed to the patients whose charts had been admitted into evidence at trial.the court then sentenced randy to months imprisonment,and david to months.we discuss below additional details of the sentencing proceedings,where relevant.
we first address the arguments that the doctors raise against their convictions.they focus on the expert testimony of two government witnesses,theodore parran and robert barkin.parran,who specializes in internal medicine and addiction medicine,evaluated all patient files in the record.based on that review,he concluded that the prescribing was not done consistent with the usual standards of medical practice and thus was not done with a legitimate medical purpose.barkin was called as an expert on pharmacology.though not a medical doctor,barkin received his doctorate in clinical pharmacy in and is by various associations for pain management and forensic medicine.like parran,barkin testified solely on the basis of the patient charts,although he reviewed only a selection.he,too,concluded that the prescriptions in the charts that he reviewed were issued o utside the scope of medical practice,not for legitimate purposes.
the doctors offer two reasons why both experts testimony should have been excluded in response to their motion in limine.they have an uphill battle,because our review is only for abuse of discretion.united states watts,cir.the scope of their motion was the subject of some dispute.the government describes it as a breathtakingly broad motion that sought to rule out all expert testimony that would suggest a violation of the standard of care applicable in civil medical malpractice cases.this,the government argued,went too far.while it conceded that the expert testimony would not be conclusive on the question of the doctors criminal liability,it argued that such evidence was relevant to circumstantially establishing that the defendants had knowingly and intentionally distributed drugs as mere rather than in the course of a professional medical practice.for their part,the doctors protest that they have at all times recognized that the experts testimony had some relevance.the goal of their motion was only somehow to limit the admissibility of such evidence when it tended to conflate the civil and criminal standards,not to exclude it entirely.but the memorandum supporting the defendants motion offers more support for the government position 
t he purpose of this motion in limine is to request that this court enter a preliminary ruling prohibiting the government from introducing any evidence at trial that the chubes treatment of patients did not conform to the standards of medical practice,or any other evidence that would be suggestive of a violation of the civil standard of care applicable in medical malpractice cases.
the district court was entitled to take the doctors at their word.on that understanding it did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion in limine.
the doctors also argue that the district court committed reversible error when it failed to exclude or strike the evidence during the trial,once it became clear that the testimony was creating precisely the type of confusion that the motion in limine sought to prevent.the net result,they assert,was effectively to reduce the government burden from the standard of criminal intent to the negligence requirement that applies to civil malpractice.furthermore,they argue,the experts provided what amounted to impermissible legal conclusions on the ultimate question of the doctors intent.we address these two points in turn.
in order to support a violation of the csa,the jury had to find that the doctors knowingly and intentionally acted outside the course of professional practice and without a legitimate medical purpose.an implementing regulation issued under the csa,reiterates this standard a prescription for a controlled substance,to be effective,must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice.see,united states bek,cir t o convict a practitioner registered to distribute controlled substances of violating a,the government must show that he prescribed controlled substances outside the course of professional practice.see also united states moore,d.as one court summarized it 
t o convict a practitioner under a,the government must prove that the practitioner distributed controlled substances,that the distribution of those controlled substances was outside the usual course of professional practice and without a legitimate medical purpose,and that the practitioner acted with intent to distribute the drugs and with intent to distribute them outside the course of professional practice.in other words,the jury must make a finding of intent not merely with respect to distribution,but also with respect to the doctor intent to act as a pusher rather than a medical professional.
united states feingold,cir emphasis in original.
when all is said and done,we agree with the government that it is impossible sensibly to discuss the question whether a physician was acting outside the usual course of professional practice and without a legitimate medical purpose without mentioning the usual standard of care.it is true that the experts did not,every time,spell out the fact that something more than conduct below the usual standard of care was needed to show an absence of a valid medical purpose.even the district court was not always as clear as it might have been although as far as we can tell it never misspoke within the hearing of the jury.during a pretrial motions hearing,for example,the district court indicated its belief that reliance on the civil standard of care could be a permissible theory of the case for the government 
b oth sides are entitled to put in their theory of the case.and if the prosecution theory of the case is that these doctors have dispensed drugs improperly because they did do the proper,that may be a question of fact for the jury.you may not like the way they do it,but i do know that the government ca do that.
the following exchange at the trial,however,was more typical 
by the prosecution doctor,would you like me to repeat the question 
the witness i believe i recall it pretty well it is never appropriate to write a prescription for the spouse of a patient when that prescription is intended for the patient even more so when it a schedule ii narcotic it not consistent with the usual course of medical practice.
and that would not be for a legitimate medical purpose,correct 
the court counsel,this is being asked regarding standard of care,not legality 
prosecution absolutely,your honor.
thus,what the jury heard was an opinion from the expert that no legitimate medical purpose existed for the prescription in question and a clarification from the court that the standard of care is an issue distinct from the question of legality.the former was just what defense counsel,during a sidebar immediately preceding this exchange,had argued that parran could testify to,and the latter reflected the distinction that the doctors now claim was not properly drawn during the trial.we are satisfied that the district court did not abuse its discretion in permitting this line of questioning and that a properly instructed jury could keep the relevant concepts straight.given this finding,we need not address the doctors failure at crucial points to object to this line of inquiry.
the doctors also argue that the district court charge to the jury was insufficient to cure the confusion created by the experts testimony.given the practical reading we give to jury instructions,see united states matthews,cir,we find no merit in this point either.the district court instructions to the jury contained no inaccurate statements of the law.viewing the charge as a whole,we see several points at which the instructions make clear that liability can not attach unless no legitimate medical purpose existed for the prescription.the charge elaborated on the meaning of the phrases in the course of professional practice and no legitimate medical purpose 
a controlled substance is prescribed by a physician in the course of his professional practice,and therefore lawfully,if the substance is prescribed by him in good faith in medically treating a patient.
good faith means good intentions and the honest exercise of good professional judgment as to a patient medical needs.good faith means an observance of conduct in accordance with what the physician should reasonably believe to be proper medical practice.
in order to determine whether or not a prescription or prescriptions were issued in the course of a defendant physician professional practice,you may consider all of the evidence of circumstances surrounding the prescribing of the substance in question,the statements of the parties to the prescription transactions,any expert testimony as to what is the usual course of medical practice,and any other competent evidence bearing on the purpose for which the substances in question were prescribed.
unless you find beyond a reasonable doubt that an act of prescribing charged in the superceding indictment was not done in the course of his professional practice,then you should find the defendant you are considering not guilty of the charge you are considering.
in addition,the court permitted defense counsel to draw out the distinctions between the civil and criminal burdens during opening statements,and closing arguments.
though it is true that the jury instructions did not spell out the distinction between the civil and criminal burdens of proof as expressly as the court did in a case reviewed by the fourth circuit,see united states alerre,cir,there is no one right way to convey the governing standards.this is particularly true where,as here,the defense made no effort even to propose the desired instruction.if it were vital to the defense that the jury receive further clarification on this issue,then the defense should have submitted a proposed instruction.in sum,the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing this expert testimony.its instructions to the jury accurately described the governing standards,and the doctors failure to make any contemporaneous objection or to propose an alternative or additional instruction was fatal to their claim on appeal for reversible error.
the doctors second challenge to the government expert witnesses is that their testimony invaded the province of the jury by giving opinions on the ultimate legal question whether they knowingly violated the law.after raising this objection in their motion in limine,the doctors did not repeat it during the trial.if the ruling on the motion in limine was definitive,then this was enough to preserve the argument.see.a.here,the court did not signal any willingness to reconsider its ruling during the trial,and so we apply the usual abuse of discretion standard to this part of the case.
the question whether the district court improperly allowed the prosecution experts to testify as to impermissible legal conclusions boils down to an inquiry into the court application of,which permits an expert to testify about an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact,rule a,but nonetheless prohibits the expert from stating an opinion or inference about whether the defendant did or did not have the mental state or condition constituting an element of the crime charged or of a defense thereto,rule b.we must decide whether,in opining that the doctors wrote prescriptions with no legitimate medical purpose,the experts in this case crossed the line established by rule b.
the government argues that neither parran nor barkin ever claimed to know the doctors intent,and so the opinions that they offered were not barred by rule b.particularly since the defense raised no contemporaneous objection,we agree with this position,though we note that portions of parran testimony come close to a statement about the doctors mental state.for example,when testifying about various red flags that signal behavior,parran stated that these flags result in a situation where a doctor is knowingly,rather than inadvertently,doing harm to a patient.he then said that when enough red flags have appeared,one can say that a doctor knew or should have known that harm was being done with these prescriptions.but these statements are phrased in general terms a doctor in x situation and do not refer directly to the defendants.the district court thus did not abuse its discretion when it did not,on its own motion,intervene and halt this line of inquiry.
the doctors case is strikingly similar to one from the eighth circuit,united states katz,cir.notably,the expert whose testimony was at issue in katz was none other than theodore parran.in katz,the eighth circuit rejected the defendant argument that parran had impermissibly testified about katz criminal intent.acknowledging that rule b prohibits experts from stating an opinion as to whether the defendant had the requisite mental state for the crime charged,the court was nevertheless satisfied that parran did not testify regarding the subjective mental state of katz upon writing the prescriptions charged in the indictment.id.at.the same is true in this case,for while parran stated his opinion that no legitimate medical purpose justified the prescriptions in the files he reviewed,he repeatedly cautioned that he was looking only at the files and that he had never had any contact with either the patients or the doctors.the same applies to barkin testimony.
the defense urges us to reject katz,but we see no reason to do so.its reasoning is sound,and it is consistent with similar decisions from this court.in united states glover,cir,for example,we confronted a challenge to testimony from a law enforcement official that stated an opinion about the criminal nature of a defendant activities.we noted that this court has held on multiple occasions that such testimony should not be excluded under rule b as long as it is made clear,either by the court expressly or in the nature of the examination,that the opinion is based on the expert knowledge of common criminal practices,and not on some special knowledge of defendant mental processes.id.at quoting united states lipscomb,cir.we also have upheld the admission of expert testimony to the effect that financial transactions did not comply with regulations and appeared to be fraudulent.united states davis,cir citing united states owens,cir.
we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony of parran and barkin.the court repeatedly told the jury that only the court can instruct the jury on what is or is not legal,and the expert witnesses in this case did not go so far as to offer an opinion on the doctors subjective intent.
we turn now to the doctors challenge to their sentences.they raise a single,though central,argument that the district court erred in its determination of relevant conduct for purposes of sentencing guideline.at the sentencing hearing,the district court concluded that although the jury had acquitted the defendants on most of the charged offenses,the government had established by clear and convincing evidence that the defendants were guilty of all of the conduct described in the presentence investigation reports psrs.the district court noted that the less rigorous standard likely would have been sufficient,but in light of lingering doubt on this question at the time of the hearing,the court opted for the higher threshold.since then,united states reuter,cir,has made it clear that it is the preponderance standard that applies to findings by a judge during sentencing.but even when we apply the proper preponderance standard to this record,we can not conclude that the government evidence was sufficient to include as relevant conduct all of the activities described in the psrs.
we begin by emphasizing that the burden in the sentencing proceedings was on the government to show that a given prescription had no legitimate medical purpose and was not dispensed in the usual course of medical practice.to meet that burden,the government produced spreadsheets that listed every prescription for a controlled substance contained in the patient files in evidence.the spreadsheets listed the patient name,the date of the prescription,the type of pill prescribed,and the dose.the probation officer used the spreadsheets and the pill totals that they tallied for the psrs relevant conduct calculations.those totals were as follows 
david prescribed mg percocet pills mg percocet pills ms contin mg pills oxycontin mg pills oxycontin mg pills oxycontin mg pills oxycontin mg pills vicodin pills tussionex pills xanax pills pills and valium pills.converting the weights of those pills to marijuana,as provided in,resulted in a marijuana equivalent of kilograms of marijuana.
randy prescribed percocet mg pills ms contin mg pills oxycontin mg pills oxycontin mg pills oxycontin mg pills oxycontin mg pills vicodin pills tussionex pills xanax pills pills valium pills and triazolam pills.the marijuana equivalent of these pills was kilograms of marijuana.
after adding a enhancement to each doctor offense level for the use of a special skill,see app.note,the p
