woodstock is a care skilled nursing facility snf in ohio that participates in the federal medicare and the ohio medicaid programs.it houses residents,half of whom were diagnosed with dementia and more than of whom displayed behavioral symptoms of dementia.on february,inspectors of the ohio department of health,under delegated authority from hhs to supervise facilities like woodstock,and acting upon a complaint by a woodstock employee,launched a survey of the facility,which concluded on march.the inspectors,registered nurses with training and extensive experience in such surveys,conducted four more visits to woodstock,on march,and and april.during their survey,they noted the following incidents.
resident was admitted on september,and suffered from organic brain disorder,ethanol alcohol dependency,and seizures.wore an electronic tracking device,which triggered an alarm when the device passed through any door to the outside world.on january,made his first attempt at elopement.he was discovered missing at and was returned eighty minutes later after being found in a roadside ditch by a cornfield,two miles away.in response,woodstock installed a camera trained on the fence surrounding a patio area over which was assumed to have fled.on january,was noted attempting to climb the fence at,but he returned when asked.at,he once again attempted to scale the fence but failed.at,called and asked the police to rescue him from woodstock.at,he finally managed to climb the fence and escape.at,he was discovered by a woodstock staff member wandering the streets without shoes or coat,despite the low temperatures in the january night,and was convinced to return.on february or,woodstock installed an alarm on the fence,but due to lack of training of woodstock staff,the alarm only became operational on march.
was also violent towards other inmates.despite having a known history of assault,he was assigned to share a room with a old resident with organic brain disorder.assaulted his roommate on three occasions in december.the first assault resulted in a scalp laceration that required stapling.a later assault included pulling these staples.also assaulted two other residents while at woodstock.in response,received counseling and had his medication altered,but without effect.received his first psychological evaluation on march.on march,he assaulted another resident.
resident,a old woman suffering alzheimer disease and advancing dementia,was admitted on january.prior to her admission,she had been a frequent visitor to her husband,also a resident at woodstock.on the day of her admission,another visitor who remembered as a visitor held open the door for her,allowing her to escape.while she was only able to walk with the aid of a walker,she made it past a large,unfenced pond and rubble from a burned building to a nearby busy street corner.she was found there minutes later by woodstock staff,who convinced her to return.
resident,a old man suffering from alzheimer disease and dementia,was admitted on january.at admission,he was heavily medicated and barely aware,or snowed.over the following months,woodstock staff experimented with altered dosage levels in order to allow him to return to a more active mental state.however,whenever dosage levels sank too low,became highly agitated and demanded to leave.on one occasion,on february,he became unsnowed unexpectedly and managed to escape through a long,unlocked window,opening to an unfenced area,of the room in which woodstock had placed him.he was returned to woodstock,displaying scratches,thirty minutes later.
resident,a old man diagnosed with schizophrenia,dementia,and parkinson disease,was admitted on december,who had a history of verbal and physical aggression,delusions,combative behavior,and refusal of care and medications,was on medication for seizures,parkinson disease,and.while on medication,suffered violent mood swings between gentle states and extreme aggression.while at woodstock,he committed more than half a dozen assaults against other residents.he attacked one resident four times,causing hematoma on multiple occasions.the assaulted resident also needed sutures to close a head wound caused by breaking a chair on his head.also attacked several other residents.a total of episodes of verbal and physical aggressiveness and combativeness were recorded.nevertheless,received no psychological or psychiatric care.on february,he committed another assault and was found wearing a belt around his neck.woodstock discharged him to the veterans administration the same day.
based on these reports and memoranda submitted by the inspectors and on their recommendation,hcfa concluded that woodstock had allowed conditions to persist that placed patients at risk and was therefore out of compliance with a total of eighteen administrative requirements.while the underlying incidents had largely occurred before the beginning of the survey,hcfa found that the conditions that allowed them to occur had existed at least from march,when the survey concluded,through march,when woodstock took sufficient corrective measures.with respect to the most serious administrative violation,deemed to be at the level creating immediate jeopardy to the residents,hcfa concluded that a sufficient remedy was in place on march.hcfa assessed a cmp against woodstock of for each of the eleven days there was immediate jeopardy to residents and for each of the two remaining days.hcfa also ordered additional monitoring of woodstock.however,hhs eventually rejected the inspectors recommendations to terminate woodstock provider agreement.
on march,hcfa issued to woodstock a notice of imposition of remedies.woodstock requested a hearing,under,in front of an hhs alj.at the hearing,the three inspectors who had participated in the survey and three of woodstock employees testified.the alj issued a decision in favor of hhs on all issues.woodstock appealed to the dab,which affirmed the alj decision in its entirety.woodstock then filed a complaint against hhs in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio.in it,woodstock alleged that the dab decision was not supported by reliable,probative,and substantial evidence,that the rationale supporting the decision was arbitrary and capricious,that the decision was contrary to h,and that it violated woodstock federal constitutional due process rights.the district court concluded that the circuit courts of appeal have exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to cmps and therefore transferred the case to us.
some issues,while prominent earlier in the litigation,need not concern us here.there are no substantial disputes remaining about the underlying facts.while the parties stress different facts and slight discrepancies remain on issues such as the exact length of certain elopements,the facts as stated above are consistent with both accounts.nor is there any question regarding jurisdiction.the parties also agree on the applicable standards of review.woodstock has not appealed the seventeen incidents of at levels below those presenting immediate jeopardy to residents,so we need not consider the daily cmp of.the sole issue remaining is whether the undisputed facts constituted,as a matter of law,a violation of that created immediate jeopardy to the r
