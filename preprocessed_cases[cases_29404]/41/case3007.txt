background 
cardiac guide catheters have been used to diagnose and treat heart disease since the late.a cardiac guide catheter is a long thin plastic tube with a preformed tip that comes in a variety of sizes and configurations.the method of using a cardiac guide catheter involves first inserting a wire into the catheter to straighten the preformed tip.once the wire is inside the catheter,the catheter is inserted into the femoral artery and advanced to the aorta of the heart.the catheter is further advanced up the descending aorta,over the aortic arch,and down the ascending aorta until the tip of the catheter reaches a position at or near the opening,ostium of the coronary artery.the wire is then removed from the catheter,which allows the tip of the catheter to return to its preformed shape.as the catheter tip returns to its shape,it moves into the desired position specifically,the tip of the catheter is inserted into the coronary ostium while another portion of the catheter rests against the opposing wall of the aorta to provide support.hereinafter,the portion of a guide catheter that rests against the opposing wall of the aorta is referred to as the contact portion of the guide catheter.
voda patents 
the three are all directed to an advantageous orientation of the guide catheter in the aortic complex.patent patent patent.all three patents issued from applications of a common parent application,namely,patent app.
the patent claims guide catheters with a significant change in the overall of the catheter in order to maximize backup support for distal advancement of a balloon catheter through the guide catheter.patent.claim of the patent reads as follows 
a femoral approach angioplasty guide catheter adapted for selective catheterization of a left main coronary artery within a cardiovascular system comprising 
an elongate flexible tubular member in a relaxed state prior to insertion in the cardiovascular system further comprising in consecutive arrangement 
a first straight proximal portion extending distally from a proximal end of the tubular member 
a second straight portion joined to the first straight portion and having a length of about to centimeters 
a tertiary curved portion defining a junction of the first straight portion and the second straight portion and defining a vertex of an obtuse angle of to between the first and second straight portions 
a secondary curved portion joined to the second straight portion and having an arcuate curvature of about to and a radius of curvature of about centimeter 
a third straight portion joined to the secondary curved portion 
a fourth straight portion joined to the third straight portion and having a distal end defining a terminal distal tip of the tubular member and 
a primary curved portion a junction of the third straight portion and the fourth straight portion and defining a vertex of an obtuse angle of to between the third and fourth straight portions,
wherein the interiors of the tertiary curved portion and every curve portion distal thereof,including the secondary curved portion and the primary curved portion,all generally face each other,
wherein the first straight portion,second straight portion,third straight portion,and fourth straight portion all lie in generally the same plane,the third straight portion and the fourth straight portion extending slightly out of plane to the extent that the fourth straight portion overlaps the first straight portion,and 
wherein the length of the fourth straight portion is approximately equal to the sum of the length of the third straight portion and the radius of curvature of the secondary curved portion.
patent emphasis added.in the written description of the patent,the second straight portion is identified as the portion of the catheter that engages the wall of the aorta opposite the coronary ostium during use along with a proximal portion of the secondary curve portion.id.at.the engagement of the second straight portion with the wall of the aorta is described as providing a large area of general backup support which makes it quite difficult to dislodge the guide catheter from its desired orientation during use.id.cordis argues that its xb catheters do not infringe claim of the patent because they do not meet the second straight portion limitation.for discussion purposes,this opinion will refer to claim of the patent as the straight claim.
claims through of the patent are method claims.claim is representative 
a method for advancing a catheter through the aorta and into a coronary ostium,the aorta having an arch and an inner wall opposite the ostium,comprising the steps of 
providing a catheter including an elongate catheter body having a proximal end and a distal end and having a central lumen from the proximal end to the distal end adapted to slidably receive a therapeutic catheter,the catheter body including a tip at the distal end of the catheter body adapted to removably lodge in the coronary artery ostium 
advancing the catheter body distal end through the aortic arch and 
engaging the aorta inner wall with a portion of the catheter body such that when the distal end of the catheter is positioned in the ostium,the catheter body engages the opposite wall of the aorta along a line having a length of about cm or greater.
patent emphasis added.with respect to claims through of the patent,cordis argues that the district court misconstrued along a line that cordis does not infringe claims through under a proper construction of along a line and that under the district court construction of along a line,claims through of the patent are invalid for obviousness or anticipation.
the patent includes both apparatus and method claims.for purposes of this discussion,claim is representative of both the method and apparatus claims 
an assembly for guiding the path of a therapeutic catheter,comprising 
an elongate tubular member including a proximal shaft portion,a profiled portion,and a substantially straight tip portion 
the profiled portion comprising,in order from the proximal shaft portion to the tip portion,a first bend,a first substantially straight leg,a second bend,a second substantially straight leg,and a third bend 
the first bend,the first substantially straight leg,the second bend,the second substantially straight leg,and the third bend being disposed within a chamber of an aorta 
a distal end of the tip portion being disposed within an ostium defined by the aorta 
the first substantially straight leg seating against a wall of the aorta opposite the ostium of the coronary artery and 
the elongate tubular member defining a lumen extending from a distal end of the elongate tubular member to a proximal end of the elongate tubular member,wherein the lumen is constructed and arranged to receive the therapeutic catheter.
patent emphases added.here,the first substantially straight leg corresponds to the second straight portion of the patent as well as the second straight portion of the patent written description.cordis argues that its xb catheters do not infringe the patent because the xb catheters do not meet the first substantially straight leg limitation,which appears in all the claims of the patent.in addition,as with the claims of the patent,claims and of the patent contain a first substantially straight leg limitation.thus,cordis also argues that its xb catheters do not infringe claims and of the patent for failure to meet the first substantially straight leg limitation.for the sake of discussion,this opinion will refer to all claims of the patent and claims and of the patent as the substantially straight claims.
cordis xb catheter 
the accused product in this case is cordis xb catheter.the original version of cordis xb catheter,which was made and sold prior to the issuance of voda patents,included a second straight portion as claimed in the patent.however,before the voda patents issued,cordis redesigned its xb catheter by replacing the second straight portion with a curved portion.for discussion purposes,this opinion will refer to this curved portion as the redesigned curve portion.the only aspects of the infringement judgment that cordis challenges are whether the redesigned curve portion of the xb catheter meets the along a line limitation of claims through of the patent under a proper claim construction and whether it meets the straight and substantially straight limitations of the,and patents under the doctrine of equivalents.

claim construction of the patent 
claim terms must be given the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention.phillips awh,en banc.that meaning is determined by reference to several sources,including the words of the claims themselves,the remainder of the specification,the prosecution history,and extrinsic evidence concerning relevant scientific principles,the meaning of technical terms,and the state of the art.id.at quoting water,safari water filtration.this court has further explained that phillips teaches that these sources should be accorded relative weights depending on the circumstances of the case,with intrinsic sources being the most relevant.microprocessor enhancement.instruments,citing phillips,at.
here,cordis challenges the district court construction of along a line in claims through of the patent.the district court construed along a line as 
contacting the aorta inner wall with a portion of the tube body such that when the end of the catheter lodges within the opening in the coronary artery,an about cm or greater length of the tube body bears upon the wall of the aorta opposite the opening.
voda cordis,claim construction order.cordis argues that the district court construction of along a line is erroneous because it does not require that a straight portion of the catheter engage the wall of the aorta.appellant br.at.cordis further argues that the claims,the specification,and the prosecution history of the patent support its proposed construction of along a line.we disagree.the following discussion will address each of cordis arguments in turn.
a.the words of the claims themselves 
cordis argues that the use of the words along a line in claim of the patent requires the contact portion of the catheter to be straight in its rest state because straight is inherent in the word line.however,cordis argument ignores the context in which the phrase along a line is used in claim.see phillips,at t he context in which a term is used in the asserted claim can be highly instructive.as the district court observed,cordis argument fails to recognize that claim refers to the position of the catheter as it is being used in the human body rather than the shape of the catheter in its rest state.because along a line describes the contact portion of the catheter in its engaged state,claim does not inherently require the contact portion of the catheter to be straight in its rest state.
in addition,cordis concedes that claim does not expressly recite a straight portion.appellant reply br.at.by contrast,claims and of the patent specifically require that the contact portion of the catheter be a substantially straight leg in its rest state.patent.therefore,the fact that claim dependent claims and not expressly recite a straight or substantially straight portion strongly implies that claims through do not require the contact portion of the catheter to be straight in its rest state.see phillips,at differences among claims can also be a useful guide in understanding the meaning of particular claim terms.see also flow control velan,discussing the doctrine of claim differentiation as applied to independent claims.
in sum,the use of the words along a line in claims through does not,by itself,limit the claimed methods to those in which the contact portion of the catheter is straight in its rest state.
b.the specification 
although the use of along a line does not by itself support cordis construction,the words of the claims must be read in view of the specification,of which they are a part.phillips,at quotation omitted.indeed,the specification may reveal an intentional disclaimer,or disavowal,of claim scope by the inventor.id.at.however,any such disclaimer must be clear.conoco,energy envtl.int l,see also teleflex,ficosa am,the patentee may demonstrate an intent to deviate from the ordinary and accustomed meaning of a claim term by including in the specification expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction,representing a clear disavowal of claim scope.however,this court has cautioned against importing limitations from the specification into the claims.phillips,at.moreover,this court has recognized that the distinction between using the specification to interpret the meaning of a claim and importing limitations from the specification into the claim can be a difficult one to apply in practice.see also comark commc ns,harris.
here,cordis argues that the patent written description limits the scope of claims through to methods in which the contact portion of the catheter is straight in its rest state.to support its argument,cordis cites to portions of the written description that describe the contact portion of the catheter of the present invention as a straight portion.appellant br.at citing patent.cordis also states that nowhere does the patent suggest that the claimed invention can only use a curved portion to engage the wall.id.at.
we do not agree with cordis that the written description provides a clear disavowal of claim scope,teleflex,at.although the written description often discusses providing a straight portion that contacts the aortic wall,patent emphasis added,the specification also discusses the contact portion without requiring that it be straight in its rest state.for example,the specification provides that 
the primary feature of the superior,better orientation of the guide catheters of the present invention is that,when disposed in the aortic complex,a contact portion of the guide catheter is established in a substantially contiguous manner against the aortic wall for a substantial length at least about centimeters.
patent emphasis added.other portions of the written description also discuss the contact portion without requiring that it be straight in its rest state.see,patent the factors determining the support provided by the guide catheter include a large supportive segment of the guide catheter that rests against the wall of the ascending aorta to increase stability of the guide catheter within the aortic complex.emphasis added patent the guide catheter has a distal end portion such that with the distal tip of the distal end portion fully disposed within the cardiovascular system,a portion of the distal end portion contacts and rests against and is substantially contiguous with a wall of the ascending aorta emphasis added.
accordingly,the written description of the patent does not clearly limit the scope of claims through to methods in which the contact portion of the catheter is straight in its rest state.
c.the prosecution history 
in construing patent claims,a court may consult the patent prosecution history,if it is in evidence.phillips,at.the prosecution history can assist the court in understanding how an inventor understood and described his invention and whether the inventor disclaimed or disavowed certain subject matter from the scope of his claims.id.this court has emphasized,however,that in order to disavow claim scope during prosecution a patent applicant must clearly and unambiguously express surrender of subject matter.sorensen int l trade comm n,see also omega eng g,raytek,f or prosecution disclaimer to attach,our precedent requires that the alleged disavowing actions or statements made during prosecution be both clear and unmistakable.
in this case,claim of the patent was amended during prosecution to overcome a rejection under for anticipation by patent the feiring reference,patent the bower reference,and patent the danforth reference.the amendment changed the third step of the method of claim as follows 
engaging the aorta inner wall with a portion of the catheter body such that when the distal end of the catheter is positioned in the ostium,the catheter body engages the opposite wall of the aorta along a line wherein the line is proximate of the ostium of the coronary artery having a length of about cm or greater.
amdt.to patent app.at filed may,deletion bracketed insertion underlined.in the remarks accompanying this amendment,the applicant stated 
applicant respectfully submits that his invention,unlike the catheters disclosed by feiring,bower and danforth engages the wall of the aorta,opposite the distal end of the catheter when the distal end of the catheter is positioned in the ostium,along a line having a length of about cm or greater.each of the catheters disclosed by feiring,bower and danforth engage the ascending aorta at a bend or curve along the catheter.none provide support along a line of about cm or greater.
cordis argues that the amendment to claims through and the accompanying remarks demonstrate voda intent to limit the claimed methods to those in which the contact portion of the catheter is straight in its rest state.we disagree.although voda amendment specifically limited his claims to methods where the catheter engages the wall of the aorta for a length of about cm or greater,the amendment makes no reference to the shape of the contact portion of the catheter in its rest state.id.at.the remarks accompanying this amendment also make no reference to the shape of the contact portion of the catheter in its rest state.rather,the remarks distinguish the prior art catheters based on the shape and length of the contact portion of the catheter during use.for instance,voda explained that his claimed methods were unlike the feiring,bower,and danforth methods because the claimed methods require engage ing the wall of the aorta,opposite the ostium,along a line having a length of about cm or greater.id.in addition,voda states that n one of the prior art methods provide support along a line of about cm or greater.id.
accordingly,we read the amendment and the accompanying remarks to distinguish the prior art based on the length of the engagement with the ascending aorta during use,rather than the shape of the contact portion of the catheter in its rest state.the patent prosecution history thus does not clearly and unmistakably limit the scope of claims through to methods in which the contact portion of the catheter is straight in its rest state.
in sum,we affirm the district court construction of along a line with respect to claims through of the patent.in addition,because cordis has waived any argument that its xb catheters do not infringe claims through of the patent under the district court claim construction,we affirm the judgment of infringement with respect to these claims.
validity of claims through of the patent 
patents are presumed to be valid.a party challenging the validity of a patent bears the burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.pfizer,apotex.
cordis argues that under the district court construction of along a line,claims through of the patent are invalid for anticipation under or invalid for obviousness under.specifically,cordis argues that,under the district court claim construction,claims through are anticipated by the amplatz references and are anticipated or obvious in view of the bourassa reference.despite cordis arguments,we find that a reasonable jury could conclude that claims through are not invalid based upon the evidence adduced at trial.accordingly,we affirm the finding that claims through are not invalid.
anticipation 
anticipation is a question of fact that is reviewed for substantial evidence when tried to a jury.finisar,at.anticipation requires disclosure of each and every claim limitation in a single prior art reference,either explicitly or inherently.in re omeprazole patent.
here,the parties only dispute whether a reasonable jury could have found that neither the amplatz nor the bourassa references disclose the third limitation of claims through of the patent.the third limitation of representative claim requires engaging the aorta inner wall with a portion of the catheter body such that when the distal end of the catheter is positioned in the ostium,the catheter body engages the opposite wall of the aorta along a line having a length of about cm or greater.patent.
in arguing for anticipation by the amplatz references,cordis notes voda concession that in one of the working positions of the amplatz catheter a significant segment is leaning on the opposite side of the aorta.this concession,however,fails to establish that any of the amplatz references disclose the third limitation of claim.first,voda did not concede that the contact portion of the amplatz catheter was cm or greater.second,voda did not concede that the amplatz catheter leans against the wall of the aorta opposite the ostium when the distal end of the catheter is positioned in the ostium.rather,voda testified that the prior art method of positioning the end of the amplatz catheter in the ostium required pulling back on the catheter such that the catheter lost contact with the wall of the aorta.given this record,a reasonable jury could conclude that cordis failed to show that the amplatz references disclosed the third limitation of claims through by clear and convincing evidence.accordingly,the district court did not err in denying cordis motion for jmol that claims through of the patent were anticipated by the amplatz references.
in arguing for anticipation by the bourassa reference,cordis places substantial reliance on the testimony of thomas trotta,one of its experts,regarding the method of using the bourassa catheter.however,as the district court observed,trotta is a catheter engineer,not an interventional cardiologist.accordingly,the district court instructed the jury that trotter has no education or training in the proper use of guiding catheters in the human body and has never used a catheter in a human.this instruction was not an abuse of discretion.cordis also relies on the testimony of frank hildner,another one of its experts,that the length of contact between the bourassa catheter and the wall of the aorta opposite the coronary ostium was cm or more.however,on hildner admitted that his estimates as to the length of contact between the bourassa catheter and the aortic wall were very inaccurate,and that he did not represent his estimates to be accurate in any way.in addition,voda testified that the images in the bourassa reference did not clearly depict whether there was any contact between the bourassa catheter and the wall of the aorta opposite the ostium during use.given this record,a reasonable jury could conclude that cordis failed to show that the bourassa reference disclosed the third limitation of claims through by clear and convincing evidence.accordingly,the district court did not err in denying cordis motion for jmol that claims through of the patent were anticipated by the bourassa reference.
obviousness 
section of title of the forbids issuance of a patent when the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art.ksr int l teleflex,d quoting.when reviewing a district court jmol determination as to obviousness,t his court reviews a jury conclusions on obviousness,a question of law,without deference,and the underlying findings of fact,whether explicit or implicit within the verdict,for substantial evidence.finisar,at quoting dippin dots,mosey,quotation omitted.
cordis offers only a perfunctory argument that it would have been obvious at the time of voda invention to increase the length of the contact portion of prior art catheters to cm or more to provide additional support during use.appellant br.at.cordis makes no argument and cites no evidence to support this conclusion.
accordingly,cordis has failed to show any reason to reverse the jury findings of obviousness nor any reason to grant a new trial on obviousness in light of the supreme court recent decision in ksr.see smithkline beecham apotex,treating insufficiently developed arguments as waived.
in sum,we find that a reasonable jury could conclude that claims through are not invalid based upon the evidence adduced at trial.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of jmol that claims through are invalid.
infringement of the straight and substantially straight claims under the doctrine of 
under the doctrine of equivalents,a product or process that does not literally infringe upon the express terms of a patent claim may nonetheless be found to infringe if there is equivalence between the elements of the accused product or process and the claimed elements of the patented invention,hilton davis chem,d citing graver tank linde air prods.see also dawn equip.farms,explaining that to prove infringement under the doctrine of equivalents,the accused device must be shown to include an equivalent for each literally absent claim limitation.however,the use of the doctrine of equivalents to establish infringement is limited by the doctrine of prosecution history estoppel,at.in particular,prosecution history estoppel limits the broad application of the doctrine of equivalents by barring an equivalents argument for subject matter relinquished when a patent claim is narrowed during prosecution.conoco,at citations omitted.
here,the parties dispute whether cordis accused xb catheters have a portion that is equivalent to the second straight portion limitation of claim of the patent,the straight claim or the first substantially straight leg limitation of claims and of the patent and all claims of the patent,the substantially straight claims.cordis makes two arguments in support of noninfringement.first,cordis argues that prosecution history estoppel bars voda from arguing that the redesigned curve portion,see discussion supra background section,of the xb catheter meets the straight and substantially straight limitations.second,cordis argues that the finding of infringement should be overturned because no reasonable jury could find that the redesigned curve portion of its xb catheter is equivalent to the straight or substantially straight limitations we will address each argument in turn.
prosecution history estoppel 
this court has explained that prosecution history estoppel can occur during prosecution in one of two ways,either when the applicant makes a narrowing amendment to the claim estoppel or when the applicant surrenders claim scope through argument to the patent examiner estoppel.conoco,at citations omitted.here,cordis argues that both estoppel and estoppel apply to the substantially straight claims of the patent 
under estoppel,a patentee decision to narrow his claims through amendment may be presumed to be a general disclaimer of the territory between the original claim and the amended claim.festo shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki,d citations omitted.however,the patentee can overcome the presumption that prosecution history estoppel bars a finding of equivalence by showing that the equivalent was unforeseeable at the time of the patent application that the rationale underlying the amendment bore no more than a tangential relation to the equivalent in question or some other reason suggesting that the patentee could not reasonably be expected to have described the insubstantial substitute in question.id.
during prosecution of claim of the patent,voda amended claim as follows 
a method for advancing a catheter through an aorta and into a branch artery,the aorta having an arch and an inner wall opposite the branch artery,comprising the steps of 
providing a catheter including a tubular member having a shaft,an integral profiled portion,and an integral,substantially straight tip portion,the tip portion being adapted to axially engage the branch artery 
wherein the catheter profiled portion comprises,in order from the shaft portion to the tip portion,a first bend,a first substantially straight leg,a second bend,a second substantially straig
