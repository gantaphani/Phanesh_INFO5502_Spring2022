this appeal stems from a lawsuit filed on june,by three community health centers in puerto rico rio grande community health center,rio grande,concilio de salud integral de loiza,loiza,and jos√© belaval,belaval.belaval is the sole appellant in this action.
in their suit,the three health centers alleged that the defendant,the secretary of the department of health of puerto rico had failed to make required payments to them under the federal medicaid statute.see.they sought declaratory and prospective injunctive relief.on november,after reviewing and adopting a magistrate judge report and recommendation,the district court issued an order granting plaintiffs a preliminary injunction.by its terms,the order required the defendant to implement,by november,a wraparound payment system that complied with the medicaid law for the purpose of providing such payments thereunder to plaintiffs.in addition to giving the defendant a deadline to put in place a system to make the required payments,the order also provided that o n or before december,defendant shall pay to the appearing plaintiffs which are currently operating all pending supplemental payments for.the second part of the order thus insured that the appearing plaintiffs would not be irreparably harmed in the interim by the defendant failure to make payments.belaval was an appearing plaintiff who was operating at the time the order was entered,and as such was within the terms of the november,order.
on march,the district court issued another order,this one clarifying how the defendant was to structure its wraparound payments in light of our decision in rio grande community health center,rullan,cir,a case which affirmed earlier relief that had been granted specifically to loiza.payments under the clarified formula were required to begin with the amounts due from the fourth quarter of,and were to continue until puerto rico established its compliance with federal law.the order also specifically mentioned belaval and reiterate d the court finding that puerto rico failure to pay belaval was in violation of the federal medicaid statute.the court ordered the defendant to establish forthwith a provisional payment system to alleviate the shortfall.
after this second order,on march,the defendant filed a motion seeking to demonstrate that it was operating in compliance with the order method of calculation.the plaintiffs opposed this motion and argued there was no compliance.as to belaval in particular,no payments had yet been made,so it opposed the motion.
the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation on june,in which he found that the defendant was not fully in compliance because puerto rico was using an incorrect method of calculating payments.turning to the payments owed to belaval specifically,the magistrate judge found that the march,order required only future payments be made to belaval,and that it did not address past payment obligations.thus the defendant failure to pay belaval up to that point did not mean that it was out of compliance with the march,order.however,the magistrate judge explicitly reserved judgment on whether any payment was owed to belaval under the november,order,and on whether the defendant was in compliance with that order.
in response,belaval asked the court to find the defendant in contempt of the november,preliminary injunction.on september,the magistrate judge agreed that the november,order had established belaval right to payment for the months from march,onward.the defendant failure to pay belaval was thus not in compliance with that order.the magistrate judge held the motion for contempt in abeyance,and he gave the defendant secretary several weeks to come into compliance.
on october,the district court adopted the magistrate judge june and september reports and recommendations finding that the defendant was generally not in compliance.the district court also agreed that the november,order entitled belaval to payments from at least the second quarter of onwards.as did the magistrate judge,the district court held the motion for contempt in abeyance despite the finding of.the district court decision to hold the contempt motion in abeyance is not at issue in this appeal.
what is appealed is a separate portion of that october,order which modified the november,preliminary injunction as to belaval.parts of that original injunction had required that belaval be paid all pending supplemental payments for by december,and had also required that the defendant set up a federally compliant payment system,under which belaval would receive what were then future payments,to be operational by november.the district court modified that original obligation,saying that in light of the confusion created by the magistrate judge june,report and recommendation,wraparound payments to belaval shall be made prospectively beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year.
this modification of the november,preliminary injunction was entirely sua sponte and was not on motion of the defendant,who had sought no such relief.the order modifying the injunction was also entered without prior notice to the parties that the court was considering a modification to the november order and without an opportunity to be heard.the effect of this unilateral change by the district court was to relieve the defendant from making several quarters worth of payments that previously had been ordered.counsel for belaval represented at oral argument that these payments would have totaled approximately to million dollars.belaval appeals from this modification of the earlier preliminary injunction.we reverse this portion of the october,district court order and reinstate the payment obligation to belaval originally imposed by the november,order.
the defendant initial response to the appeal is to argue that this court lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a significant modification of a preliminary injunction.the argument is without merit.
under a,we may hear an interlocutory appeal from a district court order granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions,or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions,except where a direct review may be had in the supreme court.while a is to be strictly construed,sierra club marsh,cir,the reviewing court must look to the practical effect of the order rather than its verbiage,morales feliciano rullan,cir.the portion of the order appealed from clearly modifies the november,preliminary injunction as to several quarters worth of said to be worth over a million dollars.by the terms of the november preliminary injunction,these sums were to have been paid to belaval almost two years ago and are still unpaid.the district court modification affects a substantial sum of money and is clearly jurisdictionally significant,id.at it does much more than merely affect the conduct or progress of litigation 
the district court cited no authority for its decision to modify the injunction in the manner it did.no party had sought the relief the court ordered,nor had any party presented any arguments as to why the injunction should be modified to substantially diminish the payments that belaval was entitled to as a result of the november,injunction.belaval was given no notice or opportunity to object to this modification.
there is an initial question whether the district court had authority to act on its own initiative.this circuit has not decided whether a district court may act sua sponte to modify an injunction under.e or.b.the plain text of rule e does not speak expressly to that question and whether rule b bars a court from sua sponte issuing relief from judgment is an issue that has divided the circuits.compare eaton jamrog,cir holding that rule b bars sua sponte relief,and dow baird,cir same,with fort knox music baptiste,cir finding that rule b permits sua sponte relief,kingvision,lake alice bar,cir same,mcdowell celebrezze,cir same,and united states jacobs,cir suggesting that sua sponte relief may be appropriate under rule b in some cases.
we need not decide these issues here.even assuming that a court may on its own motion substantially modify the terms of a preliminary injunction to th
