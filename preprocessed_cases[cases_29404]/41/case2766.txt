ishaq chanda appeals an adverse grant of summary judgment.the trial court found that he failed to establish that he was disabled under the ada,failed to pursue any retaliation claim,and failed to rebut defendant reasons for his termination.concluding that summary judgment was appropriate,we affirm.
background 
chanda,a pakistani male,is licensed in florida as a professional engineer.he began working as an engineer technician at corp in,and in february became a shift supervisor in the production department.his duties included research and development on different materials used by the corporation,drafting facility,and building tool prototypes.the corporation merged in,becoming.in december of that year,englehard laid off chanda but rehired him the same day for a position in its quality control department.
in march of he was reassigned as a quality control technician.this position required chanda to cut various widths of honeycomb with a retractable utility knife and metal scraper to obtain test samples.while previously this cutting job rotated between four or five employees,chanda alone performed it.deposition testimony indicates that engelhard assigned chanda the cutting job as part of the drill,an operation in which an employee received many nearly impossible tasks,ultimately leading to resignation or dismissal for poor performance.
in july of,chanda supervisor and another superior met with chanda to discuss his work mistakes.chanda was persuaded that the supervisor was prejudiced against him in that he favored the others.engelhard documented the meeting and complaint in a memorandum dated july.in august,chanda began complaining to and the company environmental health and safety coordinator about pain in his wrist.the coordinator told chanda to use a wristband and myoflex cream,and also suggested exercise.chanda did as he was told but the pain continued and increased in frequency.in october,chanda again complained to his superiors and was told to see his family physician.on november,the family physician diagnosed chanda with mysositis,an inflamation of the wrist and forearm.
in december of,chanda asked his supervisor to reassign him to engineering duties.the request was denied.at least two other positions came available at engelhard during the time chanda was cutting.despite his qualifications,he was not considered for either position.
on july,chanda submitted a memorandum to the company complaining of pain in his right forearm and asserting its relation to his cutting job.upon receiving the written complaint,engelhard sent chanda to his personal physician who restricted chanda from repetitive motions and lifting over pounds.
engelhard placed chanda on medical leave on july.on july,engelhard sent chanda to its own physician who warned chanda that his personal physician diagnosis threatened his job.the company physician diagnosed chanda with tendinitis,but cleared him to work with similar restrictions,instructing him to wear a brace.despite this recommendation,engelhard refused to take chanda off medical leave.in august or september of,enhelhard advertised for a position in the wheel manufacturing department,but failed to post the position internally.
chanda physician removed his restriction in october,and on october engelhard again assigned chanda to the cutting job.after only five days chanda pain returned,rendering him unable to perform such activities as grasping,turning,lifting,typing,writing,using a computer,or other functions requiring the use of his right hand.chanda returned to the company physician who permanently restricted him from performing the cutting function.finding that chanda could no longer perform the cutting duties required of his position,engelhard terminated his employment on november.chanda brought the instant action under the americans with disabilities act and the florida civil rights act chanda also sued for retaliatory discharge under title vii 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo resolving all factual issues with all reasonable inferences being drawn in favor of the the moving party has the burden of demonstrating that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,and a summary judgment is to be entered if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could find only for the moving party once the moving party provides support for its motion,the party must come forward with extrinsic evidence sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.the florida courts have recognized,and both parties agree,that actions under the florida civil rights act are analyzed under the same framework as the ada we therefore address chanda disability claims using an ada analysis.
disability discrimination 
the ada mandates that employers shall not discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability.a qualified individual with a disability is an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.this appeal poses the question whether chanda provided sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find him disabled under the act.
the ada defines a disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual.chanda maintains that three doctors diagnosed him with tendinitis and that such an impairment constitutes a disability under the ada.while engelhard appears to concede that chanda tendinitis is a physical impairment,in order to constitute a disability within the meaning of the statute,a physical impairment must substantially limit one or more of the major life activities of an individual.we look to eeoc regulations to assess the next analytical step of determining whether a physical impairment substantially limits a major life activity.
the regulations define substantially limits as rendering an individual u nable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform or s ignificantly restricted as to the condition,manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition,manner,or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.the regulations also discuss three factors the nature and severity of the impairment the duration or expected duration of the impairment and the permanent or long term impact,or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment 
major life activity 
we first must identify the major life activity involved.the regulations define major life activities as functions such as caring for oneself,performing manual tasks,walking,seeing,hearing,speaking,breathing,learning,and working.on appeal chanda focuses on his major life activity of performing manual tasks.
substantial limitation 
we next address the crucial issue whether chanda tendinitis substantially limited his major life activity of performing manual tasks.chanda asserts that the manual tasks he no longer can perform include turning handles,grasping,holding or lifting objects,using a computer or writing with a pen.while not approving the treatment accorded chanda herein,our analysis of the regulations and controlling jurisprudence persuades that the record contains sufficient evidence to support the summary judgment.
our reasoning in hilburn is compelling.therein we affirmed the trial court finding of a physical impairment based on petitioner heart disease,but held that a diminished activity tolerance for normal daily activities such as lifting,running and performing manual tasks,as well as a lifting restriction,did not constitute a disability under the ada similarly,while chanda tendinitis constitutes a physical impairment,his deposition testimony and that of his doctors fails to establish a genuine issue as to any substantial limitation.chanda acknowledged an ability to assist his spouse with household activities,to dress and feed himself,and to d
