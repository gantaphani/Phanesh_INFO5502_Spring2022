kathryn,age,suffers from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and uses a wheelchair.she and her husband are attempting to have a second child,but she is not yet pregnant.anticipating that she will become pregnant,they brought suit in federal court in october.the complaint,as amended in march,alleged that the maine medical center mmc was in violation of the architectural barrier provisions of title iii of the americans with disabilities act ada,and the maine human rights act.ann.tit,west.they seek an injunction to force nearest hospital that handles high risk deliveries as hers would be to move walls in the family center to make the bathrooms.the family center is an recovery area of rooms usually used,when available,by newly delivered mothers.if such rooms are not available,the mothers remain in the newer birth center rooms,in a different wing of mmc,where the delivery actually takes place.
has reason for concern about her access to the family center.she gave birth to her first child at mmc in november.at that time,mmc spent to reconfigure a private room in the birth center to make it available to her.due to complications associated with her giving birth,she was unable to transfer to the family center and remained in the birth center for the duration of her recovery.even if she had not suffered those complications,moving her to the family center was not a viable option because no room in that wing had toilet and shower facilities configured to be.
in april,filed a complaint with the maine human rights commission alleging violations of the maine human rights act,based on her november experience.the commission investigated and issued a report,which we shall refer to later,and which the district court considered.among the claims made to the commission was that mmc failed to remove architectural barriers in the family center.
a magistrate judge,acting on mmc rule b motion,recommended that the action be dismissed because the plaintiffs did not at present have standing to bring their claims.me.med,d.the district judge agreed and dismissed the action,without prejudice,on july.plaintiffs appeal.
our review of the decision to dismiss for lack of standing is de novo.mangual.lexis,at cir.
normally on a rule b motion to dismiss,only the complaint is reviewed.however,where standing is at issue,it is within the trial court power to allow or to require the plaintiff to provide by affidavit or amended complaint further particularized allegations of fact deemed supportive of plaintiff standing.warth seldin,d.here the district court also considered the commission report 
the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden to establish standing.bennett spear,d.the plaintiffs initially argue that the district court erred in not taking all factual inferences from the complaint in their favor,as is required on a rule b motion.the argument is misplaced.we and the district court both have assumed it to be true that is disabled,that plaintiffs are attempting to have another child,that they will use mmc a place of public accommodation for any delivery,and that at present the family center can not accommodate her.but rule b does not require we make the inferences necessary to establish that there is federal jurisdiction.
standing constitutional and prudential 
federal courts are confined by article iii of the constitution to deciding only actual cases or controversies.allen wright,d.federal courts can only decide a live grievance.am.postal workers union frank,cir quoting golden zwickler,d.standing is thus a threshold question in every case,requiring the court to determine whether the plaintiff has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant invocation of jurisdiction.see warth,at.quoting baker carr,d.the constitutional standing inquiry has three elements.a litigant bears the burden of showing that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant,and that the injury fairly can be traced to the challenged action and is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.see valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d internal quotations omitted.as this court has noted,article iii standing is not practical jurisprudence.hemp council,marshall,cir citing wright,miller cooper,federal practice procedure,at,ed.
the plaintiffs claim here involves a threat of future injury the parties dispute the degree of threat presented by these facts to the plaintiffs legal interests.plaintiffs must show that the threatened injury is impending and concrete,see valley forge,at,sufficient to constitute injury in fact.there must be some immediacy or imminence to the threatened injury.see los angeles lyons,d see also whitmore arkansas,d quoting lyons,at.
the standing inquiry involves both constitutional limitations on jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise.warth,at.see also barrows jackson.describing court complementary rule of for its own governance that exists alongside constitutional restriction on jurisdiction.federal courts have identified a number of prudential concerns regarding the proper exercise of federal jurisdiction.three of these areas are the complaint must fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked the plaintiff must assert his own legal rights and interests,and can not rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties and the suit must present more than abstract questions of wide public significance which amount to generalized grievances,pervasively shared and most appropriately addressed in the representative branches.right to life political action comm.gardner,cir quoting allen,at.warth,at.valley forge,at.see also adams watson,cir united states avx,cir.
prudential standing concerns,unlike constitutional ones,can be abrogated by an act of congress.congress may grant an express right of action to persons who otherwise would be barred by prudential standing rules.warth,at.we start with the language of the ada.the enforcement provisions of title iii of the ada are set forth in,which provides 
the remedies and procedures set forth in section a of the civil rights act of a are the remedies and procedures this title provides to any person who is being subjected to discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of this title or who has reasonable grounds for believing that such person is about to be subjected to discrimination in violation of section.nothing in this section shall require a person with a disability to engage in a futile gesture if such person has actual notice that a person or organization covered by this title does not intend to comply with its provisions.
a.is not being subjected to discrimination,so her claim must rest on whether she has reasonable grounds for believing she is about to be subjected to discrimination.the statutory language about to be subjected to discrimination dovetails with the usual prudential analysis as to whether claims are too contingent and premature.
cites some ada cases to us,all factually distinguishable.this is not,for example,a case in which the existence of architectural barriers is the only reason the ada plaintiff has not returned for services,parr l l,d,i finding standing for a plaintiff prevented from using fast food chain restaurant due to various architectural barriers because of his sincere intent to return as evidenced by his past patronage and taste for the chain food.the ada does not permit private plaintiffs to bring claims as private attorneys general to vindicate other people injuries.
the statutory requirement that plaintiff must have reasonable grounds to believe she is about to be subjected to discrimination does not,in our view,displace the normal background prudential standing limitations.see bennett,at.congress legislates against the background of our prudential standing doctrine,which applies unless it is expressly negated.linda richard,d noting that while congress may not confer jurisdiction to render advisory opinions,congress does have the power to enact statutes expanding standing through the creation of new leg
