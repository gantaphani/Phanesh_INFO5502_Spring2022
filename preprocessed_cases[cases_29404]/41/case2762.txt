on october,appellants entered conditional pleas to the charge of misprision of a felony 
whoever,having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony cognizable by a court of the united states,conceals and does not as soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in civil or military authority under the united states,shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years,or both.
the government charged appellants with knowledge of the commission of a felony involving the substance gbl.
although gbl is not a controlled substance,the government alleged that it was a controlled substance analogue of a schedule i controlled acid ghb.ghb is more commonly known as the drug.according to the drug enforcement administration dea,ghb can produce drowsiness,dizziness,nausea,visual disturbances,unconsciousness,seizures,severe respiratory depression and coma addition of acid to schedule i.march,to be codified at pts.and.
appellant mark fisher owns and operates gold gym in mobile,alabama and pensacola,florida.gold gym provides facilities for exercising,bodybuilding,and weight training and sells a number of commercial products that are popular with patrons of physical fitness centers.one of the products sold was called verve.verve,a common industrial chemical,contained gbl which metabolized into ghb when ingested into the human body.ghb is believed by some to assist the release of growth hormones which in turn stimulate muscle growth.in addition,a human pharmaceutical formulation of ghb is being developed as a treatment for catalepsy,a condition associated with narcolepsy,a serious and debilitating disease pub.law.
appellant fisher filed a motion to dismiss the indictment arguing that the application of public law through the analogue act was unconstitutionally vague,arbitrary,capricious,and denied appellant due process specifically,appellants argued that public law and subsequently filed dea rules did not put appellants on notice that gbl was a controlled substance analogue.the district court denied appellants motion holding 
t he court is of the opinion that the gbl is a controlled substance analogue of ghb,a schedule i controlled substance,and that the notice to defendants was constitutionally adequate,for the reasons set forth in the government written and oral responses.in making this ruling,the court specifically notes that no party contests the constitutionality of public law the hillory farias and samantha reid drug prohibition act of and that no party denies that notice of the illegality of ghb was published in the federal register on march.most importantly,it is undisputed that although gbl has no pharmacological effects on the human body in and of itself,it is quickly converted to ghb once it is ingested in the human body.thus it readily appears that the only reason a person would ingest gbl would be to obtain the pharmacological effects that ghb produces on the human body.arguments to the contrary belie the medical evidence and common sense.
united states fisher,order denying motion to dismiss indictment.
appellants raise two issues.whether the analogue act,as applied to gbl,is unconstitutionally vague in that it provides inadequate notice of illegal behavior and allows arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement and whether gbl is a controlled substance analogue of ghb courts that have addressed the constitutionality of the analogue act have evaluated it as it applies to a specific substance.therefore,these issues are wrapped up together into the single issue of whether appellants had constitutional notice that gbl was a controlled substance analogue of ghb 
the district court decision that is not unconstitutionally vague is reviewed under a de novo standard.united states carlson,cir.the court factual finding that gbl is a controlled substance analogue of ghb is reviewed for clear error.united states reid,cir.
as generally stated,the doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.kolender lawson,d.although the doctrine focuses both on actual notice to citizens and arbitrary enforcement,we have recognized recently that the more important aspect of vagueness doctrine is not actual notice,but the other principal element of the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.kolender,at.quoting smith goguen,d.statutes without identifiable standards allow policemen,prosecutors,and juries to pursue their personal predilections.smith,at.except where first amendment rights are involved,vagueness challenges must be evaluated in the light of the facts of the case at hand.see united states mazurie,d.
the analogue 
the fifth circuit has addressed whether the analogue act is unconstitutionally vague.see united states granberry,cir.the court held 
d espite granberry contention to the contrary,the term controlled substance analogue in is clearly and specifically defined,in terms readily comprehensible to the ordinary reader.it provides adequate notice of what conduct is prohibited.the statute makes plain that drugs which have been chemically designed to be similar to controlled substances,but which are not themselves listed on the controlled substance schedules,will nonetheless be considered as schedule i substances if they are substantially similar chemically to drugs that are on those schedules if they produce similar effects on the central nervous system as drugs that are on those schedules or are intended or represented to produce effects similar to those produced by drugs that are on those schedules.there is nothing vague about the statute.
granberry,at.
the eleventh circuit has cited granberry with approval.united states carlson,cir.in carlson,defendants argued that the definition of a controlled substance analogue was unconstitutionally vague as applied to mdma.specifically,defendants argued that the phrase substantially similar was not adequately defined and that they did not receive fair warning that their conduct was illegal.carlson,at.the court rejected defendants argument and held that the analogue act was not unconstitutionally vague.id.at.
a district court in colorado reached a contrary result in a case involving alphaethyltryptamine aet.in united states forbes,defendants were charged with distribution of aet in violation of.the indictment alleged that aet was a controlled substance analogue because it had a substantially similar chemical structure to dimethyltryptamine dmt and diethyltryptamine det,both schedule i controlled substances.forbes.at.the court dismissed the indictment because there was no scientific consensus that aet had a chemical structure that was substantially similar to dmt or id.at.therefore,the district court held that the analogue act,as applied to aet,was unconstitutionally vague.id.
appellants here argue that the analogue act was unconstitutionally vague as applied to gbl because public law and subsequently issued dea rules did not state any criteria by which a layperson could determine that gbl was a controlled substance analogue.they assert that the statute lack of specificity failed to give them constitutional notice that gbl was an illegal substance and consequently,the public is subjected to arbitrary discriminatory law enforcement.
public law and dea rules 
in public law,congress found that the abuse of ghb was an imminent hazard to the public safety.pub.law,a.accordingly,congress ordered the attorney general to issue a final order placing the drug in schedule on march,the drug enforcement administration,under authority delegated by the attorney general,issued its final rule naming ghb a schedule i controlled substance.addition of acid to schedule i.march,to be codified at pts.and 
although congress did not designate gbl as a controlled substance,it recognized the dangerous proclivities of the chemical.in section of public law,congress made the following finding if taken for human consumption,common industrial chemicals such as gamma butyrolactone gbl and are swiftly converted by the body into ghb.illicit use of these and other ghb analogues and precursor chemicals is a significant and growing law enforcement problem.pub.law.
in addition,congress added gbl to the list i chemicals.pub.law,b c x.list i chemicals are chemicals that are used in manufacturing controlled substances.finally,congress added a section to the definition of a controlled substance analogue.pub.law,a b.the new section states,the designation of gamma butyrolactone or any other chemical as a listed chemical pursuant to paragraph or does not preclude a finding pursuant to subparagraph a of this paragraph that the chemical is a controlled substance analogue.b.
appellants argue that because the dea march,final rule stated that the controls placed on gbl by public law would be the subject of a separate federal register notice,gbl had no legal status until the dea filed that separate federal register notice.therefore,as of march,appellants claim they had no notice that gbl was illegal.
on april,the dea issued its anticipated final rule on gbl designating it a list i chemical in compliance with public law.in a paragraph entitled,is gbl subject to any other controls under the controlled substances act the dea made the following statement gbl and are structurally and pharmacologically similar to ghb and are often substituted for ghb.under certain circumstances they may satisfy the definition of a controlled substance analogue.placement of in list i of the controlled substances act.april,to be codified at pt.
appellants argue that even when the dea issued the final rule on gbl,it simply clouded the issue because it said gbl would be a ghb analogue,under certain circumstances,without further explanation.to further complicate things,appellants argue,the definition of a controlled substance analogue,contained in,is unconstitutionally vague.appellants argue that the legal status of gbl is indefinite due to public law,the dea april,final rule,and the analogue act and that this ambiguity allows for arbitrary enforcement.
this court finds that the public was given notice that all ghb analogues were illegal when public law was enacted on february,and again when the dea final rule appeared in the federal register on march,at the direction of congress,designating ghb a schedule i controlled substance the next step in this constitutional analysis is to decide whether an ordinary person could look at the definition of controlled substance analogue and determine that gbl is an analogue of ghb although statements found in public law and the dea final rules indicate that both congress and the dea considered gbl to be an analogue of ghb the only thing that matters is that gbl meets the controlled analogue definition.therefore,the court will use section a to determine if ordinary people would be able to determine that gbl is an illegal analogue of ghb.if so,then the analogue act is not unconstitutional as applied to gbl.see kolender,d holding that a statute is not void for vagueness if ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited.
the definition 
the district court here found that gbl was a controlled substance analogue of ghb.this factual finding is reviewed for clear error.united states reid,cir.
appellants argue that gbl does not meet the controlled substance analogue definition.a specifically,appellants allege that the chemical structure of gbl is not substantially similar to the chemical structure of ghb and that gbl does not have an effect on the central nervous system substantially similar to that of ghb.
the definition of a controlled substance analogue contains three subparagraphs.the first issue in applying the definition is to determine whether these subparagraphs are to be read in the conjunctive or the disjunctive.appellants argue the definition should be read as requiring subparagraph i and either subparagraph ii or iii.the government argues that the definition should be read disjunctively,effectively creating three separate definitions.
the first rule in statutory construction is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute.smith magras.cir.if the statute meaning is plain and unambiguous,there is no need for further inquiry.the plain language is presumed to express congressional intent and will control a court interpretation.
as in all cases involving statutory construction,our starting point must be the language employed by congress,and we assume that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used.thus absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary,that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.
american tobacco patterson,d.
a plain reading of the statute would indicate that the definition should be read in the alternative.it reads i ii or iii.however,appellate courts have concluded differently.united states mckinney,cir assumes without holding that the definition is a test,with a conjunction between clause i and ii.the fifth circuit in granberry paraphrased the definition in the disjunctive.
the district courts that have addressed the issue also came to different conclusions.appellants rely on united states forbes,which held the definition must be in the conjunctive to avoid absurd results.in united states greig,d,the court held the definition was in the disjunctive.the southern district of new york recently issued an opinion holding the definition was in the conjunctive.united states roberts,cr rws,unpublished opinion.
we find there is no reason to take sides on this issue as gbl satisfies both subparagraphs i and ii.i ii.
defendant fisher expert,rodney guttmann,submitted an affidavit in which he testified that the chemical structures of gbl and ghb are not substantially similar.in addition,guttmann testified that recent data indicates gbl has little,if any,effect on the brain.guttmann also testified that the stimulant,depressant,or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system by gbl and ghb are not substantially similar.however,guttman continues by saying 
b ecause ghb is a metabolite of gbl,care must be taken when evaluating data taken from certain studies as the effects of gbl may be attributable to ghb rather than gbl itself.for example,it is sometimes stated that gbl has greater effects than ghb.this statement is only partially correct as the effects described are not actually due to gbl but the metabolically active product,ghb.supplemental affidavit of guttmann.
while academics may distinguish between how the originally ingested substance affects the body as compared to how the substance metabolite affects the body,the court will not make such a distinction.once gbl is ingested,the body transforms it into a gbl metabolite ghb.this transformation is not without consequence along with it comes all the harmful effects associated with ghb.for this reason,it is ludicrous to argue that gbl has no effect on the central nervous system.after ingestion,a person,by will or by choice,can not prevent gbl from metabolizing into ghb.the district court assessment of the facts was not clearly erroneous.
it is undisputed that gbl has no pharmacological effects in a vacuum.however,the human body is not a vacuum.it is also undisputed that upon ingestion,gbl converts into a gbl metabolite ghb.therefore,this court finds that gbl upon ingestion meets the definition of a controlled substance analogue as its chemical structure and effect on the central nervous system are substantially similar to ghb,a schedule i controlled substance.a i ii.people of ordinary intelligence would easily be able to determine that a substance,which is converted upon ingestion into a metabolite with a substantially similar chemical structure and effect on the central nervous system as a schedule i controlled substance,would meet the definition of a controlled substance analogue.
we affirm the district court holding and find that the analogue act,as applied to gbl,is not unconstitutionally vague.appellants had constitutional notice that gbl was a controlled substance analogue of ghb.
