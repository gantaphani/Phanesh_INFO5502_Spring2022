ames was first hired by home depot in november.during orientation,she received a copy of home depot code of conduct,which listed major work rule violations terminable upon a first offense.one of these violations was having detectable levels of alcohol as determined by a blood alcohol test.
for almost five years,ames worked for home depot without incident.on september,ames spoke with the store manager,mike mahon,about the fact that she had an alcohol problem and needed assistance through home depot employee assistance program eap.at this point,ames alcohol problem had not yet affected her work.in accordance with home depot policy,ames was put on paid administrative leave and was notified that she could return to work once she had received a treatment plan,obtained authorization,and passed a drug and alcohol test.on september,ames signed home depot employee assistance agreement,which enrolled her into home depot assistance program.the agreement stated in part 
i will be subject to periodic drug alcohol testing during the remainder of my employment at home depot whether the company has reasonable suspicion or not to believe drug or alcohol abuse occurred at work or has affected my work performance 
if i refuse to take a required drug alcohol test or fail a drug alcohol test at any time during the course of my employment at home depot,i will be immediately terminated.
ames admits that she read the agreement before signing and did not object to it.
on october,after a leave of absence with pay,ames passed a drug and alcohol test and obtained authorization to return to work.soon thereafter,jose peña became the new store manager.on november,at,ames was pulled over by police and arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.although ames was scheduled to work that day,she called the store and took a personal leave day without penalty.after the dui was reported in the local newspaper,ames case manager at home depot,clark burton,was informed of the arrest.burton tried unsuccessfully to contact ames by telephone to notify her that the dui arrest put her in noncompliance with the terms of the employee assistance agreement.on december,burton sent ames a letter informing her that she had until december to schedule an appointment at an alcohol treatment facility for an evaluation,as required to restore her compliance with the agreement.burton then spoke with ames on december and gave her until december to schedule her evaluation.
on december,ames asked peña for help rearranging her work schedule at home depot so that she could attend her alcoholics anonymous aa meetings.peña asked ames for documentation from her doctor and for more information regarding her aa meeting schedule.a few days later,ames gave peña her aa meeting schedule and a note from her physician,which stated diane ames has been under my care.she has been referred by me to carol russel,a licensed clinical social worker,for counseling,and she is seeing john zhang for psychiatric medication management.the note did not say anything more regarding ames condition or whether she required medical leave.
some time later,ames told burton that she had scheduled an appointment for her evaluation in january.ames stated that her delay in scheduling this appointment was due to some difficulty with her insurance plan and with finding a doctor who met the court dui counseling requirements.
on december,ames had a conversation with peña in which she disclosed several personal difficulties,including her marital problems and divorce,the arrest of her son on drug charges,perceived unfair treatment by previous supervisors,concerns regarding whether home depot would pay for the evaluation,and the inadequacy of her current program.at the end of the conversation,peña stated that he would inquire into whether home depot would pay for the evaluation.ames conceded in her deposition that she did not specifically ask for leave from her job during this conversation with peña.
on december,ames reported for her scheduled work shift.an assistant store manager told peña that ames was acting differently and smelled of alcohol.peña observed that ames was less responsive to conversation than normal,that she smelled of alcohol,and that she slurred her words.peña called gretchen gallois,the human resources manager,who agreed that ames should have a blood alcohol test.ames was driven to a testing facility and had her blood drawn.a few days later,the laboratory reported that ames blood had tested positive for alcohol.home depot then decided to terminate ames for violating its substance abuse policy.peña scheduled a meeting for january to tell ames about her termination.
following the december blood alcohol test,ames grew increasingly anxious that she would lose her job if the test result was positive and began drinking more.on january,ames checked herself into the hospital.the next day,ames was discharged from the hospital with instructions to start an outpatient program.because of her hospital stay,ames did not attend her scheduled january meeting with peña.on january,home depot mailed a letter to ames,which she received on january.the letter informed ames that based on her violation of home depot substance abuse policy,her employment was terminated as of december,day she came to work under the influence of alcohol.
