this case concerns the amount of reimbursement that the medicare program should pay henry ford health systems for outpatient hospital services furnished to medicare patients in henry ford fiscal years ending,and.henry ford contends that the secretary regulations mandating disaggregation of certain services from all other outpatient services when calculating reimbursement amounts violate the medicare statute and congressional intent.the district court granted summary judgment to the secretary.for the following reasons,we affirm.
congress established the medicare program in as title xviii of the social security act in order to provide hospital and medical coverage to most persons over years of age and to certain disabled persons.see.under the act,an eligible medicare beneficiary is entitled to have payment made by the medicare program on his or her behalf for covered services furnished by service providers participating in the medicare program.see.the medicare program consists of two parts part a covers inpatient hospital services and certain other institutional services,and part b covers outpatient hospital services and health care practitioner services.see,respectively.the secretary has delegated administration of the medicare program to the health care financing administration,which in turn has contracted with private insurance companies called fiscal intermediaries to handle claims processing and to determine proper payments to participating providers for services rendered to medicare beneficiaries.see.
in,congress established the lesser of costs or charges rule in order to ensure that the medicare program would not pay more for services than the provider charged to the general public.see social security amendments of.codified as amended at b,a,reprinted in.this rule limited medicare reimbursement for all services,inpatient and outpatient,to the lesser of the hospital reasonable costs of such services or the hospital customary charges for the services.see b,a.the secretary promulgated regulations stating that the lesser of costs or charges rule would be applied to the amount obtained from aggregating both part a inpatient and part b outpatient services reasonable costs and customary charges.see c.in,congress directed the secretary to issue regulations eliminating the aggregation of part a and part b figures when applying the lesser of costs or charges rule and requiring the amount to be calculated and reported separately for each type of service.see deficit reduction act of,a.
in,congress modified the lesser of costs or charges payment formula for facility services related to outpatient ambulatory surgical center procedures see omnibus budget reconciliation act of,a,stat.codified as amended at i a.the new payment formula required use of a blend amount,based on calculations that take into account the typical hospital rate for such services and also the cheaper rates charged by,in order to begin easing hospitals toward a method of reimbursement based on a set fee rather than on the hospital cost for ambulatory surgery.see conf.at,reprinted in.under the modified payment formula,ambulatory surgical services were to be reimbursed for the lesser of costs or charges or the blend amount.see id.the secretary interpreted the modified payment formula as requiring the separation and disaggregation of the reasonable costs and customary charges of ambulatory surgical services from all other outpatient services when applying the lesser of costs or charges rule.see.accordingly,the secretary issued regulations that required calculating reimbursement for outpatient ambulatory surgical services at the lesser of costs or charges or the blend amount,and reimbursement for all other outpatient services at the lesser of costs or charges.see c ii e.
in,congress again modified the payment formula,this time with respect to radiology and other diagnostic services,requiring that reimbursement for these services also be limited by blend amounts.see omnibus budget reconciliation act of,stat.codified as amended at a e n.thereafter,reimbursement for both radiology and diagnostic services would,like ambulatory surgical services,be for the lesser of costs or charges or the blend amount.see id.again,the secretary interpreted the formula modification as requiring the disaggregation of costs and charges for outpatient radiology and other diagnostic services from all other costs and charges for outpatient services when applying the lesser of costs or charges rule.see.thus,for services provided on or after october,the secretary reimbursed four categories of outpatient hospital services with the following separate calculations for ambulatory surgical services,the lesser of costs or charges or the blend amount for radiology,the lesser of costs or charges or the blend amount for diagnostic services,the lesser of costs or charges or the blend amount for all other aggregated outpatient services,the lesser of costs or charges.
henry ford is a nonprofit corporation which operates henry ford hospital,a large tertiary care hospital,education,and research complex located in detroit,michigan,and participates as a provider of services in the medicare program.as with all other providers,the secretary pays henry ford through intermediaries for covered services provided to medicare beneficiaries.in,and,due to the secretary regulations mandating the disaggregation of ambulatory surgical,radiology,and diagnostic services from all other outpatient services,the intermediary paid henry ford far less than the hospital costs for outpatient services.in,henry ford lost on outpatient services in,in.
after exhausting its administrative remedies,henry ford filed this action in district court challenging the validity of the regulations and seeking an order to the secretary to compute and pay additional reimbursements.the district court granted the secretary motion for summary judgment,and henry ford appealed.
we review de novo an issue of statutory interpretation.see bartlik of labor,cir.we read statutes and regulations with an eye to their straightforward and commonsense meanings.see bartlik,at.when we can discern an unambiguous and plain meaning from the language of a statute,our task is at an end.id.at.
the secretary argues that her regulations merely reflect the plain language in the medicare statute requiring her to disaggregate ambulatory surgical,radiology,and diagnostic services when calculating reimbursements.for support,she points to a b,which lays out the general lesser of costs or charges rule.that section directs that the rule be applied to outpatient services,with modified rules to be applied to particular services,including outpatient radiology and certain diagnostic procedures.see a b.radiology and diagnostic services are dealt with in a separate subsection requiring application of the lesser of costs or charges or the blend amount.see a e n.the same modified reimbursement method applies to ambulatory surgical services,as directed in a different subsection.see a i.
henry ford argues that,at best,the amended language of the statute is ambiguous.we agree with the secretary,however,that,at least as to radiology and diagnostic services,the statute is clear.under the statute language,the general lesser of costs or charges rule applies to outpatient services except radiology and diagnostic services.see a b referring to subparagraph e,which covers radiology and diagnostic services.in the secretary reading,and in ours,congress use of the word except is an explicit exclusion of radiology and diagnostics from the aggregate calculation for other outpatient services under the lesser of costs or charges rule.taken in combination with the separate subsection articulating a distinct reimbursement formula,this language plainly required the secretary to disaggregate radiology and diagnostic services from all other outpatient services when calculating reimbursement.
as with radiology and diagnostic services,a separate provision of the medicare statute requires application of a modified reimbursement formula for ambulatory surgical services.see u.a.unlike the other two excluded service areas,however,ambu
