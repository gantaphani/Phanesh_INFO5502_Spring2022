hinz and kellermann reached a joint working agreement on october.the agreement permitted kellermann to distribute hinz products in exchange for paying hinz a royalty rate of percent per product.

in january,kellermann sued hinz hinz countersued.the dispute was settled during a settlement conference on may.the settlement was memorialized in a written agreement.as relevant,the agreement,effective september,required kellermann to 
permanently discontinue the promotion,sale and use of the following tradenames,trademarks and products using said tradenames and trademarks cysreplete,neuroreplete,repleteextra,extra,mucuna,the replete program,and in combination with htp,
permanently discontinue the promotion,marketing and sale of the product series,and 
make no further use of any trademarks and amino acid formulations specifically prohibited by this agreement for which hinz had been paid royalties in the past.
four months later,hinz sued kellermann for breach of the settlement agreement,alleging kellermann was selling products containing the ingredients mucuna pruriens and mucuna pruriens in combination with htp.before trial,the district court ruled that the settlement agreement was ambiguous on its face.it permitted hinz and kellermann to introduce parol evidence to interpret the terms of the contract.the jury found a breach of contract,awarding in damages.
after trial,kellermann moved for judgment as a matter of law,or alternatively a new trial under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court granted judgment as a matter of law on damages,concluding hinz provided no reasonable basis for the calculation of damages.however,the court denied kellermann motion for new trial,ruling it untimely.the court also denied hinz motions for permanent injunction,interest,and attorney fees and costs.hinz appeals,contending the district court erred in reversing the damage award because it lacked jurisdiction concluding there was insufficient evidence for the damage award instructing the jury on the measure of damages and denying hinz a permanent injunction,pre and interest,and attorney fees and costs.kellermann,objecting to the use of parol evidence.
hinz argues kellermann failed to comply with the particularity requirement of rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure in his motion.hinz thus concludes the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter the amended judgment reversing the damage award.
at the close of evidence,kellermann moved for judgment as a matter of law,explaining orally the basis for the motion.see.a.specifically,he disagreed with the use of parol evidence and claimed there was insufficient evidence to prove damages,kellermann renewed his motion,stating simply we would like to renew our rule motion for judgment as a matter of law.see.b.exactly ten days after trial,kellermann filed motions for judgment as a matter of law,and alternatively a new trial.see id.the motions did not describe the grounds on which they were based.the next day,however,kellermann filed a supporting memorandum detailing the grounds for the motions.kellermann attacked the verdict,the use of parol evidence,and other irrelevant and prejudicial evidence.the district court ruled that for the issues of damages and parol evidence the motions were timely and stated with particularity.for the issue of irrelevant and prejudicial evidence,the motion was untimely.
because the dispute involves the legal jurisdiction of the court,this court reviews de novo.see andreas volkswagen of,cir.
rule is a general rule that applies to all motions.id.it requires a request for a court order to be made by motion,which shall be in writing,unless made during a hearing or a trial,state with particularity the grounds for seeking the order,and state the relief sought.b.the particularity requirement gives notice to the court and the opposing party,providing the opposing party a meaningful opportunity to respond and the court with enough information to process the motion correctly.andreas,at.however,the particularity requirement should not be applied in an overly technical fashion when the purpose behind the rule is not jeopardized.id.the court may consider motions to determine if notice was properly given and the opposing party had an opportunity to respond.see id.the court may not consider,though,filings after the filing period because to do so would allow parties to eviscerate the purpose of the time limitation.id.at.see alternate fuels,cabanas,wl at cir.aug.
here,the district court looked to the rule a motion to determine whether the rule b motion was adequate.the court did not consider the supporting memorandum,though,finding it untimely.
as for the supporting memorandum,a renewed or motion for judgment as a matter of law must be filed no later than ten days after the entry of judgment.see.b.because the supporting memorandum here was filed after the day limit,this court may not consider it.see andreas,at.
as for the district court consideration of the rule a motion,the court did not err.by definition,a rule b motion is a renewal of a prior rule a motion made at the close of the evidence and as such is limited to those issues raised in the previous motion,citing.b see also conseco fin.servicing am.mortgage,cir the grounds for the renewed motion under rule b are limited to those asserted in the earlier rule a motion.kellermann rule a motion attacked the use of parol evidence and the damage evidence.the trial transcript indicates kellermann made the motion during the trial,particularly stating its grounds and the relief sought.see.b.kellerman provided the district court and hinz with notice,and hinz had a fair opportunity to respond.because the rule a motion satisfied the particularity requirement,the rule b motion was also sufficient.see andreas,at see also conseco,at if colloquy between counsel and the trial court fleshes out the motion,it may provide the opposing party with the requisite notice.
the district court had jurisdiction to enter an amended judgment reversing the damage award.
