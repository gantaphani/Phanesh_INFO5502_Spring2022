background 
lin is a native and citizen of the people republic of china.he entered the united states on august.the department of homeland security dhs served him with a notice to appear and charged that he was subject to removal.lin admitted the allegations in the notice and applied for asylum and withholding of removal.he submitted supporting documentation,including purported abortion and sterilization certificates for his wife.dhs submitted forensic document laboratory fdl findings concerning the certificates,and the ij continued the proceedings to allow lin to respond.thereafter,lin submitted a letter from his attorney challenging the fdl findings.
on april,the ij held a hearing at which lin testified.he stated that the documentation attached to his asylum application was genuine.he said that he had reviewed the contents of his application and that everything in it was true.lin was born in fuzhou city,fujian province,china in and married yong chen in.they have a daughter who was born in.lin stated that he had a education and could not read or write.he worked at a thermos factory from through,when he was fired for being disruptive.he explained that he would sometimes hav e troubles with his,like coming to blows.in,lin opened a diner but was forced to close it in to make room for new development.neither lin nor his wife has worked since they have supported themselves and their daughter on their savings.lin wife still lives in fuzhou.
lin said that he and his wife wanted to have a second child because it had been quite a while since their daughter birth.he knew a little bit about china one child policy,including that they had to apply for permission to have a second child.they did not do so.he also knew that if they had a second child,they would have to pay a social compensation fee which they could not afford.according to lin,his wife complied with the requisite quarterly pregnancy tests,but he had no documentation to prove it.he claimed that he told her not to go for the,but she did because the neighborhood birth control office told her she had to report.
lin testified that his wife became pregnant with their second child in september and that on september,people from the neighborhood committee came to their house and discovered the pregnancy.he said that the committee conducted random checks and checks when they suspected someone might be violating the family planning laws.when questioned regarding how far along his wife was in the pregnancy,lin stated that she was a little more than three months pregnant and that she looked pregnant.according to lin,the members of the committee took his wife by force to the neighborhood committee office.he claimed he tried to resist and they came to some physical contact almost to the point of using fists.he did not injure anyone,but said he threatened to do so.he added that they pushed each other,but did not knock each other down.lin stated that he followed his wife to the neighborhood committee office where there was more pushing around.they were in the office for about twenty minutes.lin claimed his wife was eventually taken away to a local hospital to have an abortion.when asked if she had any operation other than the abortion,he responded that she had not.he explained that he did not go to the hospital with his wife because the committee members told him that it was his wife problem only and if he followed her,he would be in trouble too.the ij asked lin about the purpose of the stop at the committee office on the way to the hospital.lin could offer no explanation other than that they took my wife there.
lin later stated that the abortion occurred on december.subsequently,when asked when his wife was taken to the hospital,he answered,december.the ij asked lin if he was sure about the date,and lin replied that the abortion occurred in december.he then claimed that the matter that happened at the hospital happened the next day.the ij sought clarification of the dates and events.lin said that the people from the neighborhood committee came to his house august something.the ij indicated that lin was giving different answers to the same question and again asked him for the date on which the neighborhood committee went to his house and discovered his wife pregnancy.lin said.the ij asked him to be more specific,and lin claimed that they discover ed the pregnancy in may.this prompted the ij to ask how the members of the committee discovered that his wife was pregnant in may.lin claimed that her pregnancy was visible at that time.the ij pressed further on the date,and lin said that the officials came to his house in may to do a regular check for compliance at which time his wife was not pregnant.he stated that they came again in september and found her pregnant.the ij asked if a pregnancy test was administered.lin said that ultrasound technology was used in a hospital.the ij asked when the abortion occurred lin answered,december the.the ij inquired whether lin knew that was the third date he had given,and lin explained that he had remembered that the date was december.according to lin,his wife did not agree to the abortion but that did not matter because the decision was made by the committee.
lin stated that he had an report to prove that his wife had an abortion.he claimed the doctor sent the report to his house in china and his wife mailed it to him.he claimed that the report said that pregnancy is forbidden and his wife is not allowed to become pregnant.when the ij asked if anything was done to prevent his wife from becoming pregnant again,lin said,they did do anything.they just told us that no pregnancy anymore.lin testified that both he and his wife were physically capable of having another child.
the ij asked lin why he feared returning to china.lin responded that he would be unemployed and he could not find work because he was uneducated and illiterate.lin admitted that this was part of the reason he came to the united states and claimed the other part was the loss of his second child.
as mentioned,lin submitted documentation to support his claim.in his political asylum statement submitted with his application,lin wrote that his wife became pregnant for the second time in september and that on december,the family planning officials came to their home and took her to the hospital to have an abortion and sterilization.lin had a letter and translation of a radiology examination report,indicating that yong chen,his wife,had both fallopian tubes sterilized.he also submitted a letter from his wife in which she said that she became pregnant the second time in september and that she was taken on december to a hospital to have a forced abortion and sterilization.she claimed that she received the abortion and sterilization certificates from the officials of the neighborhood family planning office later that month.finally,lin provided translated certificates indicating that an abortion and sterilization were performed on yong chen on december.dhs submitted the findings of a forensic document examiner who determined that i t is unlikely that the abortion and sterilization certificates are genuine.several reasons were given to support this determination.lin responded with a letter from his li nan chiang.
on april,the ij issued an oral decision.based on lin concession of removability and admission of allegations in the notice to appear,the ij found him removable as charged.she then considered his application for asylum and withholding of removal.the ij took into account lin limited education and alleged functional illiteracy and his demeanor while testifying and found him not credible.she noted that he was unable to provide the most basic of information that forms the very foundation of his claim and determined that t he inconsistencies in his testimony are so significant that they warrant this finding of incredibility.
the ij gave several reasons for her adverse credibility determination.first,lin was unable to provide a plausible explanation as to how the members of the neighborhood committee immediately determined that his wife was pregnant.the ij also relied on the substantial inconsistencies in the dates for the abortion that lin provided,noting he had given three different dates.the ij said that she did not find anything in lin behavior,demeanor,background,et cetera to say that he can not remember simple facts.even more important to the ij,though,was that lin written statements indicated his wife had not only a forced abortion but also an involuntary sterilization however,lin never mentioned the latter procedure while testifying,even when asked if anything other than the abortion was done to her.lin even testified that he and his wife were physically able to have another child.the ij was also troubled by the fdl report that found the abortion and sterilization certificates suspect,but she did not give great weight to that report or counsel reply thereto.she found that the certificates did not deserve full evidentiary weight in part because lin failed to provide very detailed testimony,and none about the sterilization.in addition,the ij noted lin testimony that he had physical contact with the family planning officials,which she viewed with skepticism because his written materials made no mention of it.having found lin not credible,the ij denied his application for asylum and withholding of removal and ordered him removed to china.
lin appealed to the board.he asserted that the ij gave undue weight to the adverse fdl findings.he also claimed that given his education and brain injuries from working at a enterprise in china,the ij should have inquired into and given weight to such injuries as persecution.in an attached affidavit,lin added that he had worked in a factory where he was exposed to mercury sprayed on thermos bottles and that both his parents died from cancer after having worked at the factory all their lives.
on january,the board summarily affirmed the ij decision.the board noted that in a july,decision it had suspended lin former counsel li nan chang from practicing before the board,the immigration courts,and the dhs.because lin had retained new counsel who filed the appeal and appellate brief,the board proceeded to decide the appeal.lin petitioned for review with this court.
ii.analysis 
lin raises several arguments on appeal.he first argues that the ij erred in placing insufficient weight on the certificates of his wife abortion and sterilization procedures based on perceived deficiencies and lack of detail in his testimony.he claims that his documentation should have served the real id purpose of corroborating otherwise incredible testimony.he argues that the ij erred in failing to probe into his background and alleged exposure to harmful chemicals and that the board erred in not addressing this alleged explanation for the inconsistencies in his testimony.he also asserts that the ij and board erred in failing to recognize the ineffective assistance of his counsel.finally,he claims that the ij erred in failing to determine whether he was competent to testify.
where,as here,the board summarily affirms,we review the ij decision.juarez holder,cir.our review is deferential and we ask only whether the decision is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.lin holder,cir quoting toptchev,cir.we will reverse only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion.surganova holder,cir.
in order to establish eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal,lin bears the burden of proving that he is a refugee within the meaning of a a.b b i lin,at.thus,he had to show past persecution or a fear of persecution on account of his race,religion,nationality,membership in a protected social group,or political opinion.a a.he alleges persecution based on china coercive family planning polices and alleged practices committed against his wife,on account of his political opinion.lin may prove that he is a refugee based on his own testimony alone if the ij finds it is credible.b b ii.however,as the ij recognized,g iven the importance of the applicant credibility in asylum proceedings,an adverse credibility finding will doom the applicant claimed eligibility as a refugee.hassan holder,cir quoting musollari mukasey,cir.
before we evaluate the adverse credibility determination,we need to address some of the government arguments.the government first argues that we may not consider lin unexhausted claims that his counsel was ineffective the ij should not have proceeded with the hearing because of counsel ineffective assistance the ij should have determined lin competency to testify the ij erred in its findings regarding lin belated claim of physical contact the fdl report suspicions of the sterilization certificate were baseless and the weight given to the abortion and sterilization certificates contradicted the purpose of the real id to corroborate otherwise incredible testimony.see d a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.muratoski holder,cir denying petition for review where alien failed to exhaust administrative remedies.the duty to exhaust includes the obligation to first present to the board any argument against the removal order as to which the board is empowered to grant the alien meaningful relief.muratoski,at quoting ghaffar mukasey,cir.lin failure to exhaust the claims identified above prevents us from reviewing them 
the government contends that the exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional.we have said that it is not.see,issaq holder,cir failure to exhaust is not a jurisdictional rule in the strict sense but a rule that limits the arguments available to an alien in this court.
the government next argues that lin has waived several challenges to the ij decision,including most of the reasons for the adverse credibility finding as well as his claim that the weight given to the alleged abortion and sterilization certificates contradicts the purpose of the real id act.the statement of facts and procedural history section of lin opening brief mentions the following reasons supporting the ij credibility determination lin was unable to provide a plausible explanation as to how the neighborhood committee members determined that his wife was pregnant lin written statements indicated his wife was forced to undergo sterilization,but lin never mentioned it when testifying and lin first claimed that he had physical contact with the family planning officials when testifying.but the brief only mentions these in passing.merely mentioning that the ij made these findings without advancing any argument supported by citations to relevant authority is insufficient to challenge those findings on appeal.see,haxhiu mukasey,cir federal rule of appellate procedure requires an argument consisting of more than a generalized assertion of error,with citations to supporting authority.quotations and citations omitted asere gonzales,cir.lin has not made any cogent argument to challenge these reasons for the adverse credibility finding.thus,he has waived any challenge to them.but even if he had not waived these challenges,we would not disturb the ij credibility finding for the reasons we discuss later.
lin has waived other arguments too.he claims that the abortion and sterilization certificates he submitted should have served the real id act purpose of corroborating otherwise incredible testimony and that the ij decision to give them less weight because of the inconsistencies in his testimony contravenes the purpose of the act.but he offers no authority to support these arguments.the failure to adequately develop and support these arguments results in waiv
