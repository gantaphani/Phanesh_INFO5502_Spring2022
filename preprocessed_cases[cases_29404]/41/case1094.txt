kenneth heath was charged with four counts of attempting to evade the payment of federal income taxes between and,and with two counts of presenting fictitious financial instruments.heath argues on appeal that the district court committed reversible error by refusing to instruct the jury that the government was required to prove that he owed a substantial amount of federal income tax,failing to clarify for the jury that it could not find him guilty on a particular count unless his allegedly unlawful conduct was willful as to that count,and erroneously stating in the jury instructions that a fictitious financial instrument must be free of disqualifying remarks as opposed to disqualifying marks.he also asserts that the district court erred at sentencing by using the wrong standard when denying him a downward departure for diminished capacity under the united states sentencing guidelines.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
heath is a design engineer and a graduate of california polytechnic university.he was years old at the time of his trial.in,heath became involved with groups and stopped paying his federal income taxes.he was inspired to stop paying taxes after attending seminars conducted by irwin schiff,a convicted tax evader who wrote a book while in prison titled federal mafia how it illegally imposes and unlawfully collects income taxes.the book advises readers how to not pay taxes,but informs them that they run the risk of conviction if they follow the book advice.
although heath lived in imlay city,michigan in,he began filing federal income tax returns that showed him living in the california republic.in,the internal revenue service irs deemed heath tax returns frivolous and informed him of that determination.the irs told heath in a letter that he could refile proper tax returns without paying a penalty.heath instead proceeded to send the irs more than written communications asserting that he was not subject to federal income tax and refusing to refile in a legal manner.in one letter he explained his refusal by stating that as a private sector wage earner he is not a corporation we are sovereign natural born persons.he also filed more than improper revised tax returns and received a penalty for each return.in total,heath was assessed penalties of more than for improper and frivolous filings.
the government eventually charged heath with tax evasion for the years.during that time period,heath was employed by aeroteck as an automotive engineer and by continental chivas,a manufacturer of automobile parts.although heath filed tax returns between and that disclosed his income,he paid no taxes because he claimed to be exempt on his tax forms.his employers therefore withheld no taxes from his paychecks.heath also failed to pay taxes on money he received from a trust fund during that same time period.the irs calculated that heath owed the government for,for,for,and for.in total,the amount of unpaid tax due and owing the government between and came to.
the irs responded to heath numerous communications during that time period by advising him that his arguments for not paying taxes were without legal merit and had never been successful in federal court.in addition,the letters informed heath that he could be subject to criminal penalties for the willful failure to pay.the irs eventually sent a tax levy for back taxes to heath employers and to the manager of his trust,dennis jacobs.heath then engaged a group called american rights litigators to help him with his tax problems.jacobs received a letter from an attorney for american rights litigators who claimed to be acting under a power of attorney from heath.the letter informed jacobs that he was not authorized to honor the irs levy against heath trust because of alleged defects in the process of the irs.jacobs,however,continued to pay trust funds to the irs in accordance with the levy.heath then transferred his interest in the trust to his sister.
american rights litigators also advised heath that he could pay his tax debt with a registered bill of exchange.a bill of exchange is a written order by one person to another,signed by the person giving the order,requiring a third party the drawee to pay a stated amount on demand.black law dictionary ed.the most common type of bill of exchange is a personal check associated with a bank checking account.heath went to another organization,guiding light of god ministries,for assistance with the paperwork required for securing a bill of exchange to pay the irs.at trial,heath explained that he understood that a bill of exchange was a set off where you can ask the secretary of the treasury to set up an account for you for the irs,send this bill to the accountant and the bill off to the bankruptcy in the united states,and they promise to pay the debt,and it is all in the master plan,whatever is in the bankers act 
a paragraph at the bottom of the sample bill of exchange that heath received from guiding light of god ministries stated that 
assisting our patrons with the preparation of ucc filing,bills of exchange,and other papers may not always be appreciated by those in government agencies due to a lack of understanding or otherwise.though we do not advocate or prepare documentation that is unlawful,use of bills of exchange may result in a phone call or a visit from the irs treasury personnel alleging that the bills of exchange are fraudulent instruments,even though current bills of exchange specifically state on them void where prohibited by law.several patrons have experienced this recently.
in august or september of,heath sent to the irs what appeared to be a certified check in the form of a registered bill of exchange in the amount of.the document contained a statement in the fine print that it was void where prohibited by law.heath sent a second bill of exchange in december of that year for.it had the words not negotiable printed on the document.both of the bills of exchange offered by heath identified the drawee as john snow,trustee,and showed his address at the department of the treasury.william kerr,an employee with the division of the office of the comptroller of the currency,explained at trial that the bills of exchange offered by heath were fictitious instruments because they d id not exist in the legitimate financial record.in other words,there was no real account for payment of the documents.kerr also explained that the supposedly registered bills of exchange offered by heath looked like genuine financial instruments but were in fact fictitious.
a grand jury indicted heath in december of,charging him with four counts of attempting to evade and defeat the payment of federal income tax,in violation of,and with two counts of presenting fictitious financial instruments,in violation of a.at the conclusion of the trial,the district court granted heath motion,filed pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure,to dismiss the charge relating to the december bill of exchange.the court concluded that the document did not qualify as a fictitious financial instrument within the meaning of the statute because the face of the document stated that it was not negotiable.a jury convicted heath on the other five counts.
after the jury verdict,heath counsel filed an ex parte motion for authorization to obtain the services of a psychologist,michael abramsky,to examine heath for the purpose of determining if he had diminished capacity as defined under of the sentencing guidelines.the district court granted the motion.after abramsky interviewed heath in october of,he issued a report concluding that heath did not suffer from major psychosis.but abramsky found that heath did have cognitive slippage,which is likely a sign of a state,and that heath was chronically depressed.
under the legal conclusion section of his report,abramsky stated that although heath was not insane and that his reality testing was adequate,there were elements of diminished capacity.abramsky concluded by stating i believe a downward departure is justified.this man is deteriorating,he is likely to get worse since such dementia is generally progressive and it appears that his mental state did make a significant contribution to the decisions he made,which ultimately led to his conviction and incarceration.the doctor report was submitted to heath probation officer and to the district court.at sentencing,heath counsel requested a downward departure for diminished capacity.
although the district court discussed abramsky report,it found that heath did not have diminished capacity at the time of the offense or at sentencing.the court specifically determined that heath trial testimony and his behavior at trial indicated that he could reason appropriately,that neither the court nor the jury found that heath had a good faith belief in the lawfulness of his behavior,and that heath mental difficulties did not suggest an inability on his part to comply with legal requirements.it then denied the request for a downward departure and sentenced heath to five concurrent terms of months of imprisonment.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
jury instructions 
we review the jury charge as a whole to determine whether the charge fairly and adequately submits the issues and law to the jury.united states buckley,cir.a trial court refusal to give a requested jury instruction is reversible error only if the instruction is correct,not substantially covered by the actual jury charge,and so important that failure to give it substantially impairs defendant defense.united states sassak,cir.we will therefore reverse a judgment based on a claim of error only if the instructions,viewed as a whole,were confusing,misleading and prejudicial.united states clark,cir.
jury charge omitting instruction that substantial tax was due and owing 
at trial,heath objected to the district court jury charge describing the elements of tax evasion under.he contended that the government had to prove that a substantial amount of tax was due and owing for each count of tax evasion.in support of his position,heath relied on the model jury instructions contained in kevin et,federal jury practice and instructions criminal ed,which in turn cites a sixth circuit decision,united states burkhart,cir,that uses the term substantial when discussing.
the government disagreed with heath,contending that the language of the statute simply requires proof that any tax is due and owing.agreeing with the government,the district court denied heath request to insert the word substantial into the jury instructions.the final jury instruction on this point read as follows one element of attempted tax evasion is an amount of federal tax due and owing by the defendant for the years in question.emphasis added.
the government correctly points out that the language of the statute under which heath was charged does not contain a substantiality requirement.section provides as follows any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title or the payment thereof shall,in addition to other penalties provided by law,be guilty of a felony emphasis added.the elements of are limited to willfulness the existence of a tax deficiency and an affirmative act constituting evasion or attempted evasion of the tax.united states deniro,cir quoting sansone united states,d citations omitted see also united states marashi,cir the language of does not contain a substantiality requirement.it simply states that willful attempts to evade any tax under the tax code is a felony.
in some circumstances,however,such as where the amount of tax owed the government is in dispute and the government relies on a net worth theory to prove the amount of tax due,a number of courts have held that a substantiality instruction is necessary.the model instructions cited by heath recommend that the phrase substantial tax be inserted into the first element of the offense,at least when the government employs a net worth theory of proof,and note that most circuits require the government to prove that the amount of the tax evaded was substantial.kevin,fed jury prac.inst.
use of the net worth method to establish tax liability is employed where the government is unable to offer direct evidence that tax was underpaid because the taxpayer books and records are falsified,incomplete,or indecipherable.beth bates,annotation,sufficiency of government proof of taxpayer beginning net worth in felony prosecution for income tax evasion,under or its predecessor,relying on net worth method,fed.where there is insufficient direct evidence of tax liability in the form of proper tax records,the government must rely on circumstantial evidence to prove the taxpayer taxable but unreported income during the years in question.id.because the supreme court has suggested that the net worth method of proof is fraught with danger for the innocent,holland united states,some circuits have held that where the net worth method is used to prove the amount of tax owed,the phrase substantial tax must be included as part of the first element of.see united states sorrentino,cir holding that where the government uses a net worth theory to prove the amount of tax a defendant owes,the government must prove that the increase in the defendant net worth for each year in question exceeded his reported taxable income by a substantial amount.
the model instructions acknowledge,however,that substantiality is not an element of,and cite numerous sixth circuit cases that define the elements of consistent with the instructions given in the case before us.see kevin,fed jury prac.inst.see also united states daniel,cir holding that when the defendant failed to file his federal income tax return,and the government determined his tax liability,a tax deficiency arose by operation of law,fulfilling the tax deficiency element of section united states reed,cir stating that the requirement for deficiency is met if taxes owed are more than zero.
in the present case there was no dispute at trial over the amount that heath owed in unpaid taxes.the government knew what heath tax liability was for the years in question because heath filed annual tax returns that reported his income.his liability arose not from unreported income,but from his decision to claim that he was exempt from paying taxes on what he reported.furthermore,heath never contended that the amount stated as due and owing by the government was incorrect.he instead argued that his failure to pay taxes on his stated income was not willful because he had a good faith belief that he was not obligated to pay taxes to the united states government.we therefore conclude that the district court did not err in refusing to include the term substantial in the jury instructions,even if we assume that such is required when the government uses a net worth theory of proof to establish the amount of unpaid income tax.see united states burkhart,cir holding that the government was required to prove a substantial understatement of income in a case where it used the net worth method to establish the defendant tax liability.
jury charge on willful conduct 
heath also argues that the district court erroneously informed the jury that it was not required to find that heath conduct was willful for each year charged in the indictment.although heath is correct in noting that the court originally misspoke while giving the jury instructions,the mistake was immediately corrected when the court accurately stated that the jury was required to find that the defendant conduct was willful in each year charged in order to find him guilty.the court specifically instructed the jury as follows you reminded that you are not required me.you reminded that you are required to find the defendant conduct was willful in each year charged in the indictment.because the court instantly corrected its mistake,the jury was properly charged on the willfulness element of the crime of tax evasion.heath argument on this issue is therefore without merit.
