background 
fuller forced medication 
on august,fuller was placed at mpc because he had attempted to set himself on fire and was experiencing auditory hallucinations vallabhaneni,the psychiatrist who treated fuller at mpc,found that fuller was suffering from a serious mental illness with a diagnosis of delusional disorder,paranoid,with a differential diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia.in october,fuller was once again transferred to mpc due to paranoid delusions that he was being poisoned,presenting himself in an inappropriate fashion by remaining undressed,experiencing auditory hallucinations,and attempt sic to burn himself alive by putting a sheet over his head and lighting it.
on february,after fuller refused to voluntarily take psychotropic medication,vallabhaneni wrote to the treatment review committee recommending that fuller be involuntarily medicated with psychotropic medication because fuller was becoming very paranoid,gravely disabled,and likely to pose harm to self or others.according to vallabhaneni,the forced psychotropic medication may help fuller relieve his paranoid delusions.
on february,the treatment review committee,consisting of defendants zielinski and vidal,met to review vallabhaneni forced medication recommendation.at the february hearing,fuller presented himself to the committee in a very polite and appropriate fashion and challenged vallabhaneni recommendation to force him to undergo psychotropic medication on the grounds that the doctor did not speak with him for more than five minutes on any one occasion and that sometimes vallabhaneni was unable to remember fuller name.fuller further argued,incorrectly,that he had no history of violent episodes he twice tried to kill himself by lighting himself on fire once by putting a sheet over his head and lighting it.finally,fuller explained that his opinion that vallabhaneni was the was only a religious belief and that such beliefs did not harm any one.
the committee concluded that fuller had no insight into his mental illness nor into his need for medication.the administration of enforced medication is without doubt in the inmate best interests.without the medication the inmate will continue to deteriorate.it is believed that a substantial risk exists that physical harm will be inflicted by the inmate upon himself others as has been evidenced by his behavior during his psychotic episodes.
though the inmate is not displaying any florid symptoms of psychosis at this point,his letters clearly indicate that he is delusional and paranoid and somewhat agitated in his beliefs.it is thus believed that such symptoms are prodromal to his deteriorating to a more severe state.
after the committee approved vallabhaneni decision,fuller was forcibly administered psychotropic medication,and although he filed a written appeal to shansky,the illinois department of corrections medical director,no written decision by shansky was ever produced 
illinois forced administration of psychotropic medication 
if prison officials in the state of illinois determine that an inmate is in need of forced psychotropic medication,prison medical staff must follow the guidelines set forth in the illinois administrative code.pursuant to,prison officials may administer psychotropic medication as follows 
a administration of psychotropic medication 
psychotropic medication shall not be administered to any committed person against his or her will or without the consent of the parent or guardian of a minor who is under the age of and confined in the juvenile division,unless 
a a psychiatrist,or in the absence of a psychiatrist a physician,has determined that 
i the committed person suffers from a mental illness or mental disorder and 
ii the medication is in the medical interest of the committed person and 
iii the committed person is either gravely disabled or poses a likelihood of serious harm to self or others and 
b the administration of such medication has been approved by the treatment review committee after a hearing see subsection b of this section.
b treatment review committee procedures 
the treatment review committee shall be comprised of two members appointed by the chief administrative officer,both of whom shall be mental health professionals and one of whom shall be a physician.one member shall serve as chairperson of the committee.neither of the committee members may be involved in the current decision to order the medication.the members of the committee shall have completed a training program in the procedural and mental health issues involved which has been approved by the agency medical director.
c review by agency medical director 
if the committed person appeals the treatment review committee decision,staff shall continue to administer the medication as ordered by the physician and approved by the committee while awaiting the agency medical director decision on the appeal.
the following series of events must occur,under the illinois administrative code,before prison officials are authorized to administer psychotropic medication against an inmate will.initially,a psychiatrist or physician must conclude that the inmate was suffering from a mental illness or mental disorder the medication is in the prisoner medical interest and the inmate is either gravely disabled or poses a likelihood of serious harm to self or others.a a i iii.second,the inmate,under a b,is entitled to a second level of review of the decision to forcibly medicate him in the form a hearing before the treatment review committee,comprised of two mental health professionals one of which must be a physician.b.if the committee agrees with the treating doctor,the inmate is immediately subjected to forced medication.however,after forced medication has started,the is entitled to a third level of review under illinois law within five days,the inmate may appeal the decision to forcibly medicate him to the medical director of the illinois department of corrections.c et.
ii.analysis 
a.the decision to forcibly medicate fuller 
on appeal,fuller argues that the decision to forcibly medicate him violated his due process rights for two reasons.initially,he alleges that illinois procedure for forced medication is facially unconstitutional because,according to fuller,it does not provide for administrative review until after the medication has been administered.the second claim fuller makes is that prison officials violated his due process rights by failing to follow illinois state procedure before medicating him.
whether illinois requires administrative review 
fuller first claim,that illinois does not require administrative review before a prisoner is forcibly medicated,is based on his faulty premise that the initial decision to medicate him came from the treatment review committee.however,as section and the record clearly establish,the initial decision to medicate fuller was made by his treating psychiatrist,vallabhaneni,and not by the treatment review committee.
on february,vallabhaneni wrote to the chairman of the treatment review committee and stated that,after examination and treatment,he had found fuller to be in need of psychotropic medication on an involuntary basis because he had become very paranoid remained seclusive and suspicious posed a likely threat of harm to self or others and was gravely disabled.vallabh
