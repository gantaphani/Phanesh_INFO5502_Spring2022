the specific issue in this appeal is whether and to what extent the state of wisconsin department of public instruction dpi must disclose records uncovered in its investigation into the use of time out or seclusion rooms for disciplining students at the abraham lincoln elementary school lincoln in monroe,wisconsin,to disability rights wisconsin,drw the agency authorized to investigate alleged incidents of abuse or neglect of people with mental or physical disabilities in the state.the broader issue concerns the scope of state protection and advocacy agencies rights to records when the agencies have reason to believe that the citizens they are charged with protecting are being abused or neglected.drw brought suit in federal court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to compel dpi to turn over its records.the district court denied drw motion,reasoning that the relevant statutes require drw to know the names of students who may have been placed in the seclusion rooms or at least try to obtain permission from their legal representatives to access the records.the district court also concluded that drw failed to show that it had exhausted the available administrative issue meriting no further consideration since dpi expressly abandoned it at oral argument.we vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.
background 
drw is a nonprofit stock corporation designated by the state of wisconsin to serve as its protection and advocacy agency agency,as required under federal law.stat.wisconsin trusts that drw,in this capacity,will protect individuals with disabilities or mental illness and be an advocate on their behalf.the three federal statutes requiring that the states establish agencies and governing their operations are the developmental disabilities and bill of rights act the dd act,the protection and advocacy for mentally ill individuals act of the paimi act and the protection and advocacy of individual rights act the pair act known collectively as the federal protection and advocacy statutes or the federal statutes.dd act,paimi act,pair act.
the federal statutes,which congress enacted after concluding that state systems for protecting the rights of individuals with disabilities varied widely and were in many cases inadequate,condition federal funding for each state on the establishment of an effective protection and advocacy system for individuals with mental illness or physical disabilities,a,a f.
lincoln has two seclusion rooms that it has in the past used as part of its special education program to place students who had become unruly on if their individual education plans ieps allowed it,jt.stipulated findings of fact.the general idea behind seclusion rooms is to remove children from the classroom who are behaving inappropriately to allow them time and space to calm down and regain control of their behavior,ex.staff also have used the room to seclude students presenting dangers to themselves or to others,ex.
in october,the parents of,a student enrolled in lincoln special education program,complained to drw that a staff member had physically restrained and dragged to a seclusion room on the of the school this report was apparently the first report that drw received regarding the use of seclusion rooms at lincoln.
the seclusion room at issue in the complaint was approximately five feet by nine feet in size.dark grey carpeting covered the floor and the walls.fluorescent ceiling lighting illuminated the room,along with a window in the door.the door to the room had a lock and no interior door knob,which violated the fire code and has since been remedied,jt.stipulated findings of fact.
on february,a television station in madison,wisconsin,informed dpi that it intended to air a report about a seclusion room in a state school district.the station refused to identify the district to dpi.on march,a reporter from the station requested comments from drw regarding an investigation into the seclusion room at lincoln.the television report,which aired on march,showed the seclusion room and included interviews with children who claimed they had been locked inside.the broadcast also featured interviews with those children parents.
after the broadcast,additional parents who either knew or suspected that their children had been locked in the seclusion room requested help from drw.because many of these children are nonverbal or have limited verbal capacities,some parents are unable to determine whether their children were placed in the seclusion room.also following the broadcast,agency charged with,among other things,enforcing compliance with state and federal special education laws in an investigation into lincoln use of the seclusion room.dpi concluded that the room violated a number of state and federal laws and revealed that lincoln staff had placed six children inside.its report,however,did not identify the children by name.
drw obtained a copy of dpi findings on april,and that same day informed dpi that it was conducting its own investigation of the room.drw also asked dpi to provide a copy of its investigative file which would include the names of the children or send a copy of its findings to the parents of the six children who had been placed in the seclusion room during the school year.dpi eventually sent the file but redacted the children names and any information that might identify them.dpi explained that it decided to redact the information based on court decisions,state and federal pupil confidentiality laws including the individuals with disabilities education improvement act idea and the family educational rights and privacy act ferpa,and preliminary guidance received from the department of education.
drw eventually filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in the western district of wisconsin,seeking release of the names.the district court converted the motion to a motion for a permanent injunction and gave the parties time to file additional materials.the court eventually denied drw request,reasoning that drw did not show that it had exhausted its administrative remedies or explain why it need not do so,and also that the federal protection and advocacy statutes require drw to know the names of the individuals whose records it wishes to access or to try to obtain consent for that access from the students legal representatives.drw timely appealed,arguing that the federal statutes entitle it to all the information in dpi files.

a.the federal statutes 
dpi contends that the federal statutes do not entitle drw to the information it seeks.drw contends that it is entitled to the information it seeks even in the absence of authorization from the individuals guardians.addressing those arguments requires a close examination of the federal statutes governing the protection and advocacy system.
the core requirement of the federal statutes is that,in order to receive federal funding,each state must establish an effective protection and advocacy system to respond to allegations of abuse and neglect and generally to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities.a a i a f.the dd act,the paimi act and the pair act establish separate but largely parallel regimes to serve particular populations of people with disabilities.see gary gross,protection and advocacy system vindicate the rights of persons with disabilities,mental and physical disability law rptr,providing extensive background on the system.
the dd act,which congress enacted in,was the first statute to establish a federally directed system.it,like the paimi and pair acts,requires that states establish agencies such as drw,and authorizes those agencies to pursue legal,administrative,and other appropriate remedies or approaches to ensure that individuals with disabilities are protected.a a i.the dd act,however,limits the scope of the agencies authority to individuals with developmental disabilities.a.to qualify for services under the dd act,an individual must have a severe,chronic disability that became manifest before the age of and that results in substantial functional limits in three or more major life activities,including,receptive and expressive language,learning,mobility,capacity for independent living and economic.a.
the paimi act,which contains many of the same directives as the dd act,was enacted in to protect the rights of individuals with mental illness by requiring,as a condition of federal funding,that states establish systems with authority to investigate and remedy suspected abuse or neglect of individuals with mental illness.a.the paimi act initially applied only to individuals with mental illness living in facilities,which included,among other things,nursing homes,community facilities,board and care homes,homeless shelters and prisons.e.in,congress amended the paimi act to cover individuals with mental illness living in community settings,including their own homes.b ii.to qualify for services under the paimi act,an individual must have a significant mental illness or emotional impairment,as determined by a mental health professional.the paimi act,like the dd act,directs that agencies shall have broad investigatory authority to carry out their responsibility to protect individuals with mental illness and to advocate on their behalf.a.
the third statute relating to the state system is the pair act,which congress enacted in to serve people with disabilities who were not covered under either the dd act or the paimi act.to receive federal funds under the pair act,a state must establish a system that has the same general authorities,including access to records and program income,as are set forth in the dd act.f.
each of the three federal statutes supplies state agencies with broad investigatory authority,including access to certain records.a h i a f.the statutes specifically authorize agencies such as drw to investigate incidents of abuse or neglect of individuals when the agencies receive complaints or determine that there is probable is,reasonable grounds to believe that an individual has been,or may be,subject to abuse or neglect.a b a a f the statutes further authorize the agencies to pursue administrative,legal and other appropriate remedies to ensure the protection of individuals with disabilities or mental illness in the state.a a i a f.
in addition to granting general investigative power,the federal statutes also state that the agencies must have access to all records of any individual with disabilities or mental illness who is a client of the system if such individual or legal guardian,conservator,or other legal representative of such individual,has authorized the system to have such access.a i i a a f.in circumstances where an individual has no parent or guardian,the agencies may access records so long as they have probable cause to believe that abuse has occurred.a i ii a b f.finally,where the individual guardian has failed or refused to act,the agencies may access records under the dd act and the pair act so long as they have probable cause to believe that the individual has been subject to abuse or neglect,or,under the paimi act,they have probable cause to believe that an individual health or safety is in serious and immediate jeopardy.a i iii a c f.thus,in general,the federal statutes require the agencies to obtain a guardian consent before they may access individual records.two issues follow from this requirement whether the records that drw seeks are individual records and whether something special about the present case alters or eliminates the general consent requirement in these circumstances.
records under the federal statutes 
whether the records that drw seek fall within the ambit of individual records is not an easy issue to resolve the records are not easily classified.but it is important to examine the definition of the term,since,in ordinary cases,the classification of the documents sought will control the terms of their release.
records,under the dd act,include 
a report prepared or received by any staff at any location at which services,supports,or other assistance is provided to individuals with developmental disabilities a report prepared by an agency or staff person charged with investigating reports of incidents of abuse or neglect,injury,or death occurring at such location,that describes the incidents and steps taken to investigate and a discharge planning record.
c.the pair act,once again,is parallel to the dd act.f.the paimi act defines records as reports prepared by any staff of a facility rendering care and treatment or reports prepared by an agency charged with investigating reports of incidents of abuse,neglect,and injury occurring at such facility that describe incidents of abuse,neglect,and injury occurring at such facility and the steps taken to investigate such incidents,and discharge planning records.b a.
dpi argued in the district court that the information drw seeks does not constitute a record within the meaning of the federal statutes because dpi is not a facility nor is it charged with investigating abuse or neglect.the fact that dpi is not a facility is of no moment the potential abuse or neglect took place at lincoln,and lincoln easily meets the definition of a facility.facility includes any setting that provides care,treatment,services and habilitation.the argument that dpi itself is not an agency charged with investigating reports of abuse or neglect is also beside the point.for starters,dpi did in fact investigate complaints of potential abuse or neglect at lincoln.and in the end,it is up to drw to determine whether abuse did in fact occur preventing drw from obtaining the information it needs to investigate on the basis that dpi did something it was not required to do frustrates the goals of the federal system.
drw,on the other hand,argues that,while it is seeking records,it need not obtain authorization before it is entitled to the information.drw,it seems to us,is essentially trying to draw a distinction between investigatory information and individual records.since,drw reasons,the federal statutes expressly authorize the agencies to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect if they have probable cause to believe that the abuse occurred,the agencies must also have access to records about that abuse.although this argument has some intuitive appeal,it fails to address the fact that each federal statute contains provisions pertaining to the release of records that are entirely separate from the provisions supplying the agencies with investigatory authority.and for the most part,the records provisions specifically require that the agencies obtain a guardian authorization before they may have access to records except where an individual has no guardian or,under the dd act and the pair act,the agencies have probable cause to believe that abuse or neglect has occurred or,under the paimi act,that abuse is imminent and the guardian has failed to act.
some textual support for drw apparent distinction between investigatory information and individual records seems to come from a j i,which directs that agencies must have access to the records of individuals described in subparagraphs b and i,and other records relevant to conducting an investigation,under the circumstances described in those subparagraphs emphasis added.the language relating to other records initially seems to support drw although the language directly concerns how quickly a agency is entitled to records,it does appear to be broader than the language governing individual records and contains no limiting language.but if other records covers the information that drw seeks about dpi investigation including the names of the the authorization requirement for individual records seems rather innocuous.if a j i quoted above allows an outside agency to access individual records without authorization simply because the records are relevant to an investigation,why
