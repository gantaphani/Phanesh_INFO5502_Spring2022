in this action filed pursuant to puerto rico medical malpractice law,articles and of the puerto rico civil code,laws ann.tit,and the federal emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala,the district court excluded the testimony of the plaintiffs lone expert witness at trial.as a result of the court ruling,the plaintiffs failed to offer proof on crucial elements of their case,and the district court consequently granted judgment as a matter of law for the defendants.the plaintiffs appeal,arguing that the district court abused its discretion when it excluded the expert testimony and that its award of judgment for the defendants must be vacated.we agree.
the plaintiffs brought this action against mennonite general hospital,two physicians,and several others,alleging that the defendants negligence caused the premature birth of their daughter and her death two days later,in violation of puerto rico law.they also alleged that the hospital violated emtala when it failed to follow its own established medical screening protocols in treating hazel.
as part of their case in chief on both the emtala and puerto rico law claims,the plaintiffs proposed to introduce testimony from one expert witness,carlos ramírez.the plaintiffs disclosed their intention to call ramírez at the scheduling conference held by the district court on june.in due course,they provided the defendants with a copy of the expert report prepared by ramírez and with a version of his resume that was current through.ramírez was deposed by counsel for the defendants in november.
a jury trial began on march.on the fourth day of trial,the plaintiffs called ramírez to testify.in response to an oral motion by the defendants,however,the court conducted a daubert inquiry outside the presence of the jury and ruled that ramírez was not a qualified expert and would not be permitted to testify.see daubert merrell dow.the court then determined that the plaintiffs lacked evidence to support their claims and granted the defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law on that basis.
the plaintiffs appeal.as we have addressed the relevant law on the admission of expert testimony at some length in our recent opinion in,cir,we briefly restate our discussion there and offer a few additional points.
to succeed with a medical malpractice claim,a plaintiff must introduce evidence on causation and the standard of care in the relevant medical circumstances.see id.at listing elements of medical malpractice under puerto rico law.almost invariably,a trier of fact will need expert testimony in order to determine the applicable standard of care and to make a judgment on the cause of the injury.id.similarly,expert testimony is generally required to assess certain elements of an emtala claim.see,sociedad española de auxilio mutuo y beneficiencia de,cir finding that w ithout an expert witness through which to enter medical records or provide an opinion in support of their emtala allegations plaintiffs could not satisfy their burden of proving an emtala violation.for example,as the district court below noted,without expert testimony,it was impossible to determine whether or not plaintiff cruz was demonstrating the symptoms that require activation of mennonite general hospital protocol for patients with bleeding during the third trimester of pregnancy,a necessary finding for the plaintiffs emtala claim to succeed.
as we explained in,the judge task in determining whether to admit or exclude expert testimony is to ensure that the expert testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.at quoting united states mooney,cir additional quotation marks omitted.although a district court has substantial discretion to make admissibility determinations on expert testimony,that discretion is not without bounds.id.at.an expert with appropriate credentials and an appropriate foundation for the opinion at issue must be permitted to present testimony as long as the testimony has a tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.id.at quoting.generally,if an expert has scientific,technical,and other specialized knowledge that will assist the trier better to understand a fact in issue,gaydar sociedad instituto y planificacion familiar,cir quotation marks omitted,and that knowledge rests on a reliable foundation,mooney,at quotation marks omitted,that testimony must be admitted,at.
