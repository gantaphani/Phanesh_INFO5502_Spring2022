ii.factual background 
defendant medical practice 
defendant is a physician who owned and operated two clinics in,the mckee medical center in mckee,kentucky,and the richmond medical center in richmond,kentucky.in,defendant sold the clinics to mountain after hours clinic corporation mahc.as part of the sale,defendant became an employee of mahc and was issued of the shares of stock in mahc.by,mahc owned four other clinics in hazard,nicholson,london,and somerset,kentucky.
during,when defendant owned the mckee and richmond clinics,the billing for both clinics was done at the mckee clinic.tammy spurlock,defendant office manager,testified that she,beverly lainhart,and renee hudson did billing work.between january and december of,all billing for the six mahc clinics was performed by an outside billing service,office management services oms.in april of,oms stopped providing billing services for mahc,and the mckee clinic began doing billing for all of the clinics.
to bill its services,a medical clinic issues an invoice to the patient insurer that contains a current procedure terminology cpt code.the cpt code indicates to the insurer the level of service rendered by the clinic and the amount of reimbursement owed to the clinic.when a medical practitioner sees a patient,the practitioner records a cpt code on an encounter form to record the services performed.the cpt codes for established patients range from the least expensive,to the most expensive.the cpt codes for new patients range from the least expensive,to the most expensive.cost.tr.one type of scheme occurs where the cpt numbers are changed on the encounter forms billing sheets sent to the insurance companies so that it appears as if the clinic performed more expensive services than were actually provided.
in,defendant helped recruit seven foreign physicians for mahc.defendant recruited them under a program that allows foreign doctors to stay in the united states if they secure employment in medically areas.under this program,mahc had to meet several requirements including submitting a labor condition application lca to the dol,and a petition for nonimmigrant worker an form to the ins,setting forth information such as the physician wage,for each physician hired.mahc was required to pay each foreign doctor no less than the prevailing wage for the average wage paid to physicians in the area for comparable work.
the mckee clinic was designated a rural health clinic by medicare.as a rural health clinic,the mckee clinic was reimbursed a flat rate for each patient it saw,regardless of the treatment rendered.the mckee clinic was required to submit to medicare a yearly cost report a summation of the costs incurred by the clinic in treating patients.once a clinic reached the maximum reimbursement rate set by,additional expenses on the cost report were not reimbursed during that year.however,reported costs were used to calculate future reimbursement rates per patient.shreve,tr.
in may,a cost report was prepared for the mckee clinic for the period of october,through september,which included of defendant personal expenses.defendant alleges that when defendant operated as a sole proprietor of the richmond and mckee clinics,prior to their purchase by mahc,defendant often used business checks to pay personal expenses and would,at the end of the year,separate the personal and business expenses in order to prepare the corporation tax returns.defendant contends that his personal expenses were inadvertently included on the cost report.

presentence investigation report psr loss calculation 
the probation office determined that it would be difficult to discern an actual loss figure for counts and,but that an intended loss figure could be calculated for the conduct which occurred in.therefore,the psr calculated an intended loss figure of for counts and,based on evidence of defendant scheme.the psr calculated an intended loss figure of for count,equal to the amount of defendant personal expenses which were included in the cost report submitted to.the probation office determined that an intended loss amount for counts and,related to defrauding,could not be quantified.thus,the psr recommended that a total intended loss figure of should be attributed to defendant as to counts through.
the psr arrived at the intended loss figure of for counts and through a complex series of ten steps.first,the probation office went through encounter forms seized from the mckee medical center on november,and extracted all of the encounter forms from for patients with private insurance that were marked with,and cpt codes.second,the encounter forms in each cpt code category were counted.third,of the private insurance companies billed by mahc in,a sample of ten insurance companies were contacted to determine their usual and customary charges for each cpt code.
fourth,using the customary charges for each cpt code at each of the ten selected insurance companies,the probation office computed the payment difference that would have resulted had each category of cpt codes been and billed at a higher cpt code.for example,the probation office calculated the payment difference between to to determine the amount of loss each of the ten insurance companies would have suffered had encounter forms marked with a been and billed under a cpt code.the probation office determined the payment differences between the following additional cpt categories for each of the ten insurance companies to,to,and to.
fifth,an average payment difference was computed for each of the above categories of possible cpt.for example,the probation office determined that the average payment difference between services coded and was.psr.sixth,the number of encounter forms in each cpt category determined in step was multiplied by the average payment difference for each category determined in step to calculate an intended loss figure for each category of cpt codes.for example,for cpt code,the probation office calculated an intended loss figure for of by multiplying the average payment difference between and by the number of encounter forms for seized from the mckee clinic.seventh,the intended loss figures for each cpt category were added together to come up with a total intended loss figure for of.this figure represents the loss which would have occurred had each claim in each cpt category for been.psr.
eighth,the probation office determined an intended loss figure for of,by backtracking from the intended loss figure calculated for.the probation office determined that defendant had extensive control over the billing of three of the six clinics in the mahc system during,when the billing for mahc was conducted by oms.psr.therefore,the probation office calculated the intended loss figure for by multiplying the intended loss figure for by.
ninth,the probation office determined an intended loss figure for of.since defendant operated only two clinics in,the probation office calculated an intended loss for by multiplying the intended loss figure for by.psr.finally,the probation office added together its intended loss calculations for,and to arrive at a total loss calculation of for counts and.psr.
for counts through,the probation office calculated an actual loss figure of.psr.this was based on the amount of pay the foreign physicians were entitled to but did not receive during their employment with mahc.psr.for counts through,the probation office calculated an intended loss of.this figure equals the difference between the wage reported to the united states minus the contract amount,multiplied by the number of years of the contract,for each foreign physician.this intended loss amount represents the amount of money per contract that mahc stood to gain by illegally paying its foreign physicians below the prevailing wage.the probation office used the intended loss calculation for counts through,because it was greater than the calculated actual loss,and combined it with the intended loss calculation for counts through to calculate a total intended loss figure for counts through of.
based on this loss calculation,the probation office recommended a total offense level of.calls for a base offense level of for violations of and.the psr recommended a level increase because the intended loss totaled more than but less than.b k.the psr recommended a level increase because the offense included more than minimal planning,and an additional level increase because the abuse of a private trust facilitated the offense.thus the psr recommended a base offense level of plus a level increase,for a total offense level of.based on the recommended total offense level of and defendant criminal history category of i,the psr recommended a guideline range for imprisonment of to months.
defendant sentencing 
on august,the district court sentenced defendant to months.the district court did not order restitution.sentencing.the district court adopted the psr calculation of an intended loss of for counts and,and an intended loss of for count,for a total intended loss of for counts through.
with regards to counts through,the district court adopted the psr actual loss calculation of,after determining that the intended loss calculation relating to counts through was too speculative.sentencing,tr.however,because the court determined that the conduct charged in counts through fell outside the heartland of cases that the applicable sentencing guideline was designed to address,the court decided not to hold defendant accountable for the actual loss caused by his alleged conduct in counts through.accordingly,the district court determined that the total loss attributable to defendant was the intended loss calculated for counts through minus the actual loss calculated for counts through.
applying,the district court determined that the base offense level was,and added points as recommended in the psr because the offense involved more than minimal planning and the violation of a private trust.the district court added an level increase because the amount of loss it determined was attributable to defendant was above and below.b i.thus,the district court assessed a total offense level of,for which the applicable guideline range was to months.sentencing tr.the district court sentenced defendant to months of imprisonment and two years supervised release on each count to be served concurrently.sentencing tr.now defendant appeals both his conviction and sentence as to all counts.
iii.analysis 
sufficiency of.standard of review 
when evaluating a claim of insufficient evidence,a reviewing court must determine whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.harris,cir citing jackson virginia,d emphasis in original.a defendant claiming insufficiency of evidence bears a very heavy burden.us vannerson,cir.c ircumstantial evidence alone can sustain a guilty verdict.us ellerbee,cir citation omitted.the evidence need not remove every possible hypothesis except that of guilt.us williams,cir citations omitted.

defendant argues there is insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for counts and,defrauding or attempting to defraud private health insurance companies.however,many staff members testified that defendant instructed them to bill office visits covered by private insurance under cpt codes or,regardless of the cpt code entered by the attending physician on the encounter form.the staff members were aware that this scheme resulted in higher reimbursement from private insurance companies.justice,tr.after the fbi searched the mckee clinic and defendant home and seized encounter forms,insurance information,and records,staff members testified that the ceased.howard,tr.
