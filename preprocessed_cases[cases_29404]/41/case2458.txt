we are required on this appeal to construe the language of the emergency medical treatment and active labor act of emtala,as implemented by.emtala prevents transfers,without stabilizing treatment,of patients who come to a hospital emergency room.the complaint alleges that decedent harold arrington suffered a heart attack on his way to work in the ambulance,on the way to the queen medical center queen hospital,the emergency personnel radioed ahead to advise the hospital emergency room of their imminent arrival norbert wong,the emergency room doctor on duty,redirected the ambulance to a different hospital five miles away from queen and arrington died soon after arrival at the more distant hospital.the issue before us is whether the plaintiffs have stated a claim under emtala on the basis of the defendants failure to provide emergency treatment to arrington.
on may,at approximately,harold arrington arrington was driving to his job as a security guard when he experienced difficulty breathing.one of his called for an ambulance it arrived shortly after midnight.the ambulance left the scene at to take arrington to the closest medical facility,the queen medical center queen hospital.
norbert wong was the emergency room physician on duty at queen hospital.while under way,the ambulance personnel contacted the hospital emergency room by radio.they relayed the details of arrington medical condition to wong.arrington was in severe respiratory distress speaking words at a time and breathing about times a minute.wong asked the ambulance personnel who was the patient doctor.the ambulance personnel replied patient is a tripler army medical center patient,being that he was in severe respiratory distress we thought we come to a close facility.wong responded i think it would be okay to go to tripler.the ambulance personnel took this as a directive and changed their route so as to proceed to the more distant hospital.by the time the ambulance arrived at tripler it was and arrington condition had deteriorated.he was pronounced dead at 
on may,plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in federal district court against three sets of defendants wong and his employers,the emergency,the emergency personnel,clarence uyema and jerry ho,and their employers,the city and county of honolulu and the queen medical center.the amended complaint alleged,among other things,a violation of the emergency medical treatment and active labor act of emtala.subsequently,queens filed a rule b motion to dismiss lack of jurisdiction,wong and the emergency group filed a rule b motion to dismiss failure to state a claim,and the city and county of honolulu,clarence uyema and jerry ho filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under rule c.the district court heard all three motions on september,and two days later filed its order.it granted the defendants motions and dismissed the plaintiffs complaint on the ground that,for the purposes of emtala,arrington had never come to queens emergency department.the court concluded that emtala applied only in the case of a patient physical presence in the emergency room.see arrington wong,d.this appeal ensued.

iii.analysis 
to provide emergency treatment to indigent and uninsured patients,congress enacted the emergency medical treatment and active labor act of emtala,commonly known as the patient act,to prevent hospitals dumping indigent patients by either refusing to provide emergency medical treatment or transferring patients before their conditions were stabilized.james sunrise,cir quoting eberhardt city of los angeles,cir internal quotation marks omitted.see also gatewood washington healthcare,stating that emtala passed amid growing reports in the of hospitals denying emergency health care services to the poor and uninsured.the provisions of emtala are not limited to the indigent and uninsured,however.because emtala is clear on its face,we have held that the act applies to any and all patients,not just to patients with insufficient resources.james,at quoting brooker desert hosp,cir.
under emtala,for those hospitals with an emergency department if any individual comes to the emergency department and a request is made on the individual behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition,the hospital must provide for an appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital emergency department.a emphasis added.if,after screening,the hospital determines that an emergency medical condition exists,the hospital generally may not transfer the patient without stabilizing his condition.id.b a.in the case before us,the question we must decide is whether arrington attempt to reach the hospital falls within the scope of emtala comes to language.
to do so,we must first determine whether the language of emtala is sufficiently clear to apply without interpretation.in the ordinary case,courts simply apply the unambiguous terms of a statute to the case before them.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.if the language of the statute is not clear on its face,courts examine the specific and general statutory context in which the phrase is used in an effort to discern a determinate meaning.see robinson shell oil,d the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole estate of cowart nicklos drilling,d mccarthy bronson,d see also brown gardner,d ambiguity is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory context.king vincent,d t he meaning of statutory language,plain or not,depends on context.when a statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,courts will generally interpret the statute,unless an agency with the power to construe the statute has already provided a construction.chevron,at.in that circumstance,the court must determine whether the agency interpretation is permissible if so,that interpretation applies.id.where congress expressly delegates to an agency the power to construe a statute,we review the agency interpretation under the arbitrary and capricious standard where delegation is implicit,the agency interpretation must be reasonable.id.at.see also fda brown williamson tobacco,d.
in the instant case,appellees urge in their briefs that the phrase comes to the emergency department in a plainly and unambiguously means arrives at a hospital.at oral argument,they again acknowledged that the provision at issue encompasses the entire hospital and its grounds,not just the emergency department.appellants,however,interpret the phrase to include the act of traveling to the hospital webster third new international dictionary supports both definitions.it defines come s to as,among other things,to move toward or away from something approach,or to arrive at a particular place.webster third new international dictionary of the english language unabridged,philip babcock gove,ed purely as a matter of dictionary definition,comes to the emergency department could mean either physical arrival at the emergency room or the act of traveling from the scene of an emergency to or towards the hospital.thus,all agree that the statutory provision may not simply be applied rather it must be construed by an appropriate body.
our reading of the statute as a whole leaves it uncertain precisely what a contemplates whether congress required that an emergency patient be present at the emergency room,that the person be on the hospital grounds,or in a ambulance or whether,as in this case,it is sufficient that the patient be on his way to the hospital in a ambulance in short,we can not say that the statute is unambiguous accordingly,following chevron,at,rather than construe the statute ourselves,we must defer to an agency permissible interpretation,if one exists,of ambiguous statutory terms.in this case,and pursuant to its authority under and,the department of health and human services has promulgated a regulation interpreting a comes to the emergency department language.see.
administrative agency regulations interpreting the rule will often suffice to clarify a standard with an otherwise uncertain scope.village of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d.administrative interpretation and implementation of a regulation are highly relevant to our analysis and a federal court must consider any limiting construction that a n enforcement agency has proffered.city of chicago morales,d quoting ward rock against racism,d.
the department of health and human services has taken an expansive approach to the scope of the phrase comes to the emergency department.see.the department interprets that statutory phrase broadly,to include not just the emergency room itself,but all hospital,outlying facilities,and that once a patient seeking medical treatment presents himself at any facility or vehicle owned or operated by the hospital,he has come to the emergency department.see id.under this provision of the regulation,individuals in ambulances have unquestionably come to the hospital when that ambulance is itself on hospital property.id.
the remaining problem presented by arrington whether hospitals must admit emergency patients who are being transported to the hospital in owned ambulances.specifically,may the hospital emergency room personnel refuse to treat such patients and divert them to other hospitals when the emergency room is called by paramedics or other ambulance attendants and notified that the patient is en route to the hospital.the regulation answers this question as well.it provides that if ambulance personnel contact the hospital to inform the hospital that they want to transport the individual to the hospital for examination and treatment,the hospital may not deny the individual access unless it is in diversionary status,that is,it does not have the staff or facilities to accept any additional emergency patients.id.in other words,a hospital may not prevent a ambulance from coming to the hospital unless it has a valid reason for doing so moreover,even if the hospital is in diversionary status,where the ambulance continues to the hospital in spite of an instruction to take the patient elsewhere,that ambulance comes to the hospital,and emergency treatment of the patient must be provided.id.
the department of health and human services clearly recognized that hospitals could abuse the act simply by diverting all persons in emergency straits,before they arrive on hospital property.under,a hospital can not avoid its obligation to treat emergency patients simply by preventing individuals in dire straits from reaching the emergency room in order to engage in such diversions,the hospital must show that it is in diversionary status that is,that it lacks the staff or facilities to treat a patient.this follows the department consistent position that it would defeat the purpose of emtala if we were to allow hospitals to rely on narrow,legalistic definitions of comes to the emergency department or of emergency department to escape their emtala obligations.emtala,april,to be codified at.accordingly,the department warned that,under,a facility may not prevent an individual from gaining access to the facility in order to circumvent the requirements of emtala.emtala,june,codified at 
in the instant case,arrington was in a ambulance that was en route to queen hospital,and the ambulance personnel contacted the hospital emergency room on his behalf and requested treatment.by the plain language of the agency rules,the hospital was obliged to treat arrington unless the hospital was in diversionary status,or,in other words,lacked the staff or facilities to accept any additional emergency patients at th e time it was contacted.here,queen hospital has not contended that it was in diversionary status at the time wong directed arrington away from queen hospital and to the more distant tripler facility to be in compliance with emtala regulations,queen hospital would have to show that there were insufficient emergency staff available to treat arrington at the time the ambulance personnel called the emergency room that appropriate staff would not be available by the time arrington arrived at the hospital that the hospital did not have the proper equipment with which to treat arrington medical condition or that the appropriate equipment was unavailable because in use,out of order.finally,queen hospital would have to demonstrate that wong knew that there were inadequate staff or facilities available,and that he based his decision to redirect arrington to tripler on a reason,rather than on some other unrelated factor.
in dismissing the complaint,the district court relied on two decisions from other circuits it believed to be dispositive.neither decision,however,is inconsistent with the result we reach here.in johnson university of chicago,cir per curiam,a group of hospitals shared a telemetry system which directed patients to the appropriate emergency facility.id.at.when the paramedics called for permission to bring the patient to the nearest facility,they contacted the central shared system,which informed them that the nearest hospital had declared a partial bypass,and directed them to a different hospital within the system.id.at.in johnson the seventh circuit explicitly held that a telemetry system is distinct from that hospital emergency room,and is not governed by.id.at here,to the contrary,the ambulance carrying arrington directly contacted the queen hospital emergency room moreover,as noted earlier,there is no contention here that the hospital was on diversionary status.
nor is our decision inconsistent with the fifth circuit decision in miller medical,cir.miller held that where the patient was in bed at another medical facility,and a doctor at that facility had,by telephone,requested the hospital to accept his patient for medical treatment,did not apply.see id.at.arrington,by contrast,was not resting in bed at another facility.he was traveling towards,coming to queen hospital by ambulance when the ambulance personnel contacted the hospital emergency department to make arrangements for prompt treatment upon his arrival.
whichever standard of review we were to apply,the agency interpretation passes muster.examining the agency interpretation under the less deferential reasonableness standard,see chevron,at,it is apparent that this rule is consistent with the language of the statute and effectuates its intent.the overarching purpose of emtala is to ensur e that patients,particularly the indigent and underinsured,receive adequate emergency medical care.vargas del puerto,cir citing eberhardt,at.the agency interpretation achieves this purpose,ensuring that emergency patients may be diverted to other hospitals only when the diverting hospital has a valid,reason for doing so.the agency interpretation works no hardship on the hospital.as the department regulations note,only requires hospitals that offer emergency services to provide screening and stabilizing treatment within the scope of their capabilities.emtala.at.furthermore,a failure to treat an emergency patient,by diverting him to another hospital,may have lethal consequences.finally,when a hospital is unable to handle the and is in diversionary status,it may divert emergency patients even if they are in the process of being transported to that hospital because it is the closest.because the agency regulation is consistent with the purposes and language of the statute,we find that interpretation reasonable and certainly not arbitrary or capricious.
iv.conclusion 
the effects of patient dumping on the availability and quality of emergency services for indigent and uninsured patients are well documented.see karen treiger,note preventing patient dumping sharpening the cobra fangs,ci
