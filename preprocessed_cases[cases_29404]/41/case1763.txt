patricia leckenby appeals the district court order affirming a final decision of the commissioner of social security denying her application for social security disability benefits and supplemental security income.for the reasons discussed below,we remand to the district court with directions to remand to the agency for reconsideration.
background 
leckenby applied in may for social security disability benefits and supplemental security income she claimed an inability to engage in substantial gainful employment due to fibromyalgia,chronic back and knee pain,depression and other maladies.the administrative record is replete with medical evaluations,the most relevant of which we summarize below.
physician richard cunningham,treated leckenby on at least four occasions from april through june for headaches,irritable bowel syndrome possibly due to the earlier removal of her gall bladder,osteoarthritis,fibromyalgia,depression and possible carpal tunnel syndrome.in june,cunningham reported that medication had not relieved leckenby fibromyalgia symptoms and noted that she was aching all over and having cramps,diarrhea,and generally feels miserable.admin.rec.at.cunningham next treatment note,from june,reported that leckenby was h aving more and more trouble with pain in her shoulders,hips,back and legs.cunningham also noted at this time that leckenby had poor memory and concentration,had experienced an episode of double vision,experienced frequent headaches and was under a lot of stress.id.at.in a medical source statement mss form dated three days after that visit,cunningham stated that leckenby could stand or walk for a total of less than one hour during an workday,could sit for a total of less than one hour during an workday,and needed to lie down for to minutes on four to five occasions during an day.
physician stanley hayes,examined leckenby in august,apparently in conjunction with an earlier application for social security benefits.hayes noted generalized pain typical for fibromyalgia but found it noteworthy that the patient gives an extremely dramatic and exaggerated withdrawal response to any area of her body that is minimally palpated.id.at.hayes concluded that leckenby functional restrictions were subjective in nature.id.
clinical psychologist david lutz,examined leckenby in january,also apparently in conjunction with an earlier application for social security benefits.with regard to her daily activities,leckenby told lutz that her husband helps her with all chores and meals,as she can not do any of these tasks without pain and that her husband frequently does the shopping,id.at,although she sometimes went shopping because her mother encouraged her to get out of the house more,id.at.lutz stated that leckenby inconsistent response profile on the minnesota multiphasic personality test he administered could indicate symptom exaggeration as a cry for help or an attempt to obtain benefits.id.at.lutz concluded that leckenby had a medical pain disorder likely exacerbated by psychological factors.
reviewing psychologist geoffrey sutton,reviewed leckenby existing mental health records in august.sutton agreed with lutz conclusions except for noting that,in his opinion,no conclusions should have been drawn from the results of leckenby test.sutton completed a residual functional capacity assessment form,similar to an mss,stating that leckenby was markedly limited in her ability to understand,remember and carry out detailed instructions but would be able to understand,remember and carry out simple to moderately complex instructions.sutton also stated that leckenby was moderately limited in her ability to interact appropriately with the general public,to accept instruction and respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors,to be aware of normal hazards and take appropriate precautions,and to set realistic goals or make plans independently of others.
sleep disorder specialist john brabson,diagnosed leckenby with severe obstructive sleep apnea in february.brabson prescribed a cpap,or continuous positive airway pressure,breathing machine with a mask worn over the nose during sleep.in a examination in may,brabson noted that leckenby continued to use the breathing machine as directed and that it adequately treated her sleep apnea.brabson attributed leckenby continuing complaint that she was still somewhat sleepy during the day to from her pain and medications.id.at.
physician david kent,treated leckenby on at least eight occasions from june through january.in june,kent noted leckenby ongoing symptoms of fibromyalgia,depression and carpal tunnel syndrome in both wrists.kent prescribed a combination of three pain medications and recommended counseling,rather than new medication,for her depression because it had not responded to multiple attempts at antidepressant agents.id.at.however,leckenby apparently continued taking lexapro for her depression.kent also ordered magnetic resonance imaging mri of leckenby right knee,which revealed a horizontal tear in the right medial meniscus.after surgery to repair the torn meniscus in august,kent noted that the condition of leckenby right knee had greatly improved.in january,kent also reported that surgical relief for leckenby carpal tunnel syndrome had been very,very helpful to her.id.at.throughout these months,however,kent consistently noted that the diffuse pain,tenderness and hypersensitivity to touch characteristic of fibromyalgia continued unabated and that various prescribed medications failed to reduce leckenby reported pain or improve her sleep at night.
orthopedic specialist richard seagrave,treated leckenby torn meniscus.in a march visit,an mri on the knee showed no more abnormality.seagrave advised exercise,weight loss and a positive attitude and noted his impression that leckenby was capable of more exercise on a daily basis.id.at.
rheumatologist joseph mayus,treated leckenby on at least four occasions from approximately september through august.during this time,mayus recorded continuing objective and,in his view,credible subjective symptoms of fibromyalgia and depression consistent with the impressions of the other physicians,noting that leckenby a ches continuously from day to day and was p oorly tolerant of any activity because of worsening pain,id.at,still has chronic,diffuse unremitting pain and get s out of bed six to eight times a night because of pain,id.at.mayus prescribed new medications in addition to the several leckenby was already taking.the record also contains an mss form from mayus dated october,stating that he began treating leckenby in september.the mss form states that leckenby was suffering from fibromyalgia,chronic fatigue,morbid obesity and depression.it also states that leckenby would miss work about four days a month due to her impairments and could stand for a total of less than two hours,could sit for a total of at least six hours,and would need unscheduled breaks on an average of three occasions during an workday.id.at.in addition,mayus recorded that leckenby would be unable to perform detailed,complicated or tasks and that her symptoms would occasionally interfere with the attention and concentration needed to perform even simple work tasks.in march,mayus completed another mss form dealing more specifically with the effect of leckenby illness on her mental abilities.this form noted moderate limitations on leckenby ability to maintain attention and concentration for extended work periods defined as the approximately work periods between normal breaks,to follow a schedule and be punctual and to work at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and duration of rest periods.
psychiatrist arifa salam,treated leckenby in december and again in march.salam march treatment notes state that leckenby continues to have multiple stressors including health and financial problems and that leckenby p sychological activity was slow,h er insight is slightly limited and h er judgment was adequate.id.at.in an mss form dated june salam stated that leckenby was markedly limited in her ability to maintain attention and concentration for extended approximately work periods,to follow a schedule and be punctual and to work at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and duration of rest periods.id.at.the mss form also stated that leckenby was moderately limited in her ability to understand,remember and carry out detailed instructions,to coordinate or work in proximity to others,to accept instruction and respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors,and to maintain socially appropriate behavior.id.at.
after her application for benefits was denied,leckenby received a hearing before an administrative law judge alj in may.leckenby testified that she was years of age,married,with a daughter and a son.with regard to her daily activities,leckenby testified that her ability to drive a car was very limited and that her husband did most of the laundry,helped her prepare meals and did all of the household cleaning.leckenby testified that she shopped for clothing and groceries once in a while using a motorized cart,watched television,went for short walks and operated her computer.she also stated that she provided care for her children.
with regard to her condition and abilities,leckenby testified that she could walk half a mile with breaks,lift only five to ten pounds,and sit or stand continuously only five to ten minutes at a time.she stated that,on an average day,pain caused her to lie down five or six times per day for minutes at a time between the hours of and.she stated that she had difficulty handling small objects,that her knee surgery did not resolve the pain in her knee and that she had headaches two or three days per week.she also stated that her sleep was disrupted by pain,that she suffered from depression and that,after her gall bladder surgery in,she frequently suffered from diarrhea.in addition,she claimed that her prescription medications made her feel and upset her stomach.
following the process outlined in and,the alj found that leckenby was not gainfully employed that she suffered from the severe impairments of obesity,fibromyalgia and depression and that her mental impairment resulted in slight restriction of the activities of daily living,moderate limitation of social functioning,moderate limitation of ability to maintain concentration,persistence and pace,and no episodes of decompensation of extended duration.the alj found that these impairments did not meet or equal in severity the listed impairments in part,subpart p,appendix and that leckenby residual functional capacity rfc did not allow her to perform her past relevant work.however,based on the testimony of an impartial vocational expert,the alj found that leckenby could perform a range of unskilled jobs at the sedentary exertional level.therefore,the alj denied disability benefits.
in determining that leckenby rfc would allow her to perform work at the sedentary exertional level,the alj rejected in part the rfc opinions reflected on the mss forms of treating physicians cunningham,mayus and salam.in particular,the alj rejected the three physicians opinions that leckenby would be unable to complete an workday without rest periods,or unscheduled breaks,that would be unreasonable in number and duration because these opinions were unsupported by each physician treatment notes or clinical or diagnostic testing,and they were inconsistent with the other evidence of record.the inconsistent evidence cited by the alj included the fact that leckenby had overall required relatively little treatment,that physician hayes had found leckenby functional limitations to be entirely subjective,and that psychologist lutz had found possible symptom exaggeration.the inconsistent evidence also included the alj finding that the daily activities leckenby described in her written application for benefits and to lutz suggested a fairly normal range of daily activities.in addition,the alj rejected the rfc opinion of state reviewing psychologist sutton because he was not privy to the full record available to the alj.
the commissioner appeals council denied review,and the district court affirmed the decision of the alj.on appeal,leckenby argues that the alj failed to assign proper weight to the opinions of her treating medical sources regarding her rfc.leckenby asserts that if those opinions are properly credited,a finding of disability must ensue.
ii.discussion 
our standard of review is as follows 
we review de novo the district court determination of whether substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the alj decision.substantial evidence is less than a preponderance,but enough that a reasonable mind would find it adequate to support the alj decision.in our review,we consider the evidence that supports the alj decision,as well as the evidence that detracts from it,and we will uphold the alj decision if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole even if more than one conclusion could be drawn from the evidence.we do not reweigh the evidence presented to the alj,and we defer to the alj determinations regarding the credibility of testimony,as long as those determinations are supported by good reasons and substantial evidence.

leckenby contends that the alj erred in partially rejecting the rfc opinions on the mss forms prepared by treating physicians cunningham,mayus and salam.the social security regulations provide that a treating physician opinion regarding an applicant impairment will be granted controlling weight,provided the opinion is by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the record.prosch apfel,cir quoting d.we have upheld an alj decision to discount a treating physician mss where the limitations listed on the form stand alone,and were never mentioned in the physician numerous records of treatment nor supported by any objective testing or reasoning.reed,at quoting hogan apfel,cir alteration in reed.although a treating physician opinion is entitled to great weight,it does not automatically control or obviate the need to evaluate the record as whole.pirtle astrue,cir quoting hogan,at.
we first address whether substantial evidence supports the alj determination that the requirements stated on the mss forms were unsupported by each physician own findings and the other medical evidence of record.the alj action here is similar in nature to that in pirtle,where an alj found that a fibromyalgia claimant rfc included a recommended minutes of rest every three hours during the work day but rejected a treating primary physician recommendation of minutes of rest every three hours.at.we found that substantial evidence supported the alj decision to disregard the treating primary physician recommendation because a treating rheumatologist contrary recommendation supported the alj finding the primary physician recommendation stated that minutes would be merely beneficial,rather than required and the primary physician treatment notes did not indicate that he advised the patient to rest minutes every three hours,or that the patient reported a need to rest for minutes every three hours,or that the patient routinely asserted fatigue as a complaint.id.
likewise,in hacker barnhart,cir,a treating physician rfc determination for a claimant suffering from fibromyalgia stated that the claimant would frequently require unscheduled breaks and could not tolerate even minor physical exertion.id.at describing the rfc opinion of mittal.we found that substantial evidence supported the alj decision to disregard these limitations where the physician own treatment notes reported that the claimant responded positively to pain treatment and that the physician repeatedly admonished the claimant to exercise more often,in contradiction of the physician own rfc finding that she could tolerate no physical activity.id.
the record in the instant case does not contain the type of evidence that we found in pirtle and hacker to provide substantial support for an alj decision to reject a treating physician opinion.in contrast to pirtle,where the alj credited a treating rheumatologist opinion over the treating physician,here the trea
