barr laboratories,barr appeals the district court grant of summary judgment,interpreting the amendments of the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act,et,and regulations promulgated thereunder,to pharmachemie,a potential competitor of barr.barr contends that the district court erred in vacating an administrative ruling of the food and drug administration fda that barr,as the first company to file a paragraph iv certification for tamoxifen,a breast cancer drug,as part of its application for fda review and approval of its generic version of tamoxifen,had a statutory right to days of generic exclusivity.after the district court granted summary judgment,pharmachemie lost its court challenge to the underlying patent of the pioneer drug manufacturer tamoxifen.as a result,pharmachemie can not market its generic version of tamoxifen until the patent expires.because the fda ruling no longer causes any redressible harm to pharmachemie,we conclude that the case is moot and,accordingly,we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction,vacate the judgment of the district court,and remand the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the complaint.
the amendments simplified the procedure for obtaining approval of generic drugs.see pub,stat.while a pioneer drug manufacturer must file a new drug application with safety and effectiveness data,subsequent applicants who want to manufacture generic versions of the original drug need only file an abbreviated new drug application anda,which relies on the fda previous determination that the drug is safe and effective.see a,j.as relevant here,the amendments establish an anda certification process that enables generic drug manufacturers to obtain expedited approval of their andas before expiration of the pioneer patent.see id.j a vii,b.the anda must include a paragraph certification that i no patent information has been filed,ii the patent has expired,iii the patent will expire on a date certain,or iv the patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the drug for which the applicant seeks approval.see id.j a vii.relevant here is the paragraph iv certification,which triggers a complex process that potentially allows the anda applicant to market its generic drug before the pioneer patent expires.see id.j b.the fda can approve a paragraph iv certification anda immediately unless the patent holder files suit within days of receiving notice of the paragraph iv certification.see id.j b iii f.if a patent infringement action is timely brought,the anda can be approved only upon the expiration of a period,unless this period is altered by the court or a decision of that court.see j b iii.as an incentive to the first generic maker to risk costly patent litigation by filing an anda with a paragraph iv certification,the amendments provide that the first to file a paragraph iv certification for a particular drug is eligible for a period of marketing protection,exclusivity from competition from subsequent generic drug manufacturers,beginning from the earlier of the first filer commercial marketing of the drug or a decision of a court holding the patent invalid or not infringed.see id.j b iv.

pharmachemie contends that the case is moot on appeal because it can no longer obtain the relief it sought in its complaint in light of the adverse final judgment on the validity of the patent.barr responds that the appeal is not moot because the district court decision stripping barr of its statutory right to generic exclusivity continues to harm barr.alternatively,pointing to teva pharmaceuticals,usa,fda,wl,at,barr contends that the issues on appeal are capable of repetition,yet evade review because there are only days in which to obtain judicial review of challenges to the statutory exclusivity period.
