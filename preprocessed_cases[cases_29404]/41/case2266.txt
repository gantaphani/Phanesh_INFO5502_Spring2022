allen lingenfelter appeals the district court judgment affirming an administrative law judge alj decision denying his applications for social security disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income under titles ii and xvi of the social security act ssa.lingenfelter argues that substantial evidence does not support the alj decision because the alj improperly rejected his testimony as not credible.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse the judgment of the district court with instructions to remand to the alj for the calculation and award of appropriate benefits 
background 
procedural history 
on august,lingenfelter filed applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income,alleging that he had been disabled and unable to work since november,due to severe foot and knee impairments.after his applications were denied initially and upon reconsideration,lingenfelter requested a hearing before an alj.at the january,hearing,lingenfelter was represented by counsel and testified on his own behalf.the alj issued a decision denying lingenfelter applications on march,finding that lingenfelter suffered from multiple severe impairments but was not disabled within the meaning of the ssa.the appeals council denied lingenfelter request for review and adopted the alj decision as the final decision of the commissioner on january,lingenfelter then filed a complaint for review with the district court,which issued an order and judgment adopting the report and recommendation of a magistrate judge and affirming the alj decision.lingenfelter timely appealed.
the parties do not dispute most of the relevant facts.born on may,lingenfelter was years old at the time of his hearing before the alj.he had a high school education and worked most of his adult life as a construction worker,warehouse worker,and automobile detailer.he first underwent surgery on his left knee in.he suffered a injury of the same knee on november,which has required multiple surgeries,including two knee arthroscopies in and.about three years later,in november,lingenfelter started to experience significant pain in his left foot as well,and by he was experiencing severe pain in both feet.
medical reports 
according to the medical reports in the administrative record,more than ten doctors,including two primary treating physicians,had examined or treated lingenfelter prior to the hearing.the doctors had diagnosed lingenfelter with,among other things,torn lateral and medial meniscae,significant advanced osteoarthritis,degenerative joint disease,syndrome,posterior tibial tendon rupture and tendinitis,and bilateral advanced arthrosis and planovalgus deformity.
after first injuring his left knee in,lingenfelter was examined by doctors tony deeths and johnson,who diagnosed osteoarthritis and cartilage damage.in february,orthopaedic surgeon marshall lewis performed arthroscopic surgery on lingenfelter knee,which revealed torn medial and lateral menisci with osteoarthritis of the left knee and chondromalacia.later in,following reports of continued swelling and locking of the left knee,dilibeno examined lingenfelter and found a large erosive hole in the lateral tibial plateau extending down through cartilage to bone over the weight bearing area.he also diagnosed degenerative joint disease and determined that lingenfelter would need a total knee replacement.on the basis of similar findings in a february examination,daniel ovadia concluded that lingenfelter could not return to his usual work and was precluded from any prolonged standing or walking.
in,lingenfelter started seeing the first of his two primary treating physicians,knee specialist james caillouette.from to,caillouette consistently reported that lingenfelter was in pain because of his knee and feet.following diagnostic arthroscopy,caillouette determined that lingenfelter knee had complete lateral joint collapse with in the lateral joint space and significant osteophyte formation.he concluded that lingenfelter needed a total knee replacement arthroplasty because of the severe pain.caillouette also found that both of lingenfelter feet had experienced significant atrophy,and prescribed him a wheelchair in to help alleviate the pain.in,caillouette reported that lingenfelter left foot had completely collapsed.he also determined that lingenfelter was fully disabled from work until he received appropriate treatment.
in,richard woods examined lingenfelter on behalf of the california workers compensation appeals board.lingenfelter reported to woods that he felt constant sharp pain in his knee and feet and that his knee stiffens up and becomes more painful after sitting for about ten minutes or holding the knee in one position for about ten minutes.lingenfelter also reported that,because of the pain,he was unable to perform any significant activities.woods agreed with caillouette that lingenfelter needed a total knee arthroplasty,as radiographs revealed advanced osteoarthritis and significant atrophy of the left thigh.he also diagnosed degenerative disorder,bilateral tibial tendinitis and rupture,and advanced arthrosis of bilateral mid feet with loss of plantar arch and collapse of the left mid foot.woods concluded that lingenfelter was limited to work,and even then would require the use of a cane to help alleviate pain.
in,roger sung examined lingenfelter on behalf of the california department of social services.sung reported that of the left knee show severe tricompartmental arthritis with significant loss of joint space both medially and laterally along with marked osteophyte formation.he also diagnosed significant left knee osteoarthritis and bilateral foot planovalgus deformity.he concluded that lingenfelter was limited in his ability to walk but could sit for a full day with appropriate breaks.two other state agency doctors reviewed lingenfelter medical records and made similar findings,concluding that he could stand walk at least two hours in an workday sit about six hours in an workday and had limited use of the left lower extremity and both feet.
also in,stuart green examined lingenfelter and reviewed his medical records and for the workers compensation appeals board.consistent with the medical record,green reported bilateral foot and gait deformities,absent or weak tibialis posterior function,and knee atrophy,swelling,and pain.he also agreed that lingenfelter would require knee surgery,either immediately or in the near future.contrary to the earlier reports,however,he concluded that lingenfelter lower extremity impairments were the result of syndrome,a late manifestation of poliomyelitis that affects middle age individuals.as green reported 
what surprised me as i went through the medical records in this case is that no practitioner seems to have focused attention on what seems to me a critical aspect of this applicant past history.allen lingenfelter,at the age of four,had severe poliomyelitis.he was in an iron lung for a while,and almost died.
in,lingenfelter began seeing his second primary treating physician,foot specialist alexander tischler.tischler diagnosed severe flatfoot deformity of both feet and arthritis of the tarsometatarsal joint,and determined that triple arthrodesis surgery was a medical necessity.he also reported that lingenfelter had severe knee and foot pain,which he stated he could no longer live with.tischler concluded that lingenfelter was totally disabled and is really unable to do any work that requires any sitting or standing.by july,tischler reported that lingenfelter was mostly in a wheelchair and that bilateral casts were the only treatment that helped to reduce his pain.
finally,in,after lingenfelter underwent the recommended triple arthrodesis surgery,ronald smith diagnosed status post hindfoot reconstruction with incomplete arthrodesis and severe pes planus with subtalar instability and rupture of the posterior tibial tendon.in his description of lingenfelter symptoms,smith reported that some pain and swelling were always present,that he elevated his feet for relief,and that he used a wheelchair and crutches as aids for walking.smith concluded that these symptoms are consistent with the examination findings,history,and radiograph,and that lingenfelter pain complaints were objectively reasonable.smith at times reported that lingenfelter was temporarily totally disabled,but at other times reported that he was able to do sedentary work.
lingenfelter testimony 
at his hearing before the alj in january,lingenfelter testified that he had experienced constant pain since,along with regular cramping,swelling,and fatigue.he described the pain in his left knee as moderate to severe but stated that it my feet that hurt so bad,as if somebody were sticking a knife in them,and putting electricity in them,these shocks i get,are just unbelievable.he further testified that,because of the pain and fatigue,he could only stand for minutes or sit for minutes at a time,and had to lie down at least three times a day for minutes.he also testified that he needed to keep his legs elevated every day,even while sitting,and that the pain affected his ability to sleep.
with regard to treatment,lingenfelter stated that he took vicodin three times a day for pain,as prescribed by tischler,and sought relief from severe pain by soaking his feet in buckets of ice or a bath tub filled with epsom salt and hot water.he testified that he almost always used the cane that caillouette prescribed in,but only sometimes used crutches because they hurt his arms,and was unable to use a wheelchair because his insurance refused to approve the prescription from caillouette.at the time of the hearing,lingenfelter was also wearing a cast that tischler prescribed for his right foot,but had not yet undergone the triple arthrodesis or total knee arthroplasty.he testified that he wanted to have the surgeries,which he hoped would alleviate his pain and swelling,but that his insurance company had not authorized them.
lingenfelter testified that pain severely limited his daily activities.he stated that he had difficulty showering,could not do yard work or a lot of driving,and usually had other people shop for him,since he was otherwise able to shop for only a few things at a time.likewise,he stated that he had trouble finishing tasks generally,because he could not sit or stand for long.he testified that he occasionally watched his daughter play sports,but that it was difficult for him because of his knee and feet.
finally,lingenfelter testified that he lived in a room that he rented at a friend house and had not worked since his injury in,except for a nine week period starting in february.he stated that at that time he took a job washing tour buses because he had no money,no income at all.he testified that he could not perform that work again and that he only did so then because he just did have any money and had to do something to live.he stated that he left the job after a week because a union job at a warehouse opened up.he was fired from that job after eight weeks,however,because he was too slow to do the work adequately.he also testified that when he returned home from work each day his feet were so swollen,and that he just could do it anymore because of the pain.
alj decision 
in denying lingenfelter applications,the alj applied the disability evaluation process set forth in.see lester chater,cir describing the process.because lingenfelter disability insurance lapsed on june,he had to establish that he was disabled for at least a period between the alleged onset date,november,and june,the relevant time period see reddick chater,cir to qualify for disability benefits,a claimant must show that a medically determinable physical or mental impairment prevents her from engaging in substantial gainful activity and that the impairment is expected to result in death or to last for a continuous period of at least twelve months.citing d a.
the alj found,and the parties do not dispute,that lingenfelter passed the hurdles set at steps one and two of the process,because he was not then engaging in substantial gainful activity and he suffered from a number of severe impairments,including degenerative joint disease of the left knee,status post multiple surgeries,and syndrome.the alj also found,however,that lingenfelter was not automatically presumed disabled at step three,because his condition did not meet or equal any of the impairments listed in,pt,subpt.p,app.the alj decision that lingenfelter was not disabled therefore turned on his assessment in between steps three and four of lingenfelter residual functional capacity rfc,and application of this rfc assessment at steps four and five.see before we go from step three to step four,we assess your residual functional capacity we use this residual functional capacity assessment at both step four and step five when we evaluate your claim at these steps.
in assessing lingenfelter rfc,the alj found that lingenfelter retained the capacity to lift pounds occasionally and pounds frequently and stand walk at least hours and sit hours in an workday,but was unable to perform repetitive squatting,kneeling,crawling,or crouching and requir ed the use of a cane for standing and walking and the option to stand every minutes for a period of minutes in order to regain circulation and relieve discomfort.although the alj recognized that lingenfelter testified to additional limitations that would establish a significantly lower rfc,he rejected this testimony as not totally credible.specifically,the alj found that lingenfelter subjective complaints were only credible to the extent that he has required a cane and some accommodation with regard to his complaints of cramping and poor circulation in his lower extremities.the alj provided two reasons for this adverse credibility finding the consensus of medical opinion in the record essentially supports a residual functional capacity for sedentary work and lingenfelter nine weeks of work in cast significant doubt upon his allegation of an inability to perform any work at all.
on the basis of this rfc assessment and the testimony of a vocational expert,the alj found at step four that lingenfelter was not capable of performing any of his past relevant work as a construction worker,warehouse worker,or automobile detailer.the alj therefore proceeded to step five,where he determined that lingenfelter was not disabled because he retained the capacity to perform other work that existed in sufficient numbers in the national economy.in making this determination,the alj posed to a vocational expert both a hypothetical question based on the rfc that he assigned to lingenfelter and hypothetical questions that included the additional limitations testified to by lingenfelter.in response,the vocational expert testified that a person with the rfc assigned by the alj could perform almost a full range of sedentary work,but that sufficient jobs did not exist even at the sedentary level for a person with the additional limitations testified to by lingenfelter.the expert testified that if an employee needed to lie down two or three times a day for up to minutes,as lingenfelter testified was necessary,that essentially would eliminate any of the positions described,and in fact any of the positions at the sedentary level.
ii.analysis 
we review de novo a district court judgment upholding the denial of social security benefits.reddick,at.we may set aside a denial of benefits only if it is not supported by substantial evidence or is based on legal error.robbins soc.sec,cir.substantial evidence means more than a mere scintilla,but less than a preponderance it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.if the evidence can reasonably support either affirming or reversing a decision,we may not substitute our judgment for that of the commissioner.id.however,we must consider the entire record as a whole,weighing both the evidence that supports and the evidence that detracts from the commissioner conclusion,reddick,at,and may not affirm simply by isolating a specific quantum of supporting evidence.hammock bowen,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
lingenfelter argues that substantial evidence does not support the alj decision because the alj improperly rejected his testimony as to the severity of his pain and symptoms.we agree.as we explain below,the alj failed to provide clear and convincing reasons for finding lingenfelter alleged pain and symptoms not credible,and therefore was required to include these limitations in his assessment of lingenfelter rfc.because the alj clearly did not do so,substantial evidence does not support the alj rfc assessment or determination that lingenfelter was not disabled.to the contrary,the vocational expert testimony that sufficient jobs did not exist for a person with the limitations testified to by lingenfelter required a finding at step five that lingenfelter was disabled during the relevant time period.consequently,further administrative proceedings are unnecessary,and lingenfelter is entitled to an award of appropriate benefits.
credibility 
to determine whether a claimant testimony regarding subjective pain or symptoms is credible,an alj must engage in a analysis.first,the alj must determine whether the claimant has presented objective medical evidence of an underlying impairment which could reasonably be expected to produce the pain or other symptoms alleged.bunnell sullivan,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted.the claimant,however,need not show that her impairment could reasonably be expected to cause the severity of the symptom she has alleged she need only show that it could reasonably have caused some degree of the symptom.smolen chater,cir.thus,the alj may not reject subjective symptom testimony simply because there is no showing that the impairment can reasonably produce the degree of symptom alleged.see also reddick,at t he commissioner may not discredit the claimant testimony as to the severity of symptoms merely because they are unsupported by objective medical evidence.
second,if the claimant meets this first test,and there is no evidence of malingering,the alj can reject the claimant testimony about the severity of her symptoms only by offering specific,clear and convincing reasons for doing so.smolen,at see also robbins,at u nless an alj makes a finding of malingering based on affirmative evidence thereof,he or she may only find an applicant not credible by making specific findings as to credibility and stating clear and convincing reasons for each.
here,the commissioner concedes that lingenfelter met the requirement at step one,by providing evidence of underlying impairments that could reasonably be expected to produce some degree of the pain and symptoms alleged.also,at step two,the alj found that there was no evidence of malingering.the alj nonetheless found,however,that lingenfelter testimony was credible only to the extent that he testified that he needed a cane and some accommodation for his cramping and poor circulation.as a result,the alj excluded from his rfc determination lingenfelter testimony that he could only stand or sit for about minutes at a time,had to lie down for minutes at least three times a day,and needed to keep his legs elevated every day,because of his constant severe pain.
we must therefore determine whether the alj provided clear and convincing reasons for this adverse credibility finding.as noted,the alj provided two reasons for the finding.first,the alj determined that lingenfelter alleged symptoms,which would preclude even sedentary work,were contrary to a consensus of the medical opinion in the record that he retained the capacity for such work.similarly,the alj determined that lingenfelter ability to work for nine weeks in was inconsistent with the alleged severity of his symptoms.
we conclude that these reasons do not constitute clear and convincing reasons for rejecting lingenfelter subjective pain and symptom testimony.the alj first reason provides no support for the credibility finding,because it is clear from the record that there was not in fact a consensus of medical opinion that lingenfelter,contrary to his alleged pain and limitations,retained the capacity to perform sedentary work.the alj second reason,on the other hand,was factually accurate,as lingenfelter did testify that he worked for a brief period of time in.this reason in and of itself,however,is not a sufficient basis for the alj adverse credibility finding.that lingenfelter,after the relevant time period during which he claimed to be disabled and facing difficult economic circumstances,tried to work for nine weeks and,because of his impairments,failed,is not a clear and convincing reason for concluding that his symptoms could not have precluded him from maintaining employment during the relevant time period.
medical opinion 
contrary to the alj determination,there was not a consensus of medical opinion that lingenfelter retained the capacity to perform sedentary work,and therefore this reason does not support the alj credibility finding.in finding a consensus,the alj cited to the three state agency physicians,the two doctors who examined lingenfelter for the california workers compensation appeals board,and ovadia,who each made findings consistent with a capacity for sedentary work without explanation,however,the alj completely ignored the medical opinions of lingenfelter two primary treating physicians,who expressly corroborated his alleged pain and limitations and found him incapable of any work.
as discussed in detail above,knee specialist caillouette treated lingenfelter for over three years.during this time,caillouette reported that lingenfelter had severe pain in his left knee and feet due to his numerous serious physical impairments,and prescribed him vicodin,a cane,and a wheelchair for the pain.caillouette expressly concluded that lingenfelter was fully disabled from work until he received appropriate treatment total knee replacement surgery similarly,foot specialist tischler treated lingenfelter for about two years and determined that he was totally disabled and really unable to do any work that requires any sitting or standing.tischler also reported that lingenfelter was mostly in a wheelchair by july,and would be able to return to sedentary work only if his total knee replacement and triple arthrodesis surgeries were successful.
in light of these medical opinions,there was clearly no consensus that lingenfelter could perform sedentary work.rather,doctors caillouette and only reporting physicians who examined lingenfelter on multiple occasions and treated his impairments expressly reached the opposite conclusion,that lingenfelter could not perform any work.consequently,the alj first reason for finding lingenfelter testimony not credible is unfounded and does not provide any support for the adverse credibility finding 
to the contrary,the alj second reason for finding lingenfelter testimony not credible was factually accurate,because lingenfelter testified that he worked for a brief period of time in.we conclude,however,that this alone is not a clear and convincing reason for rejecting lingenfelter subjective pain and symptom testimony.
it does not follow from the fact that a claimant tried to work for a short period of time and,because of his impairments,failed,that he did not then experience pain and limitations severe enough to preclude him from maintaining substantial gainful employment.indeed,we have suggested that similar evidence that a claimant tried to work and failed actually supported his allegations of disabling pain.see fair bowen,cir affirming the alj finding that the claimant was not credible,but noting that the alj could easily have relied on other evidence in the record to reach the opposite conclusion.fair attempted to work in,but testified that his pain forced him to stop.see also rosario sullivan,holding that substantial evidence did not support the alj decision that claimant was not disabled,in part because claimant unsuccessful work attempt weighed in favor of a disability finding reddick,at several courts,including this one,have recognized that disability claimants should not be penalized for attempting to lead normal lives in the face of their limitations.
this reason is especially unconvincing where,as the alj recognized here,the individual attempted to work only because of extreme economic necessity.under these circumstances,it is at least as likely that the claimant tried to work in spite of his symptoms,not because they were less severe than alleged.as lingenfelter testified,although he was able to work for a brief period of time,he attempted to do so because of his dire economic situation caused by almost six years of unemployment and,even then,his impairments were severe enough that they prevented him from maintaining his employment.
moreover,lingenfelter failed work attempt did not even take place during the relevant time period.lingenfelter had to prove that he was disabled for at least a period between november,and june.his work attempt,however,as the alj observed,started in february,years after his injury and surgeries,thus,presumably,only after years of healing.thus,here,the work attempt provides even less support for rejecting lingenfelter testimony that his subjective symptoms precluded him working during the relevant time period.
in so concluding,we also find significant that the social security administration permits recipients of disability benefits to work on a trial basis without the trial work period adversely affecting their disability status.specifically,when a recipient works for less than nine months,the administration does not consider the trial work period as evidence that the individual is no longer disabled.see see also moore comm r of the soc.sec,cir t he ssa regulations provide for a trial work period in which a claimant may test your ability to work and still be considered disabled.quoting.by analogy,if working for almost nine months is not evidence that a disability benefit recipient is no longer disabled,then a nine week unsuccessful work attempt is surely not a clear and convincing reason for finding that a claimant is not credible regarding the severity of his impairments.
at least one of our sister circuits has also found the administration treatment of trial work periods significant in reviewing the denial of disability benefits.in parish califano,the claimant had taken a job within the time period during which she needed to establish that she was disabled,but was asked to resign because she could not work the hours,cir.the alj relied heavily on th is fact as substantial evidence that the claimant was not precluded from engaging in any substantial gainful activity during the relevant time period.id.at.the sixth circuit,however,looked for guidance in s ervices rendered during the trial work period are deemed not to have been rendered for the purpose of determining whether the individual disability ceased during such a period of trial work.it would appear reasonable to apply the same principle to an attempt to work before filing an application for benefits.id.at.as the sixth circuit therefore concluded,the a pproximately weeks of work over more than eight years during which claimant has been suffering from her impairment can be characterized only as sporadic,not as substantial gainful activity,which implies employment with some degree of regularity.id.at.
in sum,that lingenfelter tried to work for nine weeks in and failed is not a clear and convincing reason for the alj finding that lingenfelter was not credible when he testified about the pain and symptoms that precluded him from engaging in substantial gainful employment during the relevant time period.
other factors 
finally,we consider the alj proffered reasons in light of the other factors that we have found relevant in reviewing an alj credibility findings,and which the social security administration also requires that aljs consider in assessing credibility.these additional factors include whether the claimant engages in daily activities inconsistent with the alleged symptoms whether the claimant takes medication or undergoes other treatment for the symptoms whether the claimant fails to follow,without adequate explanation,a prescribed course of treatment and whether the alleged symptoms are consistent with the medical evidence see rollins,at bunnell,at fair,at see also at cum.ed,available at,july,requiring aljs to consider all of the evidence in the case record in assessing a claimant subjective pain and symptom testimony,including the individual daily activities the location,duration,frequency,and intensity of the pain or symptoms f actors that precipitate and aggravate the symptoms the type,dosage,effectiveness,and side effects of any medications any other treatment or measures used for relief functional restrictions and any other relevant factors.
all of these factors weigh in favor of lingenfelter.lingenfelter testified that he engaged in almost no recreational activities or hobbies and only limited household activities.he testified that he took prescription pain medicine twice a day,and the medical record established that he had undergone extensive additional treatment for his pain and symptoms,including physical therapy and multiple surgeries.also,although lingenfelter had not yet undergone the triple arthrodesis or total knee replacement surgeries at the time of the hearing,he underwent the triple arthrodesis surgery shortly after the hearing.further,doctors caillouette and tischler confirmed in their reports that lingenfelter insurance refused to authorize the recommended surgeries at least from to.finally,the only doctors who expressly assessed lingenfelter reported symptoms concluded that they were reasonable in light of the objective medical evidence.
thus,considering lingenfelter brief,unsuccessful work attempt in light of the other factors relevant to his credibility,reinforces our conclusion that the work attempt alone is not a clear and convincing reason for the alj finding that lingenfelter testimony about his pain and physical limitations was not credible.
rfc assessment and determination 
because the alj did not provide clear and convincing reasons for excluding lingenfelter pain and symptoms from his assessment of lingenfelter rfc,substantial evidence does not support the assessment.see robbins,at in determining a claimant rfc,c areful consideration must be given to any evidence about symptoms because subjective descriptions may indicate more severe limitations or restrictions than can be shown by medical evidence alone.quoting at cum.ed,available at,july.nor does substantial evidence support the alj determination,since it was based on this erroneous rfc assessment.see gallant,at because the alj had no clear or convincing reasons for rejecting claimant allegations of persistent disabling pain,claimant pain should have formed a part of the alj question to the expert.see also id.a hypothetical question should set out all of the claimant impairments.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.
in addition,we will not remand for further proceedings where,taking the claimant testimony as true,the alj would clearly be required to award benefits 
in cases where there are no outstanding issues that must be resolved before a proper disability determination can be made,and where it is clear from the administrative record that the alj would be required to award benefits if the claimant testimony were credited,we will not remand solely to allow the alj to make specific findings regarding that testimony.rather,we will take that testimony to be established as true.
varney sec y of health human,cir.here,as in varney,the alj posed to the vocational expert not only a hypothetical question based on the alj rfc assessment,but also hypothetical questions that incorporated the pain and physical limitations testified to by lingenfelter.although the alj later decided that these limitations were not credible,the vocational expert testimony establishes that taking lingenfelter testimony as true,he was disabled.dispositively,the vocational expert testified that,if an employee needed to lie down two or three times each day for up to minutes,as lingenfelter testified was necessary,this essentially would eliminate any of the positions described,and in fact any of the positions at the sedentary level.gallant,at a man who can not walk,stand or sit for over one hour without pain does not have the capacity to do most jobs available in the national economy.
in sum,we conclude that the alj did not provide clear and convincing reasons for his adverse credibility determination.there was no consensus of medical opinion contrary to lingenfelter testimony,and his failed work attempt alone is not a clear and convincing reason for rejecting his testimony,especially in light of the record as a whole.further,because the vocational expert testified that lingenfelter pain and physical limitations would eliminate any potential employment,further proceedings are unnecessary,and we reverse the judgment of the district court with instructions to remand to the alj for the calculation and award of benefits 
reversed and remanded.
the opinion of the court fails to properly analyze the alj assessment of lingenfelter credibility.when evaluating the credibility of a claimant testimony,the alj has discretion to resolve conflicts between the opinions of examining and treating physicians.the alj may be justified in discounting the value of caillouette statements as to lingenfelter ability to work.additionally,when the treating physicians statements are ambiguous,we must permit the alj to interpret the statements,rather than adopting,de novo,our own interpretation.
i would reverse the judgment of the district court on the narrow ground that the alj and the appeals council failed to set forth specific,legitimate reasons for disregarding the treating physicians medical opinions.rather than taking lingenfelter testimony as true and remanding only for an award of benefits,we should remand to the agency to enter specific findings regarding the treating physicians medical opinions and to develop a revised credibility determination based on those findings.
when evaluating the medical opinions of treating and examining physicians,the alj has discretion to weigh the value of each of the various reports,to resolve conflicts in the reports,and to determine which reports to credit and which to reject.although the opinions of treating physicians are given deference,the alj may reject these opinions if,among other reasons,they are contradicted by the opinion of a physician,and the alj makes findings setting forth specific,legitimate reasons for doing so that are based on substantial evidence in the record.orn astrue,cir thomas barnhart,cir.when an examining physician provides independent clinical findings that differ from the findings of the treating physician,such findings are themselves substantial evidence.orn,thomas,at andrews shalala,cir.under these circumstances,it is then solely the province of the alj to resolve the conflict and to decide which medical opinions to credit.andrews,at see also morgan comm.of soc.sec,cir where medical reports are inconclusive,questions of credibility and resolution of conflicts in the testimony are functions solely of the commissioner.citing sample schweiker,cir.additional factors relevant to evaluating any medical opinion include the amount of relevant evidence that supports the opinion,the quality of the explanation provided in the opinion,and the consistency of the medical opinion with the record as a whole.orn.
we defer to an alj rational interpretation of conflicting evidence even in the context of credibility determinations,where the more rigorous clear and convincing reasons standard applies to the broader reasons that the alj is required to provide for disbelieving a claimant subjective testimony see burch barnhart,cir stating,in a case where the alj interpreted evidence in the context of making a credibility determination,w e must uphold the alj decision where the evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation johnson shalala,cir we will not reverse credibility determinations of an alj based on contradictory or ambiguous evidence.
in this case the medical evidence is contradictory,but weighs in favor of lingenfelter ability to perform sedentary work.on the one hand,a series of examining physicians found at various times throughout the insured period,based on thorough and independent clinical findings,that lingenfelter was capable of performing sedentary work on the other hand,the only medical evidence stating that lingenfelter is fully disabled from all types of work comes from lingenfelter two treating physicians,caillouette and tischler.these physicians opinions are not decisive,and caillouette opinion is ambiguous and inadequately supported by clinical findings,as discussed below.given the overall weight of the evidence,the alj would be within his discretion to credit the medical opinions of the four examining physicians while discrediting or rejecting the conclusions of caillouette and tischler.
lingenfelter first treating physician,caillouette,stated in february that lingenfelter was fully disabled from work.the opinion of the court interprets this to mean fully disabled from all types of work,rather than fully disabled from his work as a heavy laborer.the exact meaning of caillouette statement is ambiguous,however,and the statement may not be inconsistent with the examining physicians opinions stating that lingenfelter was capable of sedentary work.as such,it is within the discretion of the alj to interpret the statement and resolve the ambiguity.
on september,caillouette noted that lingenfelter essentially works as a heavy laborer,and concluded that he had a complete loss of work capacity.lingenfelter work as a heavy laborer included carrying up to pounds,and carrying to pounds on a relatively frequent basis.caillouette stated that same day that lingenfelter was temporarily disabled from heavy work as a laborer,and i do not anticipate his disability status changing until he has undergone further surgery.on november,caillouette wrote that lingenfelter will either need an osteotomy of the leg or total knee arthoplasty in the near future in order to restore him to his ability to work.both these procedures require surgery.given that this statement comes only two months after the report stating that lingenfelter will be disabled from heavy work as a laborer until he has surgery,it would be reasonable to conclude that caillouette reference to lingenfelter ability to work here means his ability to work as a heavy laborer.
on january,caillouette stated that lingenfelter was still temporarily disabled from work.the word still connotes a continuation of a certain level of disability,rather than an increase in a patient level of disability.there is nothing in the record indicating any determination by caillouette between november and january that lingenfelter was disabled from all work,and it would be unusual for a physician to make such a significant change in a patient disability assessment without any written record of the change,and without any clinical findings to support the change.it would be reasonable to infer that still temporarily disabled from work refers back to caillouette statements of disability,the only other references in the record of caillouette assessment of lingenfelter ability to work.this inference is supported by the fact that caillouette previously used the general term ability to work to likely mean ability to work as a heavy laborer.given this context,the february statement fully disabled from work coming less than a month after the january statement is,at best,ambiguous.it could reasonably be read as meaning fully disabled from work as a heavy laborer or fully disabled from all work.
the ambiguity in caillouette february statement requires us to remand the case to the agency for an appropriate interpretation of the statement.if the interpretation of caillouette statement would affect the alj appraisal of lingenfelter credibility,we should allow the alj to further develop the record.see tonapetyan halter,cir smolen chater,cir.if the alj makes the same credibility finding regardless of the interpretation of caillouette ambiguous statement,then additional development of the record would be unnecessary.in either case,we must give deference to the alj interpretation of the ambiguous evidence,even in the context of credibility determinations,see burch barnhart,cir w e must uphold the alj decision where the evidence is susceptible to more than one
