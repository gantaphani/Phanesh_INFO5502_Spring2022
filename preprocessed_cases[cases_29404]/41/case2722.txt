this is a case about a failed transaction for the sale of a cyclotron,a device used to create radioactive pharmaceuticals.appellant cox nuclear pharmacy,cox brought claims against appellee cti,cti for breach of contract and fraud,and cti responded with a counterclaim against cox for breach of contract.cox appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of cti on all of cox counts and on cti counterclaim,as well as the district court denial of a motion for relief from judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm on all grounds.
background 
cox is an alabama corporation,based in mobile,that provides radioactive pharmaceuticals to hospitals and clinics in the mobile area,southern mississippi,and the panhandle of florida the market.cti is a tennessee corporation that manufactures cyclotrons for use in positron emission tomography pet,and provides services related thereto.pharmaceuticals,is also a tennessee corporation,and is a wholly owned subsidiary of cti.produces radioactive pharmaceuticals using cti cyclotrons.
a pet scan is a medical diagnostic procedure in which radioactive isotopes are introduced into the body,and an imaging device,or scanner,is used to focus on those isotopes.the substance that is introduced into the body during a pet scan is known as fluorodeoxyglucose fdg.a cyclotron is necessary to produce fdg,which has a of under two hours,and must therefore be consumed quickly after it is produced.
in,cox began selling fdg in the market.because no nuclear pharmacy was operating a cyclotron in the market at that time,cox had to fly in doses of fdg from elsewhere,which it purchased from various companies,including.at some point in,cox began to consider acquiring a cyclotron in order to produce fdg without the need to obtain it from outside the market.cox contacted cti to discuss potentially purchasing a cyclotron,and cti provided cox with a price quote for a cyclotron,a document projecting potential expenses and revenues associated with operating a cyclotron,and a document comparing the cti cyclotron with a competing model sold by general electric corporation ge.steven belcher,a representative of cox,testified that during the time cox was investigating the purchase of a cti cyclotron,cox also considered entering into an affiliation agreement with,which,among other things,would have given cox access to new pharmaceutical products developed by.belcher testified that cox rejected the agreement in early,after being assured by ned odeh,a representative of cti,that cox would receive all the benefits of the affiliation agreement if cox purchased a cti cyclotron.
in november,as cox continued to consider purchasing a cti cyclotron,cox sole shareholder,william cox,arranged a meeting at a cracker barrel restaurant in macon,georgia that included himself,belcher,other cox employees,odeh of cti,and steve putnal,the operator of a cti cyclotron in macon.william cox testified that he arranged the meeting in macon because he wanted to see steve putnal operation,talk to his personnel,and see a cti cyclotron in use,exh.at.at the meeting,william cox indicated that he was ready to purchase a cyclotron from cti,but he wanted from cti an agreement or understanding that its subsidiary,would not compete with cox in the market.though he was aware that was a wholly owned subsidiary of cti,he also asked for assurances that his company purchase of a cyclotron from cti would be kept secret from.cox testified that,in response to his request for confidentiality,odeh stated,i f we not going to tell anything about you ordering a cyclotron,they never know.odeh said,now,they may find out in the marketplace,but they never know.id.at.he also testified that odeh promised cti would assign cox order a secret number,so that nobody would ever know.id.at.
with respect to cox request for exclusivity in the market,he testified that odeh indicated that he could guarantee there would be competition.he could just guarantee that would be in there.id.at.william cox also asked for a guarantee that would not compete with cox within a certain distance of cox cyclotron.he testified 
i wanted i think a hundred and fifty or two hundred mile radius,and odeh said he did think he could get that much,maybe it would be a mile radius,but he was sure.that was a very minimum discussion.i just remember trying to get felt like a drive is what i wanted.
id.at.at the time of this meeting,cox was aware that was planning to install a cyclotron in covington,louisiana.
following the meeting in macon,on december,odeh sent a letter to william cox that stated,in pertinent part 
i have noted your access to cti newly developed chemistry modules and targets however,i was unable to get a commitment on the mile radius you requested.i was told that there are legal ramifications to providing exclusivity.
rest assured that there are no plans,to my knowledge,for petnet to move into this territory in the future.please do not hesitate to check the petnet website for current and future sites.
exh.cox testified that he received this letter on or about december,exh.at.the following day,december,william cox executed a purchase agreement for a cti cyclotron.
several days after cox executed the purchase agreement for a cti cyclotron,on december or,belcher received a telephone call from rick hiatt,an employee of.belcher testified that hiatt asked him if it was true that cox was planning to install a cyclotron in mobile,and proceeded to warn belcher what a mistake it was for cox to proceed with those plans,the implication being that cox would be unable to survive competition from,exh.at.during the course of the conversation with hiatt,belcher confirmed that cox had purchased a cyclotron from cti,and planned to install it in mobile.
subsequent to belcher conversation with hiatt,cox learned that had been soliciting a cox customer,the university of southern alabama usa,and quoting significantly lower prices per dose of fdg than cox had quoted.belcher testified that also told usa that cox was unable to produce certain types of isotopes that could produce.belcher asked odeh to send a letter to usa on cti letterhead refuting those statements,but odeh told belcher he could not interfere in attempt to win the account.moreover,also offered a lower price per dose to a cox customer located in panama city,florida.upon learning of this competition from,belcher was convinced that cox needed to make a change,exh.at.william cox was similarly taken aback,and testified that if he had known he would face competition from,he would not have purchased a cyclotron from,exh.at.
belcher further testified that around the same time cox was learning about the competition from,cti informed cox that there would be a delay with some of the equipment cox had agreed to purchase.specifically,cti told cox that the newest,latest,greatest boxes,quadrx chemistry boxes,would not be immediately available,and offered to provide cox with the current model,cpcu chemistry boxes,and replace them with the newer models once they became available,exh.at.though cox l oved the equipment it had agreed to purchase from cti,belcher testified that the combination of unexpected competition from,along with the news that the quadrx chemistry boxes would not be immediately available,did not feel right.id.subsequent to learning about the competition from and the delay in the availability of the quadrx chemistry boxes,cox informed cti that it did not intend to go forward with its cyclotron purchase,and entered into an agreement to purchase a cyclotron from ge.
on may,cox filed a complaint against cti,and hiatt,alleging,inter alia,breach of contract and fraud,in connection with a putative agreement between cox and cti under which would not compete in cox geographic territory,and cti would not disclose to that cox planned to purchase a cyclotron cti responded with a counterclaim against cox for breach of the cyclotron purchase agreement entered into between cox and cti.cti moved for,and the district court granted,summary judgment in cti favor as to all of cox claims.the district court then ordered the parties to brief the question of whether the summary judgment order also determined cox liability on cti counterclaim.after receiving the parties briefs,the court sua sponte granted summary judgment as to liability in favor of cti on its counterclaim,and ordered a trial as to damages.
after both grants of summary judgment,and before the damages trial,cti produced certain documents the order file related to cox order of a cyclotron from cti.the order file contained some documents that had not previously been produced in the course of discovery.shortly after receiving the order file,cox filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b requesting relief from both entries of summary judgment,on the grounds that the file constituted new evidence that could not have been discovered earlier,and that cti failure to produce the file earlier amounted to fraud or misconduct.the district court denied the motion,finding that the requirements of rule b were not satisfied.cox now appeals from the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of cti on cox claims,the district court sua sponte grant of summary judgment on cti counterclaim,and the district court denial of cox motion for relief from judgment.
ii.discussion 
summary judgment on cox claims 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same familiar standards as the district court.patrick floyd med,cir citation omitted.summary judgment is appropriate if the record shows no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.gitlitz compagnie nationale air france,cir per curiam citation omitted.
contract claim 
count one of cox complaint alleged breach of an oral agreement by cti and not to compete with cox in the market.the district court granted summary judgment,finding that the agreement,as alleged by cox,was void under alabama statute of frauds.that statute states,in pertinent part 
in the following cases,every agreement is void unless such agreement or some note or memorandum thereof expressing the consideration is in writing and subscribed by the party to be charged therewith or some other person by him thereunto lawfully authorized in writing 
every agreement which,by its terms,is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof 
the district court further found that,based on the record,no genuine issue of material fact remained as to the alleged agreement validity.after a thorough review of the record,we agree.
cox alleged that cti agreed that,if cox purchased a cyclotron from cti,cti would keep cox purchase of a cyclotron secret from its wholly owned subsidiary,and that would not compete with cox in the market.cox was unable to produce a written document or memorandum memorializing the alleged contract,but contended that cti representative orally entered into the agreement as the district court observed,belcher deposition testimony made clear that the alleged noncompetition agreement was to continue for more than one year.specifically,the court relied on belcher affirmative response when asked whether he made the assumption or intention that this relationship with a noncompete in this territory would extend well beyond one year,and his statement that he thought it was a long term deal,exh.at.the court also relied on cox deposition testimony,in which he stated that he certainly expected eight to ten years of noncompetition,exh.at.
on appeal,cox does not identify any evidence in the record that creates a genuine issue of material fact for trial.because the record demonstrates that the agreement was not memorialized in a writing,and was not intended to be performed within a year,the contract is void under alabama statute of frauds.accordingly,the district court properly granted summary judgment as to cox claim for breach of contract.
fraud claims 
counts two,three,four,five,and eight 
the district court also granted summary judgment in favor of cti on cox fraud claims.counts two,three,four,five,and eight of cox complaint alleged fraud in connection with the alleged oral contract not to compete.specifically,cox alleged that cti and committed fraud in that they promised that.would not compete with cox nuclear and that cti would not divulge the purchase of the cyclotron by cox nuclear to,but that.did not intend to keep those promises.at.the district court held that those fraud claims were based on promises that were part of the alleged oral agreement not to compete,which was invalid under the statute of frauds,and therefore the fraud claims failed as a matter of law.we agree.
in holman childersburg bancorporation,so d,the alabama supreme court held 
w here,as here,an element of a tort claim turns on the existence of an alleged agreement that can not,consistent with the statute of frauds,be proved to support a claim,the statute of frauds also bars proof of that agreement to support the tort claim.
though holman did not address a narrow exception to the rule for claims of promissory fraud,see id.at,the alabama supreme court eliminated that exception in bruce cole,so d.bruce applied the holding in holman to promissory fraud claims,stating,an oral promise that is void by operation of the statute of frauds will not support an action against the promisor for promissory fraud.id.
the claims set forth in counts two,three,four,five,and eight of cox complaint rely on the alleged oral agreement not to compete.as discussed above,the purported agreement not to compete is an oral promise that is void by operation of the statute of frauds,see,and cox has identified nothing in the record that creates a genuine issue of material fact as to the validity of that agreement.because under alabama law a tort claim may not turn on a promise that is part of a contract voided by the statute of frauds,the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of cti as to counts two,three,four,five,and eight.
cox argues that holman and bruce do not apply,because the fraud claims in counts two,three,four,five,and eight were not based on promises not to compete in the future,but rather on fraudulent statements that had no current plans,at the time the purported agreement was entered into,to compete in the market.this argument is without support.cox identifies no evidence of any communications regarding plans that took place contemporaneously with the execution of the purchase agreement.moreover,the only communication cox identifies regarding plans that occurred close in time to the execution of the purchase agreement was the december letter from odeh to william cox.for the reasons addressed in more detail subsequently,however,that letter can not support a fraud claim.
counts nine,ten,and eleven 
counts nine,ten,and eleven of cox complaint are based on odeh december letter to william cox,in which he stated,there are no plans,to my knowledge,for petnet to move into this territory in the future,exh.cox contends that this statement amounted to fraud because at the time of the representations there were in fact plans by cti and petnet to market and sell fdg into cox nuclear market.at.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of cti.the court observed that odeh did not affirmatively represent that had no plans to compete with cox,but rather made only the limited representation that to his knowledge had no such plans.because cox did not allege that odeh had personal knowledge of alleged plans,the court found that counts nine through eleven did not state claims for fraud.
though cox conceded at oral argument that odeh letter was honest as far as what odeh knew,cox argues that did have plans to compete in the market,and that odeh lack of personal knowledge is irrelevant.for support,cox cites several alabama cases in which an agent made an incorrect representation on behalf of a principal corporation.see birmingham news horn,so d,bolton ford of mobile,little,so d.because we agree with the district court that odeh did not represent that had no plans to compete in the market,but rather stated only that he did not know of any such plans,we find cox reliance on these cases misplaced.yet even if we were to construe odeh december letter as a rep
