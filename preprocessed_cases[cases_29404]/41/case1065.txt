almon dale allen applied for and was denied social security benefits for the period ending september.while attempting to reopen this initial case,allen filed a new benefits application and the social security administration granted allen benefits beginning september.allen now appeals the denial of his first application,claiming that the initial administrative law judge violated agency procedural regulations by failing to articulate good reasons for discounting the opinion of his treating physician.alternatively,allen argues that the subsequent favorable determination serves as new,material evidence in the initial decision requiring a remand to the agency.because the alj properly followed the social security administration regulations,and because the subsequent favorable decision,on its own,is not new and material evidence,we affirm the district court decision upholding the commissioner denial of allen initial benefits request.
initial decision denying benefits 
allen applied for disability insurance benefits on december,claiming that he became disabled on january,due to degenerative disc disease,neck,back,and shoulder pain,severe headaches,and leg weakness.the agency denied allen claim initially and on rehearing,and allen requested and was granted a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.on september,the alj issued a decision finding allen not disabled.
in his decision,the alj applied the analysis required by a to determine if allen was disabled.as part of the evidence presented,the alj reviewed a letter from mccord,a physician who began treating allen in december.mccord letter responded to the following series of questions posed by allen attorney in an earlier questionnaire 
although allen did not begin treatment with you until december,you are aware that his cervical and lumber spine problems are of longstanding duration,and he previously sought treatment with other physicians,including miranda gaw,for his complaints of severe pain in the cervical,lower thoracic and lumbar spine.i have included the progress notes and mri scan results from this physician,and upon your review of those records,would you be able to state that it is reasonable to conclude that at all times since december,allen have essentially remained unchanged 
with his diagnosed cervical and lumbar spine conditions dating to at least december,do you believe it reasonable that,as allen has stated,he would have good and bad days with regard to symptoms,such that on good days,he can stand maybe an hour or two but that on bad days,he has to get off his feet after only minutes or less 
with regard to the issue of walking,allen states that on good days,he might be able to walk for up to a mile at a time,but that on bad days,he is unable to walk much more than one block.again,in light of his diagnosed spine conditions,is it your opinion that such limitations are credible and reasonable 
allen has testified when he is having a bad day with his neck and back,estimated to occur at least one or two days per week,he requires recumbent rest to deal with his pain and would not be able to be up on his feet for a total of more than four hours in an hour period.based upon the results of your examinations and imaging study findings does he have a spinal condition which is reasonably capable of causing these symptoms as he describes them 
ar at.mccord simply answered yes to all of these questions.the alj did not give much weight to mccord letter,stating 
these affirmative answers were not helpful to the undersigned.mccord merely affirmed that it might be reasonable to conclude the claimant symptoms had remained unchanged since december of,an opinion the undersigned found to be speculative since mccord had not seen the claimant for the first time until some two years later,on december.mccord was also asked to opine whether the claimant complaints or descriptions of his abilities and symptoms are credible.the affirmative response from mccord is of no help to the undersigned since the issue of credibility is reserved to the commissioner.
after reviewing all of the evidence and conducting the required analysis,the alj concluded that the claimant has the residual functional capacity to lift and carry twenty pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently.the claimant can stand or walk for six hours per workday and can sit for six hours per workday with normal breaks.ar at.t he claimant has been capable of making a successful adjustment to other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy.a finding of not disabled is therefore appropriate.ar at.
allen requested a review of the alj decision.on december,the appeals council denied allen request and the alj decision became the final decision of the commissioner.on january,allen submitted a request to reopen his case to the appeals council and attached records of neck surgery he underwent on april and.the appeals council referred the request to reopen to the alj who made the initial decision and extended allen time to file a civil action in district court on march,allen filed a complaint in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky seeking review of the benefits denial.on april,the alj denied allen request to reopen the case based on the newly submitted surgical records.
in his letter denying allen request to reopen the case,the alj stated 
the mere occurrence of surgery does not provide a scintilla of evidence of any negative change in the claimant condition.the surgery could have improved his condition.the claimant and his attorney have failed to prove any change in his condition which would warrant a change in any finding pertinent to any matter at issue or in the ultimate decision.therefore,the presented evidence is not both new and material and does not satisfy the regulatory standard for reopening.
subsequent decision granting benefits 
while the initial alj decision denying benefits was pending before the appeals council,allen again applied for disability benefits.allen received a notice of award letter dated february,stating that he was found to be disabled starting september,the day after the alj initial decision the award letter did not state the reasons for this disability determination.
district court proceedings 
allen motion for summary judgment in the district court seeking remand to the commissioner raised three issues 
a.in view of the subsequent favorable determination,effective the day after judge schum decision,a sentence remand under g is appropriate.
b.did the administrative law judge commit legal error by failing to provide good reasons for disregarding the treating spine specialist verification of allen limitations 
c.as a matter of affording the social security claimant due process,is the commissioner required to follow his own rules and base his determination on a correct understanding of the facts when considering a request to reopen 
on october,the magistrate judge assigned to this case filed a report and recommendation rejecting all of allen contentions and upholding the agency denial of benefits.the magistrate judge rejected allen request for remand under sentence six of g because a subsequent favorable decision,on its own,does not constitute new and material evidence under g,and the new determination was likely based on allen new age category the surgical records are not material evidence for the reasons stated in the alj april,letter denying allen request to reopen the case and the raw medical data contained in the surgical records was cumulative of probative evidence already before the alj,and therefore not material.
the magistrate judge also rejected allen second contention,finding that the alj provided good reasons for disregarding mccord questionnaire responses.the magistrate judge found that the alj rejection of mccord credibility determination was appropriate under social security regulations and sixth circuit precedent.
finally,the magistrate judge determined that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to review allen final claim.the magistrate judge interpreted this contention as a request for a judicial remand for the purpose of requiring the commissioner to follow his own standards and rules pertaining to reopening of prior denial decisions.the magistrate judge concluded that allen failed to show that this claim falls under one of the limited situations where a district court has the authority to review final decisions of the commissioner.
on january,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation upholding the decision of the commissioner.allen appeals.
on appeal,allen raises arguments based on the first and second contentions in his district court motion.allen claims that the initial alj violated agency regulations by failing to articulate good reasons for discounting mccord questionnaire responses,and that the subsequent favorable determination serves as new,material evidence requiring a remand to the agency under sentence six of g.the district court,however,properly found that remand is not appropriate under either of allen claims.
the alj fully satisfied agency procedural requirements by providing good reasons for discounting mccord questionnaire responses,and therefore remand is not required for failure to do so.we have remanded cases to the agency when the agency fails to follow its own regulations by not stating good reasons for giving diminished or no weight to a treating physician opinion.see,wilson comm r of soc,cir bowen comm r of soc,cir.the alj in this case accepted some of mccord opinions,rejected others as speculative,and gave others no weight because they dealt with decisions reserved exclusively to the commissioner.the alj provided good reasons to support each of these conclusions.
social security regulations require the agency to provide good reasons for the weight given to a treating physician opinion,such as mccord four questionnaire responses.d states that w e will always give good reasons in our notice of determination or decision for the weight we give your treating source opinion.the alj provided a good reason for discounting mccord response to allen first question regarding the persistence of allen condition 
mccord merely affirmed that it might be reasonable to conclude the claimant symptoms had remained unchanged since december of,an opinion the undersigned found to be speculative since mccord had not seen the claimant for the first time until some two years later,on december.
while this stated reason may be brief,it reaches several of the factors that an alj must consider when determining what weight to give a opinion by a treating source,including the length of the treatment relationship and the frequency of examination,d i the nature and extent of the treatment relationship,d ii and the supportability of the opinion,d.
the magistrate judge properly noted that mccord final three responses presented the doctor opinion on two distinct issues whether allen spinal condition could reasonably cause the symptoms and limitations described by allen,and whether these specific symptoms and limitations as described by allen are credible.with regard to the first issue of general reasonableness,the alj agreed with and accepted mccord affirmative responses after considering the evidence of record,the undersigned finds that the claimant medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to produce the alleged symptoms 
when evaluating allen statements of subjective pain,however,the alj was required to go further and determine the actual intensity and persistence of allen symptoms and how these symptoms limit allen ability to work.c when the medical signs or laboratory findings show that you have a medically determinable impairment s that could reasonably be expected to produce your symptoms,such as pain,we must then evaluate the intensity and persistence of your symptoms so that we can determine how your symptoms limit your capacity for work.see also b the finding that your impairment s could reasonably be expected to produce your pain or other symptoms does not involve a determination as to the intensity,persistence,or functionally limiting effects of your symptoms.it was at this second step that the alj determined that the claimant statements concerning the intensity,duration and limiting effects of these symptoms are not entirely credible.
the alj provided a good reason for rejecting mccord questionnaire responses to the extent that they opined on the credibility of allen statements regarding the specific limitations of his spinal condition 
mccord was also asked to opine whether the claimant complaints or descriptions of his abilities and symptoms are credible.the affirmative response from mccord is of no help to the undersigned since the issue of credibility is reserved to the commissioner.
social security regulations state that o pinions on some issues are not medical opinions but are,instead,opinions on issues reserved to the commissioner because they are administrative findings that are dispositive of a case,that would direct the determination or decision of disability.e providing a list of examples of issues reserved to the commissioner.precedent in this circuit and agency rulings support the alj conclusion that mccord opinion of allen credibility addresses one of the issues reserved to the commissioner and therefore is not a medical opinion requiring consideration.c redibility determinations with respect to subjective complaints of pain rest with the alj.siterlet sec y of health human,cir see also walters comm r of soc,cir a n alj findings based on the credibility of the applicant are to be accorded great weight and deference,particularly since an alj is charged with the duty of observing a witness demeanor and credibility.soc.sec.rul,wl,at.
because the alj followed agency regulations by stating good reasons for discounting mccord questionnaire responses,remand to the agency is not required for failing to do so.
the subsequent determination that allen was disabled does not warrant a remand of his initial benefits denial.sentence six of g describes a situation where a court can remand a case to the agency 
the court may at any time order additional evidence to be taken before the commissioner of social security,but only upon a showing that there is new evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding.
allen argues that his subsequent favorable decision finding him disabled beginning the day after the initial decision denying benefits constitutes new and material evidence justifying remand under g.the magistrate judge correctly found that a subsequent favorable decision itself,as opposed to the evidence supporting the subsequent decision,does not constitute new and material evidence under g.therefore,allen did not meet his burden of showing that remand is proper under this section.see sizemore sec y of health human,cir.
the supreme court interpretation of sentence six of g in melkonyan sullivan,d,states as follows 
the district court does not affirm,modify,or reverse the secretary decision it does not rule in any way as to the correctness of the administrative determination.rather,the court remands because new evidence has come to light that was not available to the claimant at the time of the administrative proceeding and that evidence might have changed the outcome of the prior proceeding.
id.at.under sentence six,the mere existence of the subsequent decision in allen favor,standing alone,can not be evidence that can change the outcome of his prior proceeding.a subsequent favorable decision may be supported by evidence that is new and material under g,but the decision is not itself new and material evidence.
if a subsequent favorable from any new substantive evidence supporting the itself be new evidence under sentence six,the only way that it might change the outcome of the initial proceeding is by the power of its alternative analysis of the same evidence.but remand under sentence six is not meant to address the correctness of the administrative determination made on the evidence already before the initial alj id.in addition,it is overly broad to read the words new evidence in sentence six to include a subsequent
