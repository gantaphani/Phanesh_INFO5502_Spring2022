after receiving allegedly substandard medical care,john alton woodruff plaintiff brought a malpractice action against thomas covington and jihad ahmad,as well as the central oklahoma american indian health council coaihc,the carl albert indian health facility carl albert hospital,and the united states of america named as defendant for carl albert hospital.covington filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that he was a federal employee under the federal tort claims act ftca,b,and thus the united states was the only proper defendant.the coaihc and ahmad then filed a motion to substitute the united states for them on the grounds that the coaihc was a federal agency and ahmad was a federal employee under the ftca.the district court denied both of these motions under the rationale that these defendants were not federal employees and that congress did not expressly extend the ftca to them.we now affirm the court finding that appellants are not federal employees under the ftca and that congress did not extend ftca immunity to appellants in enacting a of the indian health care improvement act ihcia.
background 
defendant central oklahoma american indian health council,coaihc is an oklahoma corporation that was organized for the purpose of providing health services to indians residing in the oklahoma city area.coaihc operates the oklahoma city indian clinic the clinic in oklahoma city,oklahoma,which was created to serve as a demonstration project for providing health care to indians living in urban areas with unmet health needs.a.coaihc was created as a part of the implementation of title v of the indian health care improvement act ihcia,and.covington and ahmad are employees of coaihc and the clinic.
plaintiff john alton woodruff plaintiff sought examination,diagnosis,and treatment of hematuria from the clinic,carl albert indian hospital,and covington and ahmad.on october,plaintiff filed a complaint in the eastern district of oklahoma against the clinic,carl albert indian hospital,covington,ahmad,and the united states of america alleging that their negligence resulted in the surgical removal of his bladder.
on november,defendant thomas covington filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that he was a federal employee under the federal tort claims act ftca,and thus the united states was the only proper defendant.the district court denied this motion on january,finding that covington was not entitled to immunity as a federal employee.
on january,defendants coaihc and jihad ahmad then filed a motion to substitute the united states for them,on the grounds that the coaihc was a federal agency and ahmad was a federal employee under the federal tort claims act.the district court denied this motion on march,finding that neither defendant was entitled to immunity under the ftca for substantially the same reasons set forth in the court order denying covington motion to dismiss.
defendants coaihc,covington,and ahmad appellants now appeal these orders denying ftca immunity.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
before delving into the merits of appellants claims of ftca immunity,we first address the issues of whether covington appeal was timely under federal rule of appellate procedure,and whether the two district court orders were final under the collateral order doctrine so as to allow our exercise of jurisdiction under 
was covington notice of appeal timely 
the government argues that covington notice of appeal was untimely filed,and that we thus lack jurisdiction.we disagree and hold that the notice of appeal was timely under rule a.
the time limits of rule are prerequisite s to our jurisdiction.utah women clinic,leavitt,cir.under rule,an appellant in a civil case where the united states is a party has sixty days after the order is entered in which to file a notice of appeal.fed.a b.however,if one party timely files a notice of appeal,any other party may file a notice of appeal within fourteen days after the date when the first notice was filed.fed.a 
on march,the coaihc and ahmad filed their notice of appeal from the order dated march.their notice of appeal was thus timely under rule a b.covington then filed his notice of appeal from the january,order on april.because he filed his notice of appeal within fourteen days of the coaihc and ahmad notice of appeal,covington notice was timely under rule a.
the government argues that covington notice of appeal should not be covered by rule a additional fourteen days because he appealed a different order than the one appealed by the coaihc and ahmad.however,we have clearly held that the application of rule a is not restricted to circumstances in which the second party appeal is taken from the same order appealed by the first party.see,local union,cir.in,we stated that the history of rule a shows that such a technical interpretation as advocated by the government is not in accord with commentary on the time extension provisions.id.specifically,we cited the commentary to the rule predecessor,which provided 
the added time which may be made available by the operation of the provision is not restricted to cross appeals in the technical sense,to appeals by parties made appellees by the nature of the initial appeal.the exception permits any party to the action who is entitled to appeal within the time ordinarily prescribed to appeal within such added time as the sentence affords.
id.quotation,emphasis omitted see also murphy arkansas,cir rejecting the defendants argument that the is untimely because rule a is limited to a from an unfavorable part of the judgment or order initially appealed.
before rule was enacted,
a party who desired to appeal only if some other party took an appeal either had to forego his desire not to appeal and file a notice of appeal,thereby possibly provoking other appeals that might not have been taken if his had not been or he had to keep watch at the clerk office during the final days of the time for appeal in order to be sure that he would learn of the fact of the appeal of another in time to take his own.
jackson jordan,plasser am,quotation omitted.the purpose behind this broad interpretation of rule a is to give effect to the rule purpose of eliminating the necessity for protective appeals and the wasteful practice of keeping watch at the office of the clerk.id.quotation omitted.this policy is furthered by allowing any party to file a notice of appeal from any order within fourteen days after another party appealed a decision of the district court.
because covington filed his notice of appeal within fourteen days after another party in his case filed a timely notice of appeal,covington filing was timely under rule a,even though the notice designated appeal from a different order in the case see,at.
does this court have jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine 
the government argues that we lack jurisdiction over both of the appeals at hand because neither of the district court orders were final under.we disagree and find that both orders fall under the collateral order doctrine set forth by the supreme court in cohen beneficial industrial loan.
section provides for appeal from all final decisions of the district courts.the supreme court has repeatedly interpreted to mean that an appeal ordinarily will not lie until after final judgment has been entered in a case.cunningham hamilton county,ohio,d.typically,a judgment is not final unless it ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.id.at.quotations omitted.this final judgment rule serves several purposes,including allowing the trial judge to do his or her job without interlocutory appellate interference,reducing obstructions to just claims and avoiding the harassment and cost of separate appeals,and promoting judicial administration.id.at.
however,in cohen,the supreme court interpreted the term final decision in to permit jurisdiction over appeals from a small category of orders that do not terminate the litigation.cunningham,at.citing cohen,at.that small category includes only decisions that are conclusive,that resolve important questions separate from the merits,and that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.id.quotation omitted.the cohen court explained this collateral order doctrine as follows 
this decision appears to fall in that small class which finally determine claims of right separate from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.the court has long given this provision of the statute this practical rather than a technical construction.
cohen,at.see also quackenbush allstate ins,d coopers lybrand livesay,d.the tenth circuit has formulated a test reflecting these considerations,stating that the order is appealable under the collateral order doctrine when it conclusively determines the disputed question resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.yousef reno,cir.
denials of claims of immunity from suit are typically found to be immediately reviewable under the collateral order doctrine.for example,in nixon fitzgerald,the supreme court held that orders denying claims of absolute immunity are appealable under the cohen criteria,d.in mitchell forsyth,the court extended the collateral order doctrine to orders denying claims of qualified immunity,d.the mitchell court first summarized the reasoning behind immediate appeal of absolute immunity cases when a district court has denied a defendant claim of right not to stand trial we have consistently held the court decision appealable,for such a right can not be effectively vindicated after the trial has occurred,and thus an order denying a claim of absolute immunity is a collateral order.id.at.t he essence of absolute immunity is its possessor entitlement not to have to answer for his conduct in a civil damages action.id.the court then concluded that because qualified immunity is also an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability,it would be similarly lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.id.at.emphasis omitted.additionally,the court held that an immunity claim is separate from the underlying merits of the case and that the district court had conclusively determined the immunity issue.id.at.therefore,the court held,all of the cohen requirements had been met.id.at.
the tenth circuit has similarly extended the collateral order doctrine to denials of absolute or qualified immunity.for example,in chavez singer,we held that a claim of absolute immunity,like a claim of double jeopardy,
should be determined before a trial on the merits.in each situation a defendant contests a plaintiff right to hale him into court.the district court here conclusively determined the immunity question.immunity is important and collateral to the merits of the action.the right to immunity is a question of law and is arguably lost once the trial is held.

many circuits have likewise held that denials of ftca immunity are immediately appealable collateral orders.for example,in taboas mlynczak,the seventh circuit held that the denial of the united states motion for substitution in this context is effectively a denial of immunity for the defendant employee,and the collateral order doctrine therefore applies with as much force in this context as it does to other claims of qualified or absolute immunity,cir citation omitted.therefore,the court held,a denial of the united states motion for substitution under the westfall act creating ftca immunity is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.id.
similarly,in aliota graham,the third circuit held that because a n order granting resubstitution effectively denies a federal employee claim to absolute immunity,it is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment,cir.the district court order also represented its final word on the resubstitution and the question of resubstitution is completely separate from the merits of the action.id.at.therefore,the court held that the order denying ftca immunity was immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.id.at.the approach of these two cases is not controversial in fact,every circuit court follows the same route of analysis in dealing with collateral order appeals of ftca immunity denials 
in this case,the government argues that this weight of authority regarding the immediate appealability of ftca immunity denials does not save our jurisdiction because appellants in this case do not present colorable claims of immunity.the supreme court has explicitly added a colorability requirement in the context of double jeopardy claims under the collateral order doctrine.see,richardson united states,d w e have indicated that the appealability of a double jeopardy claim depends upon its being at least colorable.see also united states mcaleer,cir although the denial of a pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy grounds falls within the collateral order exception,only colorable double jeopardy claims may be appealed before final judgment.to be colorable,a claim must have some possible validity.citation,footnote omitted.although the court has not been as explicit in requiring colorability in the context of other collateral orders,it has at least stated that requiring an official with a colorable immunity claim to defend a suit for damages would be peculiarly disruptive of effective government,in concluding that this freedom from suit would be effectively lost if review were delayed until final judgment.digital,at.quotation omitted some emphasis omitted.
other courts have similarly mentioned that only the denials of colorable immunity claims are immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.for example,in powell ridge,the third circuit explained that a colorable claim of legislative immunity could be appealed as a collateral order,cir emphasis added.however,in that case,the court noted that the claim of immunity was not colorable rather,the legislators had buil t from scratch a privilege that does not exist,and thus interlocutory was denied.id.at see also malina gonzales,cir the denial of a motion to dismiss raising a colorable claim of judicial immunity is appealable under the collateral order exception to the finality requirement of.emphasis added durning citibank,cir w e have held that a denial of a motion to dismiss on grounds of sovereign immunity,if colorable,is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.emphasis added.we have also declined to find jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine where,inter alia,there is no merit whatsoever to the motion denied below.united states valenzuela,cir.
indeed,a requirement of colorability may be found in the cohen requirement that the asserted right on interlocutory appeal be too important to be denied review.cohen,at.an interlocutory appeal that does not even assert a colorable right would not,almost by definition,be asserting a right sufficient important to justify cohen interlocutory review.see powell ridge,at.
in the instant case,although we ultimately conclude on the merits that appellants are not entitled to ftca immunity,they at least presented a colorable claim for immunity.they were providing services requested by the government,and they pointed to statutory language that arguably supported their immunity claim.additionally,this is not a situation where appellants created an immunity out of whole they were indeed federal employees,they would have been entitled to an existing immunity.finally,there exists no precedent directly on point regarding the question of whether the indian health care statute at issue expanded ftca coverage.therefore,appellants claim to immunity is at least colorable,meaning that the claim has some possible validity,even though it is ultimately unsuccessful.mcaleer,at.
if we wait until final judgment to hear this appeal,the right not to be burdened by trial will have been irreparably lost.additionally,the district court conclusively determined this issue and the issue itself is completely separate from the merits of the underlying medical negligence action.therefore,we properly exercise jurisdiction over these appeals pursuant to the cohen collateral order doctrine.see cunningham,at.yousef,at.
immunity under the federal tort claims act 
the government argues that appellants are not federal employees,and that a does not extend ftca immunity to them.we agree,and thus affirm the district court denial of the motion to dismiss and the motion to substitute the united states.
in the federal tort claims act ftca,congress consented to suits against the united states for certain torts committed by federal employees while acting within the scope of their employment.the government consent to be sued under the ftca extends only to 
claims against the united states for money damages,for injury or loss of property,or personal injury of death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
b emphasis added.an ftca action against the united states is the sole remedy for any injury to person or property caused by the negligent or wrongful acts of a federal employee acting within the scope of his or her employment.b.the purpose of this exclusive remedy provision was to give federal employees an absolute immunity from common law tort actions.jamison,at cir.
were covington and ahmad federal employees under the federal tort claims act 
the ftca is a limited waiver of sovereign immunity that only applies to federal employees.united states orleans,d.the act defines government employees to include officers and employees of any federal agency,but excludes any contractor with the united states.id.quotation omitted.the supreme court has emphasized the importance of the federal employee requirement as gatekeeper it is inconceivable that congress intended to have waiver of sovereign immunity follow congressional largesse and cover countless unidentifiable classes of beneficiaries.orleans,at.
in orleans,the supreme court described the test for ascertaining whether a claimant is a federal employee covered by the act,or an independent contractor not so immunized.a critical element in distinguishing an agency from a contractor is the power of the federal government to control the detailed physical performance of the contractor.id.at.quoting logue united states,d.the question here is not whether the community action agency receives federal money and must comply with federal standards and regulations,but whether its operations are supervised by the federal government.id.at.we have devised seven factors to guide this determination 
the intent of the parties whether the united states controls only the end result or may also control the manner and method of reaching the result whether the person uses his own equipment or that of the united states who provides liability insurance who pays social security tax whether federal regulations prohibit federal employees from performing such contracts and whether the individual has authority to subcontract to others.
lilly fieldstone,cir see also curry united states,cir.
we have had several opportunities to apply these seven guiding factors in medical malpractice actions,where the employee is a physician or a nurse.for example,in bird united states,we held that a nurse at an indian hospital was a federal employee because he was not only subject to the rules and regulations and,indeed,a statute placing him under the control and supervision of physician employees of the hospital,but he was under their actual control to the extent they chose to exercise it,cir.additionally,we relied on the following considerations 
he was required to work with patients designated by others.he maintained no separate office.he used hospital equipment exclusively.he could see patients in no other place nor under any other circumstance than as directed by government employees.he was under the control and supervision of the government surgeon at the hospital to the same extent that a regular employee of the government was.
when it comes to physicians,we have explained that the control test may be more difficult to apply.in lurch united states,we provided dicta suggesting that a modified control test may be more appropriate because a physician must exercise his own professional judgment,no one controls the detailed physical performance of his duties,cir see also thomas kruppstadt,determining whether a physician is a united states employee or an independent contractor in a medical malpractice action under the federal tort claims act,baylor.however,we later declined to adopt a modified control test for physicians,because we did not find that label helpful.lilly,at.instead,we simply take into account the doctor medical and ethical obligations of independent judgment when we apply the traditional control test 
it is uncontroverted that a physician must have discretion to care for a patient and may not surrender control over certain medical details.therefore,the control test is subject to a doctor medical and ethical obligations.whether we label the test control or modified control is not determinative.what we must do in the case of professionals is determine whether other evidence manifests an intent to make the professional an employee subject to other forms of control which are permissible.a myriad of doctors become employees by agreement without surrendering their professional responsibilities.
we ultimately held that the doctor in lilly was an independent contractor with the army hospital,rather than a federal employee,because he maintained a private office,he billed the army separately,he was not provided office space or secretarial help,and he was never regularly scheduled on the hospital duty roster.id.at see also ezekiel michel,cir finding that a resident physician was a governmental employee under the control test,even though he was without compensation status at the hospital and not compensated directly by the va for his services wooten hudson,d,finding that the physician was an independent contractor,because t he record in this case is sparse at best on the level of control exercised by the hospital over doctor activities.
where there is a contract between the government and the physician,clear language regarding government control or federal employee status can often prevail over facts that might otherwise support a finding of control.for example,in duplan harper,we held that a doctor who provided treatment at an air force hospital was an independent contractor,rather than a federal employee,because his contract with the government explicitly designated the doctor as an independent contractor,he wore a name tag identifying himself to the patients as a contract physician,he was paid by a private provider,and the private provider had control and responsibility for liability insurance,cir.these facts outweighed other facts indicating that patient records were maintained by the government,the government retained the power to conduct periodic quality reviews of the doctor performance,the government imposed minimum standards for doctors,the government required doctors to follow certain rules including a dress code,the government supplied virtually all equipment and support personnel at the clinic,and the government required the doctor to be at the clinic during designated hours.id.similarly,in lurch,at,we held that the contractual language prohibited treating the doctor as a governmental employee.
in the instant case,appellants do not even argue that the government exercised control over the coaihc or covington and ahmad.the record on appeal contains no contracts or other
