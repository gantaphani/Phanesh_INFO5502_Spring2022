amended opinion 
this is an appeal of the district court refusal to set aside its grant of summary judgment to the veterans administration va in a suit brought by a physician who was transferred to a va facility without notice and an opportunity to respond,as required by statute and veterans administration agency regulations.the district court found that suzanne fligiel transfer was a major adverse action,entitling her to procedural protections,including advance notice and an opportunity to respond.however,the court held that the denial of procedural due process was harmless error and granted the va summary judgment.
on appeal,fligiel argues that the application of the harmless error test was inappropriate under wilson social security,cir,and that the district court wrongly relied on information outside of the agency record in making its determination.it is unnecessary to address these claims on the merits,however,because we find that judicial review of this matter was precluded in the first instance.therefore,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment to the va,with remand to the district court for an entry of dismissal pursuant to united states fausto,d.
background 
factual background 
suzanne fligiel,began working for the john dingall veterans administration medical center vamc in detroit in,and by,she had advanced to the position of chief of pathology and laboratory medicine services palms.while serving as the chief of palms,fligiel was involved in various disputes with both her staff and her supervisors.physicians working in her department complained that fligiel had an overbearing managerial style,and several members of the staff complained to fligiel superiors.fligiel was also resistant to the vamc new partnership with wayne state university and the detroit medical center,which caused concern with her supervisors and colleagues.her official proficiency reports,however,were highly complimentary of her work with the department at least through.
on october,fligiel was called to a meeting with samson,her supervisor at the vamc.he informed her that she was being detailed to the palms department at the vamc in ann arbor,michigan,and that she was being reassigned from her position as chief of palms to a staff physician position.the reassignment led to a net loss in fligiel annual salary of.
at the time of the detail,samson told fligiel that he was frustrated by her lack of cooperation with the partnership efforts and by the negative and hostile work climate that was the product of her management style.he advised her to report to personnel,and told her she would be escorted out of the building by the va police.fligiel did not report to personnel,and left the vamc down a back stair case.she contacted her counsel immediately.on november,her attorneys sent a letter to the detroit vamc requesting all records relating to fligiel employment,as well as a copy of the va grievance procedures.shortly thereafter,fligiel counsel sent a letter to thomas garthwaite,acting under secretary for health and the chief medical director of the department of veterans affairs,requesting an appeal to the disciplinary appeals board dab.garthwaite responded via letter dated december,stating that fligiel proper recourse was through va grievance procedures.
fligiel received a memorandum dated january,that rescinded her reassignment from her position as chief,though this did not change the amount of her salary.several days later,fligiel counsel received a letter from the department of veterans affairs counsel stating that fligiel only option for redress was through the equal employment opportunity commission.
in october,fligiel received notice that she was being permanently reassigned to a staff physician position in saginaw,michigan.fligiel accepted this transfer,but she filed a formal complaint with the va office of resolution management.fligiel received a response regarding her administrative grievance in february,informing her that the reassignment was in compliance with va regulations.
procedural background 
in june,fligiel sued michael samson,chief of staff at the detroit vamc,thomas garthwaite,deputy under secretary for health,department of veterans affairs,togo west,secretary of veterans affairs,and the department of veterans affairs in federal district court.the complaint sought damages for violations of veterans benefits,disciplinary and grievance procedures,and for a bivens claim based on a fifth amendment violation.with regard to the argument,fligiel asserted that her transfer to the ann arbor vamc amounted to a major adverse action,entitling her to statutory procedural protections.the defendants filed a motion to dismiss or,alternatively,for judgment on the pleadings on september,arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the apa and under et that the bivens claim was prohibited under bush lucas,d,and that the claims were barred on both sovereign and qualified immunity grounds.
fligiel filed for partial summary judgment on september,and on october,she filed an amended complaint that added an additional claim for sex discrimination under title vii.on january,the district court entered an order granting the defendant request for summary judgment,finding that the detail did not constitute a major adverse action so that fligiel was not entitled to a hearing before the dab,that the bivens claim was barred,and the constitutional claim was invalid on the basis of the sovereign immunity of samson,garthwaite,and west,and the qualified immunity of samson.
fligiel filed two additional amended complaints the first of these added a claim that the saginaw transfer was retaliation for the prior complaint of sex discrimination,and the second added a claim that the transfer to saginaw was a major adverse action,and fligiel was denied her statutory rights to notice and a hearing under and the apa.on april,a verdict form was filed stating that fligiel failed to prove the elements of sex discrimination with regard to the transfers to the ann arbor vamc and the saginaw vamc.
in may,fligiel submitted a brief requesting that the court reverse the january,grant of summary judgment on the basis of the later trial testimony and exhibits.in this brief,fligiel argued that samson trial testimony made it clear that the personnel actions taken in her case amounted to a permanent transfer rather than a detail,and were based in part on professional conduct or competence.the court entered an order on august,denying the request for a reversal of the earlier decision.however,the court did set aside its earlier determination that the action taken against fligiel was not a major adverse action,in light of the events occurring and evidence gathered since that earlier date.the court found that fligiel relocation to the ann arbor vamc was a major adverse action,but that this transfer was not based on professional conduct or competence.thus,fligiel was still not entitled to a review by the dab pursuant to.fligiel filed a motion to amend the judgment,which the court denied.she then filed this appeal.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court claimed jurisdiction pursuant to,relying on the veterans benefits act,et seq and the administrative procedure act,et.appeal to this court was made pursuant to.however,after reviewing these statutes in light of applicable case law,we find that judicial review of this matter was precluded.
when this court is reviewing a district court opinion as to an agency action,it will use a de novo standard of review.steeltech,epa,cir.the court will then apply the appropriate standard of review in looking at the agency decision.steeltech.
iii.statutory procedural rights 
fligiel remedies under the veterans benefits act 
veterans administration physicians are afforded procedural protections when they experience a major adverse action,as defined by.the statute identifies a transfer as such an action.c b.initially,the district court agreed with the va description of fligiel relocation to the ann arbor va as a detail,an action that does not trigger any statutory protections.however,after the issue,the court agreed with fligiel that t
