this case presents the questions of whether an erisa plan determination to deny benefits was arbitrary and capricious and,if it was,what remedy this court should order.patricia elliott submitted a claim for disability benefits to the administrator of her employer employee benefit plan,metropolitan life metlife.metlife denied elliott claim.thereafter,elliott brought this erisa action,based on the administrative record,against metlife for wrongful denial of benefits under a b.metlife moved for judgment affirming its decision to deny benefits and elliott moved for reversal.holding that metlife determination to deny benefits was not arbitrary and capricious,the district court granted metlife motion and denied elliott motion.elliott appealed to this court.
because we conclude that metlife decision was arbitrary and capricious,we vacate the judgment of the district court.the record does not support the conclusion that metlife denial of elliott claim was the result of a deliberative,principled reasoning process.we can not say,however,that elliott is clearly entitled to disability benefits.consequently,we remand to the district court with instructions to remand to metlife for a full and fair review consistent with this opinion.
elliott was injured severely in a car accident in.at that time,she suffered significant fractures of her second and third cervical vertebrae.soon after,she underwent stabilization and spinal surgery,which involved the placement of metallic wires in her neck.in,elliott began working for great american financial resources and joined the company employee benefit plan,which metlife administers.
in october,elliott began experiencing renewed pain related to the accident,including radiating shoulder pain,numbness,and burning sensations.she saw several physicians,beginning with charles kuntz of the university of cincinnati mayfield clinic.in early,elliott began receiving disability benefits,after kuntz submitted a form to great american certifying that she could not perform work of any kind.while on disability in early,elliott visited several physicians and had numerous studies conducted.none could explain with precision why elliott symptoms had reemerged.
in may,kuntz referred elliott to alex schneider at aring neurology at the university of cincinnati.schneider conducted an initial electromyogram and found no signs of motor or myelopathic symptoms.however,he also made findings consistent with a central syndrome.in addition,schneider wrote she is better than she was six months ago,but continued to have some chronic pain and anxiety related to this.schneider recommended,among other things,elavil a psychoactive prescription drug often prescribed for depression,a used to stabilize the neck,physical therapy,and a in three months.
schneider saw elliott again in august.he made no significant new findings at that visit,except to note since starting the elavil,she has done quite better sic.she states she is moving around better and her neck pain is better.however,schneider did report that she has some weakness and numbness when she is up too long,particularly in her legs and feet.schneider increased her prescription,ordered more physical therapy,and recommended a return visit in three months,a date that coincides with elliott most recent mri.
in september,elliott began the disability claims process.her claim was denied on december,in a letter from metlife.in the letter,metlife recounts the plan terms and restates technical medical terms from elliott doctors reports.then,without reasoning,the letter concludes the medial sic documentation does not support a condition of a severity that would prevent you from working.
on december,elliott sent a letter to metlife appealing the decision.in the letter,elliott wrote that her condition has improved since the increase of her elavil prescription.she also wrote that if i stand,sit,bend,walk,or sit up straight for too long,i require pain medication.describing her physical abilities,she wrote that i have improved in motor skills since therapy and can tend to my daily needs without assistance.i can do some housework most days but am restricted to light duty dusting,dishwasher,straightening.sic.
elliott also included a letter from schneider,dated december.in the letter,he described elliott condition as chronic weakness and numbness that is exacerbated when she is standing for any length of time.schneider also recounted elliott last mri,dated november,which showed surgical changes along with mild to moderate diskogenic disease and degenerative changes.there was no clear syringomyelia,although metallic artifact limits the parenchymal visualization.following that discussion,schneider specified particular limitations on elliott ability to work.he wrote 
it is my opinion that her work is limited due to her chronic pain syndrome and spinal cord injury that is exacerbated by spending any length of time on her feet or sitting in a single position for any length of time.she should not do any lifting.she should not be crouching into small spaces or doing any repetitive motion type of work.she should not do any work that requires reaching above her head.it is my opinion that her chronic neurologic condition causes her significant disability.this condition is chronic and will likely worsen in the future.furthermore,she may require further surgical intervention as she develops further arthritic changes.
in response to elliott appeal,metlife engaged robert menotti to review elliott file.the record indicates that metlife sent elliott file to menotti on february,and that he completed his review the next day.in the review,menotti recounted elliott medical history.although menotti conceded that schneider statement appears to be credible,he nevertheless asserted that elliott condition improved over time with respect to her chronic pain,especially with medication.menotti then concluded that i am not left with the impression given the current level of documentation that the claimant appears medically unable to perform sedentary work based on the physical findings supplied by schneider and by kuntz.menotti was the first physician to mention the term sedentary work,which does not appear in the plan at issue.
based on menotti findings,metlife denied elliott appeal.in its letter to elliott,metlife again recounted her medical history,including the latest reviews by schneider and menotti.again without reasoning,metlife then wrote there was no indication that your condition caused impairments which that would have prevented your sic from performing the duties of your job.therefore,the original claim determination was appropriate.
following the denial of her appeal,elliott brought an erisa action against metlife for wrongful denial of benefits under a b.metlife moved for judgment affirming its decision to deny benefits and elliott moved for reversal.the district court granted metlife motion and denied elliott motion.elliott appealed.
we review de novo the decision of a district court granting judgment in an erisa disability benefit action based on an administrative record.see glenn metro.life ins,cir whitaker hartford life accident,cir wilkins baptist healthcare,cir.in addition,when a plan grants the administrator discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the plan and to determine benefits,courts will only reverse an administrator determination if it is arbitrary and capricious.firestone tire rubber bruch,d glenn,at mcdonald life ins,cir.because the metlife plan at issue in this case provides for discretion,we apply the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.
although that standard is deferential,it is not a rubber stamp for the administrator determination.jones metro.life ins,cir.in other words,deferential review is not no review.mcdonald,at citing hess hartford life accident ins,cir.under that standard,we will uphold the administrator decision if it is the result of a deliberate,principled reasoning process and if it is supported by substantial evidence.glenn,at citing baker united mine workers of am.health ret.funds,cir.
the question in any given disability case on arbitrary and capricious review is whether a plan can offer a reasoned explanation,based on the evidence,for its judgment that a claimant was not disabled within the plan terms.in pertinent part,the metlife plan at issue here reads as follows disabled or disability means that,due to sickness,pregnancy,or accidental injury,you are receiving appropriate care and treatment from a doctor on a continuing basis and during your elimination period and the next month period,you are unable to earn more than of your predisability earnings or indexed predisability earnings at your own occupation for any employer in your local economy.the plan defines own occupation as the activity that you regularly perform and that serves as your source of income.it is not limited to the specific position you held with your employer.it may be a similar activity that could be performed with your employer or any other employer.
those terms are clear.to ascertain whether a claimant is disabled,metlife must determine whether the individual condition sickness,pregnancy,or accidental injury precludes her from performing her own occupation.once metlife makes that judgment,its determination is entitled to deference unless it is arbitrary and capricious.that is,if metlife determination that an individual can perform her occupation is the result of a deliberate,principled reasoning process and if it is supported by substantial evidence,it will not be disturbed.glenn,at citing baker,at.
we must therefore determine whether metlife made a deliberate,principled,and reasoned decision that elliott condition would not preclude her from performing her occupation.at the district court level,metlife submitted an official description of the duties of an employee with elliott former occupation as a business quality analyst elliott does not contest the use of that description here as such,we will treat elliott official job description as giving the duties of her own occupation for analytical purposes.
a business quality analyst essential responsibilities,inter alia,are to develop and prepare routine and reports needed from administration systems to effectively audit business activity coordinate with other business areas to data edit and review reports with management to ensure they meet business needs and work with administration support to drive effectiveness of reports needed.to further those objectives,the company specified some of the skills that would be required,including proficiency in some computer software.
we must now ask whether metlife made a reasoned judgment that elliott medical condition allowed her to perform those or similar duties.logically,metlife could have made a reasoned judgment only if it relied on medical evidence that assessed elliott physical ability to perform tasks.mcdonald,at citing quinn blue cross blue shield ass n,cir the plan was under a duty to make a reasonable inquiry into the types of skills the claimant possesses and whether those skills may be used at another job.see also osborne,at affirming the denial of benefits,in part,because claimant was once again able to perform the duties of his position glenn,at.put differently,medical data,without reasoning,can not produce a logical judgment about a claimant work ability.despite the numerous medical evaluations that took place in this case,metlife did not rely on an application of the relevant evidence to the occupational standard when it denied her claim initially and on internal appeal.
in its first denial letter,before having elliott file reviewed by a physician consultant,metlife merely recounted the technical contents of elliott various medical evaluations.for example,metlife wrote,per the april,office note from kuntz the findings of the january,emg revealed normal nerve conduction of the bilateral upper and lower limbs.review of the ct of the cervical spine dated march,shows no evidence of significant central canal stenosis it was suggested that you get a neurological consultation.then the letter says the medial sic documentation does not support a condition of a severity that would prevent you from working.
we note that,in the first denial letter,metlife states that it considered elliott job description.nevertheless,there is no indication that metlife reasoned from elliott condition to her ability to perform her occupation.there is no statement or discussion of elliott occupational duties or her ability,or inability,to perform them.instead,the denial letter is a mere recitation of medical terminology employed by various physicians in their diagnoses of elliott condition,without any reasoning as to why those diagnoses would permit her to function in the workplace.a court decision that merely said affirmed or reversed could not be considered reasoned.similarly,metlife can not be said to have given a reasoned denial of elliott claim,initially.
elliott appealed that initial determination,adding a letter from schneider that related her condition to her work ability.in denying her appeal,metlife relied on only one other new piece of evidence the opinion of a physician consultant,robert menotti,who conducted a review of elliott claim.because metlife initial denial lacked a reasoned basis,metlife second denial can only be characterized as reasoned if menotti review provided an adequate basis to conclude that elliott could perform her occupation despite her medical condition.
menotti review bears a striking resemblance to metlife first denial letter.in similar fashion,menotti stated nearly verbatim from metlife letter the technical findings related to elliott condition.that recitation occupies more than half of menotti review.kalish,at rejecting as inadequate a report recounting six pages of medical history and engaging in only one page of analysis.in addition,menotti presented no reasons for his conclusion that elliott condition would not preclude her from working.he never discussed elliott job duties,which implies that he did not conduct a reasoned evaluation of her condition to determine whether she could perform those duties.
to be sure,menotti discussed schneider conclusions about elliott limited work ability in fact,he explicitly stated that schneider conclusions appear ed to be credible.yet menotti offered no specific rebuttal to schneider conclusions,nor did he opine as to how elliott medical condition related to the demands of her job.instead,menotti concluded that earlier records demonstrated that elliott condition improved over time and that her chronic pain syndrome has responded to medication.however,logically speaking,evidence of an improvement,without a starting or ending point,does not help answer the question of whether an individual can perform her occupation.getting better,without more,does not equal able to work.
moreover,based on his determination that elliott was improving,menotti stated a conclusion that is arguably on a different plane than the proper inquiry.he wrote i am not left with the impression given the current level of documentation that the claimant appears medically unable to perform sedentary work.the term sedentary work appears nowhere in the plan terms.as we have noted,the proper inquiry is whether elliott could perform her own occupation.menotti never undertook such an inquiry.
in addition,menotti was a physician consultant frequently employed by metlife.the supreme court has acknowledged that physicians repeatedly retained by benefits plans may have an incentive to make a finding of not disabled in order to save their employers money and to preserve their own consulting arrangements.black decker disability plan nord,d.see also kalish,at.menotti conclusions have been questioned in at least three federal cases in all of them,he was hired by metlife.see white airline pilots ass n,d,the doctor language appears deliberately ambiguous and vague viglietta metro.life ins,civ,dist.lexis,at,it is,however,highly unlikely that menotti considered plaintiff revised job description smith home depot welfare benefits plan,dist.lexis,at.
we express no opinion on whether menotti was,in fact,influenced in this matter by his frequent employment by metlife.it is clear,however,that he failed to conduct the appropriate inquiry.menotti s
