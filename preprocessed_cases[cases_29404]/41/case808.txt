edward carmona,sued,southwest airlines southwest,claiming that the termination of his employment violated title vii of the civil rights act of title vii and the americans with disabilities act ada.the case was tried before a jury,which found that southwest had discriminated against carmona because of his disability and awarded him in lost wages.the jury found no liability on carmona title vii claim.the district court accepted the jury verdict on carmona title vii claim,vacated the jury verdict on carmona ada claim,and granted judgment as a matter of law to southwest.carmona now appeals.for the following reasons,we reverse in part,vacate in part,and remand.
facts and proceedings below 
carmona was diagnosed with psoriasis when he was twelve or thirteen years old.psoriasis is a skin disease characterized by thickened patches of inflamed,red skin,often covered by silvery scales.american medical association,encyclopedia of medicine charles clayman,random house.although individual attacks of psoriasis can be completely relieved,the disease itself is not usually curable,and it tends to recur in attacks of varying severity.id.carmona began working as a flight attendant at southwest in.
in,carmona was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis,which is a condition that develops in about percent of people who have psoriasis.psoriatic arthritis causes painful swelling and stiffness in the joints during attacks of psoriasis on the surface of the skin.during of his psoriatic arthritis,carmona can not walk or move around without great pain.it also makes it harder for him to sleep.carmona psoriatic arthritis flares up three or four times every month,and each lasts for three or four days.in other words,carmona spends anywhere from about to about of each month unable to move without a great deal of pain.he filed for intermittent family and medical leave act fmla leave so that he could be excused from work during these.southwest fmla administrator,broadspire administrator services,broadspire,granted this leave in.broadspire renewed the leave periodically until april,when it found that carmona had not worked enough hours to be eligible for renewal.
southwest attendance policy is governed by the agreement between southwest airlines and the flight attendants in the service of southwest airlines.as represented by the transport workers union of america,agreement.under the agreement,flight attendants accrue points for various types of attendance lapses,such as calling in sick,failing to show up for a flight without advance notice,or failing to report to scheduling.different types of lapses result in the accrual of different numbers of points.for example,calling in sick without a doctor note results in the addition of a to the flight attendant record,while a failure to show up without any kind of prior notice to the airline results in the addition of points.
points do not remain on the flight attendant record permanently.all points that are more than sixteen months old are automatically rolled off.if a flight attendant does not accrue any points during a calendar quarter,his running total is reduced by two.both of these reductions are known as record improvement.points are not assigned for absences that result from approved fmla leave.also,a flight attendant may use a doctor note once every calendar quarter to remove all points associated with the ailment that is verified by the note.the flight attendants records are kept in pencil,because they are frequently altered by doctors notes,fmla leave,and reviews.
when a flight attendant reaches between five and points,he is issued a letter of counsel.when the flight attendant reaches between seven and nine points,he is issued a written warning.when the flight attendant reaches between and points,he is issued a final warning.termination occurs when a flight attendant reaches or exceeds twelve points.however,termination can not occur under the terms of the agreement if the flight attendant was not timely served with the letter of counsel,the written warning,and the final warning.additionally,before termination is finalized,southwest reviews and recalculates the points to verify that the flight attendant has reached at least twelve points.southwest then issues a termination level notification and holds a meeting to discuss the situation with the flight attendant and a representative of the flight attendant union.after these precautionary steps,if southwest remains convinced that the flight attendant has accrued twelve or more points,then the flight attendant is issued a termination letter,and his employment is terminated.
carmona used a doctor note to cover three absences resulting from a of his psoriatic arthritis in late april.he contends that he tried to excuse these absences using his fmla leave but was not permitted to do so by southwest on the ground that he was not eligible for leave.southwest manager contends that carmona was eligible to excuse two of the three absences with his fmla leave but chose to use a doctor note instead.
on april,carmona fmla leave expired.he was unable to renew it,because,according to southwest and broadspire,he had not worked enough hours that year to be eligible to renew it.accordingly,after may,he was no longer able to excuse absences caused by his psoriatic arthritis with fmla leave.at the end of april,southwest appears to have believed that he had either or seven points on his record.
southwest sent carmona three letters of counsel on april,april,and may.in early may,a of his psoriatic arthritis caused him to miss several days of work.these absences were not excused,because carmona had been unable to renew his fmla leave and had already used his doctor note for the second quarter of in april.on may,southwest sent carmona a written warning.
on june,carmona sprained his thumb at home.he did not report to work the next day as scheduled,but went to the hospital instead to have his thumb examined.the hospital released him around midnight of june.however,he did not return to work until june,because of the swelling in his hand.at trial,it was disputed whether or not this absence was in accordance with the hospital instructions.carmona testified that he faxed two doctors notes to southwest,one of which said that he should return to work the morning of june,and the other of which said that he would need to stay home for three or four days.southwest contended that it had only received the note saying he could return to work the morning of june.
on june,southwest sent carmona his final warning.it issued him a termination level notice on june,which indicated that he had accumulated thirteen points as of june.under the agreement between the flight attendants union and southwest,a flight attendant must be terminated within seven days of reaching twelve points.kevin clark clark,southwest base manager for houston,requested an extension of this deadline,because he was unable to find a time within seven days of june when he,carmona,and a representative from carmona union could meet to hold the meeting to which carmona was entitled.at trial,carmona testified that his union representative told him that he had to grant southwest the extension or it would terminate him immediately.he decided to grant the extension.
before the meeting,clark reviewed carmona attendance points and concluded that carmona record was incorrect,because clark calculated that it should have reflected points,instead of thirteen.at the meeting,clark asserted this view.stacy martin martin,carmona union representative,calculated carmona total to be fourteen points.because the representative of the union and southwest manager both agreed that carmona was in excess of twelve points,he was terminated for excessive absenteeism without further procedure.carmona testified at trial that,after the meeting,when martin learned more about the circumstances of carmona absences,martin stated that he did not believe that clark had told the entire truth during the meeting.carmona attempted to bring grievance proceedings through his union,but the union determined that his grievance lacked merit.he then obtained counsel and appealed his grievance to the railway labor act rla board of adjustment board,but the board upheld his termination.
after his termination,carmona worked as a customer service agent for jet blue airlines on a basis,which did not exceed twelve hours per week.this job required him to stand behind a desk and check in passengers,meet flights on the jet way,and check baggage.after nine months,he left jet blue and began working at dillard.this job required him to sit behind a desk all day,which aggravated his condition.however,carmona admitted at trial that he did not miss work at either jet blue or dillard as a result of his psoriatic arthritis.
carmona filed suit against southwest on august,claiming that his termination violated the gender discrimination provisions of title vii,the disability discrimination provisions of the ada,and the fmla.he dropped his fmla claim during the course of the proceedings.on may,southwest filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing,among other things,that carmona claims were preempted by the rla.the district court agreed that carmona claims were preempted by the rla and granted southwest motion.carmona appealed the grant of summary judgment to this court,which reversed and remanded on july.carmona southwest airlines,cir.
on august,the district court set the case for jury trial in october.on september,the district court held a hearing on the remainder of southwest motion for summary judgment and denied the motion.at this hearing,carmona stated that he was ready to proceed to trial immediately and declined the district court invitation to engage in additional discovery.on september,the court reset the trial to begin on september.the district court stated that this would be necessary,because its docket was completely full in october and november.on september,carmona filed a motion to compel southwest to produce rita ilgen ilgen,one of its employees,as a witness,or,alternatively,a motion for a continuance pending ilgen return from her vacation outside of subpoena range.carmona stated that ilgen was important to his gender discrimination claim,because clark,the same supervisor who had terminated carmona,had not assigned her points when she was arrested for driving under the influence.the district court denied this motion on september,stating that it had no room on its docket to delay the trial.the trial began as scheduled on september.
southwest moved for judgment as a matter of law at the conclusion of each party case,arguing,inter alia,that carmona had failed to produce sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that he was an individual with a disability within the meaning of the ada,that he was qualified to work as a flight attendant within the meaning of the ada,or that he had been discriminated against because of his disability.see.the trial court carried southwest motion pending submission of the case to the jury.on october,the jury returned a verdict finding for carmona on his ada claim and awarding him in lost back wages,but finding against him on his title vii claim.following the verdict,southwest renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law,and carmona moved for reinstatement.the district court granted southwest motion on october,accepting the jury verdict as to title vii,vacating the verdict as to the ada claim,and denying carmona motion for reinstatement.the district court vacated the verdict on carmona ada claim because it found that he had presented insufficient evidence that he was an individual with a disability or that he had been discriminated against because of his disability.the district court rejected southwest argument that carmona had failed to produce substantial evidence that he was qualified for his job within the meaning of the ada.final judgment that he take nothing by his suit was issued on october.carmona timely filed notice of appeal on november.
discussion 
on appeal,carmona argues that the district court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law to southwest on his ada claim.he argues that,should we agree that the district court erred in overturning the jury verdict,we must also find that the district court erred by failing to reinstate him.he also argues that the district court erred in failing to grant a continuance so that ilgen could be compelled to testify.southwest disputes each of carmona assignments of error.furthermore,although southwest argues that the district court judgment as a matter of law was correct,southwest contends that the district court erred in its analysis of this issue by finding that carmona had presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that he was qualified for his job within the meaning of the ada.
judgment as a matter of law on carmona ada claim 
in order to hold southwest liable for discrimination under the ada,carmona needed to establish that he was an individual with a disability within the meaning of the ada,that he was a qualified individual for his job,despite his disability,and that he was discharged because of his disability.see.in order to survive a motion for judgment as a matter of law,he needed to produce enough evidence in support of each of these elements to allow a reasonable jury to find in his favor.see,eeoc du pont de nemours,cir.

individual with a disability 
carmona needed to establish that he was an individual with a disability within the meaning of the ada in order to qualify for protection under its provisions.see a.in order to establish that he had a disability,carmona needed to show that he had 
a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limit ed one or more major life activities 
b a record of such an impairment or 
c was regarded as having such an impairment.see emphasis in original.
the united states supreme court adopted a strict interpretation of this definition in the cases of sutton united airlines,and toyota motor manufacturing,kentucky,williams.sutton,d,superseded by statute,ada amendments act of,stat.williams,d,superseded by statute,ada amendments act of,stat.in sutton,the court held that the mitigating effects of medications had to be taken into account in determining whether or not a person was substantially limited in performing a major life activity.sutton.at.in williams,the court held that the phrase substantially limited precluded impairments that interfered with major life activities in only minor ways from qualifying as disabilities under the ada.williams.at.williams also noted that major life activities are those activities which are of central importance to daily life,such as walking,seeing,and hearing.id.
the district court found that,although carmona had presented sufficient evidence that he had an impairment that affected his major life activities of sleeping,standing,and walking,he had not presented sufficient evidence that this impairment was substantially limiting.the district court reached its conclusion in part because it found that our holding in waldrip general electric,cir,controlled carmona case.the district court interpreted waldrip as standing for the proposition that impairments that cause temporary,intermittent limitations of major life activities are not substantially limiting as a matter of law.
shortly before carmona case went to trial,congress amended the ada in order to correct what it viewed as an overly restrictive interpretation of the statute terms that had been adopted by the supreme court in sutton and williams.see ada amendments act of,stat.these amendments would be very favorable to carmona case if they are applicable,because they make it easier for a plaintiff with an episodic condition like carmona to establish that he is an individual with a disability.see id.carmona argued unsuccessfully in the district court that the district court needed to interpret the ada definition of disability in light of the meaning adopted by these amendments.
on appeal,carmona again contends that we must interpret the terms of the ada in light of the meaning adopted by the ada amendments act of adaaa.he also argues that,even if we decline to interpret the ada in light of these amendments,he presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that he was an individual with a disability under the old standards established by sutton and williams.
we begin our analysis by addressing carmona argument that we should interpret the ada definition of disability in light of the recent amendments.we have already addressed this issue generally.in eeoc agro distribution,llc,we stated that the adaaa did not apply retroactively,cir.carmona contends in his brief that he is not arguing for retroactive application of the amendments.instead,he argues that supreme court precedent establishes that s ubsequent legislation declaring the intent of an earlier law is entitled to great weight when it comes to statutory construction,citing nlrb bell aerospace,red lion broadcasting fcc,and glidden zdanok for support.bell aerospace,d,overruled on other grounds by nlrb hendricks county rural membership,d red lion broadcasting,d glidden,d.these cases are not on point.in bell aerospace and red lion broadcasting,the meaning of the statutes at issue before the supreme court had not been definitively established by the court in any of its prior opinions.see bell aerospace.at red lion broadcasting.at.thus,the subsequent legislation at issue in these cases did not involve a congressional overturning of settled supreme court precedent.each case involved a situation in which the court examined a statute and established its definitive interpretation for the first time.
in glidden,the and congresses had passed legislation that disagreed with a line of supreme court cases that had held that earlier congresses had not established the united states court of customs and patent appeals or the united states court of claims as article iii courts.glidden.at.in reviewing the and congresses legislation,the supreme court stated that,in judging for itself whether or not the precedent in question had been correctly decided,it was proper to give some weight to the later congresses interpretation of the earlier congresses intent in establishing the courts.id.at.ultimately,however,the supreme court stated that it was not bound by the and the congresses interpretation,because the case involved a constitutional question.id.the presence of a constitutional question gave the court the power to invalidate the later congresses desired interpretation.therefore,as in bell aerospace and red lion broadcasting,the court had yet to render a definitive interpretation of the statute at issue in glidden when it decided to give some weight to the later congresses interpretation.
carmona case is different,because the supreme court established the definitive interpretation of the ada definition of disability in sutton and williams.this interpretation was later partially overruled by the adaaa,but until the adaaa went into effect,all lower courts remained bound by the supreme court settled interpretation.the effective date of the adaaa was january.this case was filed,tried,and decided before then.therefore,in order for us to depart from the supreme court settled interpretation,we would need to find that congress intended the adaaa to apply retroactively.we have already declined to do that.see agro distribution,llc,at.accordingly,we must apply the supreme court definition of disability.
carmona only claims to have established that he was an individual with a disability under prong a of the ada definition of disability.see.specifically,he asserts that he submitted sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that his psoriasis and his psoriatic arthritis substantially limited his major life activities of sleeping,walking,and standing.we do not address carmona arguments that he presented sufficient evidence that he was substantially limited in the major life activities of sleeping and standing,because we find that he presented sufficient evidence that he was substantially limited in the major life activity of walking.
carmona testified that his psoriatic arthritis made him unable to walk when it.he stated that,when that happens i just stay immobile wherever i am.or if i do move,i crawl around it quite painful.he testified that these could occur as often as twice in the same week.this testimony was corroborated by documents entered into evidence by both carmona and southwest that contained medical evaluations of carmona condition that were made and signed by carmona physician,tom roark roark.in these documents,roark stated that carmona needed to be granted intermittent fmla leave,because he would be incapacitated three to four times every month for three to four days at a time.
the district court found that this evidence was insufficient to establish that carmona was substantially limited in the major life activity of walking for both factual and legal reasons.southwest echoes these arguments on appeal.we will examine the factual reasons first.
the district court reasoned that carmona had undermined his own factual evidence of disability by testifying that he had not declared himself disabled when he applied to work for southwest in,his symptoms were mostly on his skin,his symptoms were eased by medication,he was able to ride his bike,shop,cook,walk,stand,and perform other tasks,and after his termination,he went to work for jet blue and dillard without missing any scheduled work.we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to carmona while evaluating these arguments.see palasota,at.
arguments and are flawed,because they fail to distinguish between carmona psoriasis and his psoriatic arthritis.carmona never alleged that his psoriasis impaired his ability to walk.carmona had psoriasis when he went to work for southwest in,but he did not develop psoriatic arthritis until.therefore,there was no reason for him to disclose that he was disabled when he applied for his job with southwest in.similarly,when carmona testified that his symptoms of psoriasis were mostly on the skin,he was describing the symptoms of his psoriasis,not his psoriatic arthritis.
as to argument,it does not necessarily follow from the fact that carmona symptoms were eased by taking medication that he was no longer substantially limited in his ability to walk.the jury rationally could have concluded that,even with his medication,carmona was still substantially limited in his ability to walk during the of his psoriatic arthritis.see eeoc phillips chem,cir individuals who take medication or use corrective devices to lessen an impairment but still remain substantially limited as to one or more major life activities are still disabled under the ada.
argument is the product of selective quotation.in its opinion,the district court stated that carmona testified he was able to live by himself without assistance,take care of himself,read,drive,ride his bike,shop,cook,walk,and stand,most of the time.southwest took this a step further in its brief,omitting most of the time and stating that carmona is able to drive,read,ride his bike,go shopping,and cook,and lives by himself and is able to care for himself.carmona actual testimony was that 
by counsel for southwest do you still live by yourself 
by carmona yes,i do.
and you were able to take care of yourself,correct 
for the most part,yes.
q.you were able to read,to drive,to ride your bike,and shop and cook 
on good days,yes.
and most of the time,you able to walk and stand,correct 
on good days,yes.emphasis added.
every one of carmona responses was qualified in a manner that was consistent with the rest of his testimony.nothing in this testimony refuted his claim that his periodic of psoriatic arthritis substantially limited his ability to walk.
argument,that carmona evidence of disability was undermined by his admission that he had not missed any work because of his condition while he was employed by jet blue or dillard,has more merit.it seems strange that an employee who was medically excused from work for up to fifteen days a month at one job would have a perfect attendance record at his next job.however,carmona jobs at jet blue and dillard could reasonably be found materially different in presently relevant respects from his job at southwest.at dillard,carmona job was performed entirely while seated at a desk.although carmona testified that sitting aggravated his condition,he never contended that his psoriatic arthritis substantially limited his ability to sit.thus,the jury reasonably could have concluded that he was able to work this job during his,even if getting to and from the job was extremely painful.at jet blue,carmona worked as a customer service agent,which required him to stand behind a desk,meet flights on the jet way,and check baggage.although this job required him to stand,it involved minimal amounts of walking.jet blue did not allow him to work this job for more than twelve hours a week.under these facts,and mindful of the rule that we must view them in the light most favorable to carmona,we find that the jury rationally could have concluded that carmona was able to work for jet blue despite being substantially limited in his ability to walk,because he could tolerate the pain long enough to make it through a day as a customer service agent.
the district court and southwest also argue that carmona failed to produce sufficient evidence to establish that he was disabled as a matter of law,because our case law holds that intermittent can not be considered substantially limiting.the case cited for this proposition by both southwest and the district court is waldrip.at.however,waldrip involved a situation in which the plaintiff doctor testified that,at most,he occasionally must miss a few days of work when his chronic pancreatitis flares up.id.at emphasis added.the occasional in waldrip and the frequent,recurrent that carmona experiences are substantially different situations,though both could be described as intermittent.in waldrip,the plaintiff occasional did not substantially limit any of his major life activities,because they were so few and far between.see id.carmona spends anywhere from about to about of each month unable to walk without excruciating pain.it would be difficult to argue that this does not substantially limit his ability to walk.
the combination of carmona testimony and the medical records including roark opinion as to carmona impaired ability to walk submitted with his application for fmla certification provided sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that carmona was an individual with a disability within the meaning of the ada,because it allowed a reasonable jury to conclude that he had an impairment,psoriatic arthritis,that substantially limited his major life activity of walking.the district court erred in holding otherwise.
qualified individual 
in addition to establishing that he was an individual with a disability,carmona needed to establish that he was qualified for his job within the meaning of the ada.see a.the ada defines a qualified individual with a disability as 
an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.for the purposes of this subchapter,consideration shall be given to the employer judgment as to what functions of a job are essential,and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job,this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.
southwest argues that carmona could not have established that he was qualified for his job because precedent from our circuit holds that regular attendance is a necessary qualification for most jobs,and carmona disability prevented him from attending his job regularly.see generally smith lattimore materials,d,aff,app x cir reporting on time and regular attendance is an essential function of any job.
the district court disagreed with southwest,finding that the evidence introduced at trial was sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that flight attendants schedules at southwest were extremely flexible.therefore,the district court reasoned that,while regular attendance might be a requirement of most jobs,it was not a requirement of carmona position at southwest.
we are sympathetic to the argument that carmona was not qualified to be a flight attendant at southwest because his disability prevented him from showing up for work on scheduled days.although the evidence showed that southwest flight attendants have nearly unlimited discretion in determining when and how often they want to work,it did not show that they may skip the days they have scheduled at will.
however,we do not think that southwest can establish that it was unreasonable for the jury to find that carmona was qualified for his job.there is no dispute that carmona was able to perform the essential functions of his job as a flight attendant when he showed up to work.the dispute is over whether or not his irregular attendance made him unqualified.even if we assume that attendance was an essential function of carmona job southwest own measure of whether or not a flight attendant attendance was adequate was its attendance policy,which was extremely lenient.carmona managed to stay within the bounds of this policy for seven years,despite his irregular attendance,and despite his disability.therefore,we do not think that his disability made him unqualified for his job,even though it often caused him to miss work.
southwest also contends that carmona violation of the attendance policy in june made him unqualified for his job.we disagree with this contention as well.the fact that carmona supervisors determined that he had exceeded twelve points was evidence that his attendance was inadequate and thus that he was unqualified for his job.but,as we discuss in detail below,carmona introduced evidence that other flight attendants who had also exceeded twelve points were not discharged.based on this evidence,the jury reasonably could have concluded that carmona attendance,although inadequate under southwest written policy,would have been deemed adequate under the unwritten policy that was actually in effect,had he not been discriminated against for being disabled.therefore,even if the jury concluded that carmona had violated southwest written attendance policy,it could have reasonably found that he was nevertheless qualified for his job under the unwritten policy that was actually in effect.
accordingly,we hold that the jury reasonably could have found that carmona was a qualified person with a disability within the meaning of the ada.
discriminated against because of his disability 
the final element carmona needed to establish in order to prevail on his ada claim was that southwest discriminated against him because of his disability when it terminated him.see a.once an employer has produced sufficient evidence to support a nondiscriminatory explanation for its decision to terminate an employee,the employee may establish that he was the victim of intentional discrimination by showing that the employer proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.reeves sanderson plumbing,d quoting texas of community affairs burdine,d.i t is permissible for the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of discrimination from the falsity of the employer explanation.reeves.at emphasis in original.
southwest asserted at trial that it had fired carmona for violating its attendance policy.carmona introduced evidence in the
