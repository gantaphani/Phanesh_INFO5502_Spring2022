plaintiffs coalition for equal rights,coalition and shari warren,spirit keeper,appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the governor of the state of colorado and other colorado state officials on plaintiffs claims challenging the constitutionality of colorado clean indoor air act.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm.
the colorado clean indoor air act 
on march,the colorado legislature enacted,and bill owens signed into law,the colorado clean indoor air act ccia,et.by its own terms,the ccia became effective on july.
the colorado legislature offered the following rationale for enacting the ccia 
the general assembly hereby finds and determines that it is in the best interest of the people of this state to protect nonsmokers from involuntary exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in most indoor areas open to the public,public meetings,food service establishments,and places of employment.the general assembly further finds and determines that a balance should be struck between the health concerns of nonconsumers of tobacco products and the need to minimize unwarranted governmental intrusion into,and regulation of,private spheres of conduct and choice with respect to the use or nonuse of tobacco products in certain designated public areas and in private places.therefore,the general assembly hereby declares that the purpose of the ccia is to preserve and improve the health,comfort,and environment of the people of this state by limiting exposure to tobacco smoke.
legislative declaration.
consistent with this legislative declaration,the ccia provides that,in order to reduce the levels of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke,smoking shall not be permitted and no person shall smoke in any indoor area.the ccia expressly exempts from this general prohibition a variety of indoor areas including,of relevance here,airport smoking concession s,id.f,which it defines as 
a bar or restaurant,or both,in a public airport with regularly scheduled domestic and international commercial passenger flights,in which bar or restaurant smoking is allowed in a fully enclosed and independently ventilated area by the terms of the concession.
in addition to its general prohibition on smoking in indoor areas,the ccia also makes it unlawful for a person who owns,manages,operates,or otherwise controls the use of any indoor premises subject to the ccia to violate any provision of the ccia,and a person to smoke in an area where smoking is prohibited by the ccia.violations of these provisions are considered class petty offense s under colorado law and are penalized with escalating fines from to.id.

on june,plaintiffs coalition and warren filed this action against the governor of the state of colorado and other colorado state officials challenging the constitutionality of the ccia.in pertinent part,plaintiffs alleged that the ccia violated their rights under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution and their right to equal protection implicit in the due process clause of the colorado constitution because it prohibited indoor smoking in the establishments owned,operated serviced by plaintiffs,yet granted an exemption from the prohibition to airport smoking concessions the parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment,and,on october,the district court issued an order denying plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,granting defendants motion for summary judgment,and dismissing the action.
in their appeal,plaintiffs challenge the district court grant of summary judgment on their equal protection claims we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.keenan,cir.likewise,we review de novo challenges to the constitutionality of a statute.id.at.
the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment mandates that n o state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.const.amend.xiv.this provision creates no substantive rights,and instead embodies a general rule that states must treat like cases alike but may treat unlike cases accordingly.vacco quill,d.in other words,t he equal protection clause does not forbid classifications.it simply keeps governmental decisionmakers from treating differently persons who are in all relevant respects alike.nordlinger hahn,d.
unless a statute being challenged on equal protection grounds jeopardizes exercise of a fundamental right or categorizes on the basis of an inherently suspect characteristic,it will be presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest,city of cleburne cleburne living,d.moreover,the supreme court,by its own admission,allows the states wide latitude w hen social or economic legislation is at issue,and ha s been most likely to apply rational basis review to hold a law unconstitutional under the equal protection clause where the challenged legislation inhibits personal relationships,lawrence texas,d,concurring.
in light of these principles,it is beyond dispute that the state of colorado must be afforded wide latitude in its decision to distinguish between the establishments owned,operated,serviced by plaintiffs and the airport smoking concessions that are currently exempted from the ccia.the ccia involves social legislation,does not jeopardize the exercise of any fundamental rights,and in no way categorizes on the basis of inherently suspect characteristics.see castaways backwater caf√©.dep t of bus.prof l regulations,cir reaching same conclusion with respect to florida clean indoor air act.
the district court concluded,and we agree,that the state of colorado has offered a rational basis for its distinction between airport smoking concessions and the establishments owned,operated,serviced by plaintiffs.to begin with,the state notes that all qualifying airport smoking concessions under the ccia are located within the denver international airport dia because it is the only airport within the state of colorado that offers regularly scheduled domestic and international commercial passenger flights.in turn,the state notes that,in contrast to the patrons of plaintiffs establishments,the vast majority of dia visitors are nonresidents of colorado,in the state for only a few minutes or hours while waiting for a connecting flight.aple.br.at.further,the state notes,those dia visitors who are smokers would,without the availability of airport smoking concessions,have no options as to where they can smoke,id.at,because they have no real opportunity or ability to travel to a location outside the dia area,id.at.this obviously contrasts with most,if not all,of the patrons of plaintiffs establishments,who,even with the enactment of the ccia,have various options as to where they can smoke.lastly,the state notes that the smoking lounges at dia,in contrast to plaintiffs establishments,are owned and operated by the city and county of denver,a home rule city and county that has independent authority to take action to protect the public from secondhand smoke in facilities,which it has done.id.at citing denver municipal code,et.
in their appeal,plaintiffs do not seriously dispute any of these bases for distinction.instead,they contend the district court erred by applying a toothless and,in fact,erroneous rational basis test in analyzing and rejecting their equal protection claims.aplt.br.at.more precisely,plaintiffs complain that the district court examined only whether the distinctions drawn by the colorado legislature in the ccia were irrational and comple
