jennifer locane locane filed a petition for compensation under the national childhood vaccine injury act vaccine act,to,alleging that she suffered crohn disease as a direct result of hepatitis b vaccination.special master christian moran denied the claim,finding locane disease began before her vaccination and finding that locane failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the vaccine caused or significantly aggravated her disease.see locane sec y of health human.because the court of federal claims claims court correctly concluded that the special master decision was not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,we affirm.
background 
locane was born on july.she was adopted and does not know the medical history of her biological family.through age ten,locane had typical childhood illnesses and injuries and maintained an average growth rate,with height and weight in the fiftieth percentile for children her age.however,in early adolescence locane growth rate began to diminish.at thirteen she was in the percentile for height and fifteenth percentile for weight,and one year later she fell to the tenth percentile for weight although she remained in the percentile for height.
on august,her pediatrician,tanis,did a routine examination necessary for her participation in high school athletics and administered the first of three doses of hepatitis b vaccine.within two weeks,locane suffered stomach cramps,loose stools,nausea,and decreased appetite.her discomfort persisted,and on november,when locane returned to see her pediatrician she weighed four pounds less than she had in august and was diagnosed with a virus.ten days later,locane returned to her pediatrician because there was blood in her stool and she had lost more weight.tanis concluded locane had either crohn disease or ulcerative colitis and referred her to tano,a pediatric gastroenterologist.
tano noted locane weight placed her below the fifth percentile for children her age.tano opined that locane was suffering from inflammatory bowel disease and recommended she go to the hospital.after a series of tests that showed results consistent with crohn disease,she was prescribed prednisone a steroid and discharged from the hospital on december.
on december,locane was given her second dose of the hepatitis b vaccine,as well as other vaccinations,without any adverse effects.her prednisone prescription was adjusted over the next few weeks as her condition seemingly improved.locane received her third dose of the hepatitis b vaccine on february.shortly thereafter her condition deteriorated.in response,tano increased her prednisone prescription on march.
locane filed her petition in the claims court on august,but development of the case was put on hold as the parties attempted to establish a mechanism for cases involving the hepatitis b vaccine.a special master was assigned to the case on february,and expert testimony was heard on april.
locane argued that the hepatitis b vaccine caused her crohn disease caused significant aggravation to her condition.locane testified that she had no intestinal problems before her august hepatitis b vaccination.she attributed the fact that she had no reaction to the second vaccination in december to her high dosage of prednisone at the time.locane described the consequences of her crohn disease,which included multiple protracted hospital visits throughout college.
as a preliminary step,the special master held that it was necessary to resolve when locane crohn disease began.ultimately,the special master concluded that the preponderance of the evidence proved locane had crohn disease before her august vaccination and therefore the vaccination could not have caused her crohn disease.
bellanti,locane expert,is a professor of immunology.bellanti testified that there is a clear temporal relationship between the hepatitis vaccination and locane development of crohn disease,and that theoretically a vaccination could cause crohn disease.
the secretary of health and human services expert,warner,is a clinical professor who specializes in crohn disease.warner dismissed the temporal relationship between receipt of the hepatitis b vaccine and the diagnosis of crohn disease as coincidental.instead,warner pointed to locane reduced growth velocity,as evidenced in her growth charts,as an indication that she had crohn disease prior to receiving the hepatitis b vaccine.warner explained that a reduction in growth velocity is commonly the first sign of crohn disease seen in the pediatric population,with gastrointestinal symptoms manifesting at a later date.locane.at.on cross examination,bellanti recognized that a decrease in growth velocity may be the first sign of crohn disease.id.at.
the special master deemed warner testimony more persuasive than bellanti given the extent of warner experience and expertise with crohn disease and given that his testimony was consistent with the medical literature 
the special master found that petitioner offered little response to warner opinion that petitioner weight velocity decreased prior to her crohn diagnosis the special master explained that petitioner argument that her health was normal because she was a petite child and lost only a few pounds from age of eleven to thirteen was not supported by the relevant measure,which is the rate of change,not the absolute weight.
id.the special master gave credit to warner explanation that locane treating doctors failed to diagnose her crohn disease until after the vaccinations because it is easy to miss the subtle early symptoms.the special master found that because the average delay in diagnosis was months,locane month lapse between her growth velocity decreasing and her gastrointestinal symptoms was not out of the ordinary having found locane disease began before her vaccination,the special master held that the vaccine could not have caused the disease and an analysis under althen was unnecessary.see althen sec y of health human,summarizing the elements necessary to show by preponderant evidence that the vaccination brought about a petitioner injury.
the special master then determined that locane failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that she was entitled to compensation under the significant aggravation theory because the course of her disease was not affected by the vaccination.the special master found that in symptoms are part of the normal course of the disease,that locane did not have an adverse reaction to the second vaccination dose,and that she experienced throughout college that were not preceded by a hepatitis b vaccination.therefore,the special master found locane did not show that her condition was worse than it would have been but for the vaccination.
on review,the claims court affirmed,concluding that the special master factual finding that the onset of locane crohn disease occurred prior to her hepatitis b vaccination was not arbitrary or capricious.furthermore,the claims court held that failure to conduct an analysis under althen after determining that the preponderance of evidence showed the illness predates the vaccination was not an abuse of discretion.finally,the claims court held that the special master factual finding that locane failed to prove significant aggravation was not arbitrary or capricious.
locane timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to f.
discussion 
we review an appeal from the court of federal claims in a vaccine act case de novo,applying the same standard of review as the court of federal claims applied to its review of the special master decision.broekelschen sec y of health human.we give no deference to the claims court or special master determinations of law,but uphold the special master findings of fact unless they are arbitrary or capricious.id.
to receive compensation under the vaccine act a petitioner must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the injury at issue was caused by a vaccine.a.causation is presumed if a petitioner can show that she sustained an injury in association with a vaccine listed in the vaccine injury table.c c i andreu sec y of he
