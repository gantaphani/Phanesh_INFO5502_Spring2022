daniel dobrowski appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in his family and medical leave act fmla action.he argues that notwithstanding his admitted ineligibility for the act protections,defendant jay dee contractor should be estopped from now denying his eligibility because defendant represented,prior to his taking leave,that he was eligible.although we disagree in part with the district court reasoning,we agree with its resolution equitable estoppel should not bar jay dee from raising as a defense to dobrowski fmla claim.accordingly,we affirm the grant of summary judgment.
dobrowski,a mechanical engineer,was terminated by jay dee upon returning to work from an approved leave of absence for an elective surgical procedure undergone to treat his epilepsy.he was hired by jay dee in september and assigned to a project for the detroit municipal government to rehabilitate sludge thickeners at the detroit wastewater treatment plant.dobrowski primary responsibility was evaluating,coordinating,and processing requests from,which required portions of the wastewater plant to be turned off for completion of the tasks.
dobrowski has been diagnosed with epilepsy since he was a child.even though he took regular medication and underwent various treatments to control his disease,dobrowski continued to have seizures as an adult.about six months prior to his october surgery,dobrowski,in consultation with his physician,decided to explore additional treatment options,ultimately settling on a surgical option.in,his doctor cleared him for the surgery and scheduled it for october.
at that time,dobrowski informed jay dee that he had scheduled the surgery in a meeting with his supervisor,mekkaoui.he explained,i got the okay and so i will be having surgery on this date.all parties appeared to have assumed that jay dee would grant him time off for the operation,but dobrowski conversations with his superiors over the next months did not eliminate all confusion over the amount of leave required.on september,dobrowski sent an email to jay dee president,tom diponio,captioned leave of absence that identified his operation coming up.he explained how much work he could miss depending on the many ways this procedure could end up and indicated that he thought with all the information provided,a small meeting would clear things up.
following that meeting between dobrowski,diponio,and makkaoui discussing the surgery and leave,diponio gave a dobrowski a form headed application for leave of absence under the fmla.dobrowski filled out the form and returned it,dated september.on october,diponio wrote to dobrowski,memorializing the decision as to dobrowski leave.the letter indicated that dobrowski was to take a week of paid vacation beginning october,have the surgery on october,and that p ursuant to the family and medical leave act,jay dee contractors,will leave dobrowski position open for at least twelve weeks from october.diponio included with the letter the federal department of labor employer response to employee request for family or medical leave form that summarized dobrowski application,indicated that he was an eligible employee,and confirmed that the company was providing him with fmla leave.it also stated that dobrowski was to receive short term disability benefits from his insurance company,and that jay dee would supplement the insurance payments up to the level of his present salary.
within four weeks after the surgery,dobrowski decided that he could resume work and contacted diponio on november,about scheduling his return.they apparently agreed that,provided he receive his doctor consent,dobrowski would return in early december.on december,dobrowski called diponio and left him a voicemail indicating that he would have the letter on the following monday,december.dobrowski reported to jay dee headquarters on that day and met with diponio.
it was then that diponio informed dobrowski that he was being terminated.diponio explained that jay dee work at the wastewater plant was winding down and they no longer needed dobrowski services.dobrowski inquired about a transfer,but diponio said that none of the company other projects needed an additional engineer.when asked why jay dee did not communicate its decision earlier,diponio responded why so you could stay on medical leave 
dobrowski then sued in state court,alleging a violation of the michigan handicapper civil rights act.he later amended his complaint to include a claim under the fmla,and jay dee removed the case to federal court.the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim and remanded it to state court.
following discovery,jay dee moved for summary judgment,arguing that dobrowski was not eligible for fmla protection because jay dee employed fewer than employees within miles of dobrowski work site and he was not entitled to reinstatement because his job was eliminated from the project.in response,dobrowski argued that the doctrine of equitable estoppel applied to prevent jay dee from denying his eligibility after having indicated to him at the time of his surgery that he was eligible,and that the record established a material dispute of fact as to the second ground.the district court rejected these arguments,and granted summary judgment on each ground.
this timely appeal followed.
the question on summary judgment is whether the moving party has demonstrated that the evidence available to the court establishes no genuine issue of material fact such that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we draw all justifiable inferences in the light most favorable to the party,matsushita indus,zenith radio,d,and review the district court decision de novo.smith,cir.because we resolve the eligibility dispute in jay dee favor,we will not discuss the district court alternative ground for granting summary judgment.
all now agree that dobrowski was not in fact eligible for fmla protection because jay dee did not have the requisite employees within miles of the wastewater worksite.instead,the dispute centers on whether jay dee statements that dobrowski was being given fmla leave now bind the defendant under the doctrine of equitable estoppel such that we should treat him as entitled to the act protections 
our circuit recognizes that in certain circumstances equitable estoppel applies to employer statements regarding an employee fmla eligibility,preventing the employer from raising as a defense see sorrell rinker materials,cir remanding for the district court to consider whether an employer is estopped from denying its employee eligibility see also davis.bell telephone,cir holding that the plaintiff could not establish the basis for equitable estoppel mutchler dunlap memorial,cir same wilkerson autozone,cir endorsing a district court use of an equitable estoppel jury instruction.but our precedents do not make clear precisely which situations merit the application of equitable estoppel.we have cited two different equitable estoppel rules in fmla cases.
when we first recognized equitable estoppel in an fmla case,we collected decisions from other courts of appeals to support the proposition that under the right circumstances,an employer may be equitably estopped from challenging an employee entitlement to fmla leave.sorrell at citing duty proppants,cir kosakow new rochelle radiology,cir dormeyer comerica,cir.we provided no additional discussion of those circumstances,but two of the cited cases duty and kosakow that elaborated on them relied on the supreme court decision in heckler community health services of crawford county,d.see,kosakow,at.there,the supreme court,commenting that the core principles of the doctrine are tolerably clear,adopted the restatement of torts statement of the rule
