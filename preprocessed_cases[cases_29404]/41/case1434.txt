in january,jerome coppage,the of abs,contacted christopher lee,vice president of sales for advancepcs.coppage described an opportunity for advancepcs to be the pbm for a plan to be offered to american automobile association aaa members.he represented that abs could deliver aaa to advancepcs,ex at.over the next several months,lee and abs communicated regarding a proposal to meet aaa requirements.at some point during this process,abs contacted advancepcs and represented that aaa wished to meet and undertake further negotiations for pbm services.abs arranged a meeting between lee and aaa to occur on may.
on may,at the request of coppage,and in apparent anticipation of the upcoming meeting with aaa,lee sent a letter to abs confirming advancepcs intent to work with abs to secure a contract with aaa.on may,immediately before the scheduled meeting with aaa,lee met with coppage and jack bestrom,a consultant to abs,in a hotel near aaa headquarters.bestrom had drafted,by hand,a contract between abs and advancepcs,but had been unable to complete a typed version of it prior to meeting with lee and therefore abandoned the project.see,ex at.instead,bestrom told lee that abs would need a document acknowledging that,if advancepcs became aaa pbm,advancepcs was willing to pay to abs commissions of per prescription filled at a retail store and per prescription filled by mail.bestrom further told lee that advancepcs would not be allowed to meet with abs client,aaa,until lee gave abs such a document,ex at.because the men had an appointment with aaa that very afternoon and,therefore,time was short,lee edited the may,letter to coppage to include a reference to the commission as requested by bestrom.the men then drove to a nearby kinko to print the letter.as modified,this may,letter reads,in full

ex the letter was printed on advancepcs letterhead and included lee electronic signature.according to coppage deposition testimony,coppage himself signed the letter several days later,at home,and included a notation reading accepted and agreed this day of may,by association benefit services,ex at,ex coppage then forwarded the letter to robert blixt,the ceo of abs.lee later stated,in his affidavit submitted in support of summary judgment for advancepcs,that he modified the letter to include the commission structure based on his understanding that abs was a consultant to aaa and that the revenue sharing fees requested by aaa,as abs client,would cover the commissions to abs,ex at.after the men left kinko,lee,bestrom and coppage met with representatives of aaa.
abs claims that,in reliance on the letter,it not only facilitated the introduction to aaa and participated in the may,meeting but,over the course of the ensuing months,also assisted advancepcs in formulating a successful proposal to become aaa pbm.abs also claims that,in reliance on the letter,it did not work with rival pbms to develop proposals for aaa business.
advancepcs claims that,in the course of the development of the final proposal for aaa,abs agreed to adjust its own fees to ensure the deal went through.all parties also acknowledge that advancepcs would have been under no obligation to pay abs were it not for the successful completion of the agreement.documents in the record,generated by both advancepcs and abs,indicate that fee and compensation adjustments were topics of discussion in late may.these discussions took place after the meeting with aaa,and thus after lee letter was drafted.in particular,blixt sent a conference call agenda to lee listing compensation adjustments to abs as one of several topics of discussion,ex lee sent an email in june detailing a revised offer to aaa,including in commissions to abs,ex 
also in june,lee sent a letter to representatives of aaa that detailed a proposed division of responsibilities between aaa,abs and advancepcs in the pharmacy card program.notably,the letter laid out a full page of responsibilities for abs,which included marketing the program to aaa members and traveling to assist local clubs in implementing and utilizing the program.all these services were to be provided at the expense of abs,ex k at.several days later,lee sent an email to bestrom and blixt,apparently reiterating information recently garnered from aaa abs was neither aaa consultant nor its agent and that aaa would not sign a agreement or pay anything to abs,ex on june,yet another email followed from lee to bestrom,blixt and coppage,this one stating,in pertinent part 
i was reading through my old files this week and need to sic the letter dated may to jerry re aaa.in that letter i offered that we would pay abs per claim while we managed the aaa account.this does make any sense any more in light of our negotiations.i just want to point out that this is not in effect as we do have any negotiated agreement with aaa or abs.it is too big a deal,but i just wanted to clarify things.the contract that we sign with all and with aaa will reflect all the accurate financials and obligations.
advancepcs contends that,in the course of these ongoing negotiations,lee offered commissions of from advancepcs to abs,and abs verbally accepted.the parties rely upon no record evidence in which abs directly responded to these gradually decreasing commission levels in particular,in response to advancepcs submission of documents suggesting that abs was willing to adjust commissions,abs relies on no record evidence to demonstrate any continuing insistence upon the commission levels stated in the may,letter.
advancepcs eventually offered abs a written contract including the commissions,which abs rejected,ex at.advancepcs and aaa entered into a contract for prescription benefit services in october.
district court proceedings 
in march,abs instituted this action against advancepcs now caremarkpcs and caremark rx in the circuit court of cook county,illinois.the complaint alleged various tort theories of recovery against the defendants arising out of their conduct in arriving at the aaa agreement.the defendants removed the action to the northern district of illinois on the ground of diversity of citizenship.in the district court,the claims eventually were amended to include fraud,breach of contract and unjust enrichment.caremark filed motions for summary judgment on all counts the district court granted the motions in their entirety on september.
abs first alleged that advancepcs was liable for fraud.abs claimed that the may letter and other statements made by lee were misrepresentations intended to induce abs to forego negotiations with other pbms and assist advancepcs exclusively in obtaining a contract with aaa.in analyzing this claim,the district court set out the standard for fraud under illinois law the defendant made a false statement of material fact,known or believed by the defendant to be false when made,with the intent to induce action by the plaintiff,and which did in fact induce such action,resulting in damages.at.the court further stated that promissory fraud,that is,fraud in which the defendant misrepresents his own intent regarding his future conduct in order to induce reliance on the part of the plaintiff,is actionable in illinois only if part of a scheme to defraud.illinois courts,the district court stated,have placed a deliberately high burden on plaintiffs in claims for promissory fraud.id.at citing bower jones,cir.
evaluating the parties summary judgment submissions,the district court concluded that abs had failed to carry its burden with respect to the first element of a promissory fraud claim a false representation of intent to fulfill the promise at the time the promise was made.in support of this element,abs had submitted facts demonstrating advancepcs actual of the obligations set out in the may letter.essentially,abs sought to prove lack of intent ab initio as a reasonable inference drawn from advancepcs ultimate failure to perform.the district court concluded that this theory constituted a wholly circular argument,insufficient to create a material fact as to the intent of advancepcs on may.the only additional evidence in the record on the element of fraudulent intent,the court found,was testimony of blixt that merely opined that,upon reflection,he did not believe advancepcs had any intention of fulfilling the agreement.id.at citing,ex at.the court held that the subjective speculation of an abs officer was insufficient to raise an issue of fact,and granted summary judgment on the fraud claim.id.at.
breach of contract 
abs also claimed that the may letter was a contract between the parties that advancepcs had breached.the court examined numerous alternative arguments of abs on its contract claim that the letter itself was an enforceable contract that the letter was an offer,and that abs accepted the offer or,that the letter was an acceptance of a prior verbal offer by abs to advancepcs.
the district court began its analysis of abs contract claim by stating that a party can not prove a breach of contract without first demonstrating that a valid and enforceable contractual obligation exists.id.at.on the facts before it,the court held that no reasonable jury could conclude that the may letter was an enforceable contract because it lacked essential,definite and certain terms.specifically,the court noted that illinois law required a contract to evidence a sufficiently concrete expression of the essential terms of the agreement and the parties intent to be bound.id.the district court determined that one of the essential terms required under illinois law was mutuality of obligation.id.citing kraftco kolbus,d.
evaluating abs alternative argument that the letter was an offer,the district court found no evidence that coppage delayed signature accepted the offer because no evidence in the record supported the conclusion that this purported acceptance was ever communicated to advancepcs.id.at.the court further rejected abs assertion that it had accepted the letter in the offer by performance when it introduced lee to the aaa representatives.specifically,the court concluded that,because the claimed obligation of advancepcs would occur only if advancepcs secured a contract with aaa,the introduction was insufficient performance to constitute an acceptance.moreover,the court thought it significant that coppage had believed it necessary to sign the letter in order to create an enforceable agreement,and that this fact undermined abs contention that it had agreed to a contract by its act of escorting advancepcs into aaa.the court also noted that after the may letter was written and the initial introduction to aaa made,advancepcs sent at least two revised offers to abs,both of which would operate to terminate any previous unaccepted offer.therefore,the court concluded,there could be no accepted offer as a matter of law.
abs final argument on its contract claim was that the letter was advancepcs acceptance of a prior verbal offer by abs.the court characterized this argument as a attempt to show that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether a contract was formed.id.at.the court found that this theory was undermined by coppage signature and subscription a ccepted and agreed,such acceptance would have been unnecessary if the parties believed that an agreement had arisen by virtue of lee letter.
finding no merit in any of abs contentions regarding contractual obligations arising out of the may letter,the court entered summary judgment on the breach of contract claim.
unjust enrichment 
as an alternative to its breach of contract theory,abs requested a constructive trust on advancepcs profits from its aaa contract on a theory of unjust enrichment.the court outlined the circumstances under illinois law in which a plaintiff may seek a constructive trust on a benefit transferred to the defendant by a third party.it found that,of the permissible theories of recovery in these types of unjust enrichment claims,abs had alleged only that advancepcs had procured a benefit from aaa through alleged fraudulent dealings with abs.id.at citing hpi health care,vernon.the court then concluded that its ruling on the fraud claim was dispositive on this issue and granted summary judgment for advancepcs.
liability of caremark rx 
finally,the district court concluded that abs had asserted no independent misconduct by caremark rx,but sought only to hold it liable for the acts of its subsidiary,caremarkpcs as the predecessor entity,advancepcs.accordingly,the district court held that,because summary judgment was appropriate on all the substantive claims against caremarkpcs,caremark rx,as the parent corporation,also was entitled to summary judgment.
discussion 
in our de novo review of the order of the district court granting summary judgment,we must take the facts and all reasonable inferences from those facts in the light most favorable to the party,here abs.anderson liberty lobby,d.summary judgment is appropriate for caremark,as the moving party,if it demonstrates that the record shows no genuine issue as to any material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.abs may not avoid summary judgment by resting on the allegations of its pleadings it must come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.e.if the record taken as a whole could not permit a rational trier of fact to find for abs,abs has not demonstrated that a dispute of material fact exists and summary judgment must be granted to caremark.see scaife cook county,cir.finally,we may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any ground that was preserved adequately in the district court.mindgames,publ g,cir.
this is a diversity action,and therefore our duty is to apply the substantive law of illinois,as we believe the highest court of the state would apply it.state farm mut.auto.ins.pate,cir.
breach of contract 
the district court awarded summary judgment in favor of caremark on abs breach of contract claim.it concluded that abs had failed to demonstrate the existence of a valid contractual obligation sufficient to support a cause of action for breach.under illinois law,the elements of a breach of contract cause of action are offer and acceptance,consideration,definite and certain terms,performance by the plaintiff of all required conditions,breach,and damages.mc baldwin fin.dimaggio,rosario veraja,llc,d,leave to appeal denied.acknowledging that a breach of contract action must be predicated on a valid and enforceable contractual obligation,abs disputes the district court conclusion that no such obligation existed between the parties as a result of the may letter.specifically,abs contends that the letter itself constituted the binding agreement of the parties,or,in the alternative,that the letter was an offer for a contract,accepted by abs performance in making the introduction of advancepcs to aaa 
the question of the existence of a contract is a matter of law for determination by the court.arneson bd.of,mckendree,d,see also robinson christopher greater area rural health planning,d.no contract exists under illinois law,and,indeed,under principles of general law,if the agreement lacks definite and certain terms nor is a contract formed by an offer that itself lacks definite and certain material terms and does not require such terms to be supplied by an acceptance.in re marriage of murphy,d,leave to appeal denied,quinlan stouffe,d,rose mavrakis,d,see also restatement second of contracts even though a manifestation of intention is intended to be understood as an offer,it can not be accepted so as to form a contract unless the terms of the contract are reasonably certain.accordingly,if the may letter lacks the requisite definiteness or certainty,it can constitute neither a contract nor an offer sufficient to support abs breach of contract action.
the definite and certain terms requirement serves several important purposes,chief among them to ensure that the parties in fact have reached an agreement and to provide courts with a basis for enforcing the obligations that the parties sought to impose upon one another.see restatement second of contracts cmt.a b.under illinois law,a contract is sufficiently definite and certain to be enforceable if the court is enabled from the terms and provisions thereof,under proper rules of construction and applicable principles of equity,to ascertain what the parties have agreed to do.quinlan,at citing midland hotel reuben donnelley,internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added see also dilorenzo valve primer,d,a contract may be enforced even though some contract terms may be missing or left to be agreed upon,but if essential terms are so uncertain that there is no basis for deciding whether the agreement has been kept or broken,there is no contract.conversely,an agreement is not enforceable as a contract,because of its uncertainty,when any of its essential terms are left unsettled.illinois law and practice,at see also wagner excello foods,fearn int l,d,to be enforceable,a contract must show a manifestation of agreement between the parties and be definite and certain in its terms.when material terms and conditions are not ascertainable,there is no enforceable contract,even if the intent to contract is present.internal citations omitted.parties do not have an enforceable contract unless,by the terms of the agreement,a court can require the specific thing contracted for be done.hintz lazarus,d.even where the parties have manifested the intent to make a contract,failure of the definiteness and certainty requirements may make an agreement unenforceable.acad.chicago publishers cheever.
we conclude that,as a matter of illinois law,the letter of may does not contain sufficiently definite and certain terms to constitute an enforceable agreement.specifically,we conclude that,because the letter is silent on the issue of abs precise performance obligations and because those obligations are not set forth with the requisite specificity,any agreement is so lacking in its description of the exchange as to render it wholly unenforceable as a contract.
the case of academy chicago publishers cheever,is particularly instructive.in academy chicago,the supreme court of illinois provided guidance on what it considered to be essential terms,the absence of which precluded a finding of an enforceable contract.the academy chicago case arose out of a publication agreement between the widow of author john cheever and a publishing company with whom she had entered into an agreement to publish a compilation of cheever stories.the publishing agreement at issue was executed with formalities not present here,and appeared to define with some specificity the nature of the parties obligations the parties clearly intended to be bound to its terms.it had failed to define,however,certain terms about which the parties subsequently disagreed,including the length and content of the proposed book,relevant dates for delivery and style or manner of publication.the court held that those failures were sufficient to render the agreement unenforceable for lack of definiteness and certainty regarding essential terms to the agreement.the court further concluded that the trial court erred in supplying missing terms under the circumstances,where the agreement reached had major unresolved uncertainties such that it did not constitute a valid and enforceable contract to begin with.id.at.
the import of academy chicago is that it identifies how an agreement might fail as a contract for lack of definiteness and certainty under illinois law.in this case,the requisite terms are quite obviously different than those in academy chicago,but the opinion of the supreme court of illinois in that case instructs that even apparently detailed and formal agreements may fail for lack of certainty where they do not manifest mutual assent to essential obligations of the parties.those essential obligations in academy chicago were important components of the parties basic exchange of performances fees in exchange for a book publication.in the present case,by contrast,there simply is no statement whatsoever of the consideration abs will provide for the receipt of commissions.
our conclusion that the letter is so lacking in definiteness and certainty is strengthened by abs arguments before this court.in three separate places in its opening brief,abs characterized its obligations as involving more than a business introduction at oral argument,however,counsel for abs repeatedly stated that abs sole obligation was a business introduction it refused to acknowledge that any further performance was required by the contract or within the contemplation of the parties the difficulty abs faced in identifying its own contractual obligations is rooted in the fundamental deficiency in its case.because the essential terms are so uncertain that there is no basis for deciding whether the agreement has been kept or broken,there is no contract.acad.chicago publishers,at.moreover,as academy chicago suggests,we ought not,under such circumstances,supply missing terms when their pronounced absence in the original agreement demonstrates a lack of mutual assent and the absence of an enforceable contract at the outset id.it is not uncommon for a court to supply a missing material term,as the reasonable conclusion often is that the parties intended that the term be supplied by implication.however,where the subject matter of the contract has not been decided upon and there is no standard available for reasonable implication,courts ordinarily refuse to supply the missing term.
in sum,without specification of abs basic obligations,the letter as a whole is insufficiently definite it fails to reflect an agreement of the parties on the essential nature of their mutual obligations.for the same reason,we find unpersuasive abs contention that the essential term of its contractual obligations may be implied.see kraftco,at acknowledging that terms of a contract may be implied under certain circumstances,but limiting the application of that doctrine when,because of an agreement uncertainty,the court would be required to writ e the total contract for the parties.whatever the outer limits of a doctrine of implied essential terms would be under illinois law,they plainly are exceeded when the parties conduct does not provide a reasonable basis
