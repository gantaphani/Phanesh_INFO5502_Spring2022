peter kauffman came down with bronchitis and missed three days of work.when he returned to his job and asked that his absence be excused under the family and medical leave act of fmla,his employer,federal express corporation fedex,denied the request and then fired him because the lost days pulled his overall attendance record below company standards.kauffman sued,claiming that fedex,by terminating him,interfered with his substantive rights and entitlements under the fmla and violated the act or provisions.the district court granted summary judgment for fedex.we vacate and remand.in short,this case turns on whether kauffman was entitled to fmla leave on the missed days and whether,in deciding that question,the district court misread a medical certification kauffman submitted to fedex to establish his entitlement.
the essential facts are undisputed.for nearly years kauffman delivered packages for fedex in east moline,illinois.by the end of december he had accumulated two recent disciplinary strikes,one for unprofessional conduct and the other for violating the company vehicle accident policy.fedex policy allows management to terminate an employee who incurs three strikes in a period.
then,on january,and,kauffman called in sick.because he was not scheduled to work on january or,he returned to work on january.that morning before his shift began,kauffman encountered his immediate supervisor,tim crownover.he gave the supervisor a note dated january from his physician,david seitz.the note stated that kauffman may return to on.after receiving the note,crownover recommended that kauffman apply for fmla leave and gave kauffman what the supervisor said were the forms necessary to submit a fmla request,which crownover told kauffman had to be done within days.later that same day,crownover realized that the paperwork he handed kauffman was incorrect,and so he slipped the right forms into kauffman office mailbox.kauffman received those forms at six the evening of january.qualifying for fmla leave was critical to kauffman under fedex no fault attendance policy unless his three missed days were excused,he would earn a third strike for letting his attendance rate dip below the minimum during a period.
the next day,january,kauffman kept a scheduled appointment with seitz and asked him to complete the form certification of health care provider created by fedex for fmla requests.the form,similar to the model form promulgated by the department of labor,see a b,directs the provider to categorize the employee condition by choosing among a series of check boxes.the doctor,however,did not check any box but instead wrote bronchitis on a line next to the box corresponding to the following generic description incapacity of more than three days due to a serious health condition that also involves treatment two or more times by a health care provider hcp or treatment by a hcp on one occasion which results in a regimen of continuing treatment.the doctor also noted that a second appointment had been necessary on january,that kauffman could not work at all,and that leave was required for kauffman absences.finally,in response to a form question directing the provider to state both the date the condition commenced and the probable duration of the condition,seitz wrote simply.kauffman placed the completed form on his supervisor desk.
on the morning of january,the fifteenth day after giving kauffman the fmla paperwork,crownover asked kauffman for the completed certification of health care provider.kauffman replied that he turned it in earlier and offered to go home and get the supervisor another copy or have the doctor fax one,but crownover refused to wait and instead fired kauffman on the spot.crownover told kauffman that his fmla leave request was being denied as untimely because he did not have the certification in hand,and that as a consequence of the unexcused absence kauffman would incur a third strike,this time for poor attendance.crownover then handed kauffman two letters dated that day,one confirming the third strike based on kauffman attendance falling below the minimum,and the second terminating his employment because he now had three strikes within a period.
kauffman appealed his termination through fedex internal procedures.during this process fedex abandoned its position that kauffman certification was untimely.now,however,the company asserted that the certification was inadequate and thus upheld the denial of fmla leave and consequently the third strike and termination.kauffman replied to the new basis for dismissal with an addendum from seitz clarifying that his illness continued from january through january and required his absence from work.fedex refused to consider the addendum.having lost his appeal,kauffman filed suit alleging that fedex interfered with his rights under the fmla by firing him instead of granting leave due.kauffman also alleged discrimination,asserting that fedex fired him because he exercised his right to seek fmla leave.
fedex moved for summary judgment.despite having admitted in the internal appeal that kauffman fmla paperwork was not untimely,fedex argued in its summary judgment motion that it gave kauffman days to submit his paperwork but he failed to meet the deadline.without record citation,fedex explained that its policy implementing the rule was to require the return of forms no more than hours multiplied by hours after they were given to the employee.crownover gave the paperwork to kauffman at on the morning of january,so the company expected the forms back by the same time on january.fedex argued alternatively that the certification kauffman submitted was inadequate to qualify him for fmla leave.the company insisted that kauffman produced no evidence of discrimination or retaliatory discharge.
in response to fedex motion,kauffman submitted his own testimony that he left the paperwork in crownover office on january,and he also produced verification that his lawyer sent a copy of the required paperwork via facsimile a little after five on january.more to the point,kauffman adduced evidence that fedex itself determined that he was on time with his paperwork.for example,a document prepared by a fedex human resources employee,james mika,summarizes kauffman internal appeal and concludes that the decision to terminate peter was based incorrectly on the time frame in which peter had to submit the certificate of health care provider form.another distributed among fedex managers states that fedex considered reinstating kauffman before deciding to uphold the termination on alternate grounds.
additionally,kauffman submitted other exchanged between station managers that show he was disliked and that managers conspired to use his absence as an excuse to fire him.as to the first point,one characterized kauffman as an argumentative employee with a propensity for nitpicking,badgering finger pointing and for making,false,malicious,slanderous statements.as to the second,correspondence showed that when kauffman turned up missing for work,managers agreed to provide him with paperwork to apply for fmla leave.but they anticipated that he would be late with the paperwork and planned to terminate him should that occur.the managers discussed the importance of following the fmla strictly by dotting their i and crossing their t to ensure that the firing would stick.
when granting summary judgment for fedex,the district court focused on the document that lies at the heart of the case,the provider certification that kauffman provided to fedex to establish his entitlement to fmla leave.the court reasoned that the certification establishes that kauffman did not have a serious health condition qualifying him for leave.according to the court,replying with just the single date to the form compound instruction to s tate the approximate date the condition commenced and the probable duration of the condition was certifying that kauffman had been incapacitated for only one day,not the more than three days required by the statute.any other reading,the court explained,would be inconsistent with the note from the doctor office stating that kauffman could return to wor
