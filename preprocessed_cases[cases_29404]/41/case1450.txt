the defendant was indicted for defrauding indiana medicaid.the government case centered on three independent methods that davis used to get indiana medicaid to pay for procedures that they might not otherwise have paid he billed for services that were actually provided by other people,he billed for hours of work that nobody performed overbilling,and he billed for different procedures in order to avoid requirements miscoding.a jury returned a general verdict of guilty.on appeal,davis raises four issues.he challenges two evidentiary rulings,he challenges whether one of the three charged methods of actually prohibited,and he challenges the indictment as duplicitous.because we find no error,we affirm.
davis is a psychologist who operated two clinics in indiana.he was licensed as a health service provider in psychology hspp and enrolled as a provider under indiana medicaid program.the relationship between davis and indiana medicaid was fruitful medicaid soon accounted for the vast majority of his income,and the indictment alleged by september he accounted for more medicaid spending than any other individual hspp in the entire state.after an undercover investigation into his billing practices,he was indicted for one count of health care fraud in violation of 
the indictment alleged that davis used several methods to entice indiana medicaid to pay claims that it would not otherwise have paid.when the state instituted requirements for some of his procedures,he would submit claims for different that required no such.when davis billed indiana medicaid for neuropsychological testing,he would frequently and contrary to medicaid billing manuals bill for a fixed number of hours for a battery of tests,regardless of the number of hours actually consumed by the process.and,central to the dispute between the parties on appeal,davis would leave much of the administration and perhaps even the interpretation of the psychological tests to clinic staff members with less training than he himself had who were not licensed psychologists or hspps 
at trial,the government provided ample evidence of all three methods of fraud,as well as evidence that could allow a jury to infer willfulness.among its other evidence,the government introduced the testimony of an expert from indiana office of medicaid policy and planning to the effect that the state of indiana would not reimburse for services that were actually conducted by unlicensed staff members.
davis defense at trial relied almost exclusively on denying that he had a specific intent to defraud.he testified in his own defense that he had believed that all three practices were legal and in keeping with how he had been trained to conduct neuropsychological testing.he called only one other witness,a former employee,to testify about a medicaid audit that had been conducted in the late.he unsuccessfully sought to introduce into evidence an unpublished manuscript on neuropsychological testing in order to support his argument that he believed it was good medical practice to use technicians to perform some of the tests.apparently,the jury did not buy this good faith defense because it returned a general verdict of guilty.
on appeal,davis raises four issues.he argues that the testimony and jury instructions combined to allow the jury to determine questions of law regarding which procedures were and were not compensable from indiana medicaid.he argues that the scheme was not contrary to the law.he argues that the indictment was impermissibly duplicitous and that the duplicity was not corrected by the trial court through adequate jury instructions.finally,he argues that the district court decision to exclude his proffered manuscript was an abuse of discretion.
ii.analysis 
a.the legality of 
because much of this appeal turns on the question of whether is illegal under indiana medicaid regulations,we address this question first.whether the indiana statute allows is a question of law that we consider de novo.united states jones,cir citing olson risk mgmt.alternatives,cir.whether a conviction should be reversed when it is claimed for the first time on appeal that the conviction rested on an impermissible ground is a question we review for plain error.united states mckinney,cir.davis argues that his scheme falls within a broad reading of the word provided.the government argues that provided must be read to require that the services be personally provided by the hspp.
at the outset,we should note that davis defense at trial did not appear to rely in any way on a theory that was actually allowed under indiana medicaid rules.in the instances where the issue arose,it was solely within the context of whether davis might have erroneously believed that the regulations allowed him to do what he did.tr,may defense opening statement tr,may redirect of witness bowen tr,may admission of other laws to show whether defendant believed that substitute billing is permitted tr,may defense closing argument.generally,issues raised for the first time on appeal are reviewed for plain error.see united states mcclellan,cir.neither a general objection to the evidence nor a specific objection on other grounds will preserve the issue for review.united states wynn,cir citing united states laughlin,cir.
indiana rules for medicaid reimbursement for mental health services are contained in title,indiana administrative code.that section states that medicaid reimbursement is available for outpatient mental health services provided by psychologists endorsed as a health service provider in psychology hspp.outpatient mental health services rendered by a n hspp are subject to the following limitations.admin.code.one of the limitations is subject to prior authorization by the office or its designee,medicaid will reimburse for neuropsychological and psychological testing when provided by a physician or an hspp.admin.code.davis claim on appeal is that he provided the services that his staff conducted though the tests were administered by other paid the rent and utilities,trained the staff,and acquired the various licenses under which the clinics operated.he urges us to read the word provided as synonymous with furnished.we decline to do so.
although davis is accused of committing the federal crime of health care fraud,the allegation turns on whether he executed a scheme to defraud a health care benefit program.because the question of whether is a method to execute a scheme to defraud a health care benefit program depends on which procedures indiana medicaid will reimburse,our analysis requires us to interpret indiana law.the court is unable to locate,and the parties have not pointed us toward,any authority that indicates how indiana courts have interpreted this statute.it appears to be a question of first impression in this circuit and in the courts of indiana.
when interpreting statutes,we give words their plain meaning unless doing so would frustrate the overall purpose of the statutory scheme,lead to absurd results,or contravene clearly expressed legislative intent.united states vallery,cir.in this case,the plain meaning of the medicaid will reimburse for testing when provided by an hspp is that the hspp must be the person who is actually engaged in the conduct of performing the tests.any other reading would lead to absurd results.id.the logic of the argument made on appeal would have allowed davis to the rent,license the tests,staff the clinics with minimum wage technicians,and then fly to a tropical paradise and watch the money flow in.he would,arguably,still be providing the services that medicaid was buying from him,if providing were simply a synonym for furnishing.this can not be the plain meaning of the statute.
even if the plain meaning of the statute were not clear,we are convinced that a thorough reading of the requirement in the context of the rest of the medicaid reimbursement statute supports this conclusion.the indiana legislature has demonstrated that when it chooses to allow practitioners to perform some of the tasks that are billed by a supervising provider it knows how to make this clear in the law.in the context of outpatient psychotherapy,the state
