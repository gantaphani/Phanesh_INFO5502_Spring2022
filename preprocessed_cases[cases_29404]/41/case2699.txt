lori jo bailey,brought this wrongful death action on behalf of chad edgar beal beal,who died of fentanyl toxicity after he used a prescription patch manufactured,distributed,and retailed by the defendant companies.the action was originally filed in state court and removed under a,pursuant to b,by the defendant more than thirty days after service on the other defendants.appellant moved to remand the action to state court,asserting that the notice of removal was untimely.the district court denied this motion and thereafter granted defendants motions to dismiss with prejudice the first amended complaint on procedural and substantive grounds.appellant challenges the district court denial of her motion to remand and the dismissal of her complaint.
this case presents an issue of first impression for the court with regards to whether,in litigation,the limitations period for removal expires upon thirty days from service on the or defendant under b.for the reasons that follow,we adopt the defendant rule and accordingly affirm the district court denial of appellant motion to remand the case to state court.we resolve the appeal of the motion to dismiss in an unpublished appendix to this opinion.
the decedent,chad edgar beal,died on march,after having received an allegedly lethal dose of a pain narcotic,fentanyl,via a transdermal skin patch prescribed to him by his doctor.the prescription patch,duragesic,was manufactured by defendant alza corporation alza and distributed by defendant janssen pharmaceutica,janssen,both of which are subsidiaries of the holding company,defendant johnson johnson,johnson johnson.the patch was sold to beal at a south florida store of defendant walgreen walgreen.
beal administrator originally brought this wrongful death action in palm beach county,florida,on february.the first defendant served was walgreen,on may.the next defendant,alza,was served on may,and defendant janssen was served several days later on may.alza and janssen filed motions to dismiss in state court on june.the last defendant served was johnson johnson,and it was served on june.all defendants utilized the same attorney to represent them in the proceedings in state court.on july,the defendant,johnson johnson,filed a notice of removal of the action based on complete diversity,pursuant to b 
once the action was in federal court,the appellant timely sought remand,arguing that,under b,the time for filing a notice of removal runs from the date of service on the first,walgreen on may,therefore johnson johnson notice was not timely brought within days of the may service in its november,order,the district court adopted the defendant rule,which permits each defendant to file a timely motion for removal within thirty days of receipt of service by that individual defendant.under this rule,defendants who may have waived their right to independently seek removal by failing to timely file a notice of janssen,alza,and walgreen did nevertheless consent to a timely motion by a defendant.the district court,therefore,denied the motion to remand the action to state court,having found that the notice of removal was timely and that all defendants consented to the notice.

iii.discussion 
section a authorizes a defendant to seek removal of a suit originally brought in state court when the federal court has diversity jurisdiction over the cause of action.a.section describes the appropriate removal procedure to invoke federal jurisdiction,and requires the defendant seeking removal to file a timely notice of removal stating the grounds for removal with the appropriate federal district court.a.in order to be timely,
t he notice of removal of a civil action or proceeding shall be filed within thirty days after the receipt by the defendant,through service or otherwise,of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding is based 
b.the supreme court held in murphy brothers,michetti pipe stringing,d,that the in b is triggered by simultaneous service of the summons and complaint,or receipt of the complaint,through service or otherwise,after and apart from service of the summons,but not by mere receipt of the complaint unattended by any formal service.
on its face,b does not appear to address itself to litigation.brierly alusuisse flexible packaging,cir the statutory language itself contemplates only one defendant and thus does not answer the question of how to calculate the timing for removal in the event that multiple defendants are served at different times,one or more of them outside the original period.in applying the statute to litigation,courts have split over whether each individual defendant has a right to seek removal within thirty days of receipt of service or whether the appropriate time window for b runs from receipt of service by the defendant in other words,whether the or defendant triggers b limitations period appellant urges us to adopt the defendant rule and accordingly find that johnson johnson notice of removal was not timely under b because it was filed more than thirty days after receipt of service of process by the defendant.for the following reasons,we reject appellant argument and interpret b to permit each defendant thirty days in which to seek removal.we thus conclude that johnson johnson notice of removal was timely.
first,we observe that the trend in recent case law favors the defendant rule.see,general pump well,laibe supply,no,wl,more recently,however,the trend in the case law has been toward the rule.the sixth and the eighth circuits,several district courts in this circuit and a court in this district have followed the later served rule.among the four courts of appeals that have considered this issue,only the fifth circuit and seemingly the fourth have adopted the rule,and have held that a notice of removal is only timely if it is filed within thirty days of service of process on the first defendant.see brown demco,cir the general rule is that if the first served defendant abstains from seeking removal or does not effect a timely removal,subsequently served defendants can not remove due to the rule of unanimity among defendants which is required for removal.internal quotations and punctuation omitted getty oil ins.of,cir in cases involving multiple defendants,the period begins to run as soon as the first defendant is served provided the case is then removable.mckinney bd.of trustees of.comm,cir the most recent of these decisions,the fourth circuit decision in mckinney,is now more than fifteen years old.conversely,the two courts among the circuit courts to have adopted the defendant rule have done so far more recently the eighth circuit in,and the sixth circuit in.marano enters.of,cir brierly alusuisse flexible packaging,cir.
second,we are convinced that both common sense and considerations of equity favor the defendant rule.the rule has been criticized by other courts as being inequitable to defendants who,through no fault of their own might,by virtue of the rule,lose their statutory right to seek removal.both the eighth and sixth circuits endorsed the defendant rule,at least in part,for equitable reasons.see marano,at the fifth circuit did not consider,however,the hardships to a defendant when the defendant for whatever reason does not file a notice of removal within thirty days of service.defendants would not be afforded the opportunity to attempt to persuade their to join a notice of removal if more than thirty days had passed since the first defendant was served.brierly,at noting that as a matter of fairness to defendants it endorsed the rule 
third,the sixth circuit recognized that the
