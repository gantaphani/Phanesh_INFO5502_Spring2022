the federal aviation administration faa revoked petitioner harold singleton medical certificate and pilot license after finding that he gave an intentionally false answer on his application for the medical certificate.the national transportation safety board affirmed the faa revocation order.we conclude that the board erred in two respects.it wrongly suggested that singleton understanding of the form was irrelevant to the offense of intentional falsification.and it granted summary judgment to the faa without giving singleton a chance to present evidence bearing on that understanding.accordingly,we vacate the grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.

turning to the evidence,the board rejected singleton contention that he did not know that the phrase administrative action covered the revocation of his driver license.there is indeed a plain meaning to the term administrative action,the board opined,and respondent efforts to sow confusion upon it we find unavailing.id.at.the board explained that w hen the question is not confusing,where the wording has a literal meaning,and where the dui infraction at issue clearly begs candidness with the administrator,respondent can not claim he did not knowingly provide a false response.id.the board found that no factual question remains about singleton knowledge and that summary judgment was appropriate.id.
the board then went on to indicate that singleton understanding of question was not even relevant to whether he had the knowledge requisite to make an intentionally false statement under a.a pilot failure to understand a question,the board stated,does not establish a lack of intent to provide false information.id.at.singleton knew that his driving privileges had been revoked,and he knew that the reason for that revocation was because of an incident.id.at.hence,the board concluded,the evidence shows that he was aware of the statement falsity.id.
