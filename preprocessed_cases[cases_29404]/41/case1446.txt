background 
skinner was born in and completed her education through the eleventh grade.the record contains scant information about her work history apart from employment in the home care field from to.this work involved bathing and dressing her client as well as performing household chores like cleaning,washing,cooking,and shopping.the alj characterized these activities,which involved stooping,kneeling,crouching,and crawling,as medium to heavy in exertional demand and unskilled in nature.skinner stopped working in because the pay was inadequate.
skinner diabetes and hypertension began troubling her in february,when she was treated at south shore hospital in chicago for a chief complaint of dizziness.the emergency room physician diagnosed dizziness,otitis media an infection of the middle ear,and dm or diabetes mellitus.a computerized tomography scan of skinner brain showed no abnormalities her other exam results were normal too.she was prescribed the drug antivert to alleviate her dizziness.
skinner postemergency room treatment was overseen by teresito arcillas from february to october.progress notes from a february visit indicate skinner was still experiencing some dizziness but nevertheless felt better,although she did report a history of polyuria frequent urination and polydipsia excessive thirst.arcillas found skinner heart rate normal and her lungs clear.explaining the importance of dietary restrictions for diabetics,arcillas placed skinner on an diet and prescribed glipizide a stimulant for insulin production.
at another visit one week later,arcillas again found skinner heart rate regular and her lung sounds good.skinner was ambulatory and alert,but arcillas increased her glipizide dosage in response to an elevated fasting blood sugar and prescribed a glucometer to monitor blood sugar.three weeks later,skinner was feeling better and her polydipsia had abated.finding skinner fasting blood sugar still too high,arcillas again increased her glipizide.
on april,skinner was admitted as an inpatient to south shore hospital with diagnoses of dizziness,diabetes mellitus type ii,and possible coronary ischemia decreased blood supply.tests disclosed skinner blood pressure was elevated,as were her glucose and cholesterol levels.an electrocardiogram revealed abnormalities possibly indicative of ischemia.skinner was admitted for observation and discharged the following day.
arcillas continued to see skinner during appointments over the next several months.at a june appointment,arcillas prescribed norvasc for skinner hypertension.the following month arcillas prescribed procardia to replace norvasc as skinner blood pressure medication.in september skinner reported an episode of hypoglycemia abnormally low blood sugar and daily headaches after taking her blood pressure pill.her examination was normal,but arcillas added ecotrin a aspirin and nitrogylcerin to skinner medications.in october skinner was still reporting dizziness,lightheadedness,and headaches.
later in october,skinner switched physicians and started seeing sarah glavin.glavin notes from october,identify skinner conditions as hypertension,diabetes,seborrheic dermatitis a scalp skin condition treated previously by arcillas with a special shampoo,headaches,and lightheadedness.glavin noted skinner complained of throbbing chest pain occurring every couple of months,though those episodes lasted only for seconds.skinner also reported sinus pressure that increased at nighttime.glavin examination of skinner lungs,heart,nose,throat,abdomen,and neurological functioning did not reveal anything abnormal.glavin instructed skinner to continue her glipizide on a new schedule,and instead of procardia,which skinner believed was making her weak and causing headaches,glavin prescribed another blood pressure medication,enalapril.
on november,skinner returned to glavin with a request that she complete paperwork for public aid assistance.skinner initially told glavin she had been unable to work due to the side effects of the procardia,but eventually acknowledged she was feeling much better and would be able to pursue employment.glavin agreed that skinner was capable of working despite her medical conditions.
during a december appointment,skinner complained of fatigue over the prior month and intermittent dull headaches.skinner told glavin that on bad days these symptoms rendered her incapable of performing her daily activities.skinner also complained of two hypoglycemic episodes,though glavin notes suggest that these bouts were related to skinner use of glipizide without a full meal.glavin indicated that previous blood tests were unexceptional and skinner lungs and heart were normal.
three months later,in march,skinner again visited glavin with a complaint that she had been feeling ill for three days.skinner explained that she had awakened one morning with vertigo that lasted about fifteen minutes.on two other mornings,she experienced lightheadedness and sinus aching.skinner also reported symptoms related to hypoglycemia,which were quickly resolved when she drank a glass of juice.glavin suggested altering skinner medication to address these symptoms,but skinner did not think it was necessary.at a subsequent visit in june,skinner reported dizziness and fleeting,intermittent pains at the top of her head.glavin noted that all of skinner recent tests were normal and thought these symptoms were attributable to menopause.
