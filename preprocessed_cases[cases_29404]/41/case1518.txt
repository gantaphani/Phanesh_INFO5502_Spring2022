paul fenje was accepted into the anesthesiology residency program at the university of illinois at chicago uic.shortly thereafter,but before the residency began,the program director learned that fenje had been terminated from a previous residency because of questions about his competency.based on his lack of candor in the application process he had not disclosed his dismissal from the prior residency,fenje was dismissed from the uic program.fenje responded with this lawsuit against the program director,james feld,alleging that the termination of his residency violated his due process and equal protection rights under the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.the district court granted summary judgment to the defendant and fenje appeals.we affirm.
background 
fenje is an irish national who attended medical school in ireland.in august he commenced work as a resident in emergency medicine at a hospital in scotland.a mere twelve days after this residency began,fenje was dismissed from the program because his attending physician had questioned his competency to deliver patient care and did not consider fenje practice of medicine to be commensurate with the program requirements.fenje promptly initiated litigation in scotland,alleging breach of contract on the part of the hospital.
in june fenje applied for admission to the anesthesiology residency program at uic.nowhere in the materials submitted as part of his application did fenje mention his past association with the scottish hospital,the difficulties he had encountered there,or his ongoing litigation against the hospital.feld conducted a personal interview with fenje and asked if there was anything he should know about fenje background,including any work performed in previous training programs and whether fenje had any skeletons in his closet.fenje responded that there was nothing that feld needed to know.a few days after the interview,fenje followed up with an letter to feld confirming that there are no skeletons of any kind in any of my closets here.fenje letter went on to specifically state that he did not smoke,drank alcohol very infrequently,had never used illegal drugs,and had never been arrested or charged with any crime more serious than a single speeding ticket.fenje was accepted into the anesthesiology training program.a june,letter from feld confirmed his acceptance in writing and indicated a start date of august.
on or about july,fenje received and executed a resident agreement.this document stated in part that in the event the university were to dismiss fenje from the training program for cause,fenje would receive written notice could request a hearing the hearing would be convened before a committee fenje and a representative of the anesthesiology department would be permitted to submit oral and written materials in support of their respective cases but no attorneys would be allowed and the committee would issue a written decision that could be appealed to the associate dean of graduate medical education.
a few days after fenje resident agreement was executed,feld received an anonymous telephone call disclosing that fenje had experienced difficulties at a residency program in scotland and suggesting that feld contact the director of the program for further information.feld followed up with calls to the director of the scottish residency program and fenje supervising physician and was informed of the circumstances surrounding fenje termination.in a telephone conversation in late july,feld confronted fenje with this information,and fenje was given the opportunity to respond and state his position.fenje characterized his difficulties in scotland as a clash of personalities between himself and the director of the program,who,according to fenje,had wrongfully concluded that fenje suffered from a psychiatric obsessive trait and that his practice of medicine was unsafe.in a letter to feld dated august,fenje restated his view of the events culminating in his dismissal from the scottish training program,adding that i had never considered this incident any kind of a closet skeleton and had thought of it as a personality clash of some kind 
feld consulted with other members of the anesthesiology department and obtained their approval to terminate fenje residency because of his dishonesty in the process.feld reasoned that a doctor who has demonstrated a propensity to be less than forthcoming concerning negative incidents in his work history can not be relied upon to communicate forthrightly with supervising physicians on matters concerning patient care.feld called fenje on august,and informed him that he was terminated from the residency program.fenje was not provided with a written notice of termination at this time.in the period following his termination,fenje wrote letters and to feld and ronald albrecht,the director of the anesthesiology department,asking that the decision be reconsidered and that feld and albrecht undertake a broader inquiry before making a final decision.the decision was final,however,and no broader inquiry was undertaken.
for reasons not made clear in the record,the uic college of medicine did not provide fenje with formal written notice of his termination from the residency program until more than two years after he was orally notified of the decision by feld.in the written notice signed by albrecht,fenje was once again informed that he had been dismissed from the program due to his lack of candor in the application process,and that in the opinion of the anesthesiology department,this shortcoming rendered him unsuitable for residency training at uic.the notice also informed fenje that he could request a hearing pursuant to the terms of the resident agreement.fenje requested a hearing in a timely manner,and one was convened on march,before a committee comprised of physicians in the uic anesthesiology department.evidence and argument were submitted by fenje and feld without the participation of attorneys,and the committee thereafter voted unanimously to uphold the termination on the grounds of lack of candor in the application process.the vice dean of the college of medicine upheld the decision on fenje appeal.
fenje filed this action pursuant to,alleging due process and equal protection violations.specifically,the complaint alleged that fenje was denied due process of law because there was no pretermination hearing,his posttermination hearing was unjustifiably delayed,his resident agreement was flawed for failing to prescribe a time frame following termination within which a posttermination hearing was required,and his dismissal wrongfully imposed a stigma upon him that foreclosed other educational vocational opportunities.the complaint also alleged a violation of fenje right to equal protection on the ground that his termination was undertaken solely by virtue of feld personal animus toward him 
the district court dismissed the case on feld motion for summary judgment,holding that fenje was only entitled to notice of the grounds for the termination decision and an opportunity to respond,and that fenje had been afforded at least this much process.fenje feld,d.as to the delay in convening the hearing,the court held that no posttermination hearing was constitutionally required,and so the delay could not constitute a due process violation.id.at.in the alternative,the court held that fenje was not prejudiced by the delay,and that the delay could not be attributable to feld in any event.id.at.the court dismissed fenje claims of stigmatization because the stated reason for his dismissal was not false,and he was therefore not defamed by the defendant actions.id.at.fenje equal protection claim was dismissed because there was no evidence that feld had acted out of vindictiveness or other malevolent animus.id.at.
ii.discussion 
procedural due process 
on appeal,fenje reasserts his argument that his right to due process was violated because he received no pretermination hearing,his posttermination hearing was unreasonably delayed,and the resident agreement did not contain a provision that required his posttermination hearing to be held within a reasonable t
