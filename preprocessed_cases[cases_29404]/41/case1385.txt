charles getch appeals the order of the district court upholding the social security administration denial of his application for disability insurance benefits.getch contends that the administrative law judge alj,who denied his application for benefits,erred in concluding that environmental conditions at his former workplace did not prevent him from resuming his past work as a seam welder.getch also contends that the alj failed to consider the combined impact of his health problems and erred in finding his testimony not fully credible.finally,getch argues that the social security appeals council erred in concluding that new evidence did not warrant rehearing before the alj.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings before the agency.
backgrounda.
getch,who is presently,underwent emergency triple bypass surgery in.he returned to his job as a seam welder several months later.in december,while he was lifting heavy objects at work,getch fractured his sternum at the site of the sternotomy that had been performed during his bypass surgery.getch underwent a second surgery to reconstruct the broken sternum in march,but that surgery was unsuccessful.
in october,getch visited a pain clinic,complaining of a grinding and popping sensation in his chest.getch rated his pain during the day at or out of,with representing extreme pain,although he reported that the pain grew worse with coughing or sneezing and kept him awake at night.over the next year,looyenga,a cardiologist,monitored getch for further cardiac problems he also treated his chest pain with celebrex and cortisone shots.in june,looyenga concluded that getch was in good cardiac health.early in,however,looyenga wrote a letter to another of getch treating physicians,daly,informing him of getch ailments and noting that getch had been unemployed since early because of his inability to perform strenuous activities.
in november,getch visited geha,the chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the university of illinois at chicago.after examining getch and reviewing his medical records,geha concluded that getch sternum remained fragmented but otherwise his cardiac health had returned to normal.geha did not believe that another operation would relieve getch sternum pain,and instead he recommended that getch switch to a type of job that avoids extremely heavy and strenuous activity and pulling on the upper extremities.at.he observed that,with proper conditioning,getch likely could return to a reasonable level of activity.id.
despite geha opinion that he might be able to return to a job that did not involve strenuous activity,getch did not return to work.in december,getch filed an application for disability benefits with the social security administration.he claimed an onset of disability date of january,after he fractured his sternum.his application was referred to the disability determination bureau the state agency.
at the request of the state agency,another physician,mahawar,examined getch in january.getch told mahawar that he suffered from gout,which causes joint swelling and pain,although the record does not contain any prior medical evidence supporting a gout diagnosis.getch stated that his gout caused him throbbing pain every other month because he had stopped treating it with medication after experiencing unpleasant side effects.getch also reported problems with recurring chest pain,but he told mahawar that cortisone injections prescribed by looyenga and a pain clinic were helping to keep the pain in check.after examining getch,mahawar reported that his chest,heart,motor strength and range of motion were all normal,and that,although getch walked with a slight limp,he did not require any assistance to move around.mahawar did not observe symptoms of gout,including joint effusion,joint redness or swelling.
two other physicians then reviewed mahawar report and getch medical records.they concluded that getch could lift and carry pounds occasionally and pounds frequently,that he could stand or walk for hours in an work day,and that he occasionally could balance,stoop,kneel,crouch,crawl and climb ramps and stairs.the physicians concluded,however,that getch never could climb ladders,ropes or scaffolds.they also recommended that getch avoid concentrated exposure to extreme heat and cold,but they did not identify any other environmental limitations.
in january,getch also met,at the request of the state agency,with a psychologist,walters.getch told walters that he currently had fleeting thoughts of suicide but had not made plans to kill himself.he stated that he frequently felt helpless and hopeless,could not sleep at night,suffered from anxiety and constantly worried about the future.despite his depression,however,getch reported that he was able to groom,bathe and dress himself that he occasionally cooked for himself that he was able to fold clothes and shop for groceries that he spent most of the day watching television,reading the newspaper,playing video games and surfing the internet that he could drive and that he helped his children with their homework after school.walters diagnosed getch with unspecified depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.two psychologists then reviewed walters report,along with getch medical records,and concluded that his depression and anxiety did not significantly interfere with his ability to work.
on the basis of the state agency report,the social security administration denied getch claim,initially in february and on reconsideration in june.getch timely requested a hearing before an alj.
throughout,physician daly and cardiologist looyenga continued to treat getch chest pain.in a november letter to getch lawyer,daly opined that getch was disabled at present due to coronary artery disease,the sternum fracture,gout,and situational anxiety and depression.at.looyenga also completed a cardiac residual functional capacity questionnaire in november.he observed that getch suffered from coronary artery disease and hypertension that caused chest pain,anginal equivalent pain,shortness of breath and fatigue.looyenga discounted the possibility that getch was malingering and opined that his physical limitations prevented him from holding even low stress jobs or completing simple work tasks.he stated that getch could walk only one city block without rest or severe pain,could stand fewer than hours and sit for no more than hours during an work day,could never lift anything heavier than pounds and rarely anything weighing less than pounds,and never could twist,stoop,crouch or climb.looyenga left blank the form questions regarding potential environmental restrictions.
at a hearing before an alj in august,getch testified that he continued to experience chest pain,which caused shortness of breath and prevented him from sleeping.he also stated that his gout caused foot and joint swelling so severe that sometimes he could not walk.getch stated that his health problems had made him so depressed that he ate to the point of obesity.
getch also testified regarding his work history.before he fractured his sternum,he had worked as a seam welder for a company that makes cable for antennas and towers.getch stated that he did not perform the welding himself instead,he watched a video monitor to assess whether a machine properly welded pieces of cable together.he further testified that,in his position as a seam welder,he did not have to lift or carry more than pounds,he could alternate between standing and sitting whenever he wished,and he could sit more than percent of the work day.getch also stated,however,that smoke and chemical fumes inside the plant at which he had worked often made him cough he also testified that the plant had no air conditioning or heating,leading to extreme temperature variations which exacerbated his chest pain.
thomas grzesik,a vocational expert,also testified at the hearing.the alj asked grzesik to consider whether getch could perform his previous work,assuming that getch could lift and carry pounds frequently and pounds occasionally and that he needed to be able to sit more than half the day.grzesik opined that,even given those limitations,getch would be able to perform his past work as a seam welder.when the alj asked whether all positions for seam welder involve exposure to extreme temperatures or chemical fumes,grzesik replied it would depend on the process.it would depend on the nature of the industry i would say probably percent of the work would not.at.
not satisfied with the medical record,the alj requested that getch undergo a examination by a cardiologist.the state agency,however,selected an internist,rashan.although rashan objective medical tests showed that getch was generally healthy,he nonetheless concluded that getch gout prevented him from lifting or carrying more than pounds,standing or walking more than hours or sitting for more than hours in an workday,and climbing,balancing,kneeling,crouching,crawling or stooping.rashan opined that getch should avoid dust,smoke and fumes,but he stated that extreme temperatures would not affect getch medical conditions.after the hearing,looyenga also sent the alj a letter stating that getch suffered from obesity,hypertension,depression,gout,high cholesterol and arthritis,but that his cardiac condition was significantly improved.looyenga estimated that getch could lift to pounds.
after considering all the evidence,the alj concluded that getch was not disabled.in so finding,the alj applied the analysis described in a i v.first,he found that getch had not engaged in substantial gainful employment since the onset of his alleged disability.second,he found that getch coronary artery disease and fractured sternum but not his other ailments constituted severe impairments that limited his ability to work,but that neither was a listed impairment and together they did not equal any listed impairment.third,the alj chose not to credit getch testimony regarding the disabling effect of his chest pain,depression or gout because the medical record did not corroborate his reports he also reasoned that rashan assessment of getch limitations did not make sense,given that objective testing showed getch to be normal in virtually all measures.furthermore,the alj continued,daly opinion that getch was disabled could not be reconciled with treatment records and objective medical assessments.
at step four,the alj concluded that getch retained the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work,so long as he could alternate between sitting and standing,sit for more than half the work day,and avoid lifting or carrying objects weighing more than pounds.even with these limitations,the alj concluded,getch could perform all of the job functions of his past relevant work as a seam welder.therefore,he found,getch was not disabled.the alj did not discuss whether getch past work as a seam welder presented environmental limitations incompatible with his medical condition.furthermore,because the alj determined at step four that getch was able to return to his previous work as a seam welder,he declined to discuss whether getch could work at other jobs in the national economy.
getch asked the appeals council to reconsider the alj decision in light of new evidence showing that his gout symptoms had worsened in the months after the hearing before the alj.this evidence included treatment records from a new doctor,describing gout attacks that getch had suffered between november and september.the appeals council considered getch objections to the alj decision,together with the new evidence,but it concluded that the new evidence would not alter the alj decision and,therefore,that there was no basis for remanding the case.
in april,getch filed this action in the district court,seeking judicial review of the alj determination under g.getch contended that the alj erred in finding that he could resume his past relevant work the alj should have found that his gout constituted a severe impairment the alj improperly discounted the testimony of his treating physicians the alj should have found his testimony fully credible the alj failed to consider the combined impact of his health problems and the appeals council should have reversed the alj decision in light of his new evidence.after considering getch arguments,a magistrate judge,sitting by consent as the district court,concluded that the alj decision was supported by substantial evidence.he also held that the appeals council did not err in refusing to remand the case based on getch new evidence.
discussiona.
because the appeals council denied getch request for review,the alj decision is the final decision of the commissioner of social security.see haynes barnhart,cir.in reviewing that decision,we are limited to examining whether it is supported by substantial evidence.see g skinner astrue,cir.substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.skinner,at quoting richardson perales,d.the alj is not required to address every piece of evidence or testimony presented,but he must provide a logical bridge between the evidence and his conclusions.clifford apfel,cir.
getch presents four challenges on appeal.he first contends that,had the alj given adequate consideration to the environmental conditions at his former workplace together with his doctors advice to avoid those conditions,he could not have concluded at step four that getch is capable of performing his past relevant work.it is not enough,getch suggests,that some positions for seam welders are in hospitable environments,if the conditions of his former employer represent the norm.although the claimant has the burden at step four to establish that he can not return to his past relevant work,the alj still must make factual findings that support his conclusion.briscoe ex rel.taylor barnhart,cir clifford,at.
we previously have remanded to the agency where an alj ruled at step four that a claimant could return to her past work simply because that work was sedentary and the claimant medical condition did not prevent her from working at a sedentary level.see smith barnhart,cir.in that case,the claimant suffered from arthritis in both of her hands.id.the alj concluded that the claimant could return to her past work as a tax preparer,director of a program for the elderly,or management and information specialist because all three jobs were defined as sedentary and,even with arthritis,she could perform some sedentary jobs.in reaching this conclusion,however,the alj neglected to evaluate whether the claimant arthritis would prevent her from writing and required by the particular type of sedentary work she had performed.id.the alj error,which required us to remand the case,lay in equating the claimant past relevant work to sedentary work in general.id.other circuits have reached similar conclusions.see,bowman astrue,cir remanding to the agency where the alj did not address the impact of the claimant limited use of her hand on her ability to perform her past relevant work as cashier pinto massanari,cir holding that the alj should have considered that the claimant past relevant work required constant stooping and bending lowe apfel,cir remanding where the reviewing court could not determine the factual basis for the alj finding that the claimant could return to her past relevant work as a laundromat manager,despite her inability to perform repetitive hand movements.
the alj in this case did more than the alj in smith in addition to evaluating whether getch could do sedentary work in general,the alj specifically considered whether seam welding would require getch to lift heavy objects,stand most of the day,and so on.the alj did not determine,however,whether the job of seam welder also would require getch to tolerate exposure to dust and extreme temperatures,factors which he testified exacerbated his condition.the question this case presents is whether the findings of the alj were sufficient to build a logical bridge to the conclusion that getch could perform his past work,or whether the alj also was required to consider expressly the impact of the work environment on getch.
although the alj was not required to provide a complete written evaluation of every piece
