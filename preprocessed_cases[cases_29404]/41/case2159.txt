we are called upon to decide whether the americans with disabilities act requires public transit systems to make certain modifications to their programs for disabled riders.
metropolitan transportation district of oregon trimet is a public entity providing mass transportation services in multnomah,washington,and clackamas counties generally,the portland,oregon metropolitan area.pursuant to the americans with disabilities act ada,et,trimet has developed and implemented a plan for providing paratransit service for disabled riders unable to use its fixed route system of buses and light rail trimet plan has been approved by the federal transit administration fta,a division of the department of transportation dot,as meeting the requirements of the ada.
trimet paratransit system,the lift paratransit program lift,provides,service hours a day,seven days a week,in all areas in the trimet district.see lift rider guide,available at last accessed.lift serves riders,providing over rides per day and over a million rides per year see lift program ridership and service statistics,available at last accessed.lift fleet consists of buses and sedans.when no vehicle is available,lift contracts with taxi companies to provide backup service.currently,lift assigns vehicles to riders based solely on the requested pickup time and location.
barbara boose,who suffers from a balance disorder,has been approved by trimet to use lift since boose uses lift to get to medical appointments,do her grocery shopping,and generally,to get around.in,she submitted a request that lift accommodate her disability by scheduling rides in only sedans or taxis,as she experiences less dizziness and nausea in those vehicles than in lift buses.accompanying her request was a letter from her doctor stating that boose has reported a number of lift traumas that have aggravat ed her condition.he recommended use of sedans or taxis to reduce her neurological emotional stress.trimet declined boose request.
boose filed a complaint in the district court alleging that trimet refusal to accommodate her request violated the ada and the rehabilitation act of,et.she sought declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as attorneys fees and costs.boose and trimet filed for summary judgment.the district court granted trimet motion and denied boose motion.boose timely appealed.
the sole issue presented in this appeal is whether under the ada and rehabilitation act,lift must accommodate boose pursuant to a department of justice doj regulation requiring public entities to make reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability,unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,program,or activity.b.this issue is one of first impression in this circuit 
boose and the amici disability rights organizations argue that this doj regulation applies to trimet by its own independent force,or in the alternative,through incorporation by reference in dot regulations.we address these contentions in turn 
boose and amici argue that because title ii,part a of the ada,prohibits discrimination against the disabled by public entities such as trimet and the attorney general has the authority to promulgate regulations implementing part a,id.a,trimet must follow the attorney general reasonable modification regulation.
applicability of part a to trimet does not,however,resolve the issue of whether the doj reasonable modification regulation applies to lift,since part a also specifically prohibits the doj from making rules that include any matter within the scope of the authority of the secretary of transportation under section.id.hence,we must decide whether the accommodation sought by boose falls within the scope of that authority.
while part a of title ii deals with public entities in general,part b deals with public transportation.see olmstead zimring,d.section under part b is titled paratransit as a complement to fixed route service.it provides 
it shall be considered discrimination for purposes of the ada and the rehabilitation act for a public entity which operates a fixed route system to fail to provide paratransit and other special transportation services to individuals with disabilities that are sufficient to provide to such individuals a level of service which is comparable to the level of designated public transportation services provided to individuals without disabilities using such system or in the case of response time,which is comparable,to the extent practicable,to the level of designated public transportation services provided to individuals without disabilities using such system.
id.the secretary of transportation has the sole authority to issue final regulations to carry out this section.id.b.these regulations must establish,inter alia,minimum service criteria for determining the level of services to be required under this section.id.c.
boose describes her requested modification as scheduling transportation for her using trimet sedans instead of trimet buses.in other words,she is dissatisfied with the level of service trimet currently provides through lift and would like an enhanced level of service that would enable her to choose whatever vehicle she would like to ride.boose request,therefore,fits squarely within the definition of service criteria.that the dot has not yet promulgated a rule concerning scheduling by vehicle type does not mean that the doj regulations automatically fill this regulatory vacuum.surely the scope of the secretary authority exceeds the extent to which he has currently regulated.indeed,boose does not try to argue that the secretary lacks the authority to promulgate such a regulation.she even concedes that t he doj can not promulgate regulations regarding transportation services.only the dot can do that.we agree.only the secretary of transportation can make rules determining the level of services to be required for paratransit.c.
if the attorney general can not make rules about scheduling paratransit trips by vehicle type,then neither can he make rules that effectively require paratransit systems to schedule trips by vehicle type.application of the doj reasonable modification regulation to trimet in this instance would do just that,in violation of the regulation enabling statute.see id.a.we decline to impose a requirement on trimet that would upset the balance of authority that congress has carefully allocated between the attorney general and secretary of transportation.consequently,we conclude that the doj reasonable modification regulation does not,and can not,apply by its own independent force.see melton dallas area rapid transit,cir holding that a reasonable modification that relates specifically to the operation of a paratransit system service is exempt from the attorney general regulations in part.
part a of the ada unambiguously prevents the attorney general from regulating paratransit scheduling,which is a matter within the scope of the authority of the secretary of transportation under section.a.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter chevron natural res.def.council,d.
nevertheless,we briefly address the contention that a doj regulation and its preamble compel a contrary conclusion.amici focus on the language of b,which provides that t o the extent that public transportation services are covered by part b,they are not subject to the requirements of this part.they also quote the language of this regulation preamble 
paragraph b of explains that to the extent that public transportation services are covered by part b,they are subject to the regulations of the dot at cfr part and are not covered by cfr part matters not covered by subtitle b,such as the provision of auxiliary aids,are covered by this rule.
nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in state and local government services,july,emphasis added pt,app.a.because t he substitution of a sedan or taxi for a bus is not a matter covered by part b,amici conclude that the preamble dictates that it is outside the scope of b exception.
