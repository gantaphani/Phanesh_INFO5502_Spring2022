factual and procedural background 
molski is a paraplegic who has been confined to a wheelchair since a motorcycle accident paralyzed him at the age of.considered by some to be a controversial figure,molski has brought hundreds of lawsuits against inaccessible public accommodations throughout california.molski considers himself a civil rights activist who uses litigation to force compliance with the ada california businesses and a federal district court consider him a vexatious litigant who exploits the ada and its state law counterpart for pecuniary gain 
on january,molski took his grandmother to church,then to lunch at cable restaurant in woodland hills,california,where he spent dollars on their meal.after eating lunch,molski excused himself to use the restaurant public restroom.
upon entering the restroom,molski noticed numerous architectural barriers to his accessing the facilities.the door pressure on the bathroom door was too heavy,and the door lacked a handicap accessible sign.inside,the stall doors could not close with molski wheelchair in the stall.the stall lacked grab bars on both the rear wall and side wall,which prevented molski from maneuvering from his wheelchair to the toilet.the toilet seat cover dispenser was unreachable.the pipes underneath the sink were not insulated,and therefore,according to molski,posed a special risk to those without feeling in their legs,as hot pipes could burn them without their realization.the sink also lacked levered hardware,a type of fixture that is easily moveable without strong grip strength.molski was unable to reach at least one of the paper towel dispensers.molski testified that the hygienic violations were especially important in his case because,due to his paralysis,he uses a catheter and a urine bag that must be emptied frequently.he explained that failure to empty the urine bag can cause autonomic dysreflexia,a condition that can result in whole body spasms and even cardiac arrest.handling the bag with unwashed hands can also lead to bladder infections.
on march,rick sarantschin sarantschin,the principal of access investigation monitoring,conducted an inspection of cable and confirmed molski observations using the ada accessibility guidelines for buildings and facilities adaag.see app.four months later,molski brought a lawsuit against cable in the central district of california,alleging violations of the ada and state laws.the district court held a trial.
at trial,molski,sarantschin,and construction expert michael beall beall testified on behalf of molski,and cable vice president anthony dalkas dalkas testified as an adverse witness.molski testified primarily about his experience at cable,his prior lawsuits,and his views on disability access discrimination.sarantschin testified about his investigation of cable and the ada violations he observed.
beall testified about the construction costs of making cable compliant with the ada.he estimated that the approximate total cost to remodel both the men and women bathrooms would be,or for just the men bathroom.beall noted that incremental steps were even cheaper lowering the toilet seat cover dispenser would cost and take about minutes insulating the pipes would cost under and take about a minute and a half to do.other repairs were as inexpensive as.
in his testimony,dalkas acknowledged that the company had not attempted to identify barriers to the disabled.he admitted that cable had not made the renovations because w e were compelled to do it.dalkas testified that cable could afford each of the repairs but stated,once you start down that path,you opening a can of worms that will cost a lot of money.dalkas described issues with cable landlord,as well as the economic costs of remodeling,such as the need to close the restaurant during renovations.dalkas said he had received estimates of to bring the two bathrooms up to the current c ode,although cable had not disclosed any such remodeling bids during discovery.
the defendant did not call any witnesses,but relied primarily on its of molski and dalkas.in essence,the defendant strategy was to discredit molski by exposing an ulterior motive for bringing suit molski and his lawyer thomas frankovich frankovich were purportedly in the business of tracking down public accommodations with ada violations and extorting settlements out of them.on cross examination,molski acknowledged that he did not complain to any of cable employees about his access problems he had filed similar ada lawsuits as of october,frankovich had filed of the lawsuits even more lawsuits had been filed since that date molski and frankovich averaged for each case that settled molski did not pay any fees to frankovich molski maintained no employment besides prosecuting ada cases,despite his possession of a law degree molski projected annual income from settlements was molski executed blank verification forms for frankovich to submit with responses to interrogatories they had also filed lawsuits against two other restaurants owned by cable they had filed a lawsuit against a nearby restaurant and sarantschin obtained up to of his income from frankovich firm for performing investigations for ada lawsuits 
during closing arguments,molski focused primarily on the ada violations,and cable focused primarily on molski.the court instructed the jury on,inter alia,the elements of an ada claim,and gave it a special verdict form.the jury returned a verdict for cable,responding no to the threshold question do you find that the defendant failed to identify and remove architectural barriers at cable restaurant 
pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,molski moved for a new trial on the grounds that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence.the district court denied the motion.molski timely appealed.

americans with disabilities act 
congress passed the ada,et,in to provide clear,strong,consistent,enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities.b.title iii of the ada prohibits discrimination by public accommodations.et.title iii provides,no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns,leases or leases to,or operates a place of public accommodation.a.discrimination includes a failure to remove architectural barriers in existing facilities where such removal is readily achievable.b a iv.readily achievable means easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.
federal regulations clarify which barrier removals are likely to be readily achievable and provide examples in.they include installing grab bars in toilet stalls,rearranging toilet partitions to increase maneuvering space,insulating lavatory pipes under sinks to prevent burns,installing raised toilet seats,installing bathroom mirrors,and repositioning paper towel dispensers.b.the department of justice has referred to these examples as the types of modest measures that may be taken to remove barriers and that are likely to be readily achievable.appendix b to part to regulation on nondiscrimination on the basis of disability by public accommodations and in commercial facilities.july,see also app.
to prevail on a title iii discrimination claim,the plaintiff must show that she is disabled within the meaning of the ada the defendant is a private entity that owns,leases,or operates a place of public accommodation and the plaintiff was denied public accommodations by the defendant because of her disability.a b see parr l l restaurant,d,dunlap ass of bay area gov ts,see also mershon louis,cir applying similar test in higher education context.

california unruh civil rights act 
in the disability context,california unruh civil rights act operates virtually identically to the ada.it states,
all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal,and no matter what their sex,race,color,religion,ancestry,national origin,disability,medical condition,marital status,or sexual orientation are entitled to the full and equal accommodations,advantages,facilities,privileges,or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.
cal.b.any violation of the ada necessarily constitutes a violation of the unruh act.f.
the unruh act,however,does allow for monetary damages.victims of discrimination may obtain actual damages,as well as any amount that may be determined by a jury up to a maximum of three times the amount of actual damage but in no case less than four thousand dollars.a.the litigant need not prove she suffered actual damages to recover the independent statutory damages of.botosan paul mcnally realty,cir.the unruh act also allows for attorney fees.cal.a.
because the unruh act is coextensive with the ada and allows for monetary damages,litigants in federal court in california often pair state unruh act claims with federal ada claims.molski mandarin touch restaurant,d at.
the issue in this case is whether the district court abused its discretion when it denied molski motion for a new trial.the first question is whether there was an absence of evidence to support the jury conclusion that defendant s did not fail to identify and remove architectural barriers at cable restaurant.the second question is whether the district court explanation of the verdict,that molski was a business and not an individual,somehow justifies the jury conclusion.
there is no evidence to support the jury conclusion that cable did not fail to identify and remove architectural barriers.
the district court structured the special verdict form to track the elements of a title iii claim.first,as a threshold question,it asked,do you find that the defendant failed to identify and remove architectural barriers at cable restaurant the form then instructed the jury,if it answered yes,to answer three questions for each of the purported violations did this barrier exist at the cable restaurant on january,if yes,did defendant cable fail to identify and remove the barrier if yes,was it readily achievable to remove after these questions,the form asked,should plaintiff be awarded statutory damages in the sum of the jury answered no to the first question and therefore did not go on to answer any of the subsequent questions.
reviewing the trial transcript,the record contains no evidence in support of the verdict.farley transp,at.the testimony of molski and sarantschin established a laundry list of architectural barriers,including the absence of accessibility signage,excessive door pressure,stalls that were neither wide enough nor long enough,the absence of side and rear grab bars,the absence of looped handles for opening or closing the stall door,no sliding lock,no automatic door opener,a toilet seat cover dispenser that was too high,a paper towel dispenser that was too high,a paper towel dispenser that was blocked by a sink,sinks without levered hardware,no insulation on the pipes,urinals that were too close and too high,stall doors that were too narrow,and toilets that were too short 
dalkas,the vice president of cable,acknowledged the continued existence of these violations and flatly admitted that neither he nor anyone else at cable had attempted to identify or remove architectural barriers.
the only issue about which there was any disagreement was whether or not the removal of the barriers was readily achievable.b a iv.this issue is separate from whether cable identified and removed the barriers.the special verdict form specifically distinguished those questions,allowing the jury to find initially that cable had failed to identify or remove the barriers,but then that removal was not readily achievable.it did not do so.
the jury determination,in response to the threshold question,that cable had not failed to identify and remove barriers was against the clear weight of the evidence,given the undisputed testimony from both molski and dalkas.accordingly,the district court abused
