from until november,ogawa worked as the storeroom maintenance clerk at hawaii stevedores marina terminal in honolulu,hawaii.ogawa position as the sole storeroom clerk required him to balance responsibilities related to hawaii stevedores provision of maintenance services to shipping lines,including ordering and delivering parts for marina equipment,monitoring inventory,scheduling equipment maintenance,providing design assistance on special projects,and reviewing the time cards of other employees.although ogawa enjoyed his work,he also found it stressful.he worked up to fifteen unpaid hours per week from home to finish reports that could not be completed within the regular workday,and also experienced stress from friction with his resulting from ogawa efforts.ogawa was diagnosed with hypertension in and he regularly reported job stress to the doctor he saw for treatment of his high blood pressure.
ogawa was admitted to the emergency room on november,after suffering a left parietal stroke that left him with mild expressive aphasia and limited fine motor skills in his right hand and arm.the stroke had developed over the previous few days,and ogawa later testified that he first noticed symptoms of right arm numbness and weakness while lifting ladders at work on friday,november.when ogawa returned to hawaii stevedores six months later,it was as an assistant to the new storeroom clerk who had replaced ogawa after the stroke.although he gradually built up his hours,ogawa spoke,typed,wrote,and walked slower than before and was not able to work at his pace.in june,during the course of downsizing,hawaii stevedores told ogawa to choose between taking a medical retirement or facing termination.the same week,ogawa filed an accident report which gave notice to hawaii stevedores that ogawa believed his stroke to be.at the end of june ogawa chose medical retirement over termination.
believing that job stress caused or contributed to his high blood pressure and stroke,ogawa filed a disability compensation claim.the office of workers compensation programs referred the claim to the office of administrative law judges for a formal hearing.an alj conducted a hearing during which eight witnesses testified,including howard keller,an internist who examined ogawa at his counsel request,and jack scaff,a cardiologist who examined ogawa at hawaii stevedores request.the alj also received testimony from vocational rehabilitation counselor howard stauber and reports from additional examining doctors,including treating neurologist kevin kimata and examining clinical psychologists brian goodyear and ann mary palozzi.
after the hearing,the alj issued a page decision concluding that ogawa was temporarily disabled before march,and was permanently and totally disabled thereafter.the alj also granted hawaii stevedores request that its liability be limited under section f of the longshore act,f,such that hawaii stevedores would be responsible for weeks of permanent disability payments with the federal government taking over thereafter.the brb affirmed the alj decision in all respects and this petition for review followed.
the brb must accept the alj findings unless they are contrary to the law,irrational,or unsupported by substantial evidence.rhine stevedoring servs.of,cir.we,in turn,review the brb for errors of law and for adherence to the statutory standard governing the brb review.id.where the alj relies on witness credibility in reaching his or her decision,our court will interfere only where the credibility determinations conflict with the clear preponderance of the evidence,or where the determinations are inherently incredible or patently unreasonable.todd pac.shipyards,office of workers comp.programs,cir internal punctuation omitted.finally,in considering petitions for review of brb decisions,we apply the administrative procedure act,including the directive that due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error.see also steel shipbuilding bonner,cir applying to a petition for review arising under the longshore act.under the rule of prejudicial error,we may overturn the alj decision only if the error prejudicially affected a substantial right of a party,which occurs only if it reasonably can be concluded that absent such error there would have been a contrary result.see gunderson dep t of labor,cir internal punctuation omitted.stated another way,we will not disturb the decision of an alj because of a harmless error.
our circuit has in substance undertaken harmless error review in past cases arising under the longshore act.see,office of workers comp.programs,cir,vacated on other grounds.we did not,however,refer to our review as harmless error analysis.we now confirm that harmless error analysis applies to petitions for review brought under the longshore act.we thus conform our practice to that of at least nine other circuits.see,consolidation coal williams,cir jericol mining,napier,cir am.stevedoring marinelli,cir staftex staffing,office of worker comp.programs,cir am.grain trimmers,office of workers comp.programs,cir en banc big horn coal office of workers comp.programs,cir wensel,office of workers comp.programs,cir hunter,office of workers comp.programs,cir.killingsworth,cir.that a path is a beaten one,justice jackson long ago observed,is a persuasive reason to follow it.see robert jackson,full faith and lawyer clause of the constitution,colum.
hawaii stevedores,first,argues that the alj erred in determining that ogawa claim was not barred by his failure to provide timely notice that his stroke was.under the longshore act,an injured worker who wants to preserve a compensation claim must give the employer notice of the injury within thirty days after the date of such injury or thirty days after the employee or beneficiary is aware,or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been aware,of a relationship between the injury or death and the employment.a.the longshore act excuses late notice under several circumstances,including where the employer was not prejudiced by the failure to give proper notice.id.d.the burden falls on the employer to establish by substantial evidence that it was prejudiced by the late notice.kashuba legion ins,cir.here,the alj found that ogawa notice was due by may,but that ogawa did not provide notice until the first week of june.the alj excused the late notice,however,finding that hawaii stevedores suffered no prejudice as a result of it.
the alj prejudice finding was supported by substantial evidence.the alj noted,correctly,that hawaii stevedores makes no allegation that it lacked evidence of ogawa medical condition following the stroke,as it had access to all of ogawa medical records,his doctors,and ogawa himself for two depositions and five independent medical examinations over nearly four years.see jones stevedoring,office of workers comp.programs,cir concluding that late notice was properly excused where the alj found that the employer had ample opportunity to conduct discovery and investigate workplace conditions.instead of providing any concrete example of how its investigation was prejudiced by the late notice,hawaii stevedores relies on a bare assumption that an immediate medical exam might have provided more or different information about ogawa recovery.such a speculative and conjectural theory of prejudice,however,is insufficient as a matter of law.see kashuba,at evidence that lack of timely notice did impede the employer ability to determine the nature and extent of the injury or illness is sufficient a conclusory allegation of prejudice is not.the alj finding that hawaii stevedores did not meet its burden of demonstrating prejudice was supported by substantial evidence,and ogawa late notice was properly excused.see jones stevedor
