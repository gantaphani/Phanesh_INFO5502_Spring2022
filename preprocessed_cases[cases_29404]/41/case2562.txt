on remand,both parties presented evidence relating to whether roberts had filed administrative grievances sufficient to toll the statute of limitations.in a detailed affidavit,roberts claimed that he filed approximately fourteen grievance forms.among them,he attests,were a grievance in june or july of complaining of lack of access to legal materials and a grievance no later than early september complaining of exposure to high levels of secondhand smoke.vol.i,doc,at.he asserts that he received no receipts upon submission of his grievances,nor any written responses to them.

the county is not providing inmates the tools needed to challenge their sentences or the conditions of their confinement through a law library,legal assistance,forms system or otherwise.
the grievance system at the detention center is not providing a meaningful path for redress of inmate complaints t he facility fails to document its actions in response to inmates complaints and fails to let the inmate know how it has responded.

burden of proof 
what might seem to be one roberts had exhausted his administrative really the foundation for two distinct legal issues whether equitable tolling applies to halt the statute of limitations,and whether the plaintiff met the plra exhaustion requirement before filing suit.both questions rely on roberts use of the institutional grievance process,and both must be answered in the affirmative in order for his suit to proceed.but although these two issues ask the same question of the same set of facts,they entail different burdens of proof.
in the prior appeal in this case,we left open the question of whether new mexico law or federal law provides the appropriate,presumably,the setting of the burden of equitable tolling.roberts.at.on remand,the district court seemed to assume without deciding that federal law governed the standards for tolling.we disagree.our court has held that state law governs limitations and tolling issues in cases.garrett fleming,cir fratus deland,cir wilson garcia,d t he length of the limitations period,and closely related questions of tolling and application,are to be governed by state law.superseded by statute on other grounds.
