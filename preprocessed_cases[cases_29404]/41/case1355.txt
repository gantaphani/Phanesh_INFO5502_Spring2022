once a strapping construction laborer,kevin simila claims that a mysterious pain disorder has withered his physical prowess and left him unable to work.simila applied for disability insurance benefits dib and supplemental security income ssi.but after a hearing,the administrative law judge alj was dubious of the severity of simila limitations.and for good reason.the record showed that simila had gone hunting and fishing,attended his sons peewee hockey games,and even helped a friend build a log after the time simila claimed to have become disabled.but no matter how fishy a claim for social security benefits might seem,an alj must follow the same rules for every case.she must refrain from playing doctor,properly evaluate the medical evidence and the credibility,and accurately incorporate the limitations into any hypothetical question used to elicit the opinion of a vocational expert.despite simila contentions to the contrary,we think that the alj adequately performed these duties in this case.the medical evidence lent little support to simila case and the alj had good reason to doubt simila testimony.and though imperfect,the alj hypothetical questions adequately described simila condition.we therefore affirm.
background 
kevin simila symptoms and treatment 
until simila symptoms began in,he worked as a construction laborer and an occasional carpet installer and bartender.in of that year,simila went to his primary care physician,enders,complaining of symptoms,headaches,and joint pain.enders,on staff at the midelfort clinic,examined simila and performed several diagnostic tests.he did not observe any apparent joint swelling,and simila test results for lyme disease were negative.during this visit,simila admitted to having abused cocaine intravenously in the past but stated that he never shared needles and had been for fifteen years.
simila stopped working construction around october,and returned to the midelfort clinic several times throughout october complaining of similar symptoms.enders noted that simila had arthralgias joint pain and myalgias muscle pain of undetermined etiology and prescribed vicodin to ease the pain.as for his headaches,a ct scan revealed that simila had a sinus infection.enders referred simila to bartynski,an otolaryngologist,who examined simila and surgically drained his sinuses.the procedure did not alleviate the headaches,though.
simila symptoms continued throughout the rest of.he continued to see a number of doctors and take pain medications such as vicodin and percocet during that time.he saw two neurologists,chukwudelunzu and dexter,who each examined simila but could not determine the cause of his pain.chukwudelunzu found that simila demonstrate d adequate fund of knowledge,attention,concentration and memory during history and neurologic examination,and that simila had normal muscle strength,coordination,and reflexes.chukwudelunzu diagnosed simila with chronic headaches but noted that i think this will turn out to be a chronic daily headache with possible superimposed headache,referencing simila pain medication.chukwudelunzu changed simila prescription to taper his percocet use and control his pain with other medications simila still continued to use percocet,though.dexter concluded similarly.he diagnosed simila with diffuse myalgias and headache,etiology unclear,observing that his muscle strength was normal,except for some giveaway weakness,a sign that simila might have been exaggerating the effects of his pain,see muriel lezak et,neuropsychological assessment ed.neurological examiners repeatedly noted weakness poor effort on strength testing indicating that the patient was actively preserving a disability status.emphasis is original.in addition,like chukwudelunzu,dexter concluded that the longer simila used narcotic pain medications,the more likely it was that the narcotics contributed to his headaches.
dexter also noted that simila had been somewhat active despite his pain.simila had explained to dexter that he was able to go out deer hunting and has been able to go out and take his son to hockey and hockey games,even though he experienced discomfort and soreness the next day.
simila also saw a rheumatologist,shelley,who,like other doctors,found little explanation for simila complaints.shelley observed that simila had no swelling in any of his joints,a normal grip strength,and a full range of motion without pain in his wrists,elbows,shoulders,hips,knees,ankles,and feet.shelley diagnosed arthralgias and myalgias of uncertain etiology and headaches,and noted that he did not see evidence to suggest the significance of an arthritic condition.
throughout this time,simila did not work and drew disability compensation from his union.enders and bartynski each twice signed off on simila disability forms.on the second of enders forms,completed december,enders noted that simila had been continuously disabled from october,through indefinite.
in,simila continued seeing enders and also began treatment at the mayo clinic.at mayo,he repeated his complaints of headaches and back,joint,and muscle pain,especially during physical activity.doctors noted that simila described how his joints hurt after he helped a friend replace a gas tank and how his fingers would become numb when he used a hammer or went bowhunting.several tests gave some explanation for simila back problems.in simila lumbar spine,tests showed degenerative disk disease with slight narrowing of the and lumbar disks with disk bulges and small associated annular tears,and in his cervical spine,tests showed mild degenerative changes.however,doctors noted that simila spine had a normal range of motion with a slight increase in pain with aggressive palpation of the right sacroiliac joint.doctors also found that simila had full range of motion in all four extremities.in addition,like the doctors at midelfort,multiple doctors at mayo noted that simila was overusing his pain medication they did note,though,that simila expressed interest in getting off of it.simila continued to receive disability payments from his union,and enders colleague,usher,signed off on simila union disability form.
simila doctors tried several different forms of treatment to reduce his pain,some of which were more successful than others.physical therapy was one of the less effective.noting that simila enjoys hunting,fishing,and four wheeling and playing hockey,the therapist developed a treatment plan for simila with the goal of reducing simila symptoms by.but simila never returned after the first session and was subsequently discharged.doctors also tried additional medications,which had some temporary success.enders prescribed depakote for headaches,and after a month,simila reported that his headaches were much less frequent.by march,simila reported he was about better.
enders also prescribed prednisone,a steroid,to improve simila muscle and joint pain.the prednisone was so effective that after two weeks simila reported a marked decrease in pain simila said it is all gone.enders noted that he was feeling so good that he has been doing some fairly heavy work for the last week involving peeling logs and helping to build a log home.simila reported only normal muscle soreness and stiffness after that work.simila also instructed enders not to complete another union disability form,and around april,simila returned to work as a construction laborer.but it did last.due to prednisone side effects,simila doctors reduced the dosage,after which simila complained that his pain symptoms had flared back up.simila stopped work again sometime during the summer or fall of.although the alj found simila to only have worked during june and july,some medical records indicate that simila was working as late as september.
doctors continued to try different medications to treat simila pain but saw limited success.they tapered simila off prednisone and started him on enbrel,a medication for joint pain taken by injection,which worked relatively well at first simila reported about percent improvement of his symptoms.but again simila complaints of pain returned,and in november,simila sought kent,a rheumatologist,to approve his union disability form.kent signed the form but wrote,while his musculoskeletal pain makes hard physical labor extremely difficult,i see no reason he could perform clerical work,simila had also returned to using narcotic pain medications,such as vicodin.
at this point,simila doctors had become increasingly uncertain of the cause of simila pain.they initially thought it was spondyloarthropathy,an inflammatory joint disease,but simila had no response to a medication that targeted that disease.kent opined that simila joint pain was most likely related to chronic pain syndrome,and another doctor suggested myofascial pain due to a lack of any objectively observable inflammation.when kent was again asked to complete simila union disability form,he noted that he told simila it is unclear to me why he is totally disabled,and this makes it difficult for me then to fill out his forms and make any predictions about the future.kent eventually signed the form and indicated that simila was disabled from october,through currently.
in december,muceno,a wisconsin state medical consultant,reviewed simila medical records to determine his residual functioning capacity.muceno concluded that simila could lift or carry up to fifty pounds occasionally and frequently that simila could stand,walk,or sit for a total of six hours in an workday and that simila had no postural,manipulative,visual,communicative,or environmental limitations.this report was subsequently confirmed by another state medical consultant several months later.
by,simila doctors appeared to have few remedies left to try michet,a rheumatologist at the mayo clinic,noted that simila treatment was at an impasse.michet recommended three infusions of remicade,a drug used to treat autoimmune disorders,and stated that if simila had not improved after that,then we are going to have to conclude that he has developed more of a fibromyalgic or myofascial chronic pain disorder t he next step for managing that would be a chronic pain rehab consultation.after the infusions,simila had not improved.were taken of simila spine,which again revealed mild degenerative changes.simila continued to take vicodin regularly.
in,simila was prescribed physical therapy by doctors at the pain clinic of northwestern wisconsin,although he stated that he was not interested in longterm therapy.a month later the pain clinic discharged simila because a toxicology screen showed evidence of cocaine.until that time,the pain clinic had been providing simila his vicodin.after his discharge,simila called the midelfort clinic and requested that they prescribe him vicodin,explaining that due to financial reasons,he could no longer get it from the pain clinic.simila received a prescription for a refill.
psychological evaluation 
at the request of simila attorney,paul caillier psychologically examined simila in february.caillier reviewed simila medical records and conducted an evaluation,which included simila completing a minnesota multiphasic personality inventory.caillier wrote a letter to simila attorney,dated march,in which he concluded that simila had chronic pain syndrome and a somatoform conversion disorder a mental condition that causes a person to experience physical symptoms of a purely psychological origin.
caillier talked with simila about his symptoms and medical history.caillier noted that simila mood was normal and he had adequate attention and concentration to the task at hand.simila described his symptoms in dramatic fashion,explaining that his pain kept him from functioning and that vicodin helped only minimally.caillier noted simila other doctors could not explain his pain and that simila was concerned about whether his children would develop his symptoms,which caillier wrote was typical of simila dramatic presentation.in addition,caillier interpreted simila results and found they revealed a classical conversion v pattern,which meant that simila converted stress and anxiety into physical pain.
from his observations and the test results,caillier concluded that simila somatoform disorder and chronic pain limited his functioning.caillier completed a psychiatric review technique a standard social security disability form,and on it,he noted that simila had marked restrictions of daily living activities moderate difficulties in maintaining social functioning marked difficulties in maintaining concentration,persistence,or pace and one or two episodes of decompensation an acute deterioration of a person mental health of extended duration.from these findings,caillier concluded that simila mental impairments met the requirements of listing,somatoform disorders,pt,subpt.p,app,which would classify simila as disabled for social security purposes.in the end,caillier recommended that simila take medications and receive counseling.simila had not sought counseling by the time of the hearing and the record does not reveal whether simila took.
simila testimony 
simila testified at a hearing before the alj on april.he described his prior employment as a construction laborer and how he worked as a bartender once a week and carpet installer occasionally.he testified that he would do a little more carpet installation work when construction was slow.
simila talked mostly about his pain,it affected his life and what he was able to do despite it.he testified that he felt constant pain in his joints,shoulders,elbows,neck,knees,ankles,and hips.his daily routine was limited and he barely got off the couch.he testified that he takes his children to school in the morning but upon return must take vicodin and lie down for a few hours.he testified that he often has to lie down if he stands or sits too long.however,he is able to drive,pick up a gallon of milk from the grocery,and run the vacuum he usually makes dinner for his family.
simila also testified that any physical activity exacerbates his pain he will pay for it the next day.he testified that he can not shovel snow or do car maintenance.but he does engage in some physical and recreational activities.he occasionally helps friends with various projects,such as the time he peeled logs and constructed a log home or when he helped clean a motorboat engine.however,he testified that,when building the log home,he was on prednisone and feeling much better.he also testified that his son did most of the work his sons would have been ages eleven and six at the time.in addition,he attends his children traveling hockey team games.he testified that he can stand for only twelve minutes one period of hockey and must sit between periods and sometimes during periods.
simila also enjoys fishing and hunting.when he hunts,though,he testified that he can walk only about yards into the woods before he has to sit down,and he can stay seated for only about four hours.he went ice fishing in the winter prior to the hearing but testified that he did little work and sat in his truck most of the time.he also went fishing two weeks before the hearing.he testified that the arm with which he cast and jigged his bait was pretty much useless the following day.
finally,simila testified that he still takes vicodin regularly,and after physical activity,he sometimes overeats his narcotic pain medication.he testified that he has not been to any psychological counseling,but if caillier recommended it,he would go.
medical expert testimony 
andrew steiner,a doctor of physical medicine and rehabilitation,reviewed simila medical records and testified that,in his opinion,there was a lack of objective evidence that simila was disabled.steiner testified that the evidence showed mild degenerative disk disease changes in the lumbar part of simila back and mild osteoarthritic changes in his neck.he also found that simila had some degree of hearing loss in situations.however,he found no evidence of any significant joint deformities,loss of range of motion,or gout.
based on these findings,steiner concluded that simila could perform light work,which translates to jobs that require lifting up to twenty pounds occasionally and ten frequently standing and walking for up to six hours and sitting for up to two.further,steiner opined that simila should be precluded from jobs involving hazardous machinery or unprotected heights due to his hearing loss.steiner specified that his opinion concerned only simila physical condition and not any psychological disorders.
vocational expert testimony 
finally,the alj asked william villa,a vocational expert,several hypothetical questions to determine whether there were any jobs that simila could perform given his limitations.the alj first described a hypothetical in which simila was limited to light,unskilled work that did not involve hazardous machinery or heights.she described simila as having the following ailments myofascial pain or musculoskeletal pain disorder,mild degenerative changes in the lumbar and cervical spine,intermittent gout,headaches,hearing loss,chronic pain syndrome,and somatoform disorder.based on this hypothetical,villa concluded that simila could perform a significant number of jobs in the national economy.the alj then limited the hypothetical to sedentary work only,and villa still concluded that there were a significant number of jobs that simila could perform.finally,when the alj altered the hypothetical to describe a person who was unable to show up regularly for work,villa concluded that there would not be any jobs available.
f.the alj opinion 
the alj evaluated simila claim for disability under the mandatory sequential analysis.see a dib,a ssi.the analysis requires the alj to examine 
whether the claimant is currently un employed whether the claimant has a severe impairment whether the claimant impairment meets or equals one of the impairments listed by the commissioner,see,subpt.p,app.whether the claimant can perform his past work and whether the claimant is capable of performing work in the national economy.
clifford apfel,cir first and second alterations in original.to determine whether the claimant is able to perform his past work or is capable of performing other work steps four and five,the alj assesses the claimant residual functioning capacity rfc.see e,b c,e,b c.a claimant rfc is the most the claimant can still do despite his limitations,and the alj determines a claimant rfc based on all the claimant impairments and all the relevant evidence in the record.id.a,a.
at step one,the alj found that simila had not engaged in substantially gainful activity after the alleged onset of disability.the alj deemed simila temporary employment in the summer of an unsuccessful work attempt and not fatal to his claim.at step two,the alj found that simila had multiple severe impairments due to musculoskeletal or myofascial pain,mild degenerative disk disease,headaches,hearing loss,chronic pain syndrome,and somatoform disorder.at step three,the alj concluded that none of simila impairments,physical or psychological,met or medically equaled any of the listed impairments.then,the alj found that simila had an rfc of light,unskilled work based on the objective medical evidence,simila course of treatment,his daily activities,his work history,and the medical expert opinion.accordingly,at step four,the alj concluded that simila could not perform his past work as a construction laborer.however,at step five,the alj accepted the vocational expert testimony,concluded that there were a substantial number of jobs in the national economy that simila could perform,and ultimately found that simila was not disabled.
simila appeals 
simila took his case to the appeals council and submitted additional evidence in the form of a letter from caillier to simila attorney,dated june.in that letter,caillier elaborated on his previous report and responded to the alj concerns regarding the severity of simila mental disorders.the appeals council denied simila appeal and therefore made the alj opinion the final decision of the commissioner.see craft astrue,cir.simila then filed suit in the district court,which affirmed the alj decision and ruled that caillier june letter was not new and material evidence and therefore should not be included as part of the record for judicial review.simila astrue,wl.simila then appealed to this court.
ii.discussion 
we review the alj decision directly,but we play an extremely limited role.elder astrue,cir.we will not displace the alj judgment by reconsidering facts or evidence,or by making independent credibility determinations.id.instead,we look to whether the alj built an accurate and logical bridge from the evidence to her conclusion that the claimant is not disabled.craft,at.we will affirm the alj decision if it is supported by substantial evidence,which is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.quoting barnett barnhart,cir.therefore,even if reasonable minds could differ concerning whether simila is disabled,we affirm if the alj decision has adequate support.elder,at quoting schmidt astrue,cir.
simila raises four points on appeal.he argues that the alj erroneously rejected caillier conclusions about the intensity of simila somatoform disorder and chronic pain syndrome the alj erred in evaluating simila credibility the alj hypothetical question to the vocational expert omitted key facts and the district court should have remanded because caillier june,letter was new and material evidence.
a.the alj decision to discount caillier letter of march,
simila first argues that the alj erroneously declined to place significant weight on caillier findings regarding the intensity of simila impairments.the alj did not challenge the underlying diagnoses that simila had a somatoform disorder and chronic pain syndrome.rather,she discounted caillier conclusions concerning the degree of functional limitation that simila ailments cause,because they were not supported by the objective evidence of record and were inconsistent with claimant testimony.the alj instead concluded that simila disorders resulted in only mild restrictions of activities of daily living mild difficulties maintaining social functioning moderate difficulties maintaining concentration,persistence,and pace and zero episodes of decompensation.consequently,at step three in the sequential analysis,the alj found that simila impairments did not meet or equal a listing level,which would have automatically declared simila disabled,a iii,and at steps four and five,the alj found that simila had an rfc for light,unskilled work,id.a iv v.
before we evaluate whether the alj properly weighed caillier conclusions,we must first determine what type of medical source caillier is.if caillier is deemed a treating source,then the regulations require that the alj give his opinions controlling weight,as long as they were supported by medical findings and consistent with substantial evidence in the record.see d skarbek barnhart,cir.if caillier is a nontreating source,however,the alj was not required to assign his opinion controlling weight.white barnhart,cir.instead,the alj was permitted to evaluate the opinion weight in light of other factors.see d elder,at.
a nontreating source is a physician,psychologist,or other acceptable medical source who has examined you but does not have,or did not have,an ongoing treatment relationship with you.caillier falls squarely within this definition.he examined simila only once,and nothing in the record suggests anything ongoing about their treatment relationship.furthermore,the regulations specifically define a nontreating source as any doctor with whom the claimant relationship was not based on your medical need for treatment or evaluation,but solely on your need to obtain a report in support of your claim for disability.id.caillier evaluated simila at the behest of simila attorney,evidenced by the fact that caillier report was in fact a letter addressed to the attorney and not to simila.accordingly,caillier opinions were not entitled to controlling weight.
simila attacks the alj decision to discount caillier conclusions on a number of grounds.primarily,simila contends that the alj improperly rejected the opinion of the only psychologist in the case,which left the alj without an adequate basis to assess the effect of simila somatoform disorder.in this sense,simila argues that the alj played doctor,because she had no other psychological expert opinion in which to ground her findings.see blakes ex rel.wolfe barnhart,cir.we find simila view of the alj role in evaluating psychological evidence too narrow.although another psychologist opinion would have augmented the alj analysis,neither the regulations nor our prior decisions require the alj to rely on such specific evidence to rebut a nontreating physician.t he administrative law judge is not required or indeed permitted to accept medical evidence if it is refuted by other need not itself be medical in nature wilder chater,cir emphasis added.instead,an alj is required to determine the weight a nontreating physician opinion deserves by examining how well caillier supported and explained his opinion,whether his opinion is consistent with the record,whether caillier is a specialist in pain disorders,and any other factor of which the alj is aware.d.
this is precisely what the alj did here,declining to give caillier opinion substantial weight because it lacked consistency and supportability.the alj noted that caillier found that simila had marked restrictions of daily living activities.but she concluded that this was inconsistent with simila testimony that he regularly took his children to school,often made dinner for his family,went hunting and fishing with friends and family,attended his son traveling hockey team games,and worked with friends on.caillier discussed none of these activities in his march letter,despite the fact that caillier appeared to base his conclusions concerning simila functional limitations on simila subjective complaints caillier did not claim that the only arguably objective measurement caillier the intensity of simila mental disorder.furthermore,the alj discounted caillier opinion as to simila social functioning because it,too,was unsupported by and inconsistent with the evidence.nothing in the record or in caillier letter suggests that simila had problems getting along with his family or friends or with the crowds at hockey games.instead,the alj pointed out that,throughout his medical treatment,simila doctors consistently described him as pleasant and enjoyable.
the alj also found little support for caillier conclusions that simila had marked difficulties maintaining concentration,persistence,or pace,and had experienced one or two episodes of decompensation.caillier letter mentioned simila capacity for concentration only once,in which he noted that simila had adequate attention and concentration to the task at hand.this was consistent with what chukwudelunzu observed several years earlier when he found that simila demonstrate d adequate concentration and memory during history and neurologic examination.simila argues that this does not prove that simila can maintain attention and concentration throughout the workday.but simila argument misses the point.in determining what weight to give a nontreating physician opinion,the alj is required to look for support.id.d.although these observations may not prove whether simila can concentrate on work,they certainly do not support caillier opinion that simila is markedly deficient in that area.
simila also attacks the alj finding that caillier did not perform a mental status exam,citing the fact that caillier prefaced his observations with the words on exam.whether these two words prove the alj incorrect,we can not say.those two words do tell us much about what kind of exam caillier was performing.nonetheless,any error here was harmless given the other reasons the alj cited for discounting caillier opinions.we agree with the alj that simila hunting and fishing,attending travel hockey games,and helping friends with maintenance and construction projects are inconsistent with caillier conclusions about simila functional limitations.
simila presents a barrage of other arguments,but to no avail.simila contends that the alj ignored objective evidence supporting caillier opinions,such as the results,michet note about simila needing chronic pain rehab,and steiner testimony that it is not unusual for doctors treating a person with somatoform to not find any physical causes.but the alj did discuss the,and as we mentioned,the results of that test said nothing about the intensity of simila pain,but only that simila had a somatoform disorder,which the alj accepted as true.moreover,the alj is not required to discuss every piece of evidence but is instead required to build a logical bridge from the evidence to her conclusions.craft,at.although snippets of michet notes and steiner testimony might support caillier opinions,other objective evidence is inconsistent with it many of simila medical records state that simila had a normal,range of motion and normal strength,and kent wrote that it was unclear to me why simila is totally disabled and he saw no reason he could perform clerical work.
simila also argues that the alj erred by failing to mention that caillier is a neuropsychologist whose opinions deserve more weight.see d.but the regulations state that a specialist opinion is generally entitled to more weight it is not presumptively so unlike treating physicians.id.emphasis added.mentioning caillier specialty might have made the alj opinion more complete,but in light of the other evidence the alj cited,it would not have changed the outcome.
finally,simila argues that the alj erred by not seeking additional evidence before rendering a decision.see id.c.an alj has a duty to solicit additional information to flesh out an opinion for which the medical support is not readily discernable.barnett,at.simila relies on barnett to contend that the alj was required to recontact caillier because she found his opinion unsupported by the record.simila reads barnett too broadly.an alj is entitled to evaluate the evidence and explanations that support a medical source findings.see d.and she need not recontact the source every time she undertakes such an evaluation,but only if,as we said in barnett,the medical support is not readily discernable.at emphasis added see also skinner astrue,cir aljs may contact treating physicians for further information when the information already in the record is inadequate to make a determination of disability.here,the alj discerned and discussed the evidence upon which caillier relied the results,his review of simila medical records,and simila subjective complaints.this record was not inadequate.the alj simply found that this evidence failed to support caillier conclusions,a finding the regulations entitled her to make.
in one instance,though,the alj should have recontacted caillier.the alj observed that i t is unclear whether caillier had access to the records indicating some concern with claimant narcotic usage.we agree with simila that unclear is tantamount to not readily discernable.however,we believe the alj error did not affect the outcome.and,again,the alj need not mention every strand of evidence in her decision but only enough to build an accurate and logical bridge from evidence to conclusion.craft,at.the alj discussion of the lack of consistency and support for caillier opinion built that bridge.accordingly,the alj decision to discount that opinion was supported by substantial evidence.
b.the alj credibility determination 
simila next disputes the alj finding that his testimony was not entirely credible.we review an alj credibility determination with deference,for an alj,not a reviewing court,is in the best position to evaluate credibility.craft,at.we reverse that determination only if it is so lacking in explanation or support that we find it patently wrong.elder,at quotation omitted.an alj may not discredit the claimant testimony as to subjective symptoms merely because they are unsupported by objective evidence.carradine barnhart,cir quotation omitted see also c.to evaluate credibility,an alj must consider the entire case record and give specific reasons for the weight given to the individual statements.ssr.in other words,the alj should look to a number of factors to determine credibility,such as the objective medical evidence,the claimant daily activities,allegations of pain,aggravating factors,types of treatment received and medication taken,and functional limitations.see c prochaska barnhart,cir citation omitted.in the end,a n alj may disregard a claimant assertions of pain if he validly finds her incredible.prochaska,at.
simila argues that the alj improperly discounted his testimony as to the intensity of his symptoms and the limitations that stem from them.relying primarily on our opinion in carradine,at,simila contends that the alj ignored the psychological nature of his illness,relied too heavily on objective medical evidence,mischaracterized simila past medical treatment,and incorrectly found his current activities inconsistent with his subjective complaints of pain.along these lines,simila also contends that the alj selectively considered the evidence,looking only to which types of activities simila performed but not to how he performed them or to activities he could no longer perform.
though the alj credibility determination was not flawless,it was far from patently wrong.the alj had plenty of reason to doubt simila description of his symptoms and the extent of the constraints they impose.to begin with,simila case is not quite carradine.in carradine,we reversed an alj finding of no disability where the alj failed to appreciate the psychological nature of the claimant somatoform disorder and relied primarily on the lack of objective medical data to support his conclusions.at.the alj in that case concluded that the claimant somatoform disorder implies she exaggerates the severity of symptoms she reports.id.at.that wrong.that the claimant has a somatoform disorder means merely that the pain has a psychological cause rather than a physical one.id.
here,the alj did make such a mistake.instead,the alj had a host of facts upon which to base her opinion that simila overstated his symptoms.chief among them was evidence of simila activities.simila helped a friend peel logs and build a log home he replaced a gas tank he attended his son traveling hockey team tournaments he went hunting and fishing including ice fishing in the winter and fishing from a boat just weeks before the hearing.these are not light tasks.they require extended physical exertion,which simila was seemingly able to perform.we disagree with simila contention that these activities are akin to the occasional driving,shopping,housework,and therapeutic walking discussed in carradine.id.at.
simila argues that the alj failed to follow ssr by selectively considering the evidence and not discussing how simila engaged in these activities.but the alj specifically noted simila testimony regarding the length of time simila spent doing each activity and that such activities exacerbate his pain.the alj merely discounted simila credibility as to how much this pain limited his continuing to hunt,fish,and go to hockey tournaments led the alj to conclude that simila can adequately deal with any increase in his symptoms.moreover,simila attempts to downplay his activities contradict several of his doctors reports and,in some instances,common sense.the reports reflect simila ongoing participation in certain activities,the patient enjoys hunting,fishing,and four wheeling and playing hockey as opposed to one or two discrete events.and,as we already mentioned,one physician,kent,openly questioned simila claims for disability i see no reason he could perform clerical work.even caillier noted simila tendency to describe his symptoms in dramatic fashion.moreover,simila description of how he engaged in certain activities is equally dubious when asked about peeling logs and building the log home,simila did point to the prednisone injections and say he felt good enough to work.instead,he responded,my son was doing most of the work i was there along with him.simila sons were eleven and six years old at the time.though we do doubt their strength,peeling logs which often requires using a chainsaw might make even paul bunyan a little tired.
in addition,the alj discussed the utter lack of objective medical evidence that might bolster simila complaints of severe,disabling pain.doctors consistently reported that simila had a normal,range of motion in his limbs and spine,mostly normal strength,and only mild degenerative disk disease in part of the spine.one physician even noted that simila exhibited some giveaway weakness,which can be a sign that the patient is trying to deceive his physician by feigning true muscle weakness.see lezak et,supra,at hans neville et,neuromuscular diseases,in neurology for the william weiner christopher goetz,ed.a pattern of weakness suggests lack of full voluntary effort.leonard green,malingering,dissimulation and,in trauma matthew bender because the deceptive patient is unaware or uncertain as to how much strength to exert and is not exerting maximal strength as he or she is asked to do,the resulting effort produces a ratchety,irregular,sudden feeling to the examiner counteraction.by contrast,the examiner finds a smooth loss of muscle resistance in a truly weakened limb.lee russ et,attorneys medical advisor reissued ed.noting that e xaminers sometimes employ a give away weakness test to demonstrate that a patient is faking muscle weakness,but expressing some doubt as to applicability of test to patients with reflex sympathetic regional pain syndrome.all this is on top of the fact that a set of government medical examiners concluded that simila could carry or lift over pounds occasionally and over pounds frequently.in short,simila medical history offers little or no for support his testimony.
simila attacks the alj reliance on this lack of objective evidence in light of our holding in carradine.in carradine,the alj plainly misunderstood the psychological nature of the claimant illness and his heavy reliance on the lack of an objective medical explanation for the claimant pain contributed to that error.at.but carradine does not imply that an alj can never consider the lack of objective evidence in rejecting a claimant subjective complaints.such a reading would nullify c and,which require an alj to consider the objective medical evidence.instead,carradine,consistent with the regulations,stands for the proposition that an alj can not deny disability solely because the available objective medical evidence does not substantiate the claimant statements.c emphasis added.here,the alj considered the objective evidence along with a host of other factors named in the regulations,see id.c,like simila activity levels,as we discussed.
the alj also evaluated simila course of treatment and employment history.she found simila pain medications,several injections,and one physical therapy be relatively conservative and inconsistent with simila complaints.simila assails the alj for playing doctor and improperly evaluating the extent of his treatment.simila again likens his case to carradine,in which we observed that the claimant extensive treatment regimen actually bolstered her credibility.at.however,the regulations expressly permit the alj to consider a claimant treatment history.c v.given the deference we show to an alj factual determinations,craft,at,we will not question the alj finding that simila treatment was relatively conservative,especially when compared with carradine treatment that included morphine and a surgical implant in her spine.see carradine,at.
moreover,simila seemed to have his own idea of what type of treatment he record shows a pattern of behavior.multiple physicians throughout the course of his treatment noted that simila was overusing his pain medication and that such overuse might actually be causing some of his symptoms,superimposed headache.even simila admitted that he occasionally overeats his pain pills.in addition,simila has a history of cocaine use,and in,the pain clinic of northwestern wisconsin discharged simila after a toxicology screening showed evidence of cocaine.this cut off his supply of vicodin.but simila had to have it.so he called the midelfort clinic for a refill and lied,telling them he could get a prescription from the pain clinic for financial reasons.though simila was successful in getting more pills,this is hardly the kind of conduct that helps one succeed on
