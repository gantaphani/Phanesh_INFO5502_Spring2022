secretary of health and human services kathleen sebelius appeals the district court order certifying a nationwide class of medicare beneficiaries and granting summary judgment in the beneficiaries favor.patricia haro,jack mcnutt,and troy hall are named plaintiffs.john balentine was haro lawyer in her underlying personal injury suit.
before the district court,the beneficiaries raised two claims the secretary practice of demanding up front reimbursement for secondary payments from beneficiaries who have appealed a reimbursement determination or sought waiver of the reimbursement obligation is inconsistent with the secondary payer provisions of the medicare statutory scheme and the secretary practice violates their due process rights.balentine separately claimed the secretary practice of demanding that attorneys withhold settlement proceeds from until medicare is reimbursed is also inconsistent with the secondary payer provisions.
the district court agreed with the beneficiaries.the court enjoined the secretary from seeking up front reimbursement of medicare secondary payments from beneficiaries who have received payment from a primary plan if they have unresolved appeals of their reimbursement calculations or unresolved requests for waiver of their reimbursement obligations.the district court also agreed with balentine and enjoined the secretary from demanding that attorneys withhold settlement proceeds from their clients until after medicare is reimbursed.the district court did not reach the beneficiaries due process claim.
on appeal to our court,the secretary raises three jurisdictional arguments.first,she argues that this case is not justiciable because neither the beneficiaries nor balentine had article iii standing.second,she argues this case is moot.third,she argues that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over all claims in the complaint.on the merits,the secretary maintains that her interpretation of the medicare secondary payer provisions is reasonable.
we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.we conclude that haro has demonstrated article iii standing on behalf of the class of medicare beneficiaries and that balentine has independently demonstrated standing to raise his individual claim.but we conclude that the beneficiaries claim was not adequately presented to the agency at the administrative level and therefore the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to g.we reach the merits of balentine claim,but conclude that the secretary interpretation of the secondary payer provisions is reasonable.we therefore vacate the district court injunctions,reverse the district court summary judgment order,and remand for consideration of the beneficiaries due process claim.
background 
statutory background 
congress enacted the secondary payer provisions of the medicare statute in to cut medicare costs.see zinman shalala,cir.those provisions make medicare secondary to other sources of insurance by forbidding medicare payments when a primary plan for instance,group health insurance or liability insurance is reasonably expected to make payment for the same medical care and by providing that certain medicare payments are conditional and must be reimbursed.b a,b.conditional payments are at issue in this case.
medicare makes a conditional payment when a primary insurer can not reasonably be expected to pay promptly.id.b b i.if medicare makes a conditional payment and the beneficiary later receives payment from a primary insurer,medicare is entitled to reimbursement.id.b b ii.specifically,b b ii provides that a primary plan or an entity that receives payment from a primary plan,shall reimburse medicare once the primary plan responsibility has been demonstrated by a judgment or settlement.id.we refer to this paragraph b b ii as the reimbursement provision.if medicare is not reimbursed within days after notice of the primary insurer payment,the secretary is entitled to charge interest on the reimbursement amount.id.
the statutory scheme also creates a cause of action by which the united states may recover from a primary plan or from any entity that has received payment from a primary plan or from the proceeds of a primary plan payment to any entity.id.b b iii.we refer to this part of the medicare statutory scheme as the cause of action provision.the cause of action provision allows the united states to seek reimbursement from the beneficiary herself.zinman,at see also g medicare has a right of action to recover its payments from any entity,including a beneficiary or attorney that has received a primary payment.
when medicare learns that a beneficiary has received payment from a primary plan,the secretary makes an initial determination of the amount of reimbursement due from the beneficiary.borrowing from the social security act,the medicare act incorporates administrative review procedures set out in b and judicial review pursuant to g.see b a.a beneficiary may contest the amount of reimbursement or seek waiver of any reimbursement amount.see id.
factual background 
patricia haro 
patricia haro was injured in a car accident and medicare paid for her medical treatment.haro filed a personal injury claim against the tortfeasor,which eventually settled.medicare,through the medicare secondary payer recovery contractor sought reimbursement of in a letter dated january.the letter informed haro of her right to appeal the reimbursement determination or seek waiver but also stated that haro must pay within days and that interest would start to run if payment was not made in that period.the letter encouraged haro to pay the amount in full,even if she decided to appeal or seek a waiver,in order to avoid interest charges.
haro disputed the reimbursement determination by letter dated january.haro lawyer sent a second letter,on february.in it,he argued that the reimbursement provision did not grant the secretary authority to seek payment from a beneficiary within days of notice of the settlement if the beneficiary had appealed the reimbursement determination.the letter also argued that the due process clause prohibits takings of property before there has been a determination of rights to that property.
medicare reduced haro reimbursement amount to by letter dated march.on march,likely before haro received notice of the revised reimbursement figure,haro sent medicare a check for.haro did not seek reconsideration of medicare reduced reimbursement amount and instead filed this lawsuit on march.medicare reimbursed haro the difference between and on april.
jack mcnutt 
like haro,jack mcnutt was injured in a car accident and medicare paid his medical costs.mcnutt personal injury lawsuit settled and mcnutt notified medicare of the settlement.medicare responded with a letter requesting reimbursement of.the letter stated that mcnutt was required to pay within days of the receipt of the settlement proceeds and that interest would start to accrue if payment was not received within that time.the letter also informed mcnutt of his rights to appeal and seek waiver of the reimbursement obligation.mcnutt appealed the reimbursement determination.
after medicare sent mcnutt a notice of the secretary intent to refer the debt to the department of treasury,mcnutt wrote a letter of appeal,but with his letter he enclosed a check for,the amount he believed he owed.medicare sent mcnutt an adjusted demand.because of mcnutt earlier payment,only including in interest remained outstanding.medicare notified mcnutt that his remaining reimbursement payment should be made within days.mcnutt sought reconsideration of that amount,and the secretary acknowledged that notice of intent to refer the debt to treasury was sent in error medicare then reduced mcnutt total reimbursement amount again,and mcnutt paid the remaining balance,plus interest.his administrative appeal was still pending at the time this appeal was filed.at the administrative level,mcnutt did not challenge the secretary practice of demanding up front reimbursement.
troy hall was injured while working and medicare paid for his medical care.after hall settled his worker compensation claim,he received a reimbursement demand from the secretary.hall appealed the secretary initial reimbursement calculation.medicare reduced the reimbursement amount and determined that hall owed nothing.at the administrative level,hall did not object to the secretary practice of demanding up front reimbursement.
john balentine 
attorney john balentine represented haro in her personal injury lawsuit and during administrative proceedings.he received a letter from medicare similar to the letter that haro received.it instructed him not to disburse settlement funds to his until medicare had been reimbursed,and said he would be personally liable if he did.balentine declared that he routinely receives similar letters from medicare.
district court proceedings 
as noted above,this appeal involves two separate claims against the secretary.first,the beneficiaries alleged that the secretary exceeded her authority under the medicare secondary payer provisions by demanding payment before resolution of the beneficiaries appeals or completion of the waiver application process.second,balentine alleged that the secretary demand that beneficiaries attorneys withhold settlement proceeds until medicare is reimbursed exceeds the secretary statutory authority.the beneficiaries also alleged that the secretary demand violated their due process rights.plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief.
in the district court,the secretary moved pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the secretary argued that the beneficiaries lacked article iii standing and had not exhausted their administrative remedies as required by g.the district court concluded that haro and mcnutt had article iii standing and that,with respect to mcnutt,g exhaustion requirement was properly waived.the district court denied the motion to dismiss.
on for summary judgment,the district court granted the named plaintiffs motion and certified a class of beneficiaries who had been or would be subject to demands for reimbursement from the secretary before their administrative appeals were exhausted.even analyzing the secretary practice pursuant to the deferential standard explained in chevron natural resources defense council,d,the district court determined that the secretary up front reimbursement requirement was inconsistent with the appeals and waiver processes.the district court therefore enjoined the secretary from demanding reimbursement of secondary payments from beneficiaries prior to resolution of their administrative appeals or requests for waiver.the district court also enjoined the secretary from demanding that attorneys withhold liability proceeds from their clients pending reimbursement of disputed claims.

iii.discussion 
jurisdictional issues 
on appeal,the secretary argues that article iii case or controversy requirement was not met in this case because neither the beneficiaries nor balentine had standing and because the beneficiaries claims are moot.the secretary also maintains that the district court lacked statutory subject matter jurisdiction.each jurisdictional argument is addressed in turn.
article iii standing 
beneficiaries 
in order to demonstrate article iii standing,a plaintiff must show a concrete injury fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.in a class action,standing is satisfied if at least one named plaintiff meets the requirements.bates united parcel,cir en banc.a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim and for each form of relief sought.daimlerchrysler cuno,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the standing formulation for a plaintiff seeking prospective injunctive relief generally requires that the plaintiff concrete injury be coupled with a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar way.bates,at quoting city of los angeles lyons,d.
a plaintiff is presumed to have constitutional standing to seek injunctive relief when the plaintiff is the direct object of government action challenged as unlawful.los angeles haven hospice,sebelius,cir citing lujan,at.here,haro was the direct object of the secretary allegedly overreaching collection practice.she received a letter requesting reimbursement before her administrative appeal had run its course.we therefore start with the presumption that haro has article iii standing,on behalf of the class,to challenge the secretary practice.see mayfield united states,cir when the lawsuit at issue challenges the legality of government action,and the plaintiff has been the object of the action,then it is presumed that a judgment preventing the action will redress his injury.
we consider whether the elements of article iii standing,as articulated in lujan,were satisfied at the time the complaint was filed.cnty.of riverside mclaughlin,d.when the complaint was filed,medicare owed haro the difference between the she sent to medicare in response to the first demand letter and medicare final reimbursement determination.haro had been deprived of for approximately one and had therefore suffered a modest but concrete fiscal injury that was directly traceable to the challenged action of the secretary.the first two prongs of the lujan formulation were therefore satisfied as to the beneficiaries claim.
the third element of article iii standing is redressability.the secretary argues that haro is not likely to suffer the same injury again and that she therefore can not show that injunctive relief would redress her injury.lyons suggests that haro must demonstrate that she was likely to suffer the same injury in the future,absent injunctive relief.at victim lacked standing to pursue injunctive relief against police where he was unable to demonstrate likelihood of future.but unlike the plaintiff in lyons,haro alleged injury was ongoing at the time the complaint was filed she was deprived of.an injunction prohibiting the secretary from withholding reimbursement payments until after completion of the appeals process would have redressed haro injury.see mclaughlin,at distinguishing lyons.because we conclude that a properly framed injunction would have redressed haro injury,haro has demonstrated the necessary criteria for article iii standing on behalf of the class.
balentine is not part of the beneficiary class he asserted an individual claim unique to his status as counsel for a medicare beneficiary.therefore,he must separately demonstrate article iii standing.daimlerchrysler,at.because balentine was the object of the secretary demand that he withhold disbursement of haro settlement funds,we begin with the presumption that he has standing to challenge the secretary action.los angeles haven hospice,at citing lujan,at.
the demand balentine received bears significant similarity to the demand at issue in los angeles haven hospice.haven hospice challenged a department of health and human services regulation implementing a cap on reimbursement for hospice care provided to medicare beneficiaries.see id.at see also i.haven hospice received a demand for repayment of the amount it had been reimbursed in excess of the statutory cap.los angeles haven hospice,at.the secretary maintained that the hospice did not have article iii standing to challenge the regulation or seek to enjoin its enforcement.id.at.but this court,applying the lujan presumption,concluded t he fact that the allegedly unlawful regulation was directly applied to haven hospice and exposed it to individual liability for the claimed overpayments,is sufficient to support its claim of article iii standing to pursue the declaratory and injunctive relief sought in the complaint.id.at.
the demand letter the secretary sent to balentine represents direct application of the secretary interpretation of her authority under g the letter states that medicare claim must be paid up front out of settlement proceeds before any distribution occurs,and that medicare must be paid within days of receipt of the proceeds from the third party.because g provides that medicare has a right of action to recover its payments from any entity,including a n attorney that has received a primary payment,the regulation subjects balentine to individual liability.consistent with los angeles haven hospice,balentine has demonstrated article iii standing.at.
the secretary next argues that the claims asserted in the complaint are moot a claim becomes moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.powell mccormack,d citation omitted.it is undisputed that haro did not challenge medicare final reimbursement calculation and is not owed any additional refund.but the district court concluded,and the beneficiaries maintain,that the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness applies to their claim.see,padilla lever,cir en banc quoting roe wade,d.
in sosna iowa,d,the supreme court held that mootness of a named plaintiff claim after class certification does not moot the action.after incremental extension of sosna the supreme court held that whether class certification occurs before or after a named plaintiff claim becomes moot is immaterial.mclaughlin,at that the class was not certified until after the named plaintiffs claims had become moot does not deprive us of jurisdiction.the court stated that where a claim is so inherently transitory that the trial court will not have enough time to rule on a motion for class certification before the proposed representative individual interest expires the relation back doctrine is properly invoked to preserve the merits of the case for judicial resolution.id.citations omitted.
here,haro claim expired before the district court certified the class.her individual interest in injunctive relief expired once she was fully reimbursed approximately one month after she filed this lawsuit but the district court could not have been expected to rule on a motion for class certification in that period.pursuant to the rule in sosna and mclaughlin,expiration of haro personal stake in injunctive relief did not moot the beneficiaries claim for injunctive relief.we conclude that the beneficiaries claim for injunctive relief is not moot,and that article iii justiciability requirements are satisfied 
statutory subject matter jurisdiction 
the secretary maintains that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction.the complaint alleged federal question jurisdiction under and,alternatively,jurisdiction under b a.the latter statute is a provision in the medicare scheme that incorporates g,the statute that establishes federal jurisdiction to review final decisions of the commissioner of social security.the district court determined that it had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to g.
a.the beneficiaries claim 
federal question jurisdiction does not extend to most claims arising under the medicare act.the medicare act incorporates.h,which provides 
no findings of fact or decision of the secretary shall be reviewed by any person,tribunal,or governmental agency except as herein provided.no action against the united states,the secretary,or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section of title to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter.
the series of cases interpreting h makes clear that it precludes federal question jurisdiction in this case.first,in weinberger salfi,d,the supreme court ruled that a claim arises under the social security act,for purposes of h,if the social security act provides both the standing and the substantive basis for the presentation of the claim.salfi held that a due process and equal protection challenge to provisions of the social security act could not proceed under.id.at.
the supreme court extended salfi to the medicare act in heckler ringer,d.there,the court ruled that there was no federal question jurisdiction to consider a challenge to a procedure for determining medicare benefits.the court described the procedural claim as inextricably intertwined with the substantive claim for benefits,but the court rejected the proposition that application of h depends on whether a claim is procedural rather than substantive,id.at.
finally,in shahala illinois council on long term care,the supreme court explained that the broad purpose of h is to ensure that claims are channeled so that the agency has the first opportunity to revise its own policies 
t he bar of h reaches beyond ordinary administrative law principles of ripeness and exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrines that in any event normally require channeling a legal challenge through the agency i t demands the channeling of virtually all legal attacks through the agency and assures the agency greater opportunity to apply,interpret,or revise policies,regulations,or statutes without possibly premature interference by different individual courts applying ripeness and exhaustion exceptions case by case.
d emphasis added citation omitted.illinois council continued,t he fact that the agency might not provide a hearing for any particular contention,or may lack the power to provide one is beside the point because it is the action arising under the medicare act that must be channeled through the agency.id.at emphasis omitted citations omitted.
here,the beneficiaries and balentine maintain that the secretary interpretation of the secondary payer provisions is unlawful and that the secretary application of the statute enabling regulations injured them.because the secondary payer provisions of the medicare act provide the standing and the substantive basis for the beneficiaries claim,h precludes original jurisdiction under.see salfi,at see also fanning united states,cir district court did not have federal question jurisdiction over class action complaint seeking to enjoin the government attempt to obtain reimbursement of medicare overpayments pursuant to the secondary payer provisions.pursuant to h,we conclude the beneficiaries claim is subject to the requirement that it be administratively channeled.
because the beneficiaries were required to satisfy the presentment and exhaustion requirements under g prior to seeking judicial relief,we must first determine whether haro fairly presented her claim at the administrative level.kaiser blue cross of,cir.exhaustion is waivable,presentment is not.id.citing mathews eldridge,d.only presentment is purely jurisdictional.eldridge,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the secretary maintains that g jurisdictional presentment requirement was not met because none of the named plaintiffs presented to the agency the claim that the secretary lacks authority to demand up front reimbursement.the beneficiaries rely heavily on eldridge to argue that a final decision from the secretary with respect to a claim for benefits entitles a beneficiary to raise any policy challenge in federal court,ostensibly on review of the secretary final benefits decision.we conclude the beneficiaries position is inconsistent with the purpose of the channeling requirement in h as explained by the supreme court in illinois council.
eldridge involved a social security beneficiary who,after responding to a questionnaire,received notice that a state agency monitoring his status had tentatively concluded he was no longer disabled.id.at.eldridge disputed one of the reports relied upon by the agency but otherwise stated that the agency had enough evidence of his disability.id.at.the social security administration accepted the agency determination and terminated eldridge benefits.id.eldridge did not request reconsideration of the administration termination of his benefits before filing a lawsuit and arguing that due process required that he be given a pretermination evidentiary hearing.id.at.
analyzing the district court jurisdiction to adjudicate eldridge claim,the supreme court ruled that t hrough his answers to the state agency questionnaire,and his letter in response to the tentative determination that his disability had ceased,eldridge specifically presented the claim that his benefits should not be terminated because he was still disabled.id.at emphasis added.the court continued,t he fact that eldridge failed to raise with the secretary his constitutional claim to a pretermination hearing is not controlling,g requires only that there be a final decision by the secretary with respect to the claim of entitlement to benefits.id.consequently,the court concluded that the nonwaivable jurisdictional element of g was satisfied.id.at.
the beneficiaries maintain that eldridge stands for the broad proposition that g presentment requirement is satisfied once a beneficiary has raised a claim for benefits.in their view,a final decision on a claim for benefits permits a beneficiary to raise any separate claim pertaining to the agency procedure or policy in federal court.we disagree.in our view,the beneficiaries reading of eldridge is overly broad.
the purpose of the channeling requirement is to assure the agency greater opportunity to apply,interpret,or revise policies,regulations,or statutes without possibly premature interference by different individual courts applying ripeness and exhaustion exceptions.illinois council,at.this purpose would not be fulfilled if plaintiffs proceeding through the administrative channel were permitted to raise claims in federal court that were not raised before the agency.see lifestar ambulance,united states,cir describing administrative review as the first step in a comprehensive statutory remedial scheme that fully empowers a reviewing court to consider and remedy any of the violations of law alleged by a plaintiff.
moreover,the beneficiaries interpretation of the presentment requirement is fundamentally inconsistent with the general rule that o nce federal subject matter jurisdiction is established over the underlying case between plaintiff and defendant,the jurisdictional propriety of each additional claim is to be assessed individually.caterpillar lewis,d quoting james moore,moore federal practice,ed.in eldridge,the general rule described in caterpillar was not contravened because the plaintiff argument that he was entitled to a pretermination evidentiary hearing had direct bearing on the termination of his benefits.notably,this case does not involve a claim for benefits because the beneficiaries do not challenge medicare reimbursement calculations.they challenge the secretary policy of demanding up front reimbursement,a policy that has no bearing on the reimbursement calculations questioned by the beneficiaries at the administrative level 
finally,illinois council,a case decided years after eldridge,persuades us that the beneficiaries interpretation of eldridge is too expansive.in illinois council,the supreme court addressed a case bearing directly on challenges to medicare regulations and made clear that the type of policy challenge at issue in this case is subject to the channeling requirement of h,and to the presentment requirement in g.illinois council,at nor can we accept a distinction that limits the scope of h to claims for monetary benefits.
we decline to adopt the extraordinarily broad reading of eldridge that the beneficiaries invite.we conclude that the named plaintiffs reimbursement disputes did not provide an opportunity for the secretary to consider the claim that her interpretation of the secondary payer provisions exceeded her authority.their requests for redetermination of their respective amounts of reimbursement did not constitute presentment of their policy challenge.
haro february,letter was not adequate presentment.
the beneficiaries rely solely on presentation of their reimbursement disputes as evidence that they fulfilled g presentment requirement,but we consider whether the requirement was otherwise satisfied.in the course of exchanging correspondence regarding the amount of reimbursement they each owed,only haro made mention of the argument that the secretary exceeded her authority under the medicare secondary payer provisions by seeking up front reimbursement.
haro requested redetermination of the amount of her reimbursement obligation by letter dated january,but her letter did not challenge the secretary authority to demand up front reimbursement.haro did make a brief objection to the secretary reimbursement practice in a letter dated february.but subsequent correspondence between haro and the secretary memorializes that both parties ignored haro objection.the correspondence shows that haro sent payment in response to the secretary initial demand.medicare then reduced its reimbursement demand,determined that haro had overpaid,and refunded to haro.with its refund,medicare gave haro notice that it was closing its file.haro did not object to the secretary closing her file,signaling that the parties had resolved their dispute.approximately one month passed between the time haro sent her february,letter and the time the secretary sent a letter reducing the reimbursement amount.approximately one additional month passed before haro was reimbursed for her overpayment.the record does not show that either of the parties ever followed up on haro objection to the secretary practice,and neither mcnutt nor hall ever objected to the secretary authority to demand up front reimbursement.
haro letter and subsequent inaction did not afford the secretary an opportunity to apply,interpret,or revise the challenged policies or regulation.illinois council,at.given the sequence of the parties correspondence,haro silence signaled abandonment of her objection and an end to her dispute with medicare.haro letter is not a basis for jurisdiction under g treating it as such would render h channeling requirement meaningless.do sung uhm humana,cir.
we conclude that the beneficiaries claim was not presented to the agency.because presentment is a jurisdictional requirement under g,the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the beneficiaries claim 
balentine claim is excepted from the channeling requirement.
attorney balentine brings a separate claim unique to his status as an attorney for a medicare beneficiary.as such,we must separately consider whether the district court had jurisdiction to adjudicate his claim.
between ringer and illinois council,the supreme court decided bowen michigan academy of family physicians,d.michigan academy appeared to limit the scope of the channeling requirement in h to quantitative,determinations.see id.at.but in illinois council the supreme court clarified that it is more plausible to read michigan academy as holding that the provision of the medicare statute that incorporates h into the medicare act does not apply h where application of h would not simply channel review through the agency,but would mean no review at all.illinois council,at.
because balentine is not a medicare beneficiary,he did not have the opportunity to present his challenge through the same administrative channel as the beneficiaries we are unaware of any other path to administrative review of the policy that balentine challenges,and the parties cite none.therefore,because applying h channeling requirement would mean no review of balentine individual claim,the claim falls within the very narrow michigan academy exception,see,and the district court had federal question jurisdiction under to adjudicate it.
b.the secretary interpretation of the reimbursement provision is reasonable.
having determined that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the beneficiaries claim,but that it had jurisdiction to adjudicate balentine claim under,we turn to the merits of the secretary appeal of the district court second injunction.
the district court concluded that the secretary practice of demanding that attorneys withhold client funds was inconsistent with the secondary payer provisions.the reimbursement provision states that an entity that receives payment from a primary plan,shall reimburse medicare for any secondary payment if it is demonstrated that such primary plan had a responsibility to make a primary payment,b b ii emphasis added,but it does not define entity.
the secretary has interpreted entity that receives payment
