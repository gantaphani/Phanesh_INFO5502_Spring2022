order amending opinion and amended opinion 
after review of a the petition for rehearing filed by appellee total renal care davita,davita,coupled with its motion to withdraw a portion of our opinion and to certify a question to the washington supreme court,and b the motion by washington retail association for leave to file a brief amicus curiae in support of that petition and motion,we 
deny davita petition for rehearing and its accompanying motion 
grant leave to file the amicus curiae brief and 
amend our opinion filed on march,slip,by inserting the following two paragraphs at page,at,after line and immediately above the caption failure to offer instruction on direct threat defense 
in its petition for rehearing,which has been joined by an amicus brief,davita argues that n either the riehl nor humphrey courts state or imply that arguably disabled employees are entitled to absolute protection regardless of their transgressions against the employer,let alone more protection than would be afforded a employee for the same misconduct.but the law often does provide more protection for individuals with disabilities.unlike other types of discrimination where identical treatment is the gold standard,identical treatment is often not equal treatment with respect to disability,holland boeing,en banc identical treatment may be a source of discrimination in the case of the handicapped,whereas different treatment may eliminate discrimination against the handicapped and open the door to employment opportunities.that why the ada and washington law require employers to make reasonable accommodations for disabilities.
that said,requiring prop.instr.in no way provides employees with absolute protection from adverse employment actions based on conduct.under the ada a plaintiff must still establish that she is an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.washington law has a similar provision t he prohibition against discrimination because of such disability shall not apply if the particular disability prevents the proper performance of the particular worker involved.even if a plaintiff were to establish that she qualified,under the ada the defendant would still be entitled to raise a business necessity or direct threat defense against the discrimination claim see a b.defendant may also raise the defense that the proposed reasonable accommodation poses an undue burden see id.here davita would be able to raise any analogous defenses available to it under washington law.our holding is thus far less controversial and sweeping than davita and the amici proclaim.
stephanie gambini gambini appeals the district court denial of her renewed motion,alternatively seeking judgment as a matter of law and a new trial,following a jury verdict in favor of her former employer total renal care,davita,davita.gambini originally brought suit in pierce county superior court in tacoma,washington,charging that davita had discriminated against her in violation of the washington law against discrimination washington law.to and the family medical leave act fmla,to.davita then timely removed the case to the united states district court for the western district of washington,where davita prevailed at trial.we affirm as to gambini fmla claim,but reverse and remand as to her washington law claim.
background 
in november gambini began working as a contracts clerk at davita,a company that provides dialysis to renal patients.it is undisputed that gambini had a history of health problems that predated her employment at davita.after several months at davita she began to experience depression and anxiety,and in april she experienced an emotional breakdown at work.gambini eventually met with a mental health provider at the community health clinic and was told that her symptoms were consistent with bipolar disorder.
upon returning to work several days later,gambini informed her supervisor robin warren warren that she was seeking medical treatment for bipolar disorder.when warren was promoted in may,davita replaced her with carrie bratlie bratlie,who became gambini new direct supervisor.gambini also told bratlie that she was suffering from bipolar disorder and requested several accommodations.in addition,gambini told her that she was experiencing mood swings,which she was addressing with medications,and asked that they not be personally offended if she was irritable or short with them.gambini privately divulged to bratlie that she was seeing a therapist and struggling with some medication issues.
gambini bipolar symptoms grew more severe in april found herself increasingly irritable and easily distracted and began to have a hard time concentrating or assigning priorities as between her tasks.gambini admitted to a fellow,who also suffered from bipolar disorder,that she was struggling to perform her job because of her symptoms.that recommended that gambini seek treatment from psychiatric nurse practitioner bobbie fletcher fletcher,who confirmed gambini bipolar disorder based on gambini short fuse,high energy,and propensity to exhibit anger and irritability.
during that period gambini current and former supervisors,warren and bratlie,convened to discuss gambini attitude and what they perceived as her poor job performance.their meeting culminated in a decision to deliver a written performance improvement plan to gambini at a later meeting that would include bratlie,gambini,and gina lovell lovell,the supervisor of payor contracting.accordingly,on july,bratlie emailed gambini,requesting that she come to bratlie office without indicating any specific purpose for the meeting.
upon arriving at bratlie office gambini was already agitated because she did not know the purpose of the meeting or why lovell was in attendance.when bratlie presented gambini with the improvement plan,the first sentence of which stated,gambini attitude and general disposition are no longer acceptable in the spa department,gambini began to cry.reading the remainder of the document did not alleviate gambini she found her face growing hot and felt a tightening feeling in her chest,as well as short ness of breath and shaking.when she had finished reading the performance plan,gambini threw it across the desk and in a flourish of several profanities expressed her opinion that it was both unfair and unwarranted.before slamming the door on her way out,gambini hurled several choice profanities at bratlie.there is a dispute about whether during her dramatic exit gambini warned lovell and bratlie that they will regret this,but bratlie did observe gambini kicking and throwing things at her cubicle after the meeting.back at her cubicle,gambini tried unsuccessfully to call fletcher to tell her about how upset the meeting made her feel and about her ensuing suicidal thoughts.
gambini reported for work the next morning and received a return phone call from fletcher who,alarmed about gambini suicidal thoughts,told gambini to go directly to the hospital.gambini told bratlie that she needed to check into the hospital,and bratlie asked gambini boyfriend todd demille demille to pick her up and take her to the hospital.when demille arrived,bratlie gave him fmla forms for gambini to fill out.she also signed the personnel change notice for gambini leave request.gambini went straight from work to joseph hospital,where her bipolar diagnosis was reconfirmed.
on july davita provisionally approved gambini request for fmla leave,subject to medical certification from her health care provider.additionally,davita human resource generalist mara mclemore mclemore began an investigation into the july meeting with gambini by interviewing gambini supervisors.during the investigation mclemore asked bratlie via email about gambini expected date of return.during the same time frame several employees sent emails to mclemore stating concerns about gambini outburst.for example,one employee specifically requested that gambini be prevented from returning to work.
on the following business day,mclemore and bratlie called gambini on her cell phone to tell her that her employment was being terminated.three days later gambini sent davita a letter stating that her behavior during the july meeting was a consequence of her bipolar disorder and asking davita to reconsider its decision to terminate her.when davita refused to reconsider,gambini filed this action,which proceeded to trial in december.
at trial gambini objected to the district court substantive jury instructions on each of her legal claims.after a jury trial,the jury returned a verdict in favor of davita on all claims.after the trial court denied her alternative motion,gambini filed a timely appeal to this court,challenging the giving of several jury instructions as well as the failure to give her proffered instructions,and 
standard of review 
where a challenge to jury instructions is at issue,prejudicial error results when,looking to the instructions as a whole,the substance of the applicable law was not fairly and correctly covered swinton potomac,cir,quoting earlier caselaw internal citations omitted.where an error is merely harmless,reversal is not required wall data los angeles county sheriff dep t,cir.as wall data,id.teaches,we review a district court formulation of civil jury instructions for an abuse of discretion,and w e review de novo whether a jury instruction misstates the law.here analysis reveals that the trial court committed reversible error when it refused to give gambini prop.instr.because it failed fairly and adequately to cover the issues presented and to state the law correctly,and because it was ultimately misleading.and because the case will have to be retried,we address other questioned instructions as well.
swinton,at quoting earlier caselaw,with internal citations omitted reconfirmed the standard for evaluating a verdict where the jury has been given an incorrect instruction 
an error in instructing the jury in a civil case requires reversal unless the error is more probably than not harmless.while this standard of review is less stringent than review for harmless error in a criminal case,it is more stringent than review for sufficiency of the evidence in which we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.in reviewing a civil jury instruction for harmless error,the prevailing party is not entitled to have disputed factual questions resolved in his favor because the jury verdict may have resulted from a misapprehension of law rather than from factual determinations in favor of the prevailing party.
that yardstick will be applied in our review of the actual and proposed jury instructions at issue on this appeal.
instructions regarding gambini disparate treatment claim 
instruction as to conduct resulting from disability 
gambini submitted and the trial court denied prop.instr.
conduct resulting from a disability is part of the disability and not a separate basis for termination.
we conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it declined to give that instruction and that such exclusion was not harmless error.
most significantly,the washington supreme court has itself enunciated the rule embodied in that instruction.on that score riehl foodmaker,en banc has stated explicitly 
conduct resulting from the disability is part of the disability and not a separate basis for termination.
in so doing riehl drew on our own holding in humphrey memorial hospitals ass n,cir,which in the context of the americans with disabilities act ada similarly articulated that conduct resulting from a disability is considered part of the disability,rather than a separate basis for termination.as a practical result of that rule,where an employee demonstrates a causal link between the conduct and the termination,a jury must be instructed that it may find that the employee was terminated on the impermissible basis of her disability.
because of the washington supreme court express reliance on humphrey,we may properly look to that decision in applying the washington law.indeed,the facts in humphrey are substantially analogous to gambini situation,and we held there at that a jury could reasonably find the requisite causal link between the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder and humphrey inability to conform her behavior to her employer expectations of punctuality and attendance,so that she was fired because of her disability.
as we have said,that principle has been adhered to by the washington supreme court,again in analogous circumstances.in riehl,at an employer terminated and refused to rehire an employee who began to suffer from depression and posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd after approximately five years of service.evidence that the employee mental disability motivated the adverse employment action included his supervisor written comments about the employee personality change after his illness,which suggest ed he was not the same as the old riehl id.in light of his favorable performance reviews and promotions within the company id.at,the supervisor comments suggest that the employer decision to fire not rehire riehl was based on riehl personality difference,which may have been caused by his disability id.at.in fact,when riehl was terminated he was told that the decision was not based on his performance id.at.
hence the court held that a jury could reasonably find that the mental disability was a substantial factor in the adverse employment actions,making the critical point that under washington law a plaintiff need not prove that the impermissible basis for the adverse employment itself the determining factor id.at.as mackay acorn custom cabinetry,en banc explains 
washington disdain for discrimination would be reduced to mere rhetoric if this court were to require proof that one of the attributes enumerated in the antidiscrimination statute was a determining factor in the employer adverse employment decision.
thus a decision motivated even in part by the disability is tainted and entitles a jury to find that an employer violated antidiscrimination laws.
failure to have instructed the jury on that score plainly requires reversal.at trial gambini presented evidence that davita signed an interrogatory response,which stated that one of the reasons it terminated gambini was because she had frightened her with her violent outbursts,as documented by emails to the people services department.her violent outbursts,like humphrey obsessive rituals or riehl subdued personality,were arguably symptomatic of her bipolar disorder.gambini had informed her supervisors about her condition and kept them apprised of her medication issues and the various accommodations she thought might reduce the chances of an outburst at work.when her temper erupted during the july meeting,gambini was in the throes of a medication change,which heightened the volatility of the mood swings that she and her health care providers were trying to get under control.
under all the circumstances it was surely permissible for a properly instructed jury to review the events culminating in the july meeting and gambini eventual termination and to conclude that it was her personality and not her work product that motivated davita.in fact,the very first sentence of the written performance improvement plan that bratlie presented to gambini on july stated,gambini attitude and general disposition are no longer acceptable in the spa department.it is undisputed that people who suffer from bipolar disorder struggle to control their moods,which may vacillate wildly from deep depressions to wild frenzies of hypomania.hence the record is replete with examples of how gambini bipolar disorder manifested itself through her irritability,her short fuse and her sometimes erratic emotions.
accordingly the jury was entitled to infer reasonably that her violent outburst on july was a consequence of her bipolar disorder,which the law protects as part and parcel of her disability.in those terms,if the law fails to protect the manifestations of her disability,there is no real protection in the law because it would protect the disabled in name only.as school board of nassau county,florida arline,d instructs,the disability discrimination laws are nec
