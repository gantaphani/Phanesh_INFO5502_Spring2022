refert claims to remember very little of her childhood due to repressed memories resulting from abuse.refert graduated from a new jersey high school and then attended rutgers university.in,refert graduated from seton hall law school,after which she clerked for a new jersey state judge and worked at various new jersey law firms.
in refert applied for the position of cheyenne reservation associate tribal judge.in her application,refert stated that she had attended an elementary school near the northern cheyenne reservation in montana.she also represented that she had attended a montana school that enrolled native american students,that she had spent a substantial portion of her life on a reservation,that she was born in sheridan,wyoming,and that she was affiliated with the northern cheyenne tribe in montana.refert was not selected for the position,but she was hired a few months later as chief tribal judge by the cheyenne river tribe.in february,refert moved to eagle butte,south dakota and began her work.in november,refert was removed from that position and began practicing law mostly in the tribal court.
in november,the cheyenne river tribal council addressed whether refert was actually enrolled as a member of the northern cheyenne tribe.at this meeting,refert claimed that she was native american and that she had been enrolled in the northern cheyenne tribe since birth.she stated that her personnel file contained verification of this information,as did her indian health services ihs file.her personnel file,however,did not contain such did her ihs file.refert later claimed that she lost her copies of the documents proving she was a tribe member when the roof blew off her mobile home.
ihs,an agency within the dhhs,provides limited free medical services to eligible native americans.during refert time in south dakota,between and,she received free health services from ihs based on her assertion that she was eligible as a member of the northern cheyenne tribe and was native american.during the investigation into her eligibility,refert represented that she had documents establishing her tribal enrollment but she never gave those documents to investigators.a dhhs investigation uncovered no proof that refert was enrolled in any native american tribe.
in october,ihs informed refert by letter that,based upon its information,refert had never provided the documentation necessary to establish her eligibility for services.the letter asked refert to provide the appropriate documentation within days or face termination of ihs services.refert never submitted the required documentation.
on august,an indictment was filed charging refert with one count of health care fraud,in violation of,and four counts of making a false claim against the united states,in violation of.although refert received free medical services on numerous occasions,the indictment singled out four specific visits march,an emergency room visit october,an outpatient pharmacy visit july,an emergency room visit august,an outpatient pharmacy visit.
during refert two day jury trial,the government called nancy davis,the deputy area director for ihs,to testify.the government introduced a briefing sheet that ihs shares with patients to explain ihs eligibility.davis testified that a patient must be a member of a federally recognized tribe or must prove descendancy of a member of a federally recognized tribe to be eligible for free ihs services.davis testified that each tribe has the authority to create its own membership criteria and that membership is typically based on blood quantum.davis also testified that because ihs is only funded at fifty percent of its need,the burden is on the patient to prove their eligibility.davis,however,acknowledged that in the past,some individuals who have not proven eligibility nonetheless received free care over a long period of time.davis also explained that ihs will treat any person for genuine emergencies,even if the individual is ineligible for ihs.the cost of the services is then billed to the person or their insurance company.
with respect to refert specifically,davis testified that refert filled out a standard new patient sheet on her first visit to ihs.on that document,refert wrote that she was born in sheridan,wyoming,was enrolled in the northern cheyenne tribe,and had native american blood.on another similar form,refert wrote down a different birth place,lame deer,wyoming,and added that her mother was born in onondaga,new york.davis testified that refert never produced the documents necessary to show that she was eligible to receive ihs services.
on refert attorney asked davis if ihs used the ihs briefing sheet,which gave a overview of ihs services and eligibility,to determine eligibility.davis responded that the briefing sheet was a resource created to share with people that was easier to understand than the actual regulation.davis reiterated throughout her testimony that the short explanatory document was not the entire ihs regulation.
refert attorney entered the primary ihs regulation into evidence and questioned davis about following the language in the regulation 
generally,an individual may be regarded as within the scope of the indian health and medical service program if is regarded as an indian by the community in which lives as evidenced by such factors as tribal membership,enrollment,residence on land,ownership of restricted property,active participation in tribal affairs,or other relevant factors in keeping with general bureau of indian affairs practices in the jurisdiction.
davis testified that a tribe may choose to authorize american access to ihs services but it is customary for a resolution to be presented to the tribal council in order to officially recognize the individual.davis testified that the specific tribe may decide if an individual is regarded as an indian by the community and therefore should be eligible for ihs.davis testified that working in the community and associating with its members does not create eligibility for ihs services in the absence of tribal action.
in her defense,refert testified that she submitted the appropriate eligibility documents with her ihs application for benefits but that those documents could not be found because of a political vendetta or conspiracy against her.when asked by her attorney if she was a member of the native american community she answered that she was.refert also testified that she knew she had to be eligible to receive treatment from ihs.
the district court selected eighth circuit pattern jury instruction to explain the elements of the false claim charges in instructions through given to the jury.instruction and further explained the government burden of proof.instruction stated the elements of health care fraud.
the jury found refert guilty
