beginning at the end of,amrhein formed an opinion that she and redpath were not treated equally at hcsc.she felt that redpath was assigned significantly less work than she was and that redpath did not pull his weight with either the united airlines or georgia pacific accounts.amrhein let this opinion be known to several hcsc employees,including benner.
in a performance review drafted by benner and dated february,amrhein received favorable marks for all competency areas,but only met the targeted standard with respect to contributions to team and technical quality.she received a salary increase.amrhein did not think this review or the salary increase reflected the quality of her work,and she felt that she was being penalized for complaining about redpath.
over the following year,amrhein was disciplined by hcsc on two separate occasions.employees of hcsc were required to follow the hcsc code of conduct and business ethics code.the code forbade the misuse of corporate assets,which had been interpreted to include the overuse of company telephones for personal purposes.the code also prohibited the disclosure of proprietary business information.hcsc monitored the quality of the group specialist work with quality coordinators.the coordinators would randomly telephone conversations of group specialists and listen for violations of the code.
during a taped phone conversation with a representative from a competing company in january,amrhein disclosed information that karen woods believed to be proprietary business information.amrhein divulged the amount of the fee hcsc charged its customers for a certain service,and further suggested that hcsc had not trained its employees on compliance with the health insurance portability and accountability act.amrhein was suspended without pay for five days and placed on probation.amrhein claimed that there was nothing improper about the conversation,and that the real reason hcsc suspended her was that she had complained about her performance review.
a warning issued by benner to amrhein on december,indicated that her use of the telephone for personal use was excessive amrhein did not believe her personal telephone use was particularly excessive and argued to benner that redpath use exceeded her own,and that redpath,who did not receive a warning,should have.
on december,marquedant,benner,and amrhein met to discuss the telephone use and amrhein frustration regarding the warning.during that meeting,amrhein stated that she felt she was being treated significantly less fairly than redpath by benner and hcsc.she also suggested that she might seek an eeoc mediator,or file a complaint in order to obtain one.
on december,amrhein sent an to marquedant regarding her treatment at hcsc.in the she discussed how her behavior and work product far exceeded that of redpath,but that redpath received preferential treatment.she stated that she felt that this amounted to sexual discrimination.also in the,amrhein detailed a series of personal tragedies that she had experienced between june and december.her father passed away on june,her died unexpectedly on september,and her niece was hospitalized in november after expressing suicidal tendencies.marquedant notified woods and human resources representative yvonna cosey of amrhein concerns.cosey investigated amrhein various complaints.
on january,amrhein met with cosey and marquedant.cosey informed amrhein that she found no evidence of gender discrimination.amrhein then expressed her intent to file a complaint with the eeoc the following day,marquedant notified benner and woods of amrhein intent to file an eeoc claim.
on february,woods sent an to her supervisor asking for help in addressing their options with amrhein.woods noted that amrhein was a huge challenge and was disruptive to the unit and costing us a huge amount of time and resources.
on february,marquedant met with several group specialists,including amrhein,to discuss new policies regarding the scheduling of personal time off or pto.during the meeting,amrhein complained about the scheduling of her pto,to which marquedant responded that if you wanted to schedule all of your days,you should not have made the complaint,and referenced amrhein opening up a can of worms.the argument escalated quickly witnesses characterized amrhein behavior in the meeting as argumentative.
also in,marquedant,while monitoring amrhein calls for personal use,overheard amrhein make what she judged to be an inappropriate disclosure.the call,which took place on january,was between amrhein and cathy perricone,an employee of united airlines.amrhein suggested in that conversation that staff reallocation at hcsc had been due to the need for hcsc to meet performance guarantees,which were contractual performance expectations that hcsc had to meet to avoid financial penalties.marquedant notified benner and woods of her opinion that this disclosure violated the code confidentiality policy.after discussing various options,cosey,woods and marquedant made the decision to terminate amrhein.amrhein was notified on march,that she was terminated for the perricone conversation and insubordination at the february,meeting.
on january,amrhein filed a complaint against hcsc,alleging that hcsc had discriminated against her based on her gender in violation of a and had terminated her in retaliation for her efforts to oppose gender discrimination in violation of.on february,the district court granted hcsc motion for summary judgment.this timely appeal followed.
