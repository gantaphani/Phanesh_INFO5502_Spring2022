a jury found that united parcel service ups had discriminated on the basis of disability,under the maine human rights act mhra,against its epileptic employee paul warren.ups refused to reinstate warren to his position as a driver of a commercial vehicle,and kept him in a position at the same pay but from which he was ineligible to earn overtime as he previously had done.warren was awarded back pay of.the district court ordered warren to be reinstated unless and until ups has legal reasons to take him off the job.the district court also awarded warren front pay for overtime from the date of his jury award until his reinstatement.
ups appeals,arguing that four of the district court jury instructions were in error under the mhra disability provision.the claimed errors are in the placing of the burden for the mhra safety defense,the elements of the mhra safety defense,the reasonable accommodation instruction,and the record of and regarded as instruction on disability.there is no appeal from the damages award.
ups defense at trial was that federal law prohibits persons with epilepsy from driving commercial vehicles of pounds or more.state law regulates the driving of trucks under that weight,and maine law has no such flat prohibition.nonetheless,ups refused to reinstate warren to drive the vehicle that he drove before his epilepsy diagnosis,reasoning that as there is a safety risk resulting from epilepsy,the risk is there regardless of the weight of the truck,and that it wants its drivers to be able to drive all of its vehicles,including those pounds or more.
the most significant question in this case is how maine law treats the issue of safety risk in the context of disability discrimination.neither the mhra nor the decisions of the maine law court flatly answer the question.the federal district court judge,predicting how maine would address the question,concluded that maine would treat safety solely as a matter of defense for the employer to show.the court did so based on differences in language between the federal americans with disabilities act ada and the mhra,the amendment to and recodification of the act by the maine legislature,and the reasoning of the maine law court in other cases.we find no error in the district court prediction based on present maine law 
paul warren worked as a ups package delivery driver from until,when he started suffering from symptoms associated with epilepsy.in his last year of driving,he drove the route between rockland,maine and whitefield,maine the whitefield route in an delivery van.
in,warren had a simple partial seizure while he was driving his package delivery route.this type of seizure is characterized by a,which for warren means that he perspires and develops goosebumps.during that,warren pulled over to the side of the road,waited for the symptoms to subside,and then continued on his route.he then went to the doctor and was eventually diagnosed with partial epilepsy.based on consultation with his doctor,warren decided to stop working temporarily and ups accommodated his decision.during this time,he received disability benefits and began to take medication to control his seizures.
because his medication was not totally effective,in early,warren was referred to another doctor who added another medication to his regimen.after treating warren over the next few months,the doctor cleared warren to restart work in a position at ups in june.this was about a year since he had stopped working.
with that medical clearance,warren initially requested ups find him a position.ups said there was no such work available for warren in the rockland processing center.warren then sought assistance from his union.the union filed a grievance,and a grievance committee ordered ups to find warren work in the rockland center.ups did so,and warren returned to work at the rockland center in january,washing vehicles and loading packages into vehicles.in this position,warren had very minimal opportunities to work overtime,which eliminated at least per week from his earnings.
in september,warren doctor informed ups that because warren seizures had come under excellent control,he had cleared warren to resume work as a package car driver.warren requested resumption of his former commercial driving route.ups then referred warren to its own doctor,an occupational medicine specialist,for a second opinion.the ups doctor agreed that warren seizures were well controlled,that warren was not at risk of los ing voluntary control,and that there was no concern of loss of consciousness.the doctor concluded that warren could resume driving,but that warren would not be eligible for a department of transportation dot commercial driver license a dot card,which under dot rules can not be granted to individuals who have been diagnosed with epilepsy or are taking medication.see b,f.the doctor found,however,that as long as warren took his medications regularly,warren was fit for duty and that he may safely drive any ups vehicle not requiring dot licensure.
under federal regulations,a driver is required to have a dot card to operate any commercial motor vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of pounds or more.see id.although not all of ups package trucks are pounds or more,warren ineligibility for a dot card was nonetheless relevant because it is the company policy to require a dot card for all of its package car drivers regardless of the size of the particular vehicle they drive.because of this policy,ups refused to return warren to his driving position,and warren continued working in his position 
on june,warren made a written request to return to work as a driver on the whitefield route,a route on which an vehicle is used.this litigation centers on warren june request.warren made the request through his union representative,terry hanlon,to sue davis,ups regional labor relations manager.the request stated that hanlon had communicated with the dot and that the dot had informed hanlon that warren would fall outside its regulations were he to drive a vehicle smaller than pounds.over the next few months,davis and hanlon spoke on several occasions regarding warren request.aside from conversations with one of her employees,hanlon,and ups counsel,davis took no other steps to evaluate warren request.davis testified that no individualized assessment of warren medical condition was conducted.in november,davis sent an to hanlon denying the request,citing to ups dot card policy.
warren then pursued a grievance through his union representative,hanlon.in front of the grievance committee,hanlon argued that based on the collective bargaining agreement,the ada,and the mhra,warren had a disability but was nonetheless entitled to drive.the grievance committee came down somewhere in the middle.it remanded the grievance to both ups and the union,instructing ups to ensure warren had eight hours of work a day in the rockland center,but it did not order ups to return warren to his driving position.
in december,warren filed a complaint with the maine human rights commission charging that he was unlawfully discriminated against on the basis of disability,based on his june request for reinstatement.in june,the commission determined that there were reasonable grounds to believe that unlawful discrimination had occurred,and subsequently made attempts at conciliation with ups.conciliation was unsuccessful,and in september,the commission referred the case for litigation.warren also received a letter from the equal employment opportunity commission in march.
in april,warren filed suit against ups in federal district court,asserting that the denial of his june reinstatement request was a violation of both the ada and the mhra,and seeking reinstatement to his driving position,back pay,and compensatory and punitive damages.after the suit was filed,ups began a further evaluation of warren medical condition.ups requested warren medical records,and its occupational health managers consulted with an outside occupational health expert to determine whether it would reinstate warren to a driving position.after a conference call with the outside expert,the local occupational health manager
