the iowa department of human services the department or state appeals from the district court judgment that the department violated the mandates of title xix of the social security act,et.supp medicaid act or act,when it refused to fund surgery for the plaintiff,john smith pseudonym.we reverse.
smith,now years old,was born with the physiology of a female.he suffers from the psychiatric condition gender identity disorder,which when severe,equates with what is popularly known as transsexualism.sharon satterfield,smith primary treating psychiatrist and a specialist in gender identity disorder,has determined that sex reassignment surgery essentially a transition from female to male physical features is the necessary treatment for smith.this transformation involves several different surgical procedures,hormonal treatment,and psychological counseling.smith has already undergone the surgery for breast reduction and contouring.at this stage,smith seeks payment from the department for the final surgical procedure,which is a phalloplasty,the creation of a body part that simulates a penis.the department administrator of the division of medical services,donald herman,testified at trial that the state medicaid program covers psychotherapy and medication prescribed for psychiatric conditions such as gender identity disorder,but that surgical procedures are not covered.the department has funded procedures for smith,such as a hysterectomy,that were medically necessary for diagnosed conditions other than his gender identity disorder.
medicaid is a program through which the federal government provides funds for the provision of health care services to needy individuals through the participation of the states,which act as administrators of the funds.arkansas med.soc y,reynolds,cir.states are not required to participate in the medicaid program,but if they do they must comply with the requirements of the medicaid act and its regulations.reynolds,at.although the medicaid act does not require states to provide funding for all medical treatment falling within categories of medical services,it does require that state medicaid plans establish reasonable standards for determining the extent of medical assistance under the plan which are consistent with the objectives of the medicaid act.beal doe,d quoting a.once a state decides to provide certain optional medical services,it is bound to act in compliance with the statute and its applicable regulations,which include the requirement that each service be sufficient in amount,duration,and scope to reasonably achieve its purpose.b see weaver reagen,cir.
the medicaid act defines medical assistance as payment of part or all of the cost of enumerated care and services a.as a general matter,a state may choose which enumerated services to provide,but some services are mandated for most categories of needy persons who receive services under the plan.a a,a.as the seventh circuit has stated,under the medicaid act there are essentially three categories of potential categorically needy,the medically needy,and those whose need is determined in relation to the poverty level.addis whitburn,cir.a state plan must provide for medical assistance to the categorically needy,but the state may choose whether to provide services to those persons within the classification of medically needy,who do not qualify for some forms of federal assistance but who nonetheless lack the resources to obtain adequate medical care.hodgson board of county comm rs,county of hennepin,cir.once a state elects to provide optional services,it is bound to act in compliance with statutory sections and regulations in the implementation of those services.meyers reagan,cir.
smith is within a covered medically needy classification of medicaid recipients,but the department refused payment for a phalloplasty because the procedure is excluded by a state regulation that prohibits funding for plastic surgery for certain purposes and which specifically excludes sex reassignment surgery.on may,smith brought suit under,alleging that the medicaid act provides an enforceable federal right to reasonable standards for the determination of the extent and scope of services that a state will provide and contending that the regulation that excludes funding for surgery for gender identity disorder is unreasonable and thus violates his right under the act.
the department does not dispute that smith is eligible for coverage under the medically needy classification of medicaid or that he is ready for the phalloplasty.the department contends that smith does not have an enforceable right under section,that the district court erred in an evidentiary ruling that limited the testimony of its expert witness,and that the district court erred when it concluded that the application of the regulation violated smith right.assuming for the purposes of this case that smith has an enforceable federal right,we reverse the district court judgment because the department regulation does not violate that right.
we first address the department argument regarding the district court evidentiary ruling.at trial,the department offered the expert testimony of randall kavalier.the district court limited kavalier testimony to general psychiatric principles and basic diagnostic criteria by excluding those opinions he offered concerning the effectiveness and necessity of sex reassignment surgery in general and for smith in particular.the district court found that kavalier testimony about gender identity disorder and the potential treatment options was unreliable because his opinion was based on an indiscriminate literature review and was beyond the scope of his expertise.
the federal rules of evidence grant expert witnesses testimonial latitude unavailable to other witnesses on the assumption that the expert opinion will have a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of his discipline.kumho tire carmichael,d quoting daubert merrell dow,d.w here such testimony factual basis,data,principles,methods,or their application are called sufficiently into question the trial judge must determine whether the testimony has a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of the relevant discipline.id.at.quoting daubert,at.alteration in original.a district court determination of the reliability of a proposed expert testimony is reviewed under an standard.id.at.
kavalier is an experienced,general psychiatrist who has treated several patients with sexual disorders.kavalier,however,had examined only one patient with gender identity disorder,that examination occurring some eight years prior to trial in this case,and had had limited contact with that patient.his opinion concerning treatment of smith was founded on a literature review,a review of smith file,and two interviews with smith.the district court concluded that kavalier lacked expertise in the specialized discipline of gender identity disorder and noted that the opinion he offered disagreed with sources he acknowledged to be respected medical sources on that condition.thus,although the court accepted some of kavalier testimony,it concluded that his opinion regarding the treatment of gender identity disorder lacked a reliable basis.
we have found no abuse of discretion in the limitation of the testimony of witnesses who,although considered experts in certain areas,were not in the particular discipline relevant to their testimony.see dancy hyster,cir gier educational serv.unit,cir watkins schriver,cir uniroyal goodrich tire,cir.likewise in the present case,because kavalier testimony was based neither on his personal experience nor on his knowledge of the relevant discipline,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in limiting kavalier testimony to general principles and diagnostic criteria.
turning to the merits,we have held that t he medicaid statute and regulatory scheme create a presumption in favor of the medical judgment of the attending physician in determining the medical necessity of treatment.weaver,at see pinneke preisser,cir.at the same time,medicaid was designed to provide the largest number of necessary medical services to the greatest
