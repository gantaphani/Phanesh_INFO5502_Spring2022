richard kalish,who suffers from a heart condition and depression,began receiving disability benefits under a group insurance plan the plan issued to his employer by liberty life assurance company of boston.the benefits ended,however,when liberty determined that kalish was no longer disabled under the terms of the plan.after exhausting his administrative appeals,kalish brought this action to recover benefits from liberty pursuant to a b of the employee retirement income security act erisa.the district court granted judgment on the administrative record in favor of liberty.
kalish argues on appeal that the district court erred in holding that the arbitrary and capricious standard of judicial review applies to this case despite liberty conflict of interest as both insurer and plan administrator,liberty could deny benefits because kalish was capable of sedentary work,liberty decision to deny benefits for kalish heart condition was not arbitrary and capricious,and liberty was not required to consider evidence of kalish alleged depression.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court affirming liberty denial of benefits and remand this case for entry of an order requiring liberty to award benefits plus interest from the date on which kalish benefit payments ceased.
background 
factual background 
kalish worked for deluxe video services,a company affiliated with rank america,before his health problems began.as an employee,he was covered by rank america disability insurance policy.liberty is both the insurer and administrator of the plan.under the terms of the plan,kalish was to receive monthly disability benefits equal to of his monthly income if he became unable to perform all of the material and substantial duties of his occupation on an active employment basis because of an injury or sickness.
kalish was the director of national transportation for deluxe video.he was responsible for ensuring that newly released video and dvd movies arrived at nationwide distribution centers on a basis.according to the form that kalish supervisor at deluxe video completed and returned to liberty,kalish job duties required him to direct all aspects of transportation operations,handle all carrier negotiations,travel to locations,and direct an staff of employees.his supervisor further described kalish job as a high stress position with many deadlines and significant contact.in addition to four hours of sitting,kalish position required him to spend one hour standing,one hour walking,and one hour reaching at shoulder level on a daily basis.
kalish suffered two separate heart attacks in may and july of.immediately following the first heart attack,kalish filed a claim with liberty.he received disability benefits for days,the limit for such benefits under the plan.then,in december of,kalish filed another claim with liberty,this time seeking disability benefits.
in order to process this claim,liberty requested additional documentation from kalish treating physicians.among the physicians were eisenberg,an internist,and raminick,a gasteroenterologist,both of whom had been treating kalish before his heart problems began and continued seeing him after his heart attacks.eisenberg and raminick provided liberty with copies of their medical records,which document kalish problems with hepatitis,diabetes,hypertension,peptic ulcers,and sleep apnea.
the bulk of the medical reports considered by liberty,however,were generated by rasak,the cardiologist who treated kalish for his heart condition.in addition to providing liberty with copies of kalish medical records,rasak sent liberty a letter in january of that stated at this point,i do not see kalish functioning well in a workplace and feel that he should be completely and totally disabled.rasak also opined that never can kalish work an day on account of his severe coronary artery disease.in support of this opinion,rasak repeated that kalish is severely debilitated as a result of his extensive damage to his heart,and that,i f it were not for the patient hepatitis c,the patient may be a candidate for a cardiac transplant.rasak further observed that kalish suffered from hypertension,diabetes,hepatitis c,peptic ulcer disease,sleep apnea and hypercholesterolemia.
as part of its review process,liberty sent an investigator to kalish home in january of to conduct an interview and obtain a statement from kalish.liberty investigator observed that the claimant appeared tired,but was very cooperative.he also reported that kalish appears to have a limited lifestyle,due to tiring easily.in reaching his final conclusion that kalish was highly credible,the liberty investigator stated that kalish appears to try to keep his spirits up,but came across as missing his job.
a registered nurse employed by liberty reviewed the medical reports provided by kalish treating physicians.in her evaluation,she noted what she considered to be inconsistencies between the statements provided by rasak regarding kalish ability to work and the results of the medical tests performed on kalish.she recommended that kalish file receive peer review from an independent physician specializing in cardiology.
liberty then retained peer review analysis,an independent company,to evaluate kalish file.the cardiologist conducting the review,conrad,spoke with rasak by telephone.during this discussion,rasak expressed the opinion that it would not be feasible for the patient to perform work involving any significant exertion,but he conceded that it might be possible for the patient to perform work of a sedentary nature.on the other hand,rasak noted that depression in association with other medical problems might also impair the employee ability to function effectively in his job.
conrad,in performing his evaluation,examined kalish medical records.he concluded that kalish had moderate to severe impairment of left ventricular function,and that this dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of recurrent congestive heart failure and increased mortality risk.but conrad found that there wa s no clear evidence that work cessation would necessarily reduce the risk.he further observed that kalish has shown significant clinical improvement,is able to exercise on a regular basis,and testing has shown good functional capacity.conrad concluded his review with a finding that the records do not document a need for restrictions or limitations that would necessarily preclude the employee from performing the duties of his job.
liberty forwarded a copy of conrad peer review to rasak on february,along with a letter inviting him to respond to the findings of conrad.rasak was given one week to detail the specific areas with which he disagree d and to provide medical documentation to support his position.liberty cautioned that,in the absence of a response,it would conclude that he agree d with the peer review.rasak did not respond to this letter.
on march,liberty denied kalish claim for disability benefits as of october,the date of a stress test taken by kalish that conrad had relied upon in concluding that kalish was no longer disabled.liberty indicated that it would keep his claim open for an additional two weeks,until march,to permit kalish to respond to the denial.no documents were received from kalish or his physicians before the march deadline.on may,however,rasak sent liberty a copy of a report,dated april,noting that kalish was suffering from depression.
kalish wrote a letter to liberty on may,to formally appeal the denial of his claim.he also advised liberty that he would be submitting additional medical reports from rasak and from a clinical psychologist,last.on may,liberty received a letter from last,stating that he had been treating kalish for depression and anxiety on a weekly basis since april.last expressed his opinion that d ue to the depression and anxiety,and medical problems,kalish ability to work currently is significantly compromised.
liberty wrote kalish a letter on july,informing him that a consulting physician would be reviewing his recently received medical information and that the process could require several weeks.but kalish file was never reviewed by an independent physician.it was instead evaluated by a nurse employed by liberty.she concluded that the n ew medical records document no new objective or clinical change in his condition except for some symptoms of depression.however,the psychologist supplied no office notes and symptoms were not present or treated until mos after the denial.based upon this review,liberty upheld its denial of benefits to kalish in a letter dated july.
procedural background 
kalish filed suit against liberty in a michigan state court in december of.liberty removed the action the following month to the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan,where,in accordance with a stipulated order,all of kalish claims were dismissed with the exception of his claim for benefits under erisa.the parties then filed for judgment on the administrative record.on may,immediately following oral argument on the motions,the district court delivered an oral opinion granting liberty motion for entry of judgment and denying kalish motion.the district court order,which had a transcript of the oral opinion attached,was filed on june.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
liberty alleged conflict of interest does not make application of the arbitrary and capricious standard of review inappropriate 
a denial of benefits challenged under a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.when such authority is granted,the highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review is appropriate.borda hardy,lewis,pollard,page,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.a plan administrator decision will not be deemed arbitrary and capricious so long as it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation,based on the evidence,for a particular outcome.davis.fin.ret.plan,cir noting that t he arbitrary and capricious standard is the least demanding form of judicial review quotation marks omitted.
we review a district court determination regarding the proper standard to apply in its review of a plan administrator decision de novo.hoover provident life accident ins,cir.the district court in the present case applied the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.kalish concedes that application of the de novo standard would be improper,but argues that liberty denial of benefits should be evaluated under a less deferential,standard because liberty was operating under a conflict of interest,as it was both the insurer and an administrator of the plan.
we agree that liberty operation of the plan as both the insurer and the administrator creates a conflict of interest.see killian healthsource provident adm rs,cir concluding that there is an actual,readily apparent conflict where as administrator,it interprets the plan,deciding what expenses are covered,and as issuer of the policy,it ultimately pays those expenses quotation marks omitted.the solution to this conflict,however,is not to alter the degree of deference granted under the arbitrary and capricious standard.see borda,at holding that a conflict of interest does not require the court to abandon the arbitrary and capricious standard of review quotation marks omitted.rather,the supreme court has determined that the conflict must be weighed as a factor in determining whether this is an abuse of discretion.firestone tire rubber,at.quotation marks omitted.the district court,therefore,did not err in evaluating liberty denial of benefits under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.
b.the district court erred in ruling that liberty could deny benefits on the basis that kalish was capable of sedentary work 
in holding that liberty denial of benefits to kalish was not arbitrary and capricious,the district court reasoned that kalish treating physician said at one point that the plaintiff may be capable of sedentary work.this finding,kalish argues,was an improper basis for the district court conclusion.we agree.
although the fact that a claimant is able to engage in sedentary work is an appropriate consideration in some cases,the plan language in the present case explicitly stated that a participant is disabled so long as he is unable to perform all of the material and substantial duties of his occupation.emphasis added.liberty has acknowledged that kalish position as director of national transportation required him to stand for one hour a day,walk for one hour a day,and reach at shoulder level for one hour a day.thus,while rasak opined that kalish might be able to engage in sedentary work,he repeatedly insisted that kalish was incapable of working an day and functioning well in a work environment because it would not be feasible for the patient to perform work involving any significant exertion.rasak made this determination relative to what he understood kalish job duties as director of national transportation to be.
in mcdonald life insurance,cir,the plan administrator based its decision to deny benefits on the opinion of a doctor who had merely opined that the claimant might be able to return to work under certain limited circumstances.the mcdonald court concluded that t he mere possibility that a participant might be able to return to some type of gainful employment is an insufficient basis upon which to support a plan administrator decision to deny that participant claim.id.at.similarly,in the present case,the fact that kalish might be capable of sedentary work can not be a rational basis for finding that he was not disabled,given that his former occupation required him to walk,stand,and reach for several hours a day.we must therefore determine whether there are any other grounds that adequately support liberty decision to deny benefits to kalish.
c.the district court erred in sustaining liberty denial of benefits to kalish on the basis of his heart condition 
kalish argues that liberty denial of continuing benefits was arbitrary and capricious because liberty relied solely on the opinion of conrad,the cardiologist it retained to review kalish file.the weight of conrad evaluation should be discounted,kalish maintains,for two reasons.first,conrad allegedly could not provide a truly independent opinion because he was employed by a firm that specializes in eliminating employee absences,and thus became part of the liberty advocacy team.second,kalish argues that conrad opinion should be discounted because conrad did not physically examine kalish and instead reviewed only his medical files.
kalish makes the legally valid point that,when a plan administrator explanation is based on the work of a doctor in its employ,we must view the explanation with some skepticism.moon unum provident,cir.but conrad was not an employee of liberty.rather,he was an independent expert retained by liberty to conduct a peer review of the work of kalish treating cardiologist,rasak,and to examine the other medical records in kalish file.there is no evidence that liberty attempted to tamper with or inappropriately influence conrad evaluation,which could lead us to conclude that liberty had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in relying upon his opinion.see mcdonald,at finding a denial of benefits to be arbitrary and capricious when premised on the report of an independent doctor whose initial opinion changed after a telephone call from members of the plan administrator appeals committee.
even so,the supreme court has acknowledged that physicians repeatedly retained by benefits plans may have an incentive to make a finding of not disabled in order to save their employers money and preserve their own consulting arrangements.black decker disability plan nord,d citation and quotation marks omitted.this court has similarly observed that a plan administrator,in choosing the independent experts who are paid to assess a claim,is operating under a conflict of interest that provides it with a clear incentive to contract with individuals who were inclined to find in its favor that a claimant was not entitled to continued disability benefits.calvert firstar,cir noting that the possible conflict of interest inherent in this situation should be taken into account as a factor in determining whether a plan administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious quotation marks omitted.thus,although routine deference to the opinion of a claimant treating physician is not warranted,we may consider whether a consultant engaged by a plan may have an incentive to make a finding of not disabled as a factor in determining whether the plan administrator acted arbitrarily and capriciously in deciding to credit the opinion of its paid,consulting physician.see nord,at.
in the present case,however,kalish has offered only conclusory allegations of bias with regard to conrad.he failed to present any statistical evidence to suggest that,when retained by liberty,conrad has consistently opined that claimants are not disabled.see id.stating that a determination of bias might be aided by empirical investigation see also calvert,at the court would have a better feel for the weight to accord this conflict of interest if the claimant had explored the issue through discovery.while discovery is ordinarily not permissible in an erisa action premised on a review of the administrative record,an exception to that rule exists where a plaintiff seeks to pursue a bias.in the absence of such evidence,we are unable to conclude on this basis that liberty acted arbitrarily and capriciously in deciding to credit the opinion of conrad over that of rasak.see nord,at.noting that a treating physician,in a close case,may favor a finding of disabled.
but kalish presents an alternative argument for why conrad opinion should be discounted.he points out that,although conrad reviewed kalish medical records,he did not physically examine kalish.liberty insists that this argument was rejected by the supreme court in nord.but the court opinion in nord did not address the argument advanced by kalish.the court instead focused on the treating physician rule in erisa cases,which some courts had employed to impose a heightened burden of explanation on administrators when they reject a treating physician opinion.id.at.nothing in the act itself suggests that plan administrators must accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians.kalish argument,in contrast,is that greater deference should be accorded to the opinion of rasak,not because he was kalish treating physician,but because rasak actually conducted physical examinations of kalish while conrad reviewed only kalish medical records.
whether a doctor has physically examined the claimant is indeed one factor that we may consider in determining whether a plan administrator acted arbitrarily and capriciously in giving greater weight to the opinion of its consulting physician.see calvert,at w e find that the failure to conduct a physical examination may,in some cases,raise questions about the thoroughness and accuracy of the benefits determination.but reliance on a file review does not,standing alone,require the conclusion that a plan administrator acted improperly.id.
in the present case,the report produced for liberty by conrad contains a summary of kalish medical records,but it dedicates only one page to analyzing those records.this limited commentary contains little more than conrad conclusory assertions to the effect that the available records do not document a need for restrictions or limitations that would necessarily preclude the employee from performing the duties of his job as described.in summarizing the information in kalish file,conrad states that he reviewed the form submitted by kalish employer,which describes the job duties of the director of national transportation.conrad notes that kalish position is high stress with many deadlines and includes responsibility for directing all aspects of transportation operations,handling negotiations,travel to other sites,and direct supervision of employees.at no point,however,does conrad explain how someone with kalish conrad explained as left ventricular dysfunction associated with an increased risk of recurrent congestive heart failure and increased mortality risk could be expected to function on a daily basis in the environment characteristic of kalish former position.
conrad bases his finding that kalish could return to work primarily on an october,stress test.this test,which conrad said demonstrated significant clinical improvement,was found by conrad to both contradict and outweigh more recent echocardiology test results,which continued to show moderate to severe impairment.although acknowledging that the studies are not directly comparable,conrad determined that this lone stress test,conducted several months before,justified his ultimate conclusion that t here is no clear evidence that the employee current cardiac status would necessarily preclude work involving light activity,as described.emphasis added.but the plan language in the present case explicitly provides that kalish will be deemed disabled if he is unable to perform all of the material and substantial duties of his occupation on an active employment basis because of an injury or sickness.kalish position,which required him to actively supervise employees and travel extensively,can not reasonably be found to require only light activity.
rasak,in contrast,offered the opinion that kalish was incapable of working an day and functioning well in a work environment because it would not be feasible for him to perform work involving any significant exertion.this determination was made by rasak in light of what he understood kalish job duties as director of national transportation to be.conrad,in arriving at a contrary opinion,does not explain why he disagreed with rasak conclusions.see calvert,at finding a reviewing physician report to be inadequate because,even though the reviewing physician does mention the claimant doctors by name,he does not explain why their conclusions were rejected.
the fact that rasak had the opportunity to physically examine kalish on numerous occasions,while conrad relied exclusively on a file review,makes conrad failure to discuss the findings of rasak all the more troublesome.see id.at concluding that the plan administrator reliance on a pure paper review was just one more factor that supported the court ruling that a denial of benefits was arbitrary and capricious see also mcdonald,at the evidence presented in the administrative record did not support the denial of benefits when only the administrator physicians,who had not examined the claimant,disagreed with the treating physicians.
we further note that,although conrad report mentions in passing that kalish has been diagnosed with depression see part.below,the report offers no conclusion with respect to whether kalish depression would impact his ability to return to his former position.both the district court and the parties have treated the diagnosis of depression as distinct from the diagnosis of the heart condition.but rasak concluded that kalish was unable to return to work after considering kalish overall physical and mental health,which included an analysis of the interrelated effects of the heart condition and the depression.the fact that the report of conrad does not discuss kalish depression or acknowledge the connection between the two ailments further calls into question liberty reliance upon the opinion of conrad.
finally,conrad report omits any discussion of the findings by liberty own field investigator,who personally interviewed kalish at home in january of.this investigator found that kalish appears to have a limited lifestyle,due to tiring easily.far from explaining how a person who fatigues easily could assume the responsibilities required by kalish former position,conrad report,prepared less than a month later,fails to even mention the investigator observations.perhaps conrad dismissed the investigator report without comment because he believed that kalish performance on the october stress test suggested that kalish had exaggerated his exhaustion levels to the investigator.but,if so,conrad made this credibility determination without having physically examined kalish and in contradictio
