background 
flanory is currently incarcerated at the mound correctional facility,but his claims pertain to events that took place while he was housed at the newberry correctional facility ncf.on or about december,flanory was interviewed by bonn,the classification director at ncf,for placement in the general equivalent degree ged program at the facility.flanory informed both bonn and torp,the principal of ncf ged program,that he had obtained his ged from the sarvis educational center many years before,and that he had since obtained an associate degree in general studies from the montcalm community college.flanory further advised that verification of his educational history could be found in his presentence investigation report psir.torp informed flanory that ncf policy prohibits the use of the psir for verification of educational history.linda tribley,the assistant deputy warden at ncf,advised flanory that it was his responsibility to provide documentation showing his educational achievements.notwithstanding the fact that he already had his ged,and over his objections,flanory was assigned to the ged program.because he already had obtained his ged,flanory refused to attend the class.
on january,flanory filed a grievance on the issues of his ged,associate degree,and psir,contesting the requirement that he participate in a ged class,which he had already completed,for a degree he had already obtained.on january,flanory signed an assignment waiver form to be removed from the ged program and the school roster.on january,bonn placed flanory on room restriction for waiving the ged program.room restriction disqualified flanory from indigent status.as a result,he was not able to purchase personal hygiene items,including toothpaste.in response to flanory grievance concerning the situation,davis,ncf warden,denied flanory grievance appeal,stating that flanory would be ineligible for indigent status for a period of months,and that certain hygiene items,including bars of soap,shampoo,tooth swabs,and toilet paper,were available in the housing units.flanory then requested these items from potts,ncf assistant resident unit supervisor,who responded that the items were not available.toothpaste was among the hygiene items listed by davis as only available for purchase in the prisoner store.
in october,flanory met with the new principal of ncf ged program,belles,who then contacted montcalm community college and verified flanory associate degree.on november,flanory was removed from room restriction and added to the work pool.after securing funds from his job assignment,flanory requested his records from the sarvis educational center.on april,flanory received documentation showing that he had earned a ged.
flanory placement on room restriction and his loss of indigent status caused him to be without toothpaste beginning in january,for a period of days.flanory had undergone a dental examination in october,which revealed no dental problems.in september,flanory experienced a toothache.after an examination,flanory was diagnosed with peridontal disease of the gums,and one tooth was extracted.
on may,flanory initiated this action,which sought compensatory and punitive damages,alleging that his dental health declined because he was wrongfully placed on room restriction and denied indigent status,and he was not otherwise provided with dental hygiene supplies.flanory claimed that defendants violated the privacy act,e,g c and g,by failing to verify his educational credentials,which caused defendants to place him on room restriction and deny him indigent status for approximately nine months.he further alleged that defendants violated his eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by denying his access to dental hygiene supplies,including toothpaste,which led to his gum disease.
on august,magistrate judge greeley issued a report and recommendation that flanory complaint be dismissed for failure to state a claim.on september,flanory filed objections to the report and recommendation.in his objections,flanory conceded his privacy act claim.on january,the district court issued an order approving and adopting the report and recommendation.flanory bonn,wl.flanory then timely filed this appeal.

iv.analysis 
since flanory conceded his privacy act claim earlier in the litigation,the only remaining claim is the alleged eighth amendment violation.the eighth amendment prohibits prison officials from unnecessarily and wantonly inflicting pain on prisoners by acting with deliberate indifference to prisoners serious medical needs.blackmore kalamazoo county,cir quoting estelle gamble.failure to provide medical care may rise to the level of a violation of the cruel and unusual punishments clause of the eighth amendment where objective and subjective requirements are met.harrison ash,cir farmer brennan.
