kim baird baird seeks review of the final decision of the merit systems protection board board sustaining her removal from her position as a psychiatric nursing assistant at the fort leonard wood army hospital agency in missouri.for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the board final decision and remand the case for further proceedings.
in december of,baird was notified in writing that her position met the criteria as a testing designated position tdp for random drug testing under the army federal workplace program.the notice explained that she would be subject to random drug testing as a condition of continued employment.if she refused to take a test as directed or tested positive for illegal drug use,the notice warned 
y ou will be immediately taken out of your tdp through reassignment,detail,or other personnel action to ensure that you do not occupy a tdp,and referred to the employee assistance program eap.in addition you may be reassigned,demoted,or separated according to applicable regulations.
baird signed a copy of the workplace program statement,attesting to her awareness of the program and that her position was subject to it.
on november,baird was ordered by her supervisor,david phillips phillips,to take a random drug test promptly.on november,linda blackman blackman,baird supervisor,was notified that baird had failed the november random drug test.as the supervisor,blackman was responsible for determining what action to take in light of the failed drug test,after receiving a proposal for discipline from phillips.
blackman promptly contacted beverly williams williams in the civilian personnel advisory center cpac,which is the agency entity responsible for advising management on personnel matters.blackman was informed by email on november that williams office would track down the regulation on drug use and proposed penalties.williams replied to blackman by email on november that baird should be taken out of her position immediately,detailed to a position that is not a tdp,and referred to eap.williams surmised that after baird met with the eap officer,we can see if we should look at returning her to the nursing assistant job,permanent reassignment,change to lower grade or removal.williams also informed blackman that nothing in the regulations required baird removal baird case was the first instance of a failed drug test under the federal workplace program at the fort leonard wood hospital,and the facility had no stated policy about what punishment,if any,should be given to baird.at a loss to know what action to recommend to blackman,williams sent an email to the deputy commander for administration of the hospital,patrick sauer sauer,asking for advice about the hospital policy.sauer then turned to his human resources coordinator,inez neeley neeley,asking her to consult with the army medical command medcom,which is the headquarters organization for the army medical department.
neeley contacted ernesto morales morales,a labor relations officer at medcom to ascertain medcom policy and practice regarding failed drug tests under the federal workplace program.morales first responded to neeley by email on november,saying that he was aware of seven or eight occasions of positive drug tests,and that the penalty for a failed drug test is a local call.neeley reported this information back to williams,who asked for further clarification because she could find no regulations calling for removal.neeley sent another email to morales,asking for clarification about whether there was any regulatory guidance requiring removal.morales responded by email saying that t here is nothing in the regulations that specifically mandates a removal action for testing positive for drugs.he stated that of the seven medcom instances of positive drug tests,of which he was aware,six of the employees were removed and one was reassigned.
the commander of the hospital,sharon deruvo deruvo,was notified of baird failed drug test on november,by email.deruvo was informed that williams wanted to meet with the commander before initiating an official response because baird case would set a precedent.
on november,williams related further information about baird situation to neeley.williams indicated that blackman wanted to retain baird,but that input from the commander was necessary.she noted that the hospital table of penalties might support,but did not require removal blackman was reported as saying that she would rather not lose baird,but if that is the policy,then we separate her.neeley replied that whatever we do with this case will set precedence sic for every other case we have.
on december,neeley sent an email to a large group of hospital officials,all of whom were familiar with the situation,including the lack of any existing agency policy as to the appropriate punishment.neeley opined that there are too many irons in this fire and too many folks are being made aware of the situation.neeley stated that t he commander has made a decision on what action she wants to take and cpac is working in the direction based on the commander decision.neeley further stated in the email that she had advised a unit of the hospital that wished to employ baird of the commander decision.
on direction from deruvo,williams then drafted a proposed removal letter,which phillips signed on december.baird responded to the proposal in writing and orally,but to no avail.the agency,per blackman,issued the formal notice of removal on february.
baird appealed her removal to the board on march,and filed her first discovery request on april.among other things,baird sought access to all documents including emails in the possession of the agency related to the decision to dismiss baird from her employment.baird was forced to file two motions to compel discovery,and finally,on july,four days before the first hearing day and days late,the agency delivered a first set of email messages responsive to the discovery request.at the hearing on july,baird counsel requested and received additional emails from blackman and phillips.two of the email messages were written by williams at the time she was drafting the proposal of removal.williams related to blackman that deruvo has decided that we should propose removal.to neeley,williams stated that ltc sauer spoke with col deruvo and the decision is to propose removal.
the july hearing was continued to august.on august,baird counsel interviewed sauer and presented him with a copy of neeley december email,which had been copied to sauer.sauer volunteered that he regularly archived such messages in his computer.counsel for the agency refused to permit sauer to produce any emails he had archived relevant to baird removal.counsel for baird promptly moved to compel production of sauer archived emails.
at the august hearing,baird counsel asked again for access to the email messages sauer admitted he had archived.sauer explained that he had only been asked by agency counsel,the very day before,if he had any relevant emails.counsel for baird then demanded production of sauer relevant archived emails.agency counsel objected to such discovery,saying this is discovery in the middle of the trial.prugh baird counsel has made his discovery motions.the agency has responded to them many times.to litigate discovery in the middle of the hearing is not appropriate.prugh replied well,to hide relevant evidence is also not appropriate and that what going on.the administrative judge sustained the agency objection to production of sauer archived emails.
during the course of the hearings,neeley testified that to the best of her knowledge deruvo made the decision to remove baird.in addition,sauer testified that advice had been sought from morales since the fort leonard wood hospital had no precedent in dealing with failed drug tests.sauer understood morales to have said that basic medcom precedent was to order removal for tdp employees who fail random drug tests.he further testified that the precedent meant a lot in colonel deruvo decision to propose removal of baird and that deruvo made the decision to propose removal.
