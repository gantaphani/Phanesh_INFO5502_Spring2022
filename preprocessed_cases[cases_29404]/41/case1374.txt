this case arises out of the merger of corsolutions medical,with a subsidiary of matria healthcare,in a deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars.angus duthie and michael condron were corsolutions officers prior to the merger.we consider in this appeal whether the merger agreement mandates arbitration of fraud claims that matria asserts against duthie and condron individually,seeking recovery from their personal assets.because we conclude the agreement does not require these claims to be arbitrated,we affirm the district court decision to enjoin matria from pursuing the claims in a pending arbitration proceeding.
background 
matria and corsolutions provide services to employers,health plans,and health care programs.pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger signed december,the agreement,corsolutions agreed to merge with coral acquisition,a matria subsidiary.corsolutions became the surviving corporation after the merger and a subsidiary of matria.the merger agreement spanned pages.
angus duthie and michael condron,the plaintiffs in this case,were corsolutions officers.duthie was its chairman and chief executive officer,and condron served as the president and chief operating officer.the two remained corsolutions officers for a time after the merger.at the time of the merger,duthie owned corsolutions shares that represented a ownership interest in the company.condron did not own any corsolutions shares when the agreement was signed but became a shareholder sixteen days later,when he exercised options and acquired shares of corsolutions common stock,which comprised about of the company outstanding shares at the time.duthie signed the agreement,but only in his capacity as chairman and ceo.condron did not sign the agreement.
pursuant to the agreement,million went into the escrow account,an account set up to satisfy certain potential claims and adjustments contemplated by the agreement.the agreement appointed coral sr,llc as the stakeholder representative,meaning that it was constituted to act as the representative,agent,and for the stakeholders and their successors and assigns for all purposes under this agreement,the escrow agreement and the agent escrow agreement.agrt.a.the agreement defines the stakeholders as the holders of common stock,the holders of preferred stock,the holders of company options and the holders of company warrants.agrt.duthie and condron are both stakeholders under the agreement definition of the term.
the agreement provides for four different arbitration forums.the settlement accountant,an independent accounting firm,is to resolve disputes over balance adjustments and working capital computations.agrt.b.a tax arbitrator,a senior tax partner in a mutually agreeable accounting firm,would resolve any matters.agrt.h.the bipa arbitrator is to resolve disputes concerning a refund corsolutions owed to the centers for medicare medicaid services.agrt.d.and,in the section most relevant to this case,section provided for arbitration of certain disputes in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association aaa.
we would not be here,of course,if all had gone smoothly.instead,according to matria,the very day after the merger closed,one of corsolutions customers informed matria that it planned to conduct an audit of corsolutions disease management programs.that was news to matria,and it maintains that corsolutions and its officers knew about the customer concerns before the merger but failed to convey them to matria.
in october,coral sr initiated aaa arbitration proceedings against matria.matria responded by filing a suit in the delaware court of chancery seeking to enjoin the arbitration and asserting claims against coral sr based on alleged inaccuracies in the agreement representations and warranties.matria did not sue any individuals in the delaware case.on march,the delaware court held that the agreement required arbitration of the fraud claims that matria had asserted against coral sr seeking recovery from the escrow fund.matria healthcare,coral sr llc,wl,at.
two months later,matria asserted counterclaims in the aaa arbitration against coral sr for fraud,equitable fraud,and breach of contract.matria also asserted counts of fraud,equitable fraud,and breach of contract against duthie and condron in the same filing,alleging that the two had knowingly withheld information and made multiple misrepresentations.duthie and condron then moved to dismiss the claims against them in arbitration for lack of jurisdiction.the arbitration panel denied the motion.duthie and condron subsequently filed a complaint seeking a declaration that matria claims against them were not arbitrable and a preliminary injunction preventing matria from proceeding against them in the arbitration.the magistrate judge entered an order preliminarily enjoining matria from proceeding in the arbitration against duthie and condron,and matria appeals from that decision.
ii.analysis 
this case involves a complex transaction that yielded complex documentation we begin with first principles.although the federal arbitration act favors resolution of disputes through arbitration,its provisions are not to be construed so broadly as to include claims that were never intended for arbitration.continental cas.am.nat.ins,cir quoting am.logistics,catellus dev,cir.that is,arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.howsam dean witter reynolds,d citation omitted.
whether a particular dispute must be arbitrated is generally a question for judicial determination,unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provided otherwise in their agreement.id.neither party disputes that the court,and not the arbitration panel,should decide the arbitrability question in this case.nor is there clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary in the agreement,and so we proceed.
whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is a matter of state contract law.hawkins aid ass for lutherans,cir.in this case,delaware law controls.agrt.as with any contract,our task is to interpret the agreement in a manner that satisfies the reasonable expectations of the parties at the time they entered the contract.dittrick chalfant,citation omitted.we are nonetheless mindful that the federal arbitration act is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements and that questions of arbitrability must be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.continental cas,at citing moses cone mem l hosp.mercury const,d.
this case comes to us on appeal from the grant of a preliminary injunction,and the relevant inquiry in this case is whether duthie and condron demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.see john united church of christ city of chicago,cir listing factors court should consider when determining whether to grant preliminary injunction.we ultimately review whether a district court should have granted a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.miller flume,cir.the likelihood of the success on the merits in this case depends on the soundness of the district court interpretation of the agreement language,see id.at,however,and we review a district court interpretations of the merger agreement de novo,see fyrnetics quantum group,cir.
the question on appeal is whether the agreement mandates arbitration before the aaa of the claims matria asserted against duthie and condron in the aaa proceeding.these claims allege that duthie and condron made fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions both in person and in the agreement,and they seek recovery from duthie and condron personal assets.matria argues that these claims must be arbitrated because it contends that the agreement mandates that any claim involving misrepresentations or omissions arising out of the merger must be arbitrated,and according to matria,the delaware court of chancery already said they must be.
a.the agreement does not require arbitration of all claims.
as support for its argument that the agreement requires arbitration of all claims arising out of the agreement,matria turns principally to certain language in section d ii.this section provides in full 
in accordance with the terms of the escrow agreement,for a period of months after the closing date,parent shall be entitled to make claims against the escrow fund with respect to damages arising out of or resulting from,or amounts payable with respect to,the matters set forth in section other than section a,which is the subject of section d i and subject to the limitation in section d iii it being understood that in the event parent shall have timely delivered notice of any claim on the escrow fund pursuant to section,such claim shall survive until such time as such claim is finally resolved.the parties intend to shorten the statute of limitations and agree that,after the closing date,any claim or cause of action against any of the parties hereto,or any of their respective directors,officers,employees,affiliates,successors,permitted assigns,or representatives based upon,directly or indirectly,any of the representations or warranties,covenants or agreements contained in this agreement,or any other agreement,document or instrument to be executed and delivered in connection with this agreement may be brought only as expressly provided in this article vii.
emphasis added.
we do not agree that the portion of the provision we italicized above mandates arbitration of any claim alleging that a director or officer made misrepresentations in the agreement.consistent with section d survival of representations and warranties claims period heading,the point of this section is to shorten the statute of limitations for claims against the escrow fund.shortening the time period for bringing such claims reflects a reasonable desire for finality concerning the amount in the fund so that the remainder can be distributed to the stakeholders within a reasonable period of time.and although section d ii expressly mentions directors and officers,it does not state that any claim against a director or officer is arbitrable.instead,it provides that claims against directors and officers may be brought only as expressly provided in article vii.
nothing in article vii expressly provides for arbitration of claims against individual defendants for their personal assets.instead,consistent with its heading,claims on escrow funds,article vii only provides for arbitration of claims against the escrow fund.ten and a half pages long,article vii sets forth detailed provisions relating to claims on the escrow fund,a term it mentions over forty times.section sets forth the circumstances under which matria can make a claim against the escrow fund.section specifies the claims process.section details certain limitations on claims.for example,section b specifies that the maximum liability for matria claims on the escrow fund is the amount in the escrow fund,and it further provides that neither coral sr nor any stakeholder has any obligation to contribute money to the escrow fund under any circumstance.
the next section,section,is critical to this case.it provides 
section.disputes.in the event of a dispute between the parent and the stakeholder representative relating to any claim other than a third party claim that is the subject of litigation escrow fund dispute or any claim subject to section or section,the stakeholder representative and parent shall seek in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such escrow fund dispute within ninety days of receipt by the stakeholder representative of a claim notice.if the stakeholder representative and parent are not able to resolve such escrow fund dispute,all of the parties hereto agree that such escrow fund dispute shall be exclusively and finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the aaa 
section,then,only mandates the arbitration of an escrow fund dispute.the dispute here is neither between the proper parties nor of the proper subject to constitute an escrow fund dispute under the agreement.first,the dispute is not one between the stakeholder representative and parent,the entities that section defines as the parties to an escrow fund dispute.the agreement defines the parent as matria and the stakeholder representative as coral.but the claims at issue in this appeal are between matria and individual officers.matria healthcare,wl suit between matria and coral sr.
the agreement also not equate the stakeholder representative to the individual stakeholders nor does matria argue that it does.the agreement specifies that the stakeholder representative is coral sr,and that coral sr acts as the representative for the individual stakeholders for purposes under the agreement.when referring only to these individuals,the agreement uses the term stakeholder or stakeholders.see,agrt.a,c,b.section,however,only refers to disputes in which the stakeholder representative is a party.
in addition,the recovery matria seeks in its claims against the individual officers is not of the type that section makes arbitrable as an escrow fund dispute.we note first that although the claims matria filed in arbitration against coral sr and duthie and condron asked for recovery from the escrow fund as well as from duthie and condron personal assets,matria readily acknowledges that it could only obtain recovery from the escrow fund by arbitrating claims against coral.opening br.at,reply br.at.the question at issue in this appeal,then,only concerns claims for personal assets.
such claims do not fall within the scope of section,which only compels arbitration of claims on the escrow fund.to fall within section purview,a dispute must relate to a claim,which the agreement defines to include third party claims not relevant here and direct claims.a direct claim under the agreement is one where the parent shall be entitled to make a claim for damages pursuant to section.agrt.a.a claim for damages under section is a claim against the escrow fund in accordance with the terms of the escrow agreement.emphasis added.because the claims at issue seek recovery from duthie and condron personal assets,not from the money in the escrow fund,section does not apply to these claims.
the text of article vii as a whole reinforces this conclusion.the parties seemed to approach article vii,the section entitled claims on escrow fund,with particular care.it alone takes up over ten pages with detailed provisions including a shortened statute of limitations,a prohibition on punitive damages,and a ceiling for liability.yet it does not state anywhere that claims for amounts from sources other than the escrow fund must be arbitrated.
the other provision to which matria turns in support of its position that the agreement requires arbitration of all,or at least nearly all,claims,section,also does not help it.section has two very long sentences.the first reads 
consent to jurisdiction.except as provided in sections adjustment of initial merger consideration,h tax disputes,escrow fund disputes and bipa claims herein,each of the parties hereto a irrevocably consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction located in the city of wilmington in the state of delaware,for the purpose of any action or proceeding arising out of this agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this agreement,b agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and c agrees that,except in any action brought against the party in another jurisdiction by an independent third party,it will not bring any action relating to this agreement or any transactions contemplated by this agreement in any court other than a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction located in the city of wilmington in the state of delaware,except for the purpose of enforcing any award or decision.
and the second sentence says 
for the avoidance of doubt,except for claims for specific performance arising after the date hereof and prior to the closing,any claims arising out of this agreement,or the breach,termination or validity thereof,shall be finally and exclusivel
