we briefly summarize the trial evidence,resolving factual conflicts in favor of pietrafeso.on friday,july,rocco was transferred from a correctional facility in sterling,colorado,to the lawrence county jail,a holding facility for pretrial detainees.the jail contracts with a local hospital for needed medical services.rocco arrived at the jail at jailer asheim conducted the intake screening interview,after receiving from the van driver an envelope marked with rocco name,inmate number,and the following notation in bold red letters 
urgent colo medical summary transfer report deliver to medical department at once 
in the interview,rocco told asheim that he suffered from a severe asthma condition.rocco said he was taking a bunch of medications,though he brought with him to the jail only an albuterol inhaler.rocco did not tell asheim that on july,just eight days earlier,he was sent to the colorado prison emergency clinic suffering from a severe asthma attack.vance siedenburg,the physician assistant who treated rocco at the prison clinic,testified that he exhibited difficult breathing,sweating profusely,anxiety level very high,secondary to inability to breathe.siedenburg administered steroid and adrenaline medications to alleviate rocco constricted bronchia.siedenburg testified that he last saw rocco on july,when his asthmatic condition had stabilized.siedenburg prescribed two steroids,prednisone and beconase two medications,ativan and vistaril an antihistamine,zantac singulair an albuterol inhaler and nebulizer treatments as needed siedenburg testified that the colorado correctional officials did not consult him in preparing the medical summary transfer report that accompanied rocco to the lawrence county jail in the envelope.
asheim testified that rocco was tired when he arrived at the jail but exhibited no wheezing,difficulty breathing,or coughing during the intake interview.after placing rocco in a cell with his inhaler,asheim called chief deputy harmon to ask permission to take rocco and the envelope to the hospital emergency room so that the bunch of prescriptions could be filled.when asheim advised that rocco was not having any problems and had his inhaler,harmon told asheim to call the hospital,explain the situation,and see if the emergency room would fill prescriptions without seeing rocco.asheim called the hospital and was told that no prescriptions would be filled without seeing rocco.asheim then called head jailer bob williams,explained the situation,and suggested that rocco be taken to the emergency room saturday morning so that his prescriptions could be filled before the local pharmacy closed at noon.before leaving the jail,asheim taped the unopened envelope to a conspicuous shelf in the control room.
rocco was not taken to see a doctor saturday morning,and his prescriptions remained unfilled.when asheim came to work saturday afternoon,williams said he did not remember being asked to do that.asheim shift ended at saturday.he could not sleep that night because he knew from a former girlfriend experience that a person with severe asthma had a constant need for medications.on sunday morning,asheim discussed the situation with sheriff rick mowell,who said that rocco could wait until monday or tuesday to see a doctor since he was not in apparent distress.still concerned,asheim then took the unopened envelope to physician assistant kay huhnerkoch at the hospital.
huhnerkoch opened the envelope and reviewed its contents.a colorado medical summary transfer report dated july,advised that rocco was last seen by a physician on july and listed his current medications as albuterol,ativan,and an antidepressant,imipramine.the report did not disclose rocco severe asthma attack on july,his treatment by physician assistant siedenburg,or the medications siedenburg prescribed on july.the envelope also contained a hospital pass for breathing treatment every hours.siedenburg described this document as a kite permitting a colorado inmate to access the prison clinic without further approval it was not a prescription.after reviewing these documents,huhnerkoch advised asheim that the inhaler was sufficient for the weekend unless rocco needed to use it more than three times in a period,in which case he should be brought to the hospital emergency room.asheim returned to the jail with a note from huhnerkoch to that effect and personally told rocco what the note said.pietrafeso expert medical witness at trial,a forensic pathologist,testified that huhnerkoch note was prudent because excessive use of an inhaler means that the albuterol is not effectively treating an asthma attack.
asheim testified that rocco was not wheezing or coughing or showing signs of discomfort and did not ask for a doctor when asheim explained huhnerkoch note.however,a testified that rocco physical condition deteriorated over the weekend and that he repeatedly asked the jailers for his medications.similarly,rocco sister testified that he called her repeatedly to report that his inhaler was not working and that he needed more medication.she reported rocco complaints to jail administrator larson on monday,july.
rocco was taken to see a doctor at on tuesday,august.the doctor reported 
rocco was seen today.he has a history of reactive airway disease and copd.recently he has been incarcerated and unfortunately he has just been able to get his albuterol inhaler,which is keeping him relatively stable,but he is quite uncomfortable and needs a broader treatment program.he has noticed just a slight amount of green material when he is coughing but this is minimally so he has had anxiety background with ativan and imipramine he is at the point where he feels that he may need some systemic steroids,which he has been on in the past.he is not on any topical steroid at this point.
emphasis added.the doctor prescribed three inhalers albuterol,flovent,and salmeterol,albuterol nebulizer treatments if needed,ativan,imipramine,and singulair.he noted,i think this needs to be reviewed within a week to see that he is stabilizing with this.if he is not,we may need to consider systemic steroids.
at that afternoon,larson picked up the prescribed medications at the local pharmacy and delivered them to asheim at the jail.asheim brought them to rocco who said he needed to use the nebulizer.the nebulizer asheim brought lacked a mouthpiece and could not function.when asheim returned with a mouthpiece,rocco was wheezing and in asthmatic arrest,but neither rocco nor the jailers knew how to mix the prescribed albuterol solution.rocco found a bottle of albuterol solution in the nebulizer left by its previous user.after breathing the nebulizer mist for a few minutes,he told asheim it was not working.asheim called an ambulance which arrived at and rushed rocco to the hospital.rocco died of an acute bronchial asthma attack at 
the forensic pathologist testified that the level of albuterol in rocco bloodstream showed that he had taken far more than the prescribed dosage of that rescue drug without overcoming the acute asthma attack.the pathologist further testified that the flovent and salmeterol inhalers would not treat an acute attack because these are maintenance drugs,not rescue drugs.what would help him for the acute attack would be the prednisone,the steroid rocc
