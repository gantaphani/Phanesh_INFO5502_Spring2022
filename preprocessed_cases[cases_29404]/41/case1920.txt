jude medical,sjm produced the silzone prosthetic heart valve.a test conducted by sjm showed a slightly higher risk of paravalvular leaks at the site where the valves were implanted.sjm thereafter recalled all unimplanted silzone valves.numerous suits were then filed across the nation,and the cases were later consolidated in minnesota.on motions by the plaintiffs,the district court issued three orders that collectively had the result of certifying two seeking damages based on minnesota consumer protection statutes,and another seeking primarily injunctive relief.sjm appeals these two class certifications.we reverse and remand.
background 
sjm received approval from the food and drug administration fda for the silzone heart valve.the valve had as a unique characteristic a sterile,antimicrobial silver coating on the valve polyester sewing cuff where the valve connected to a patient heart tissue.months after receiving fda approval,sjm sponsored a random,controlled study comparing patient experience with silzone and heart valves.the study data showed a statistically significant increase for patients implanted with valves over those implanted with valves in the incidence of paravalvular leaks severe enough to require valve explanation.
sjm immediately recalled all unimplanted silzone valves.following the recall,plaintiffs sued sjm in courts across the nation.the cases were consolidated for pretrial proceedings in minnesota pursuant to the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation.eventually,five plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint,claiming to represent over silzone valve recipients.the plaintiffs alleged common law strict liability,breach of implied and express warranties,negligence and medical monitoring,and claims under various minnesota consumer false advertising act,the consumer fraud act,the unlawful trade practices act,and the uniform deceptive trade practices act.the plaintiffs moved for class certification of an injunctive class,called the medical monitoring class,and a personal injury class seeking money damages,although both classes made many of the same claims under the same legal theories noted above.the district court found both proposed classes met the threshold requirements of federal rule of civil procedure a,then conditionally certified the claims in both classes under rule b and c.the court also conditionally certified the medical monitoring class under rule b and c.finally,the court concluded common issues of law and fact predominated over plaintiffs claims under minnesota consumer protection and deceptive trade practices acts,and a class action was the superior method to adjudicate those claims.the court unconditionally certified a consumer protection class under those statutes pursuant to rule b.
as to the common law claims,the district court envision ed a minimal number of subclasses,and found that only significant variations in state law will be sufficient to require different subclasses,then requested briefing from the parties with regard to subclasses in the conditionally certified classes.after receiving briefing,the court decertified the personal injury class,citing erie railroad tompkins,and castano american tobacco,cir,wherein the fifth circuit reversed a district court class certification order because the district court failed to consider how the variations in state law would affect predominance and superiority.the district court found no two states laws were substantially alike,which,in the court estimation,would require management of at least subclasses.the court again conditionally certified the medical monitoring class,subject to the plaintiffs submitting to the court the identities of suitable class representatives and a manageable trial plan.after reviewing the laws of different states with regard to medical monitoring,the court observed it would apply the medical monitoring law of different states,conditionally certifying the class only as to those plaintiffs whose valves were implanted in states that recognize a cause of action for medical monitoring,absent proof of injury.the court concluded the elements of medical monitoring claims in states that recognize such claims appear ed to be the same.in a third order,the court added plaintiffs from more states for a total of to the list of those presenting medical monitoring claims.following the third order,two certified subclasses remain the class based on minnesota consumer protection statutes,and the medical monitoring class.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court ruling granting or denying class certification for abuse of discretion.glover standard fed.bank,cir.the district court rulings on issues of law are reviewed de novo,and the court abuses its discretion if it commits an error of law.blades monsanto,cir citing emery hunt,cir italics removed.thus,even under the abuse of discretion standard,a district court rulings on issues of law are reviewed de novo.emery,at.
to be certified as a class,plaintiffs must meet all of the requirements of rule a and must satisfy one of the three subsections of rule b amchem,windsor,d blades,at.the rule a requirements for class certification are the putative class is so numerous that it makes joinder of all members impractical questions of law or fact are common to the class the class representatives claims or defenses are typical of the claims or defenses of the class and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a.the district court certified the class based on minnesota consumer protection statutes using rule b,which provides that a class action may be maintained if the court finds the questions of law or fact common to members of the class predominate over the questions affecting only individual class members,and a class action is the superior method for fair and efficient adjudication of the dispute.the district court certified the medical monitoring class under rule b,which provides a class action is appropriate if the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class,thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.
consumer protection class 
the district court concluded it would apply minnesota law to the consumer protection statutes class because the minnesota statutes permit any person to bring suit thereunder.the court conducted a cursory analysis as to the application of the minnesota consumer protection statutes.the court concluded applying minnesota law was proper because the parties,particularly sjm,had significant contacts with minnesota,including sjm being headquartered in minnesota,and the fact that much of the conduct relevant to the claims occurred or emanated from minnesota.
sjm makes numerous assertions of error regarding the district court order certifying the consumer protection class.sjm argues the constitution does not permit a nationwide personal injury class action using the consumer protection law of one state to the exclusion of all other states.sjm claims the nationwide class violates the constitution commerce clause,the due process clause,the full faith and credit clause,the erie doctrine,and the rules enabling act.sjm also argues the nationwide consumer protection class violates federal rule of civil procedure,questioning the manageability of the class,the adequacy of the class representatives,and the typicality of their claims.finally,sjm argues the plaintiffs can not meet the predominance or superiority requirements of rule b.
addressing the class certification issues only with regard to the due process and full faith and credit clauses,we conclude the district court did not conduct a sufficient analysis.the due process and full faith and credit issues are dispositive,and we believe it prudent not to decide issues unnecessary to the disposition of the case,especially given the numerous constitutional issues implicated in such an analysis.see georgine amchem,cir,aff sub,amchem,windsor,d.
