in the department of health and human services denied heartland regional medical center status within the medicare program as a sole community hospital sch for the years through.hhs based its decision upon a regulation that provided a hospital located within miles of a like hospital could qualify as an sch only if it was in a rural area.as a consequence of the denial,heartland received reimbursement for less than the actual cost of the healthcare it provided to medicare beneficiaries during those years.heartland petitioned the district court for review under the administrative procedure act,arguing the district court had vacated the rural location rule in,wherefore hhs should have held a hearing to consider the hospital claim to be an sch.the district court granted summary judgment to hhs without deciding whether the court decision had indeed vacated the rule.we conclude the decision did not vacate the rural location requirement and therefore affirm the judgment of the district court on that ground.
background 
part a of the medicare program provides basic protection against the costs of hospital care for the elderly and disabled.a hospital that provides inpatient services to a medicare beneficiary receives reimbursement under the prospective payment system pps,which pays a fixed amount regardless of the actual cost of the care.id.because a hospital may incur a loss whenever it treats a medicare beneficiary,the congress,concerned not to overburden a hospital that is the only source of care in its vicinity,exempted sole community hospitals from the pps an sch instead receives reimbursement for the actual cost it incurs in providing care to each medicare beneficiary.see clinton mem l hosp.shalala,discussing both congress a ware ness that some hospitals might not flourish under the pps and its decision to codify hhs exemption for schs.in the medicare statute defined an sch as any hospital located more than road miles from another hospital or one that,by reason of other factors is the sole source of inpatient hospital services reasonably available to individuals in a geographic area.d d iii.an hhs regulation interpreted the other factors in such a way that a hospital located within miles of other like hospitals would be an sch only if it was located in a rural area,a,meaning any area outside an urban area,including any metropolitan statistical area msa as defined by the executive sic office of management and budget,id.f ii iii.
in order to apply for sch status under the regulation,a provider would contact its fiscal intermediary,which would make a recommendation to the health care financing administration hcfa,id.b i v,the unit within hhs that administered the medicare program pursuant to a delegation from the secretary.the hcfa decision to disapprove a hospital application for sch status was subject to review by the provider reimbursement review board prrb.a a.
heartland regional medical center,which is located in joseph,missouri,applied for status as an sch in.the hcfa denied heartland application because heartland is in an urban area,to wit,the joseph msa,and is fewer than miles from the nearest like hospital.heartland appealed to the prrb,arguing hhs lacked authority to promulgate the rural location requirement.the prrb held it lacked jurisdiction to resolve this legal question and therefore granted the hospital request to seek direct judicial resolution of its challenge.
heartland repaired to the district court,where it argued the rural location requirement was inconsistent with the medicare statute and,in any event,hhs had not adequately explained why the requirement was appropriate.the district court disagreed on both those counts,heartland hosp.shalala,slip op.at,june,heartland i,but it accepted heartland alternative argument that hhs had defined urban area by reference to the omb definition of an msa without adequately considering other approaches raised in public comments upon the proposed rule.the district court held that,because hhs had fail ed to respond to reasonable alternative definitions of an urban area,the rule was invalid,id.at,wherefore the court remanded the rule to hhs for action consistent with the court opinion.
on remand hhs issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to reconsider its decision to define urban area as an msa.see proposed rule medicare program changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems and fiscal year rates.meanwhile,the hcfa reopened its adjudication of heartland claim to status as an sch.after receiving further public comments in the rulemaking proceeding,hhs considered the alternatives but decided to retain the rural location requirement and its definition.see final rule medicare program changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems and fiscal year rates.shortly thereafter,however,the congress amended the medicare statute to preclude hhs from maintaining the rural location requirement.consolidated appropriations act,app.f,tit,stat.on august,the hcfa designated heartland an sch,effective as of january.
on september,the hcfa denied heartland request that it be deemed an sch for the years through,giving three reasons.first,the hcfa reasoned that the court in heartland i had not vacated the rural location requirement but had merely remanded it to hhs to consider alternatives to defining urban area as an msa once hhs had duly considered and rejected the alternatives,the hcfa could lawfully deny heartland application based upon the rural location requirement.the hcfa reasoned in the alternative that,even if the court in heartland i did vacate the rule,the hcfa could,in adjudicating heartland status,adopt the same rural location requirement and apply it retroactively to based upon hhs reasoning in the rulemaking.the hcfa third reason for denying sch status was new heartland application had not adequately defined the hospital service area.
heartland returned to the district court and filed both a motion to enforce the judgment in heartland i and a challenge under the apa to the hcfa new decision.in the motion to enforce,heartland sought reimbursement of its actual costs of care for medicare beneficiaries,plus interest,for the years through.the district court denied that motion,heartland hosp.thompson,d,heartland ii,and we affirmed because even if heartland i vacated the rural area requirement,the only obligation it expressly imposed on the agency was to consider the two alternatives suggested during the comment period,heartland reg l med.ctr.leavitt,heartland iii.
in its apa challenge to the hcfa three reasons for denying it status as an sch,heartland argued the district court in heartland i had vacated the rural requirement and remanded the matter for hhs to develop the particular facts relevant to heartland claim to be an sch.the district court granted summary judgment to hhs without deciding whether it had in heartland i vacated the rural location requirement,heartland reg l med.ctr.leavitt,d,heartland iv,relying upon our statement in heartland iii that with or without vacatur,an agency that cures a problem identified by a court is free to reinstate the original result on remand,at.by considering alternatives in its rulemaking,hhs had cured the problem and thereby cleared the way for the hcfa to apply the rural location requirement and deny heartland application.heartland iv,d at.heartland appeals that ruling,which we review de novo.see venetian casino resort,eeoc.
ii.analysis 
heartland contends that because heartland i vacated the rural location rule in force from to and hhs did not promulgate a new rural location rule until,the hcfa retroactively applied a rural location requirement in the adjudication when it denied the hospital application for reimbursement as an sch in through.although heartland does not dispute that a principle announced in adjudication is necessarily retroactive,see rivers roadway express,d goodman fcc,the hospital points out that the agency could not have applied hhs rule retroactively to deny heartland application unless that power had been conveyed by congress in express terms,bowen georgetown,d.heartland asserts the congress gave the agency no
