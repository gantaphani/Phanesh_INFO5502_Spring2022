amy samons filed a claim for disability benefits and supplemental security income.she appeals the judgment of the district court upholding the decision of the social security administration denying her claim.we affirm.
after the social security administration denied samons benefits initially,an administrative law judge conducted a hearing.the alj then concluded that samons was able to perform her past relevant work and denied her claims.the appeals council denied review after considering additional medical evidence that samons had submitted,and the alj decision thus became the final decision of the ssa.samons unsuccessfully challenged that decision in the district court.on appeal,she contends that the alj erred in three respects by failing to give adequate weight to her treating physician opinion,by improperly assessing her credibility,and by failing to consider the duties of her past relevant work before deciding that she could do it.
we review the district court decision de novo,see pettit apfel,cir,to determine whether the alj decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole and whether it complies with the relevant legal requirements.see see also g.substantial evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind would accept as adequate to support the commissioner decision.young apfel,cir.in determining whether the decision is adequately supported,we consider evidence that detracts from that decision,as well as the evidence supporting it.id.
following the ssa process,see,the alj first determined that samons had not been engaged in substantial gainful activity since february.he then decided that she had a severe impairment an impairment or combination of impairments that significantly limit ed her ability to do basic work activities,see the alj described samons as having,a severe history of chronic back pain,a history of seizure activity,asthma,a hiatal hernia,gastroesophageal reflux,headaches,and intermittent depression.at step three,the alj concluded that samons impairments did not meet or equal any of the listings that create a presumption of disability.see d.he denied samons claim at step four,after concluding that she was not disabled because she could perform her past relevant work as a cook,baby sitter,house keeper,and cashier.see f.
samons first maintains that the alj failed to give sufficient weight to the opinion of her treating doctor that she was unable to work because of her seizures.ronald hollis,samons family physician,treated her in she was then treated by another physician until,when she returned to hollis care.samons was continuing treatment with hollis at the time of the hearing in.
hollis diagnosed samons with epilepsy a seizure disorder,a diagnosis supported by her abnormal electroencephalography eeg results in and.in samons medical chart,hollis stated that she had both grand mal and petit mal seizures.a grand mal known as a seizure features uncontrolled muscle spasms involving the entire body,and loss of consciousness the person may clench the teeth,bite the tongue,and lose bladder control.after the seizure passes,the person may fall into a deep sleep for an hour or more.usually,there is no recall of the seizure on waking up.the signet mosby medical encyclopedia ed.at.according to testimony at her hearing,samons grand mal seizures lasted about five or six minutes and afterward she was tired,disoriented,and had muscle pain it took her about two hours to recover.
petit mal seizures or absence seizures consist of a momentary break in consciousness of thought or activity,often accompanied by automatisms or clonic movements,especially of the eyelids.dorland illustrated medical dictionary at,as quoted in flanery chater,cir.samons mother testified that numerous times she had observed her daughter stare for a minute or two and then continue what she had been doing,sometimes seeming as if she was unaware that anything had happened.hollis called these petit mal seizures,although samons neurologist,demetrius spanos,used the term partial complex seizures for what she described to him as blank staring spells that lasted minutes.
hollis wrote two opinion letters.on november,he wrote a letter t o whom it may concern stating that although samons seizures were better controlled,she still has frequent daily episodes of staring and decreased awareness of her surroundings and had been instructed not to drive.he concluded that samons was unable to hold down any type of job secondary to seizures.in april,after samons hearing but before the alj decision,hollis wrote another letter.the beginning of second letter was virtually identical to the first,but this time he concluded by stating that samons should not work a job schedule,as being or may result in an increase of further symptoms or activity.the alj did not consider the second letter since samons first submitted it to the appeals council after the alj denied her claim.
we address first samons contention that the alj failed to give the first letter adequate weight.a treating physician opinion regarding an applicant impairment will be granted controlling weight,provided the opinion is by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the record.even if the opinion is not entitled to controlling weight,it should not ordinarily be disregarded and is entitled to substantial weight.singh apfel,cir see also.but the alj may give a treating doctor opinion limited weight if it provides conclusory statements only,see chamberlain shalala,cir,or is inconsistent with the record,see cox barnhart,cir.
the alj acknowledged the weight generally accorded a treating doctor opinion,but he concluded for several reasons that hollis opinion was not entitled to such deference.he first stated that hollis opinion was not consistent with the clinical and laboratory findings and that there were too many inconsistencies in this case.
although the alj did not dispute that samons had epilepsy,he questioned the frequency of her seizures.hollis,in his somewhat cryptic letter,appeared to rely on his finding that samons had frequent daily episodes of staring and decreased awareness of her surroundings petit mal or partial complex seizures to conclude that she could not work.the alj stated,in contrast,that samons had said in february,that she had not had a seizure in four months,and that she had reported in january,that her last seizure was in.although we think that the alj used the term seizure here to mean grand mal seizures only,we note that samons told spanos that she had only two or three petit mal seizures and no grand mal seizures in the four months before february,and we can not determine whether she had petit mal seizures between january,and.
hollis medical records also included other statements regarding the frequency of her seizures that support the alj finding of inconsistencies and his refusal to give substantial weight to hollis opinion.in,hollis said that samons was stable on tegretol,an medication.although in june,he notes an increase in samons seizures in the last month,she was out of tegretol he refilled her prescription and noted two weeks later that she was having no more seizures.about a month later,she reported having had two or three petit mal seizures since her last visit,and on august,samons told hollis that she had had a seizure every day for two weeks.hollis referred her to a neurologist,spanos,who saw her for the first time in october.not long after that,hollis wrote the letter stating that samons could not work.
but according to the record,samons seizures decreased the same month that hollis wrote the letter.on her first visit to spanos,he changed her medication,prescribing topamax because her partial complex seizures seemed to be her primary problem he continued her on tegretol but stopped another seizure medication.as we have said,when samons returned to see spanos four months later,in february,she reported having had only two or three staring seizures and no grand mal seizures in the interim.the doctor increased her topamax,hoping to decrease her staring seizures even further.
