background 
in september,nicklas was convicted in arkansas state court of misdemeanor terroristic threatening.nicklas had sent two letters,on nicklas personal letterhead,to a man he was not acquainted with,accusing the man of being an undercover fbi agent living in a house that did not belong to him.in the first letter,nicklas ordered the man to vacate the house and sign the deed over to nicklas.the second letter,also ordering the man to leave the house,was styled as a final warning by nicklas.
on november,a grand jury returned an indictment charging nicklas with knowingly and willfully transmitting in interstate commerce a facsimile communication containing a threat,in violation of c.according to the indictment,in september,nicklas faxed the department of justice,inspector general,the following message 
dear sir i understand the fbi is under attack nationwide.agents are being killed in a number of cities and a major task force in sic trying to figure out why.remember what i told you last week.tom duvall,gambino crime boss gave you a message.for each day i do not receive the deed to my property which you are illegally holding,an fbi agent will die.the deadline is noon of each day.the fbi satellite office in fayetteville,ar has the deed.any other questions.sincerely,david nicklas.
finding nicklas incompetent to stand trial,the district court committed nicklas to the government custody,pursuant to d,to determine whether there is a substantial probability that in the foreseeable future he will attain the capacity to permit the proceedings to go forward.psychiatrist ralph newman,and psychologist maureen reardon,performed a forensic evaluation of nicklas records,reviewed nicklas mental and physical condition,and requested that the district court order involuntary administration of medication in order to restore nicklas competency to stand trial.the district court referred the request to the magistrate judge who issued a report and recommendation that the request to medicate nicklas be granted.the district court adopted the report and recommendation in toto,ordering that nicklas be forcibly injected should he refuse to take his oral medication voluntarily.nicklas appeals.
ii.discussion 
in sell,the supreme court set forth four criteria the government must satisfy before it may obtain an order to forcibly medicate.see id.at.in united states fazio,cir,petition for cert.filed,we explained 
first,a court must find that important governmental interests are at stake,though s pecial circumstances may lessen the importance of that interest.second,the court must conclude that involuntary medication will significantly further those concomitant state interests.this includes finding that administration of the drugs is substantially likely to render the defendant competent to stand trial,and a t the same time that administration of the drugs is substantially unlikely to have side effects that will interfere significantly with the defendant ability to assist counsel in conducting a trial defense,thereby rendering the trial unfair.third,the court must conclude that involuntary medication is necessary to further those interests and that any alternative,less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve substantially the same results.fourth,and finally,the court must conclude that administration of the drugs is medically appropriate,in the patient best medical interest in light of his medical condition.the court then emphasized that the goal of this test is to determine whether involuntary administration of drugs is necessary significantly to further a particular governmental interest,namely,the interest in rendering the defendant competent to stand trial.
id.at citations omitted.it is the government burden to prove the final three sell factors by clear and convincing evidence.id.at.w e review de novo the district court determination that important governmental interests are at stake,and we review the district court determinations with respect to the remaining sell factors for clear error.id.at.
on the first factor,we conclude important governmental interests are at stake and no special circumstances have lessened those interests in this case.the government interest in bringing to trial an individual accused of a serious crime is important.that is so whether the offense is a serious crime against the person or a serious crime against property.sell,at.nicklas does not dispute the district court finding that transmitting a threatening communication in interstate commerce is certainly a serious offense.united states nicklas,wl,at.nicklas does argue special circumstances exist because f orcibly medicating nicklas will put him in the exact same circumstance he currently is commitment in a medical facility if found to be a danger to others or their property.we disagree.
nicklas may find himself in similar circumstances if he is forcibly medicated,but as the district court observed,this likely result is not certain.although presently incompetent to stand trial,and therefore incompetent to make decisions,nicklas has indicated that,were he brought to trial,he may not assert an insanity defense.if nicklas maintains this view when brought to competence,he could well be convicted of the charge of the indictment nicklas argument that the government lacks an interest in prosecuting him because any prosecution would not alter his position therefore fails.
another important governmental interest in prosecuting nicklas is protecting the public from his future crimes.nicklas has been in custody for less than half the time for which he could be imprisoned if convicted of the charge of the indictment see c imposing a statutory maximum.in view of the admitted seriousness of the offense and the proportion of the potential sentence served,we conclude the length of nicklas confinement does not yet indicate a special circumstance.see sell,at deciding the possibility that the defendant has already been confined for a significant amount of time for which he would receive credit toward any sentence ultimately imposed,affects,but does not totally undermine,the strength of the need for prosecution.
the recent case of united states white,wl cir,illustrates our conclusion.in white,the fourth circuit court of appeals reversed a district court order to medicate forcibly because,among other reasons,white had served more than the entirety of her likely sentence in detention and because t he alleged victims of white crimes would not likely benefit or be made whole in any way by her prosecution.id.at.in contrast to white,nicklas has served approximately forty percent of the statutory maximum and less than the projected sentence under the united states sentencing guidelines or guidelines in addition,this case is factually dissimilar to white because here nicklas has previously engaged in similar criminal conduct,which was also apparently related to or emanated from his mental disease.unlike white,where the record did not show white was likely to commit relevant future crimes,id.at,nicklas mental illness arguably finds expression in his offenses.for example,in the arkansas state court case,nicklas was convicted of misdemeanor terroristic threatening stemming from his posting of letters to a stranger falsely accusing the man of being an undercover fbi agent illegally living in nicklas house,while in this case nicklas is accused of faxing the fbi a letter that states in part,for each day i do not receive the deed to my property which you are illegally holding,an fbi agent will die.because of the intertwined nature of nicklas mental disease and his crimes,it is reasonable for the government to presume nicklas may persist in committing similar offenses,and the government has a
