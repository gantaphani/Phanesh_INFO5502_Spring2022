in this employment discrimination action,plaintiff regina russell appeals from the district court order granting summary judgment to the defendants,the university of toledo,randall mcelfresh,norine wasielewski,kristine armstrong,and john mills,on the plaintiff claims of disparate treatment,hostile work environment,and retaliation on the basis of race,brought pursuant to title vii,chapter of the ohio revised code,and sections and.russell contends that she raised genuine issues of material fact that militate against the grant of summary judgment.for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that the district court did not commit reversible errors of law in dismissing russell claims against the defendants,and we therefore affirm the order of summary judgment.
factual and procedural background 
registered nurse regina russell,a employee of the university of toledo student medical center,was terminated on may,for failure of good behavior,gross insubordination,and neglect of duty.russell,an female,was first hired as a nurse at the center in and worked in that capacity throughout her employment with the university.that tenure was not,however,without its rough patches and its resulting disciplinary proceedings.
in fact,russell complained that she was treated differently than other center employees and that the sole reason for such disparate treatment was her race.specifically,in an affidavit filed in opposition to the defendants motion for summary judgment and in her deposition testimony,the plaintiff asserted that,over the years of her employment nurses with whom she worked expressed their beliefs that she received her job only through affirmative action programs she was given less desirable working hours than even temporary employees her workspace was deliberately located in the rear of the facility and was treated with less respect than the desks of other nurses she was not permitted leave time to attend committee meetings and other functions when other nurses were and she was disciplined more harshly than other employees who also failed to employ proper nursing methods.
kristine armstrong,the clinic coordinator at the student medical center from through the time of russell termination,did not dispute that russell often worked the latest shift at the center,that the plaintiff often used a desk at the back of the building,that russell was denied permission to attend certain meetings and events,and that the plaintiff had received more frequent discipline than many other employees.armstrong insisted,however,that race was never a factor in decisions affecting russell and that legitimate considerations explained what russell attempted to portray as discriminatory actions.
for example,the coordinator testified in her deposition that the nurses have no assigned desk but have various schedules,various sites they work at.referencing three of the nurses in the student medical center,armstrong stated that there is no sandy desk,there is no gay desk,there is no regina desk.furthermore,the late hours to which russell was assigned resulted in part from the fact that s he was the least senior nurse the entire time she was there and from the fact that temporary contract employees could not be counted on to work those later,unsupervised hours by themselves.armstrong denial of the plaintiff request for leave time to attend conferences or to work on university projects was also not but a function of the need to staff the center at lunch times and at times when other nurses were already absent from the workplace.
according to the defendants,russell ultimate termination was,moreover,the culmination of an escalating pattern of misconduct and insubordination,as well as the inevitable result of a progressive discipline system provided for in a collective bargaining agreement that governed the plaintiff employment.armstrong testified that russell failed to adhere to the center triage policy,that she routinely arrived late to work in the mornings,and was chronically tardy in returning to work after lunch.she said that the plaintiff also often refused to usher patients to treatment rooms because she was addressing personal business in telephone calls or studying for her advanced degree.consequently,armstrong testified,the plaintiff had received verbal and written warnings from her supervisor from time to time.
in november,russell was sent for a hearing after failing to for two months on a tuberculosis skin test that had been performed on a university of toledo student.she was also suspended without pay for five days in november for failing to triage properly a distraught student who had not slept for four days and who visited the center at the request of the university counseling services.rather than gather relevant information from the student and arrange for him to be seen by a physician,the plaintiff sent the young man away because he did not have a appointment at the center.fortunately,a supervisor witnessed the episode,found the student sobbing on the grass outside the building,and brought him back inside for consultation with one of the doctors on duty.notification of that suspension included a written warning to russell that f urther infractions of failure of good behavior and university policy may result in more severe disciplinary action up to and including termination.
in the defendants estimation,just such further infractions occurred on february.on that date,john mills examined a patient who had previously been sutured at another medical facility and determined that the sutures could then be removed.he asked russell to remove the sutures,a request with which the plaintiff did not comply based on her stated position that the student visit would have had to have been classified as a nurse visit,rather than a doctor visit,for her to perform the procedure.even after mills ordered russell to remove the sutures,she demurred,leading mills to report the incident in an to randall mcelfresh,the university director of labor employee relations.in that transmission,mills noted 
i have had recurrent and escalating difficulty having this nurse perform specific functions and nursing duties and have experienced general and sometimes overwhelming recalcitrance and a very disconcerting lack of professionalism,all of which ultimately impacts the level and quality i wish,and the medical center intends to provide.s adly,i am not alone in this experience.
on that same day,february,mills and russell were working together on a young man in respiratory distress.as explained by mills in his deposition 
and as is routine,be it in the er or our workplace,i gave her verbal orders and she knows a lot of things to do anyway,routine things that she does,and we stabilized the patient eventually.
but the issue of contention was,i believe,the instruction or order more accurately to give intravenous methylprednisolone,solumedrol is the generic name,after the iv was established.and i was writing the note,writing things out after the patient was being stabilized,and as minutes passed and the patient became stable after several aerosols and iv fluid and medications that were administered she brought the chart to me and asked me to change the order from iv to im which stands for intramuscular.and i changed my order since she had told me that she had given it intramuscularly instead of intravenously to reflect the actual route of administration.
as a result of the february disputes involving the drug administration and the suture removal,the university labor relations manager,joseph klep,recommended that russell be sent for a hearing on charges of gross insubordination and neglect of duty.mills was also disciplined by the university for an error in judgment for his alteration of the patient medical records.
russell disciplinary hearing resulted in a may,decision to terminate the plaintiff employment with the university.subsequently,russell filed a charge of racial discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and received from them a letter.the plaintiff then timely filed her complaint in federal district court,alleging title vii violations of disparate treatment,maintenance of a hostile work environment,and retaliation violation of the civil rights provisions of section a conspiracy to violate her civil rights in contravention of the provisions of section violations of ohio antidiscrimination principles codified in chapter of the ohio revised code and violations of ohio public policy.
following a period of discovery,the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment,a motion that a magistrate judge recommended be granted.objections filed by the plaintiff to the magistrate judge report and recommendation were then considered by the district judge,who ultimately denied them in a memorandum opinion.in doing so,however,the district court specifically disagreed with the magistrate judge conclusion that russell failed to satisfy her burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation.nevertheless,the court determined that russell did not adduce facts sufficient to raise a genuine issue of whether the defendants actions were actually pretexts for forbidden discrimination and thus granted summary judgment for the defendants on each of russell causes of action.
discussion 
on appeal,russell takes issue with most,but not all,of the substantive rulings made in this case by the magistrate judge and the district court.for example,she contends that the district court erred in concluding that the defendants proffered reasons for terminating her employment at the student medical center were not simply a pretext for prohibited racial discrimination she insists that she offered evidence that employees were treated more favorably than she was she argues that questions of fact existed as to whether the plaintiff established prima facie cases of hostile work environment discrimination and retaliation and she maintains that the district court mistakenly believed that she did not sue defendants in their individual capacities in the count of the complaint alleging a section violation.
we review grants of summary judgment by a district court de novo.see ciminillo streicher,cir.summary judgment should be rendered if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.a genuine issue of material fact exists only when,assuming the truth of the party evidence and construing all inferences from that evidence in the light most favorable to the party,there is sufficient evidence for a trier of fact to find for that party.a party can not withstand summary judgment,however,by introduction of a mere scintilla of evidence in its favor.see ciminillo,at.
disparate treatment 
russell raises claims of racial discrimination under both title vii and section of the ohio revised code.those federal and state claims may be analyzed together,however,because ohio requirements are the same as under federal law.carter of toledo,cir.
lacking any direct evidence of the defendants racial discrimination,russell attempted to prove her claims of disparate treatment by use of circumstantial evidence of discrimination according to the framework outlined in mcdonnell douglas green,d,and texas department of community affairs burdine,d.pursuant to that mode of analysis,a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that she is a member of a protected group,she was subject to an adverse employment decision,she was qualified for the position,and she was replaced by a person outside of the protected class.carter,at.a plaintiff may also satisfy the fourth prong of a prima facie case showing by adducing evidence that she was treated differently than similarly situated employees.newman fed.express,cir.
establishment of a prima facie case by the plaintiff creates a rebuttable presumption of discrimination,and the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for taking the challenged employment action.if the defendant satisfies this burden,the plaintiff must then prove that the proffered reason was actually a pretext to hide unlawful discrimination.id.citations omitted.to establish such pretext,a plaintiff must show either that the proffered reasons had no basis in fact,that the proffered reasons did not actually motivate her discharge,or that they were insufficient to motivate discharge.manzer diamond shamrock chems,cir.
the magistrate judge determined that the defendants were entitled to summary judgment in this case on the plaintiff disparate treatment claim because russell failed to establish that employees outside the protected class were treated more favorably than she was.as recognized in carter,however,the fact that a plaintiff is replaced by someone not in the protected class is also sufficient to satisfy the fourth prong of the prima facie case analysis.there is no disagreement,moreover,among the parties that russell replacement,erica spychalski,was caucasian,white.thus,russell did indeed establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment in this matter.
nevertheless,the defendants articulated legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons for the plaintiff discharge,reasons focusing on russell failure to remove a patient sutures at the direction of a physician and the plaintiff failure to follow orders about how medication was to be administered to another student patient.consequently,in an effort to prevail on her disparate treatment claim,russell now argues that those articulated reasons were pretextual only and masked a prohibited discriminatory intent.
she first insists that the articulated bases for her discharge had no factual foundation.according to the plaintiff,she did not refuse to remove sutures from a patient she simply sought to require that the clinic records be changed to reflect that the procedure would be performed by a nurse rather than by a physician.likewise,she argues that mills never instructed her to deliver certain medicine intravenously and,in fact,that clinic procedures mandated intramuscular injections for the prescribed dosages of such medications.
but,even if russell is correct in these characterizations,they are not sufficient to defeat summary judgment on this claim.under this circuit modified doctrine,for an employer to avoid a finding that its claimed nondiscriminatory reason was pretextual,the employer must be able to establish its reasonable reliance on the particularized facts that were before it at the time the decision was made.wright murray guard,cir emphasis added.the employee then has the opportunity to introduce contrary evidence,but the decisional process need not be optimal,only reasonably informed and considered.see id.in this matter,regardless of the semantics used by the plaintiff,even regina russell herself does not deny that she did not actually remove a particular patient sutures when directed to do so by mills.consequently,she is unable to advance any evidence indicating that the defendant university did not have an honest belief that russell refused to comply with a directive given by the medical caregiver ultimately responsible for the patient.
similarly,the defendant employer had sufficient information before it reasonably to rely upon facts indicating that the plaintiff chose to disregard the medical directive concerning the type of injection to be given another clinic patient.the validity of the doctor account of the dispute was lent even more credence by the fact that the doctor himself was forced to alter his records to reflect the plaintiff different injection method,a change that ultimately led to a reprimand of the doctor also.in short,russell has offered no evidence indicating that the defendants made the termination decision on grounds other than those offered or that the defendants did not reasonably believe that the plaintiff twice failed to comply with direct orders given by the physician responsible for the care of patients being treated by him.
russell also argues that the two identified acts of insubordination did not actually motivate the discharge decision.rather,she claims that numerous other experiences at the medical center,when taken together,establish that invidious discrimination must have been the true impetus for the adverse employment decision.for example,russell alleges that she was forced to use a desk in the back of the clinic,that other student medical center employees openly surmised that she must have obtained her job through affirmative action initiatives,that she was denied leave time for university functions that was granted to white employees,and that her workspace was trashed by other nurses while russell was on vacation.
these incidents,however,either singularly or in tandem,are insufficient to establish racial animosity at the student medical center.first,uncontradicted evidence in the record established that the nurses at the student health center did not have assigned desks,although they may well have routinely used certain work stations.second,even had the desks been assigned,no testimony was offered during any deposition that desks other than the station in the rear of the facility were available at the time russell was hired in.
similarly,comments from other employees shortly after russell hire that she would not have received the job but for the university adherence to affirmative action principles are irrelevant when deciding whether those employees superiors were racially motivated when firing the plaintiff years later.likewise,statements made by other nurses that russell was not a pleasant do not necessarily indicate discriminatory animus sufficient to create a genuine factual issue.in fact,such comments are more likely expressions of the frustration that other health center employees felt as a result of russell reluctance to perform certain menial tasks and her habit of requesting fridays off and thus foreclosing the possibility that other nurses could enjoy weekends and then showing up at work anyway.
the record before this court also contains no evidence and no indication that denials of russell requests for leave time to attend diversity committee meetings or continuing education events were racially motivated.instead,the plaintiff supervisor explained that staffing considerations mandated that certain individuals with more advanced training be available at the center during evening hours and that russell not be absent from the facility during other patient hours due to the illnesses,pregnancies,or other unavoidable absences of other employees.
other alleged instances of racially discriminatory treatment highlighted by the plaintiff are even less indicative of an improper purpose behind the defendants employment decision.for example,russell complaints about trash at her work station when she returned from vacations were clearly overreactions to innocent behavior.investigations of the plaintiff complaints regarding the condition of module a nursing station resulted in the following explanatory memorandum from norine wasielewski to russell on july,
upon investigation into your incident report of july,i have found that there was one water bottle and one soda can inadvertently left on the desk opposite your customary workstation and no ill intent noted by the staff member in question.while it is preferable for all employees to leave a workstation in good order,this is an unfortunate result of what was an extremely busy day.
the staff member working at that desk was covering for you while you were scheduled off on vacation from july to july and was unaware that you were working the next day.given this information,i am unsure as to how the staff members sic behavior could be construed as harassment when you were not expected to return from vacation on the day in question.
by memorandum of january,wasielewski reiterated,in regard to another complaint from russell 
while it is preferable for all employees to leave a nursing station just as they found it,this is not an unusual event.there are several other offices and workstations which are shared with other student medical staff members as well as contingent staff.kris armstrong has spoke sic with the other individuals who worked in module a during your absence the week of december,and none of them meant any intentional harm.this is an unfortunate inconvenience of sharing a workplace.
under this second prong of the manzer pretext analysis,the plaintiff admits the factual basis underlying the employer proffered explanation and further admits that such conduct could motivate dismissal.manzer,at.nevertheless,
the plaintiff attempts to indict the credibility of the employer explanation by showing circumstances which tend to prove that an illegal motivation was more likely than that offered by the defendant.in other words,the plaintiff argues that the sheer weight of the circumstantial evidence of discrimination makes it more likely than not that the employer explanation is a pretext,or coverup.
id.because russell has not adduced evidence indicating a discriminatory motive in any of the employer actions,however,she has failed to establish pretext under this scenario.
in the alternative,to satisfy the third prong of the manzer pretext analysis framework,the plaintiff must show that the employer proffered reasons for the challenged employment action were insufficient to motivate that discharge.such a showing ordinarily consists of evidence that other employees,particularly employees not in the protected class,were not fired even though they engaged in substantially identical conduct to that which the employer contends motivated its discharge of the plaintiff.id.as this court held in ercegovich goodyear tire rubber,cir 
t o be deemed similarly situated in the disciplinary context,the individuals with whom the plaintiff seeks to compare treatment must have dealt with the same supervisor,have been subject to the same standards and have engaged in the same conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer treatment of them for it.mitchell toledo hosp,cir.
russell has failed to establish,however,that any other employees of the student medical center were so similarly situated.in its memorandum opinion,the district court correctly explained why this was so 
plaintiff claims she was to defendant armstrong,a caucasian employee,who was not displaced for failing to properly triage a patient in or rupturing a patient ear drum elizabeth graflin,a caucasian employee,who obtained medical treatment for her spouse in contradiction to student medical center policy gay trace,a caucasian employee,who placed a patient in a treatment room and left for the day without informing anyone about the patient whereabouts and colleen yoder,a caucasian employee who was given flexible time to attend class.
the actions of each of these other employees are distinguishable from plaintiff actions.the record indicates a long history of complaints about plaintiff work performance and attitude,as well as multiple disciplinary actions,such as written warnings,suspensions,working suspensions,and eventually termination.there is no indication armstrong,graflin,trace or yoder had similar histories of discipline clearly,there exist differentiating circumstances which distinguish plaintiff conduct from that of the other employees,including plaintiff extensive history of poor performance.therefore,armstrong,graflin,trace and yoder are not similarly situated to plaintiff,and plaintiff can not prove defendants legitimate nondiscriminatory reason was insufficient to terminate her employment.
russell asserts that the other employees lack of prior disciplinary records,in and of itself,establishes that she was treated differently than caucasian employees.the explanation for the lack of prior disciplinary records for armstrong,graflin,trace,and yoder,however,is simply the stark absence of evidence that those individuals had engaged in improper conduct prior to the incidents emphasized by russell.again,that fact alone means that the plaintiff was not similarly situated to the individuals with whom she seeks to compare herself.
hostile work environment 
russell also submits that she was subjected to a hostile work environment at the student medical center solely because of her race.in her brief on appeal,russe
