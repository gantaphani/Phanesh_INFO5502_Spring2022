these consolidated appeals involve the application of an arkansas statute that requires the immunization of arkansas schoolchildren against hepatitis ann.a the district courts held that the statute religious beliefs exemption violated the establishment clause of the first amendment because the exemption applied only to the religious tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious denomination.ann.d emphasis added.the district courts then determined that the exemption was severable from the remainder of the statute.construing the statute without the exemption,the district courts held that the underlying immunization requirement survived due process,equal protection,and hybrid rights challenges.on appeal,we do not reach the merits of the claims raised below because the arkansas legislature rendered these issues moot when it broadened the exemption to encompass philosophical as well as religious objections.see ann.d a.instead,we set forth the general history of these matters,explain the changes in arkansas law,and address the issue of mootness as discussed by the parties in their supplemental,briefs.
background 
because the issues in this case do not turn on the specific facts that differentiate each individual party,we forgo a detailed discussion of the individual parties and the specific facts that gave rise to their actions.instead,we describe the parties generally by their respective roles.the first group of parties consists of arkansas schoolchildren who were excluded from school or threatened with exclusion from school for failure to receive immunization treatments for hepatitis b.this group also includes the parents of the schoolchildren collectively,the schoolchildren.the second group consists of the arkansas departments of health and education and various officials from these two departments,including fay boozman,the director of the arkansas department of health collectively,the officials.the final group consists of various individual arkansas school districts collectively,the school districts.in each case,the schoolchildren brought suit against the school districts the officials.
the schoolchildren in each case alleged that they held sincere religious beliefs that prevented each child from being immunized for hepatitis b.the schoolchildren did not belong to any recognized religion that had as one of its tenets opposition to immunization for hepatitis we,like the district courts,assume for the purposes of our analysis that the schoolchildren held sincere religious beliefs against hepatitis b vaccination.
in case the schoolchildren argued that the religious beliefs exemption violated the establishment clause of the first amendment by permitting exemptions only for beliefs associated with a recognized religion.they also argued that the underlying immunization requirement violated their equal protection and due process rights under the fourteenth amendment.the district court accepted the schoolchildren arguments regarding the establishment clause challenge,but held the religious beliefs exemption severable.the district court then rejected the schoolchildren equal protection and due process challenges to the underlying immunization requirement,finding that the supreme court had repeatedly ruled such requirements permissible.see zucht king.jacobson massachusetts.accordingly,the district court preserved the immunization requirement but severed the exemption.
noting the hollow nature of the schoolchildren victory,the district court stated 
our holding does not afford relief of any real value to the plaintiff because his daughter remains subject to receiving the required shots as a condition of attending school within the state of arkansas.this decision will also be of understandable concern to those who previously enjoyed the immunization exemption as adherents or members of a recognized church or religious denomination.however,the recourse of both groups is to communicate their concerns to the arkansas legislature,for it is within the province of the legislature and not this court to enact a religious exemption provision that comes within constitutional boundaries.
in case,the schoolchildren brought suit against the officials and school districts.the district court adopted the analysis of the earlier opinion and,in addition,set forth a separate analysis to conclude that the religious beliefs exemption was unconstitutional and severable.the district court rejected the schoolchildren argument that the first amendment free exercise clause demanded a compelling interest analysis of the compulsory immunization requirement.instead,the district court found that the statute was a neutral statute of general applicability that did not target religious beliefs.the district court also rejected the argument that other constitutional rights,such as,inter alia,a parent right to control a child education,reinforced the underlying free exercise rights challenge and mandated the application of compelling interest review under a hybrid rights analysis.see,employment,oregon dep t of human res.smith,d discussing the application of compelling interest review in cases that involve alleged first amendment violations in combination with other alleged constitutional violations.finally,the district court rejected a substantive due process challenge under the fourteenth amendment in which the schoolchildren alleged that the right to refuse medical treatment was a fundamental liberty interest that mandated compelling interest review of the compulsory immunization statute.
in case,the schoolchildren brought suit against the officials and the school districts and argued issues similar to those described above.in addition,the schoolchildren argued that because the compulsory immunization statute provided individualized exemptions for secular purposes,such as medical exigencies,a general religious exemption was necessary to avoid a free exercise violation.the district court rejected these arguments.
finally,case involves a from two of the school districts,the morningstar and lake hamilton school districts.the morningstar and lake hamilton school districts moved for dismissal arguing that they were involved in no justiciable case or controversy with the schoolchildren.pointing to the fact that the relevant arkansas statutes and rules provide for criminal sanctions against school officials who fail to enforce the immunization requirements,the morningstar and lake hamilton school districts characterized themselves as disinterested bystanders caught in the crossfire between the schoolchildren and the officials.see ann.c b any school official,parent,or guardian violating the regulations shall be subject to the penalties imposed herein.id.e any person found guilty of violating the provisions of this section or the regulations promulgated by the state board of education or the division for the enforcement hereof shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.the district court rejected the motion to dismiss,finding that the lake hamilton and morningstar school districts were proper parties to the litigation.
after obtaining jurisdiction,we entered a temporary stay to permit the schoolchildren to attend school pending resolution of their appeals.after oral arguments,we noted that the schoolchildren had followed the district court suggestion and communicated their concerns to the arkansas legislature.as a result,the arkansas legislature had amended the exemption portion of the statute to omit reference to recognized religions and to provide broader exemptions based on religious or philosophical beliefs.id.d a it appeared,however,that the broadened exemption was not yet in force because the arkansas department of health had not passed necessary implementing regulations and the amended statute specifically prohibited the granting of exemptions prior to passage of the implementing regulations.see id.d d.accordingly,it was not clear whether any schoolchildren would be excluded from school in the absence of our temporary stay.
we directed the parties to submit supplemental briefs to address whether the anticipated availability of a broadened exemption mooted the underlying challenges to
