leroy robbins appeals an affirmance of the commissioner of social security partial denial of benefits.we have jurisdiction to review under.we reverse and remand because the commissioner decision is not supported by substantial evidence.
background 
in october,robbins filed applications for supplemental security income and disability insurance benefits.he alleged he has been disabled since august by depression and severe impairments to his neck,left shoulder,back and knees.after his applications were denied initially and upon reconsideration,robbins requested and was granted a hearing in march before administrative law judge alj eileen burlison during which the august testimony of robbins and his son rodney were accepted into the record.judge burlison denied robbins claims and,in august,the social security appeals council denied his request for review.robbins then filed a complaint for review with the district court.
in august,based on a stipulation by the parties,the district court reversed judge burlison determination.the district court ordered the alj on remand to order and evaluate a consultative exam as to robbins mental impairment claim hold a new hearing reevaluate the credibility of robbins and of other lay testimony and reevaluate robbins residual functional capacity rfc and ability to perform past relevant or other work.in february,a second hearing was conducted by administrative law judge riley atkins,who found robbins disabled as of september,but not before.because robbins did not file a written challenge to this decision,judge atkins determination became the commissioner final decision.
in march,robbins filed a complaint for review with the district court challenging this partial denial of benefits.in september,the district court affirmed the commissioner decision.robbins timely appeals that judgment,challenging the alj determinations at steps four and five of the commissioner sequential evaluation process for determining if a claimant is disabled 
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo the findings of the district court.flaten sec y of health human,cir.we may set aside a denial of benefits only if it is not supported by substantial evidence or is based on legal error.id.substantial evidence means more than a mere scintilla,but less than a preponderance,such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.young sullivan,cir.if the evidence can support either affirming or reversing the alj conclusion,we may not substitute our judgment for that of the alj.flaten,at.however,a reviewing court must consider the entire record as a whole and may not affirm simply by isolating a specific quantum of supporting evidence.hammock bowen,cir.
rfc determination 
as part of his step four determination,the alj determined robbins rfc.see a iv,soc.sec.ruling july,ssr,wl.the alj found robbins was capable of less than a wide or full range of medium exertion with postural and manipulative limitations from his alleged august onset date through september,and from september,on,less than a wide or full range of light exertion,requiring a option in addition to the same,additional limitations.
at step five,the alj found that,for the period between august and september,robbins was not disabled.this conclusion relied on testimony of a vocational expert at the february hearing that because,based on his determined medium rfc,robbins had been capable of working as a general clerk or security or gate guard,positions that had existed in significant numbers in the national economy during that time.based on similar testimony and the determined light rfc,the alj found robbins was disabled as of september.
adverse credibility finding 
in determining a claimant rfc,an alj must consider all relevant evidence in the record,including,inter alia,medical records,lay evidence,and the effects of symptoms,including pain,that are reasonably attributed to a medically determinable impairment.see ssr,wl,at accord a,a.moreover,ssr directs that c areful consideration be given to any evidence about symptoms because subjective descriptions may indicate more severe limitations or restrictions than can be shown by medical evidence alone.see ssr,wl,at.when giving such consideration,if the record establishes the existence of a medically determinable impairment that could reasonably give rise to the reported symptoms,an alj must make a finding as to the credibility of the claimant statements about the symptoms and their functional effect.see soc.sec.ruling july,ssr,wl,at,smolen chater,cir.
while an alj may find testimony not credible in part or in whole,he or she may not disregard it solely because it is not substantiated affirmatively by objective medical evidence.see ssr,wl,at light soc.sec,cir.moreover,unless an alj makes a finding of malingering based on affirmative evidence thereof,he or she may only find an applicant not credible by making specific findings as to credibility and stating clear and convincing reasons for each.see smolen,at once a claimant meets the cotton test and there is no affirmative evidence suggesting she is malingering,the alj may reject the claimant testimony regarding the severity of her symptoms only if he makes specific findings stating clear and convincing reasons for doing so.
in this case,there is no dispute that the record establishes the existence of impairments to robbins shoulder,back and knees as of august,which could have given rise to the severe pain and functional limitations between that date and september,to which robbins testified in his record affidavit.as a result,the alj was required to make a credibility finding as to robbins own testimony.because the alj made no finding that robbins was malingering,he was required to give clear and convincing reasons in support of his adverse credibility finding.id.
the record shows that the alj found robbins testimony to be not entirely credible.reading the alj fleeting credibility finding in the best light,he offers the following as justification first,robbins testimony was not consistent with or supported by the overall medical evidence of record second,his testimony regarding his alcohol dependence and abuse problem remains equivocal,based on his conflicting testimony and reports to doctors of maintaining sobriety,versus continuing to drink in lesser amounts.
taking the latter first,we do not consider a cursory finding that a single line of testimony is equivocal sufficient to constitute substantial evidence.while conflicting or inconsistent testimony concerning alcohol use can contribute to an adverse credibility finding,see,verduzco apfel,cir finding applicant testimony not credible where there was evidence of malingering and where the testimony and various statements regarding his drinking were not consistent,in this case it can not justify such a finding alone and without further corroboration or explanation 
as for the former justification,it is exactly the type we have previously recognized the regulations prohibit.see ssr,wl,at light,at in this case,the alj disbelieved light because no objective medical evidence supported light testimony regarding the severity of subjective symptoms from which he suffers,particularly pain.an alj may not discredit a claimant subjective testimony on that basis.to find the claimant not credible,the alj must rely either on reasons unrelated to the subjective testimony,reputation for dishonesty,on conflicts between his testimony and his own conduct,or on internal contradictions in that testimony.
in addition,we note that the alj did not provide a narrative discussion that contain s specific reasons for the finding,supported by the evidence in the case record nor was his brief notation sufficiently specific to make clear the weight the adjudicator gave to the individual statements and the reasons for that weight,as he is required to do.see ssr,wl,ssr,wl,at.so,even if the alj had given facially legitimate reasons for his partial adverse credibility finding,the complete lack of meaningful explanation gives this court nothing with which to assess its legitimacy.while an alj may certainly find testimony not credible and disregard it as an unsupported,statement,we can not affirm such a determination unless it is supported by specific findings and reasoning.see flaten,at.
lay witness testimony 
it is uncontested that the alj erred by failing to account for the august testimony of robbins son rodney,in which rodney offered eyewitness evidence supporting his father claims as to functional limitations and severity of pain.as the commissioner concedes,the alj is required to account for all lay witness testimony in the discussion of his or her findings.lewis apfel,cir lay testimony as to a claimant symptoms is competent evidence that an alj must take into account,unless he or she expressly determines to disregard such testimony and gives reasons germane to each witness for doing so.
we disagree with the commissioner suggestion that this error was harmless.while there may be cases in which the failure to consider lay witness testimony can be harmless,this is not one of them.we recently clarified the proper application of the harmless error standard in social security cases.see stout comm r,cir.after reviewing our relevant prior decisions,we explained that we have only found harmless error when it was clear from the record that an alj error was inconsequential to the ultimate nondisability determination,noting that we had never found harmless an alj silent disregard of lay testimony about how an impairment limits a claimant ability to work.id.accordingly,we held in stout that where the alj error lies in a failure to properly discuss competent lay testimony favorable to the claimant,a reviewing court can not consider the error harmless unless it can confidently conclude that no reasonable alj,when fully crediting the testimony,could have reached a different disability determination.id.at.
besides robbins own testimony,the alj had only that of his wife,daughter and son to consider.given that the testimony of robbins son directly supports his claim of disability since august,the fact that the alj considered the similar testimony of robbins daughter can not alone support a finding of harmlessness.indeed,if credited,the testimony of robbins son adds substantial weight not only to robbins claim,but also to the testimony of robbins wife and daughter,which support robbins claim.because the alj did not make a legally sufficient adverse credibility finding with regard to robbins own testimony,we can not say with respect to rodney testimony that no reasonable alj,when fully crediting the testimony,could have reached a different disability determination.id.
by failing to properly account for the testimony of robbins and his son,the alj erred in assessing the record testimony offered in support of robbins disability claim.while the alj rfc determination appears proper as to the limitations he considered,his failure to explain his dismissal of other claimed limitations results in our finding that substantial evidence does not support the alj rfc determination.
vocational expert hypothetical 
robbins also challenges the alj step five determination of his ability before september,to perform other work available in the national economy.he argues that the hypothetical posed to the vocational expert was inadequate because it excluded some of his functional limitations.this challenge engages the errors discussed above 
as the commissioner correctly recognizes,in hypotheticals posed to a vocational expert,the alj must only include those limitations supported by substantial evidence.see osenbrock apfel,cir.conversely,an alj is not free to disregard properly supported limitations.the alj failure to account for the testimony of robbins and his son calls into question the validity of his determination of robbins limitations and rfc before september.because those determinations were flawed,the hypothetical posed to the vocational expert was legally inadequate.id.such a failure can not be deemed harmless because,if the ignored testimony is credited,a proper hypothetical would have included limitations which,the record suggests,would have been determinative as to the vocational expert recommendation to the alj.accordingly,the alj step five determination is unsupported by substantial evidence.see id.at an alj must propose a hypothetical that is based on medical assumptions supported by substantial evidence in the record that reflects each of the claimant limitations.
reversed and remanded.
i respectfully dissent from the court holding that reversal and remand are required in this case.the administrative law judge alj analysis is thorough and cogent,and it should be affirmed.
first,the majority overturns the alj adverse credibility determination.op.at.i disagree with its analysis,and i would instead hold that the alj satisfied the requirement of providing clear and convincing reasons for its finding,which is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.see reddick chater,cir johnson shalala,cir.
as the majority suggests,we have held previously that t he claimant need not produce objective medical evidence of the pain or fatigue itself,or the severity thereof.smolen chater,cir.in other words,an alj may not discredit the claimant allegations of the severity of pain solely on the ground that the allegations are unsupported by objective medical evidence.bunnell sullivan,cir en banc emphasis added accord c.that point of law is.
the applicable regulations,however,make clear to claimants that in e valuating the intensity and persistence of your symptoms,such as pain,and determining the extent to which your symptoms limit your capacity for work,the agency will consider all of the available evidence,including your history,the signs and laboratory findings,and statements from you,your treating or nontreating source,or other persons about how your symptoms affect you.c.they specifically state that the agency will also consider the medical opinions of your treating source and other medical opinions.id.the regulations continue 
objective medical evidence of this type is a useful indicator to assist us in making reasonable conclusions about the intensity and persistence of your symptoms and the effect those symptoms,such as pain,may have on your ability to work 
we will consider your statements about the intensity,persistence,and limiting effects of your symptoms,and we will evaluate your statements in relation to the objective medical evidence and other evidence,in reaching a conclusion as to whether you are disabled.we will consider whether there are any inconsistencies in the evidence and the extent to which there are any conflicts between your statements and the rest of the evidence,including your history,the signs and laboratory findings,and statements by your treating or nontreating source or other persons about how your symptoms affect you.
id.c,emphases added accord id.c.we have also recognized that an alj may consider,as a factor in discrediting a claimant subjective complaints,testimony from physicians and third parties concerning the nature,severity,and effect of the symptoms of which claimant complains.thomas barnhart,cir quoting light soc.sec,cir accord smolen,at stating that the alj shall consider the observations of treating and examining physicians regarding,inter alia,any functional restrictions caused by the symptoms.the applicable social security ruling states likewise.it instructs that the adjudicator credibility finding must be based on the available medical signs and laboratory findings,as well as on any statements and other information provided by treating or examining physicians or psychologists and other persons about the symptoms and how they affect the individual.see ssr,wl,at.
in short,while the claimant is not required to provide objective medical evidence affirmatively proving the severity of his pain,bunnell,at,the foregoing authority makes clear that an alj may reject a claimant statements about the severity of his symptoms and how they affect him if those statements are inconsistent with or contradicted by the objective medical evidence.see,johnson,at noting that t he alj also identified several contradictions between claimant testimony and the relevant medical evidence.the majority confusion on this fundamental issue is patent.
the alj assessment of appellant leroy robbins testimony,which i would hold entirely proper,began with the following correct statement of law 
in establishing the residual functional capacity,i must determine whether claimant complaints of symptoms can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence and other evidence based on the requirements of and social security ruling.i must also consider any medical opinions from acceptable medical sources which reflect judgments about the nature and severity of the impairments and resulting limitations on claimant residual functional capacity.
citations omitted.the alj then noted robbins testimony regarding his past work,which was that he was no longer able to even carry a can of paint upstairs.robbins had further testified that his typical day consist ed of sitting and watching television,because of his pain.
the alj found these allegations regarding robbins functional limitations not entirely credible,noting that they were not consistent with or supported by the overall medical evidence of record which reflects no serious physical or mental functional limitations.in making that finding,the alj permissibly relied on the opinion of victoria carvalho,which was that robbins was consistently assessed as capable of medium exertion,with the accommodation due to robbins perceived pain of being able to change position every hours,for minutes.aside from a slight deviation in the claimant knees,ankles and toes,carvalho had assessed robbins as having no functional impairment in the upper or lower extremities good strength and no difficulties ambulating.it was also proper for the alj to rely on the opinion of the impartial medical examiner,orin bruton,who agreed that robbins could perform duties involving medium exertion.further,julie isaacson opined that robbins knee pain had improved following surgery and that he should get back in the work force.as for robbins psychological state,paul stoltzfus view,even as late as,was that he had only slight or mild socialization limitations in a work environment and no cognitive functional limitations.see ssr,at stating that the alj credibility determination should take into account any d iagnosis,prognosis,and other medical opinions provided by treating or examining physicians or psychologists and other medical sources.
these medical opinions simply were not consistent with robbins claim that his pain resigned him to a sedentary life of watching television.thus,the alj did not,as the majority erroneously holds,disregard robbins testimony solely because he did not prove the severity of his pain by objective medical evidence.rather,in the phrasing of the social security administration,the alj properly found that robbins alleged functional limitations and restrictions due to symptoms could not reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence and other evidence in the case record.ssr,at.
the majority approach is one i hope we will not repeat.its conflating of the two relevant lack of affirmative support versus the presence of contradictory medical absolutely bar adjudicators from making adverse credibility determinations so long as the claimants are able to keep their stories straight.the applicable regulations,agency ruling,and case law all counsel strongly against such an approach.
additionally,a claimant inconsistent statements about the use of alcohol can contribute to a determination regarding that claimant credibility.see thomas,at verduzco apfel,cir.
the alj made such a finding in this case,stating that robbins presented conflicting testimony and reports to doctors of maintaining sobriety,versus continuing to drink in lesser amounts.the alj noted that d uring his initial screening on april,robbins specifically denied having a problem with alcohol.yet during that same period,charles reagan observed,the claimant has been drinking up to a case a day.this drinking escalated beginning in.then on november,as the alj further noted,robbins reported to carvalho that he continues drink but admitted he did have a problem with alcohol.
the majority fallback argument is that the alj decision is characterized by a complete lack of meaningful explanation which gives this court nothing with which to assess its legitimacy.op.at.it asserts that the same error infects the alj finding regarding robbins conflicting testimony as to his alcohol abuse.see op.at.
it is unclear to me why the majority chooses simply to disregard the many pages preceding as well as the few pages following the paragraph in which the alj made the credibility determination explicit.as the commissioner suggests,after discussing in great detail the reasons supporting its ultimate findings,the alj was not required explicitly to link his determination to those reasons.see,lewis apfel,cir in all,the alj at least noted arguably germane reasons for dismissing the family members testimony,even if he did not clearly link his determination to those reasons.
indeed,all of the reasons discussed above constitute grounds invoked by the agency,sec chenery,or reasons the alj assert ed,connett barnhart,cir.the majority is utterly wrong to suggest otherwise.
in sum,the alj properly supported and adequately explained his adverse credibility determination.the finding is supported by specific,clear,and convincing reasons,and it should be affirmed.
i also disagree with the majority view that a remand is required because the alj failed explicitly to comment on the lay opinion testimony of rodney robbins,the claimant son.see op.at.
the application of harmless error doctrine in our review of the denial of social security disability benefits is.see,booz sec y of health human,cir.in batson comm r of soc.sec,cir,for example,we simply asked whether there remained substantial evidence supporting the alj decision,or whether the error in any way negate d the validity of the alj ultimate conclusion.id.at.a similar analysis would have been proper in this case.
but,as the majority says,w e recently clarified the proper application of the harmless error standard in social security cases.op.at.i did not agree with this same majority formulation in stout commissioner,cir,and i do not endorse it here.stout no reasonable alj standard unduly curtails the latitude we have always accorded to the administrative bodies we review.
regardless,i would hold that the alj error in this case was under stout exacting test.in stout,as in each of the cases upon which the majority there relied,the alj failed to consider all available lay witness testimony.see at citing various cases.this case is quite different.although the alj failed to comment on the testimony of the claimant son,he considered at length the strikingly similar testimony of the claimant wife and daughter.given that aspect of the case,as well as the nature of the alj ultimate determination,we can confidently conclude that no reasonable alj,even fully crediting the omitted testimony,could have reached a different disability determination.id.
as noted,the majority reverses because the alj erred in failing to mention the substance of roughly four pages of rodney robbins unsworn testimony,dated august.rodney testified that in august his father had trouble walking,a slight limp that become more pronounced on some days than others.he explained that given his father high level of pain tolerance,his verbalizing his pain was noteworthy.rodney recalled his father having some difficulty using his arms and hands.he further testified that his father was in pain on approximately half of the occasions on which rodney saw him,and that his father would become worn out easily.rodney also noticed marked depression and some irritability.according to rodney testimony,his father condition had only worsened since august.
though the alj did not mention this testimony in his decision,he did explicitly consider the testimony of rhonda heaps,robbins daughter.heaps testified that she had seen her father two to three times per week since august.she testified that he had difficulty walking because of swolle
