the plaintiff,umass memorial medical center hospital,seeks a judgment vacating an arbitration award that was entered in favor of the defendant,united food and commercial workers union union.the issue is whether the district court erred when it upheld the arbitral award and denied the defendant request for attorney fees.for the reasons stated below,we uphold the affirmance of the arbitral award and the denial of fees.
background 
the union submitted a grievance to the hospital in october,pursuant to the grievance procedure contained in the parties collective bargaining agreement cba.the grievance was filed on behalf of employees classified as phlebotomists and was based on the hospital failure to provide differential pay to employees for holidays not worked.the matter was resolved in arbitration in favor of the union.as a result,the hospital paid the appropriate differential payments to the phlebotomists and one other employee.on november,the union filed a second grievance based again on the hospital failure to provide differential pay for holidays not worked because the hospital refused to apply the earlier arbitrator decision to all employees.this second grievance was brought on behalf of all union members.when asked to clarify on what date the grievance occurred,the union responded that it occurred each holiday since november,when employees covered by the union contract who were on the day shift and were scheduled to work beginning before were not paid all differentials with their holiday pay.the hospital denied the grievance as untimely because it contended that the grievance had already been heard at the earlier arbitration and since the union had not raised the issue at that time on behalf of all employees,it was prohibited from doing so at a later point.as a result,the second grievance was also submitted to arbitration.
the cba sets forth a three step procedure for resolving disputes.the relevant provisions read as follows 
an alleged grievance shall be presented in writing with the date the grievance occurred by any individual employee or group of employees together with their steward if desired,to the manager or designee within seven calendar days after the grievant knew or should have known of the event giving rise to the grievance 
any grievance not presented within the specific time frames specified in step one,two,or three,shall be forfeited and waived by the aggrieved party and the union.extensions of the time frames referenced above may be granted upon mutual written agreement between the hospital and the union.
the arbitrator concluded that the second grievance was timely filed and therefore,procedurally arbitrable.he reasoned that 
the dispute in the present case does not have a specific end date it recurs every time there is a holiday and the employees are not paid the relevant differentials.it is analogous to a claim that an employer is paying incorrect wages or benefits.an alleged wrongful denial of the appropriate wage rate recurs every time an employee is paid the incorrect rate of pay.
although the arbitrator found that the alleged breach was continuing and occurring each day the grievants have not been paid the appropriate rate,he also determined that the appropriate remedy would not be applied retroactively to november the cba came into rather from the date of the filing of the second grievance.since the arbitrator found the violation to be continuous,it was irrelevant that the filing of the grievance did not occur within seven days of one of the holidays listed in the cba or within seven days of the employees receiving payment for those holidays.after finding the grievance procedurally arbitrable,the arbitrator upheld the grievance on the merits based upon the earlier arbitrator finding that the hospital had violated the terms of the cba.
the hospital filed a complaint in district court seeking to vacate the arbitrator award.it contended that the arbitrator exceeded his powers and overstepped his jurisdictional authority when he concluded that the grievance was timely filed.it relied on the following provision in the cba 
arbitration 
the jurisdiction and authority of the arbitrator and his opinion and award shall be confined exclusively to the interpretation application of the specific provisions of this agreement.
the arbitrator shall have no authority to add to,detract from,alter,amend,or modify any provision of this agreement 
the thrust of the hospital argument was that the arbitrator procedural holding violated the terms of the cba because it ignored the language in the contract requiring grievances to be filed within seven days after the grievant knew or should have known of the event giving rise to the grievance.relying on language in the arbitrator opinion that stated that each holiday upon which a violation occurs is considered a new event,the hospital argued that the events are episodic in nature,not continuous.consequently,since the grievance was not filed within seven days of a holiday or payment relating to such holiday,it was untimely.the hospital rejected the characterization of the violation as continuous because it argued that this characterization improperly focuses on the effect of the violation instead of on the violation itself.the hospital argued that the arbitrator rationale would construe even the most discrete of violations as continuous because the effect of the violation would continue until resolved by the arbitrator this approach would then arguably nullify the rule.
in response to the hospital complaint,the union filed a counterclaim to enforce the award.the hospital then moved for judgment on the pleadings and the union moved for summary judgment and for attorney fees.
