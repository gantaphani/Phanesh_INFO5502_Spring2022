this appeal challenges a substantial verdict against an abortion clinic for medical malpractice.the defendants ask us to vacate the jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs,claiming that the court made a number of erroneous evidentiary rulings during the trial.after a careful review of the record,we affirm the verdict for the plaintiffs.
olga gaydar and oleksandr stepanov visited sociedad instituto y planificacion familiar clinica the clinic or clinica on april,for the purpose of obtaining an abortion for gaydar.taking into consideration the date of her last menstrual period,gaydar estimated that she was five weeks pregnant.after arriving at the clinic and completing the medical history forms provided to her,gaydar underwent a pelvic examination,followed by a suction procedure intended to terminate her pregnancy.following the procedure,she was given two instruction sheets that contained information outlining what symptoms could be expected after an abortion and what symptoms should be considered abnormal.the instructions also indicated that she should return to the clinic two weeks after the procedure for a appointment.
in the days after the procedure,gaydar continued to experience nausea and breast tenderness as she testified at trial,she felt like she was still pregnant.she purchased and performed a home pregnancy test,which returned a positive result.she also began experiencing pain in the lower area of her abdomen.on may,eleven days after the procedure,gaydar and stepanov returned to the clinic,and explained to a nurse and the receptionist that gaydar was experiencing symptoms of pregnancy,had received a positive result on a home pregnancy test,and was in pain.the clinic employees explained to gaydar and stepanov that such reactions were normal following an abortion.gaydar and stepanov returned home without having seen a doctor that day.
on the morning of may,gaydar began experiencing severe pain in her abdomen.she was unable to get out of bed and was nauseated.stepanov took gaydar to the emergency room at pavia hospital where she was initially diagnosed as suffering from septic shock,which the emergency room doctors attributed to her abortion.natalio bayonet,a gynecologist on staff at the hospital,arrived to treat gaydar.after reviewing a sonogram,he diagnosed her as suffering from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy gaydar was stabilized in the emergency room and given a series of blood transfusions,after which bayonet performed emergency surgery on her,extracting the remains of the ruptured ectopic pregnancy and removing her right fallopian tube.gaydar was hospitalized for seven days following the surgery,five days of which were spent in the intensive care unit.as a result of the rupture and the surgery,gaydar now has only one healthy fallopian tube and also has a scar on her abdomen.
gaydar and brought a diversity action against the clinic,hector the owner of the clinic and the doctor who allegedly performed the attempted abortion,and the clinic insurance carrier,sindicato de aseguradores para la suscripcion conujunta de seguro de responsabilidad simed.gaydar alleged,inter alia,that the clinic and negligently failed to detect her ectopic pregnancy on april and may,thereby leading to the rupture of her fallopian tube and her need for emergency surgery on may.at trial,gaydar called jose rodriguez as an expert witness.he testified that the clinic conduct varied from the applicable standard of care when its employees failed to give gaydar any laboratory tests,including a pregnancy test,prior to the attempted abortion.rodriguez also testified that the clinic employees with whom gaydar spoke on may should have called a doctor to examine her,given her symptoms.as part of her,gaydar also called bayonet,the gynecologist who performed her emergency surgery at pavia hospital.we discuss his testimony more fully in part,infra.in opposition,the defendants called carlos roure,who testified that there was nothing wrong with the care gaydar received on april and may at the clinic because her symptoms did not indicate the presence of an ectopic pregnancy.after the presentation of evidence,the jury returned a verdict finding the defendants jointly and severally liable to gaydar for and to stepanov for.the defendants now appeal from the entry of judgment on that verdict.
the defendants allege a series of trial errors the district court erred in permitting bayonet,listed by the plaintiffs as a witness who would testify about his treatment of gaydar,to also testify as an expert witness the district court should have excluded plaintiffs expert witness,jose rodriguez,because he was not a gynecologist the district court showed bias against the defendants and abortion clinics and rodriguez exceeded the bounds of his expert knowledge when he testified that medical records had been altered.we address these arguments in turn.
inappropriate expert testimony 
bayonet testimony 
the testimony at issue involved colloquies between bayonet and plaintiffs counsel on direct examination,and subsequently between bayonet and defendants counsel on,as well as some questions posed by the court.on direct examination,after bayonet answered a series of questions regarding gaydar condition in the emergency room,her eventual diagnosis,and her emergency surgery,gaydar counsel began the following exchange 
q before she was taken to pavia,what type of exams could have been performed on her to detect the ectopic pregnancy 
diepa defendants counsel objection.way beyond the scope.
the court why do you say it is beyond the scope so what.he a physician.he is a gynecologist.he can answer those questions perfectly.i do see the problem with this.overruled.
miranda defendants and then,your honor,he has been offered to render testimony on his treatment of this lady at the time of the treatment,not before.
the court it does matter.go ahead.
bayonet can you repeat the question,please 
q first of all,was it possible before may when she was taken to the pavia hospital,whether it was possible to detect that gaydar had developed an ectopic pregnancy 
a well,certainly a positive pregnancy test is usually done.you could probably have done an ultrasound examination.and this would probably have detected either a pregnancy in the tube or a dual pregnancy but i was there,so i do know what standard procedures they do in the facility where the abortion was done.
this was the extent of this line of inquiry of bayonet on direct examination by gaydar counsel.at the end of the of bayonet,defendants counsel had this exchange with him 
q and when gaydar went to clinica on april,she was approximately five weeks pregnant 
q is it possible to palpate an ectopic pregnancy five weeks old with no other signs or symptoms 
a well,if you do a real good pelvic exam,perhaps you could,but it could be easily missed.
the defendants argue on appeal that the court erred in overruling their beyond the scope objection during the direct examination of bayonet because this objection advised the court that the questions posed by gaydar counsel required bayonet to provide expert testimony when he was only called as a fact witness.the defendants also contend that the court exacerbated its initial error by asking bayonet a number of questions that also called for the testimony of an expert witness.this questioning came after defendants counsel had completed the of bayonet with the inquiry,quoted above,about the possibility of missing,during a pelvic exam,an ectopic pregnancy at five weeks gestation.the judge then immediately started his own line of questioning,which we set forth fully 
the court let me ask you something,doctor,myself,because i have doubt.if you had been is hypothetical,of course.if you had been called to make this abortion yourself,what would you have considered doing under the circumstances in april what would be the right thing to do 
the witness bayonet well,i speaking from the point of view of a gynecologist.
the court sure.
the witness number one,i would have verified that the pregnancy test was positive.if you suspect an ectopic pregnancy,perhaps you could your pelvic exam demonstrated an adnexal mass,then probably a
