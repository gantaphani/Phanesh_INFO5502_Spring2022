jacklin jones applied for disability benefits,but an administrative law judge denied her claim,reasoning that her testimony about her functional limitations was not credible.the alj supported the credibility determination with references to the medical evidence,the opinions of treating physicians,and jones daily activities.the district judge affirmed the alj decision,and jones appeals.we affirm.
jones claimed to become disabled beginning in november as a result of injuries she sustained in a motor vehicle accident.jones had sought treatment for her injuries from her physician,susan joseph,but when her condition worsened,joseph referred jones to an orthopedic surgeon,richard karr.
in march,jones complained to karr of chronic lower back pain with radiation down her left leg.jones informed karr that she took hydrocodone,prescribed by joseph,to manage her pain.during his examination,karr noted no pain behavior,a straight spine,normal bending,normal ability to straighten her legs,no limping and a normal gait.as a result of the examination,he informed jones that her condition was benign.he advised jones to stop taking hydrocodone and to instead use a combination of and a benign analgesic to manage her pain.karr further advised jones to lose weight.finally,karr ordered an mri to further assess jones condition.
after reviewing the results of the mri a month later,karr noted a mild disk bulge at the disk of the lumbar spine and diagnosed discogenic lower back pain with associated myofascial leg pain.karr again advised jones to desist taking narcotic medication to control her pain and instead use other medication and to begin physical therapy.karr did,however,refer jones to steven donatello for pain management.karr also discussed with jones a surgical option to treat her pain,but advised her that it would be unpredictable and should be used as a last resort.jones agreed not to proceed with surgery at that time.
when jones saw donatello,he reviewed her mri and diagnosed leg weakness,mild edema in her left foot,a disk bulge with lower back pain,and a radiculopathy.donatello gave jones a series of epidural steroid injections,after which jones coworkers noticed that she was able to move around the office better and had decreased outward expressions of pain.donatello also prescribed percocet,a pain relief medication containing oxycodone and acetaminophen.
despite the epidural steroid injections,jones continued to complain of pain,and joseph again referred her to karr.in june,jones informed karr that she was taking percocet and continued to suffer severe pain.karr noted that she was working without restrictions,walking normally,and had normal straight leg raises and muscle strength.karr again advised her to take a more benign pain medication and to pursue exercise or physical therapy.karr also reminded jones of surgical options.
jones visited joseph throughout,who prescribed darvocet and oxycontin to relieve jones pain.in november,jones quit her job as an accounts payable supervisor.at the time,jones worked only part time and believed that other employees might be laid off if she did not quit.
in,joseph continued to refer jones to karr.in march,karr noted that she exhibited no signs of active radiculopathy.he opined that she had a bad back disk but that her presentation was very benign.he noted that she was overweight and deconditioned,but did not exhibit pain behavior.karr again advised her of surgical options to treat her pain,though he advised her against those options.meanwhile,through,joseph prescribed various pain medication,including oxycontin,a lipoderm patch,naprosyn,and vicodin,though jones did not always take the prescribed dosage of some medication because it made her dizzy.in august,joseph diagnosed bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome,and jones began wearing wrist braces to alleviate her pain.
in april,richard almonte,a state agency doctor,completed a physical residual functional capacity assessment.almonte believed that jones could lift or carry pounds occasionally and pounds frequently.he further believed that jones could sit,stand,or walk for six hours in an day.a second state agency doctor affirmed almonte opinion in october.
in january,jones underwent another mri.joseph reviewed the mri and diagnosed a protrusion at the disk with mild bilateral foraminal narrowing and a mild disk bulge at the disk of jones lumbar spine.in february,jones began to see michael belete instead of joseph.like joseph,belete referred jones to a specialist,neurologist max lee.
lee reviewed the mri and found a mild amount of degenerative disease around the disk and to a lesser extent at the disk of the lumbar spine.lee opined that it was difficult to attribute all of jones symptoms to the mri and recommended that she continue conservative pain management and explore surgery if she did not improve.
throughout and,belete continued jones on various pain medications and referred her to a pain management clinic.jones complained to belete that the medication made her both dizzy and drowsy.belete also ordered various medical tests to determine the extent of jones injury.in august,a nerve conduction study produced results consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome.in september,belete noted that jones continued to use wrist splints and referred her to a hand surgeon.in october,belete prescribed another epidural steroid injection.a november bone scan revealed a decrease in bone mineral density loss,consistent with osteopenia.
at a hearing before the alj,jones testified that she had been unable to work due to the back pain associated with her accident that had worsened over time.she testified that,before she quit her job,walking to a coworker office had been painful and often had required her to take pain medication upon return to her office.jones further testified that she would sometimes attempt to control her pain by lying on the floor of her office.
when describing her lower back pain,jones testified that it made it difficult to sit or stand for long periods and also that it was irritated by movement.she stated that she could sit for an hour or stand for a half an hour on a good day and that she could walk for two blocks before needing a rest.she also testified that the pain impairs her concentration and that pain medication makes her dizzy,drowsy,fatigued,and nauseated.jones stated that she opted to forego surgery to treat her lower back pain because her doctors informed her that it would be iffy.
jones also testified that her carpal tunnel syndrome makes her hands go numb and makes it difficult to hold onto things.she testified that she could lift pounds but that it would cause her pain afterwards.she stated that she wears a brace to relieve some symptoms of her carpal tunnel syndrome and that the brace has alleviated some of the symptoms.jones testified that she did not explore other treatment options for her carpal tunnel syndrome because her insurance did not cover either examinations or treatments.
despite her pain,jones was able to complete an associate degree.jones informed the alj that she attended school from,taking classes one or two evenings per week.she completed a associate degree in business management during that period.she testified that she would sit at the back of classrooms and take breaks to control her pain.
jones also testified that she does some household chores.when she folds laundry,a family member carries the basket to her.she occasionally washes dishes or vacuums,but has trouble standing to do so.she uses a computer to monitor her bank account and her children internet activity.she testified that her pain prevents her from doing activities that she used to enjoy,such as fishing,skating,volunteering at her children schools,and directing a church choir.she testified that she does not exercise,despite her doctors recommendations that she do so,because of the pain associated with it.both jones and her husband testified that she spends much of her time lying down in her bedroom.
in addition,a vocational expert testified at jones hearing.the alj posed hypothetical questions to the vocational expert,directing him to assume an individual with jones vocati
