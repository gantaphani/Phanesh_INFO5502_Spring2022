in,george sosebee stopped receiving medical care for hepatitis,among other serious physical ailments,because he lacked insurance and could not afford further treatment.even though he was suffering from severe physical problems,in he returned to work because he desperately needed money for medical care he earned less than.sosebee and his wife are both currently unable to work.they do not own a home instead,they rent an apartment.sosebee performs some household chores out of necessity because his wife can not,but he must use his wife wheelchair to move around.despite this uncontradicted evidence,the district court ruled that sosebee failed to show his net worth did not exceed.it therefore denied his application for attorneys fees under the equal access to justice act eaja.although it did not say so in so many words,the court must have concluded that the circumstantial evidence of net worth that sosebee provided was insufficient to show that his assets were below the statutory limit.this conclusion was problematic to start with,and became entirely untenable when sosebee offered to supplement the record through motions under rules e and b.we therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
sosebee filed his original petition for social security disability benefits in.he was unsuccessful initially,but on appeal in,the district court remanded the case to the social security administration ssa for rehearing.at that time,sosebee submitted an application for attorneys fees pursuant to eaja,which the district court granted.ssa denied sosebee application again in,and sosebee appealed again to the district court.as before,the district court remanded the case to ssa,and sosebee filed another application for attorneys fees.the commissioner of social security opposed the motion.at the time,the commissioner was a woman.she has since been replaced by a man for convenience,we use the gender of the incumbent commissioner in this opinion.the commissioner primary argument was that the amount of sosebee fee request was unreasonable.he added,however,that sosebee had not shown that he was eligible for eaja fees because he had not provided enough evidence to prove that his net worth did not exceed.
in his reply to the commissioner opposition brief,sosebee stated that his net worth did not exceed at the time the civil action was filed,adding sosebee did not specifically plead this in his initial eaja application,it was implied in plaintiff memorandum in support of summary judgment.sosebee also pointed with appropriate citations to evidence in the record that supported his representation,including his inability to afford medical care in,his lack of medical insurance,his lack of income during the relevant time period,and his lack of any significant assets.
the district court denied sosebee application for eaja fees on april.the court explained that sosebee has not provided the court with documentation concerning his net worth and he has not shown why he was unable to do so.sosebee promptly filed a motion to amend the judgment under fed.civ.e and a motion for relief under fed.civ.b,attaching an affidavit with details about his net worth.the rule motion was technically premature in light of the rule motion.see kapco c o enterprises,cir.we disregard the rule motion in the remainder of this opinion.in the rule motion,sosebee argued that governing caselaw indicated that it was enough for him to provide the details about his net worth in his reply brief to the commissioner opposition brief to his application,or at the very least the law was unclear at the time he made his application and thus the evidence he had tendered with the motion should be accepted.sosebee new affidavit left no doubt that he qualified for fees

the district court was unmoved,denying the rule e motion on its merits on june.the court also denied sosebee rule b motion as untimely on that date although it was actually premature,and denied his second rule b motion on september.sosebee filed his notice of appeal on august.
there are two issues in this case that require our attention whether the statements made in sosebee reply brief in support of his eaja fees application satisfied his obligations under the eaja to show his net worth and whether the district court abused its discretion in denying sosebee rule e motion.we take them in turn.
this court reviews a district court decision to award or deny attorneys fees under the eaja for abuse of discretion.united states hallmark constr,cir.if the district court reached its conclusion because of its interpretation of relevant law,however,then we review that question of law de novo because a district court application of an erroneous view of the law is by definition an abuse of discretion.boyd.state police,cir.
first,we must identify the source of sosebee obligation to prove his net worth.the statute with which we are dealing is d b,which reads as follows 
a party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall,within thirty days of final judgment in the action,submit to the court an application for fees and other expenses which shows that the party is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award under this subsection,and the amount sought,including an itemized statement from any attorney or expert witness representing or appearing in behalf of the party stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses were computed.the party shall also allege that the position of the united states was not substantially justified.whether or not the position of the united states was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the record including the record with respect to the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civil action is based which is made in the civil action for which fees and other expenses are sought.
also relevant is b b,which defines the term party itself in relevant part as an individual whose net worth did not exceed at the time the suit was filed.in scarborough principi,d,the supreme court had this to say about the way these provisions should be understood 
relevant here,eaja authorizes the payment of fees to a prevailing party in an action against the united states the government may defeat this entitlement by showing that its position in the underlying litigation was substantially justified.d a.in a further provision,d b,the act prescribes the timing and content of applications seeking fees authorized by d a.section d b specifies as the time for filing the application within thirty days of final judgment in the action.in the same sentence,the provision identifies the application contents,in particular,a showing that the applicant is a prevailing party who meets the financial eligibility condition in this case,a net worth that did not exceed at the time the action was filed,d b and a statement of the amount sought,with an accompanying itemization.
at.although d a does not expressly incorporate the financial eligibility details to which the court referred,which as it noted are found within the definition of the term party found in d b,the court construed the reference to the need to show eligibility in the former statute to incorporate the financial limitations.see also bazalo west,noting that t he additional requirement of net worth is not s
