this case presents a question of first impression in our court does of the rehabilitation act,extend to a claim of discrimination brought by an independent contractor in order to answer that question,we must decide whether d,which refers to the standards applied under title i of the americans with disabilities act as such sections relate to employment,incorporates title i literally or selectively.if title i is incorporated literally,then the rehabilitation act is limited by the ada and only covers relationships in the workplace if selectively,then the rehabilitation act covers all individuals subject to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance,who may bring an employment discrimination claim based on the standards found in the ada.a.the sixth and eighth circuits have concluded that title i is incorporated literally,wojewski rapid city reg l,cir hiler brown,cir,while the tenth circuit has concluded that title i is incorporated selectively.schrader ray,cir.we agree with the tenth circuit,and conclude that incorporates the standards of title i of the ada for proving when discrimination in the workplace is actionable,but not title i in toto,and therefore the rehabilitation act covers discrimination claims by an independent contractor.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court.
for purposes of this appeal,the facts of this case are simple and not contested.lester fleming is an anesthesiologist who suffers from sickle cell anemia.in,fleming applied for a position as an anesthesiologist at the yuma regional medical center yuma.upon learning of fleming sickle cell anemia,yuma told him that it would not be able to accommodate his operating room and call schedules.fleming declined to accept this condition of employment,effectively canceling the contract.
fleming brought suit against yuma for breach of his employment contract and employment discrimination in violation of of the rehabilitation act.the district court granted summary judgment in yuma favor,ruling that fleming was an independent contractor,and that independent contractors are not protected by the rehabilitation act.fleming appeals the ruling that the rehabilitation act does not apply to independent contractors he does not,however,appeal the district court finding that he is an independent contractor 
the rehabilitation act of,et,was the first major federal statute designed to protect the rights of the handicapped people of this country.smith barton,cir see also consol.rail darrone,d describing the act as a comprehensive federal program aimed at improving the lot of the handicapped.section creates a private right of action for individuals subjected to disability discrimination by any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance,kling los angeles county,cir,including employment discrimination in such programs,consol.rail,at.boyd postal,cir.it provides that n o otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.a.the rehabilitation act broadly defines program or activity to include all of the operations of an entire corporation,partnership,or other private organization,or an entire sole proprietorship if the entity as a whole receives federal assistance or if the entity is principally engaged in the business of providing education,health care,housing,social services,or parks and recreation,and various other services.b a.
the rehabilitation act,as amended,incorporates various standards and remedies from other civil rights laws.most important for our case,d provides that t he standards used to determine whether this section has been violated in a complaint alleging employment discrimination under this section shall be the standards applied under title i of the americans with disabilities act as such sections relate to employment.d.see.title i of the ada defines key terms in the act,defines discrimination in the workplace,provides for defenses and limitations for employees using illegal drugs or alcohol,and commits enforcement to the equal opportunity employment commission and the attorney general.although we have not addressed the question,other circuits have held that independent contractors are not covered by title aberman abouchar sons,cir johnson city of saline,cir birchem knights of columbus,cir.
the issue before us is whether fleming,as an independent contractor,may maintain suit against yuma based on of the rehabilitation act.fleming urges us to read d to mean that t he standards of title i of the not title i be used to determine whether this section has been violated in a complaint alleging employment discrimination.d emphasis added.relying on the tenth circuit opinion in schrader,fleming would have us hold that does not literally incorporate title i of the ada and,therefore,d addresses only the substantive standards for determining what conduct violates the rehabilitation act,not the definition of who is covered.schrader,at.
yuma,not surprisingly,offers a different view.it would have us hold that d incorporates title i of the ada in toto,including any limitations found in those provisions.relying on decisions from the sixth and eighth circuits,yuma argues that the focus of the rehabilitation act is upon providing remedies for individuals who are employees and therefore the rehabilitation act,like title i of the ada,requires an relationship.wojewski,at.the district court agreed with yuma and found that fleming was not an employee,but an independent contractor.it then held,citing pga tour,martin,d scalia,dissenting,that e mployment actions under the rehabilitation act may only be brought by employees and can not be brought by independent contractors.thus,yuma and the district court would have us read title i of the ada into d as though title i had been incorporated on a basis.
although the matter is not entirely free from doubt,we agree with fleming that he is covered by the rehabilitation act even though he is an independent contractor.we reach this conclusion for several reasons.
first,the scope of the rehabilitation act is broader than the ada the rehabilitation act covers any otherwise qualified individual who has been excluded from the participation in,or denied the benefits of,or subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.a.the rehabilitation act covers any program receiving federal funds.the act carefully defines program or activity as all of the operations of state instrumentalities,colleges and universities,local education agencies,and an entire corporation,partnership,or other private organization,or an entire sole proprietorship.b emphasis added.this language has led us to interpret program or activity broadly.sharer oregon,cir quoting haybarger lawrence county adult prob.parole,cir internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the rehabilitation act covers all of the operations of covered entities,not only those related to employment.
by contrast,title i of the ada prohibits discriminat ion against a qualified individual because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures,the hiring,advancement,or discharge of employees,employee compensation,job training,and other terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.title i covers all aspects of the relationship,but unlike of the rehabilitation act,it does not cover other relationships,which are addressed elsewhere in the ada.see zimmerman or.dep t of justice,cir.
second,congress did not use language of incorporation when it referred to the ada in.instead,congress referred to the standards used to determine whether has been violated in a complaint alleging employment discrimination.d emphasis added.we think the choice of words is significant.the supreme court decision in consolidated rail darrone is instructive in this regard.section of the rehabilitation act provides that t he remedies,procedures,and rights set forth in title vi of the civil rights act of shall be avail
