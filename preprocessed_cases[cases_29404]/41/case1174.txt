in this appeal,brought by plaintiff timothy brown on behalf of his minor child,melody,we are asked to reinstate the plaintiff medical malpractice complaint against the united states,filed pursuant to the federal tort claims act,b.that complaint was dismissed by the district court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,under feres united states,as applied to prenatal injuries by this court in irvin united states,cir.because the facts in this case are readily distinguishable from those in irvin and do not implicate the rationales underlying the decision in feres,we conclude that the district court does have subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff complaint.we therefore reverse the judgment entered below and remand the case for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
despite the district judge entry of an order of dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b,there can be no doubt that he was fully sympathetic to the brown family,especially to young melody,who was born with spina bifida,allegedly as the result of malpractice on the part of a military doctor who provided prenatal care to melody mother,deborah brown,while deborah was on active duty with the united states navy.in april,in an effort to conceive a child,deborah had sought counseling at her branch medical clinic.danjoyeb mukherjee,a navy lieutenant there,prescribed prenatal vitamins to deborah,and she began taking them in anticipation of achieving a pregnancy.
the vitamins contained folic acid,which the plaintiff alleges is intended solely to prevent neural tube defects in a developing fetus.neural tube defects can cause serious spinal cord and brain injury during the first days of gestation,after which the fetal neural tube closes.deborah husband,plaintiff timothy brown,later alleged in the complaint that prenatal doses of folic acid offer no scientific benefits to an expectant mother but are prescribed to ensure that there is adequate folic acid for the baby from the moment of conception onward.
in june,some two months after she began taking the prenatal vitamins,deborah brown returned to the clinic for a regularly scheduled physical exam.she indicated on a medical history form that she and her husband were trying to conceive and that she was currently taking prenatal vitamins.captain leland mills,then the senior medical officer at the clinic,purportedly recommended that she discontinue taking the prenatal vitamins.in response to this advice,her husband alleged,deborah stopped taking the vitamins that day.
about four weeks later,deborah conceived.after approximately one month of gestation,deborah returned to the clinic,where she received a new prescription for prenatal vitamins containing folic acid.according to the complaint,however,the critical time period for taking folic acid had passed,and the fetus that deborah was carrying had already suffered a neural tube defect from lack of folic acid.melody brown was born on march,and was diagnosed as having spina bifida and its neurological sequelae.deborah brown sustained no physical injury whatever from the effects of the negligent prenatal treatment,from her pregnancy,or from melody birth.
timothy brown brought this action against the united states on behalf of himself and his infant daughter,alleging that mills was negligent in recommending that prenatal vitamins be discontinued and thereby failing to assure that folic acid was available for melody benefit from the time of her conception.in response,the united states filed a motion to dismiss the action for want of subject matter jurisdiction,contending that the feres doctrine had created an applicable exception to the government waiver of sovereign immunity in the federal tort claims act,one that barred timothy brown suit because the injury stemmed from allegedly negligent acts by and against military personnel.the district court granted the government motion to dismiss,and timothy brown now appeals.
discussion 
we emphasize that in resolving the legal question presented by this appeal,we are reviewing only the district court order of dismissal under rule b.we must,therefore,treat the allegations in the complaint as true.see evans pearson,cir.
the legal background of this case is territory.the federal tort claims act permits the government to be sued for injuries caused by the negligence of government employees,acting within the scope of their employment,to the same extent that a private individual would be liable for such negligence.see b.this statutory provision is,nevertheless,subject to a exception carved out in feres united states.in feres,the supreme court held that the broad waiver of sovereign immunity found in the federal tort claims act does not apply to negligence actions brought by military personnel.specifically,the court ruled,the government is not liable under the act for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.id.at.the court has since identified three rationales for the feres exception first,the distinctly federal nature of the relationship between the government and members of its armed forces second,the existence of the veterans benefits act,which provides a form of compensation for injured members of the military and,third,the special relationship of a service member to his or her superiors and the effects of the maintenance of such suits on discipline,and the extreme results that might obtain if suits under the tort claims act were allowed for negligent orders given or negligent acts committed in the course of military duty.united states shearer,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
after feres,the court held that the doctrine also precludes suits by third parties for claims that or injuries to service members incident to military duty.see stencel aero eng g united states,d where the case concerns an injury sustained by a soldier while on duty,the effect of the action upon military discipline is identical whether the suit is brought by the soldier directly or by a third party.see also mondelli united states,cir child suit for genetic injuries caused by her father exposure to radiation during active duty in the military barred because the injury derived from injury to her father lombard united states,same.
despite the plaintiff argument that,in contrast to the situations in stencel,mondelli,and lombard,the feres doctrine is inapplicable in this case because melody injury was not derivative of any injury to her mother but was,rather,the result of negligence affecting melody directly albeit in utero,the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction under our ruling in irvin united states.there we dismissed an action for negligent prenatal care given to a mother enlisted in the army that allegedly resulted in the death of her child four days after birth.relying on the fifth circuit analysis in scales united states,cir,we held in irvin that the treatment accorded to a pregnant member of the military on active duty is inherently inseparable from that accorded to the fetus and that such a claim would therefore force a judge to question the propriety of decisions or conduct of fellow members of the military.see irvin,at.the district court found the browns case factually indistinguishable from irvin and,therefore,dismissed the action.
but the district court did so with great reluctance,engaging in the following,highly persuasive,analysis 
plaintiffs attempt to distinguish irvin and scales in two ways.first,plaintiffs argue that the treatment the failure to provide prenatal vitamins with folic acid injured only melody brown,rather than her mother.therefore,plaintiffs maintain that melody brown injury does not have its genesis in a service member injury.second,plaintiffs argue that prenatal folic acid supplementation should have been provided specifically for the benefit of melody brown,a civilian,rather than her mother,an active duty military servicewoman,for whom the folic acid offered no benefit.therefore,plaintiffs argue that melody brown sustained a direct injury that is independent of the medical treatment her mother received.
in support of their arguments,plaintiffs cite to a number of circuit and district courts permitting civilian dependents of military personnel to proceed with claims under the federal tort claims act ftca for negligent prenatal care.see,romero united states,cir finding that child claim for prenatal injuries was not feres barred del rio united states,cir finding that children claim for prenatal injuries was not barred by feres because their claims did not derive from their mother injury,but were independent lewis united states,d holding that the feres doctrine did not bar claims for negligent prenatal care where medical treatment was allegedly directed at only the child,rather than the service member graham united states.permitting child suit under the ftca for prenatal injuries suffered at the time of her delivery utley united states.allowing child ftca claim for negligent prenatal care.
in each of the cases cited by plaintiffs,the court permitted recovery for the child injuries.admittedly,none of these cases addressed negligence allegedly occurring early in gestation as the fifth circuit did in scales.indeed,most of plaintiffs cases concern negligence at the time of labor and delivery.however,some of the cases are factually similar to the case before this court in that they allege a negligent injury only to the child,rather than an injury to both the child and the service member.romero,at joshua,the civilian child,was injured,not a military patient.admittedly,in satisfying its duty of care to joshua,proper prenatal treatment would have involved his mother body.the sole purpose of the treatment,however,would have been directed at joshua.lewis,d at plaintiffs amended complaint is consistent in its allegations while both regina and clayton received medical care at walter reed,only clayton medical treatment was negligent.graham.at i t is the injury to the child and not one to the serviceperson which is at issue.utley.at the only party injured by the alleged malpractice is a civilian infant who has no federal relationship with the government and no remedy if his suit is barred.therefore,each of these courts concluded that the child ftca claim was not barred by feres because the child had sustained an independent injury at the hands of military personnel.that is precisely the argument plaintiffs assert here.
moreover,as noted in many of the cases cited by plaintiffs,none of the three considerations typically invoked to support application of the feres doctrine seems to apply with particular force in the case of a servicewoman seeking prenatal care in anticipation of or during a pregnancy.in this case,the relationship between the civilian child,melody brown,and the government is not distinctly federal in nature.moreover,the court has no indication that melody brown could recover benefits under the veteran benefits act for her injuries.finally,the question of whether a doctor should recommend that an expectant mother take prenatal vitamins with folic acid seems to have little,if any,bearing upon military discipline and would not require judicial scrutiny of the operations of the armed services.
despite this cogent analysis of relevant case law pointing to a finding of based on the facts before the district court,the court came to the conclusion that it was bound by irvin to hold that no recovery was available to tim brown on behalf of melody.unlike the district court,however,we are not convinced that the end result of this analysis requires slavish adherence to irvin,principally because the facts of the two cases can be distinguished,but also because the irvin opinion analysis rests on shaky ground,as indicated below,and because its reliance on the decision by the fifth circuit in scales has since been undercut by subsequent decisions in the fifth circuit and elsewhere.
the complaint in irvin sought recovery for injury to the plaintiff mother,at that time on active duty with the united states army,that had resulted in the death of her newborn infant,caused by the defendants malpractice in prescribing contraindicated medication and in failing both to aggressively treat,evaluate and properly diagnose the resulting pregnancy condition and to reclassify mildred irvin medical condition as urgent.at.in other words,the death of the irvin infant was caused by and was therefore derivative of an injury suffered by the child mother.by contrast,the facts here indicate that the medical treatment at issue caused no injury to deborah brown,as opposed to her fetus.and,although it is true that the irvin opinion relied on the fifth circuit dictum in scales that the claim of a fetus can not be considered an independent ground of recovery,at,in a subsequent fifth circuit case,dickerson united states,cir,the government conceded liability,and the fifth circuit permitted a claim to proceed for negligent prenatal care when the care was offered solely for the benefit of the active duty mother unborn child.thus,the fifth circuit appears to have joined the other courts that have distinguished claims involving injury to a child that derives from an injury to a parent,such as a birth defect caused by a parent exposure to radiation,see,mondelli,at,from those claims for negligent medical care administered solely to the detriment of a civilian child.see,romero,at mossow united states,cir recovery permitted in legal malpractice action against military lawyer who informed an injured child father that he could not sue for negligent prenatal care provided by the military to his wife,who was on active duty with the air force at the time.
doubtless,we would be obliged by irvin to apply the feres doctrine to bar the plaintiff claim on his daughter behalf had the injury to the child been caused by an injury to her mother,who was on active duty with the military at the time of the alleged negligence.however,the injury to the fetus in this case was direct and not derivative.moreover,as the district court correctly noted,the three rationales underlying the feres doctrine,the distinctly federal relationship between service members and the military,the administrative compensation scheme available to service members,and the need for military discipline,are simply inapplicable to suits for negligent prenatal care affecting only the health of the fetus.
in shearer,the supreme court noted that an action by a member of the armed forces against the government for an injury sustained incident to military service is because it is the type of claim that,if generally permitted,would involve the judiciary in sensitive military affairs at the expense of military discipline and effectiveness.shearer,at.but a negligence action for medical malpractice in the prenatal care or birth of a child is a matter that courts can and do handle on a routine basis,and it is one that clearly can not be said to invite judicial interference in sensitive military affairs.more to the point is the indication in shearer that courts should take a flexible approach to government claims of immunity in actions brought under the federal tort claims act.see id.at.the feres doctrine can not be reduced to a few rules each case must be examined in light of the statute as it has been construed in feres and subsequent cases.we thus conclude that the holding in irvin,eroded by the decisions in subsequent cases,should be confined to its facts and does not foreclose a contrary result in a clearly distinguishable set of facts such as the one now before us.
one of the most persuasive of those subsequent cases is romero,in which the fourth circuit held that feres did not bar recovery for injuries to the child of active members of the united states navy who was born with cerebral palsy,alleged to have been caused by inadequate prenatal care by military doctors.the mother,roxanna romero,was known to have a condition known as incompetent cervix,which,when left untreated,resulted in joshua romero premature birth and resulting cerebral palsy.the government argued that if reasonable medical measures had been undertaken to prevent joshua injuries,the treatment suturing of the cervix until the beginning of labor would have been directed solely to joshua mother and,therefore,that joshua injury was incident to military service.romero,at.the court rejected this the same contention as the government made,after noting that claims brought by civilians and civilian dependents of service members who have directly sustained injuries from military personnel are not,held as follows 
we believe the precedent governing injuries by the military to civilians applies here.joshua,the civilian child,was injured,not a military patient.admittedly,in satisfying its duty of care to joshua,proper prenatal treatment would have involved his mother body.the sole purpose of the treatment,however,would have been directed at joshua.
romero suffered from a congenital cervical weakness.this condition apparently placed joshua at risk of injury.it did not,however,affect romero health.presumably her state of health would have been the same whether the physician placed the sutures or not.if the treatment had been administered,its sole purpose would have been directed at preventing injury to joshua because the purpose of the treatment was to insure the health of a civilian,not a service member,feres does not apply.
we note that the situation in this case directly parallels that in romero,in that the allegedly inadequate treatment produced no injury whatever to deborah brown.indeed,had the proper prenatal care been provided,it would have been solely for the benefit of the fetus and would not have affected the mother health in any way.we conclude that this set of facts should be governed by cases such as romero,rather than by cases like mondelli,involving derivative genetic injuries to children resulting from a parent exposure to radioactivity while on military duty.see mondelli,at.the latter clearly arise s out of or is in the course of activity incident to service.feres,at.the former just as clearly is not.
because the underlying rationales supporting the feres doctrine are not applicable in the situation before us,and because the case is readily distinguishable from prior circuit precedent,we decline to adopt the government contention that we are bound in this matter by our decision in irvin.instead,we elect to join those circuits holding that the federal tort claims act does not preclude recovery for negligent prenatal injuries to the child of a military service person that are independent of any injury to the child parent.
conclusion 
for the reasons set out above,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
the majority has decided that the medical malpractice claims asserted against the united states by plaintiff timothy brown on behalf of himself and his minor child,melody brown,were improperly dismissed by the district court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.because i would conclude that plaintiff action is barred under feres united states.and sixth circuit precedent,i respectfully dissent.
in feres,the supreme court held that the government is not liable under the federal torts claims act for injuries to military personnel for injuries that arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.feres,at.the feres doctrine is not limited to those situations where a service member is injured or killed in the course of military duty or while subject to a direct command relationship.woodside united states,cir.the supreme court in feres disallowed two claims of medical malpractice asserted against military doctors,and courts have consistently applied the feres doctrine in barring suits for the alleged negligent medical treatment of active service members at a military hospital.see skees united states by and through of army,cir sidley united states of navy,cir treatment of service member at naval hospital incident to military service woodside,at injury to active duty service member while receiving treatment at military hospital or medical facility deemed to be incident to military service.
the feres holding has also been extended to bar claims based on injuries sustained by service persons.see stencel aero engineering united states,d claim asserted by third party seeking indemnity for damages paid to injured service member barred.
courts have construed feres as barring the derivative claims of family members of service persons where the claim has its genesis in an injury to an active duty service person incident to military service.under the genesis test,if the suit is based on essentially the same facts as the potential serviceman suit or the suit could not have happened but for the serviceman cause of action,then the feres doctrine precludes suit.minns united states,cir.
cases applying the genesis test include minns,at claims of children of servicemen given investigational and defective drugs,causing children to be born with birth defects,properly dismissed because the exposure of servicemen to chemicals was the genesis of children alleged contact with chemicals skees,at claim of widow of serviceman who committed suicide due to allegedly negligent treatment at military hospital barred west united states,cir vacating opinion reported at which held that there was a cause of action for health problems suffered by children due to parents incompatible blood types where parents allegedly relied on negligent typing of father blood at time of induction hinkie united states,cir barring claims of children born with birth defects caused by father exposure to radiation mondelli united states,cir claim for child cancer caused by father exposure to radiation while on active duty barred lombard united states,damage claim for genetic injuries to children allegedly caused by father exposure to radiation while in the service barred scales united states,cir claim asserted on behalf of child for birth defects allegedly caused by rubella vaccination given to child mother barred laswell brown,cir claims of children for genetic injuries caused by father exposure to radiation barred monaco united states,cir claim of child for injuries caused by father exposure to radiation barred.
in scales,the fifth circuit addressed the viability of claims asserted on behalf of a child allegedly born with birth defects due to a rubella vaccination given to his service member mother during her pregnancy.the court distinguished cases which have permitted the dependents of servicemen to sue the government based on negligent conduct directed to the dependent alone which did not involve any decisions by the military toward enlisted personnel.scales,at.in contrast,the court noted,the allegations of negligence of the child in scales focused entirely on the medical treatment that military physicians gave the mother.id.the court stated 
the treatment accorded his mother is inherently inseparable from the treatment accorded charles as a fetus in his mother body.consequently,the district court analysis is the same whether the suit is brought by charles or scales.in either instance,the judge is placed in the position of questioning the propriety of decisions or conduct of fellow members of the armed forces.this is precisely the type of examination that feres seeks to avoid.
a minority of courts have adopted a position contrary to scales.for example,in del rio united states,cir,the court held that a claim asserted on behalf of twin infants who were allegedly injured due to negligent prenatal care given to their service person mother was not precluded under feres.in romero by romero united states,cir,the court reversed the dismissal of claims brought on behalf of a child born prematurely with cerebral palsy due to the doctors failure to implement a medical treatment plan made necessary by his service person mother incompetent cervix,concluding that the genesis test only applied to civilian injuries derived from an actual injury to the service person.
in irvin united states,cir,the sixth circuit considered the case of a service member who became pregnant while on active duty in the united states army.the complaint alleged that the child died due to negligent prenatal medical care,including prescribing contraindicated medication during pregnancy.the irvin court addressed whether the claim brought on behalf
