opinion of the court 
appellee michael pierce,a inmate incarcerated at the state correctional institution in greene county,pennsylvania,was convicted in following a jury trial of three counts of first degree murder,arson and other charges in connection with setting his parents house on fire.pierce mother and grandmother died in the fire,and his father,who tried to save them,died six months later from complications due to smoke inhalation and bronchopneumonia.the fire was started in the basement by use of an accelerant,gasoline.although an adult,pierce was living with his parents just before the fire because his marriage had failed and he was unemployed.pierce sister,joan,who escaped the fire,testified for the commonwealth that pierce believed that his parents were conspiring against him and trying to poison him.
pierce competence to stand trial and unyielding negative views about a psychiatric approach to his defense were issues from the beginning of the criminal proceedings.our decision that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal requires that we discuss this background in some detail.prior to the appointment of janice smarro,esquire,pierce moved to have two prior lawyers discharged on the ground that each was conspiring with the district attorney of philadelphia.one of these attorneys,michael wallace,esquire,sought a competency evaluation.in november,eric becker did a mental status examination and concluded that pierce was competent to stand trial.apparently,the trial court,the honorable david savitt,found pierce competent to stand trial in december.app.wallace tried to have the trial court order other evaluations in,but pierce refused to cooperate with pietro miazzo,app,and he then sought to have wallace removed from his case.
pierce went to trial with smarro as counsel and was found guilty.at the penalty hearing,the commonwealth argued two aggravating circumstances,murder in the course of committing another felony arson under.ann.d,and creating a grave risk of death to a person other than the murder victims under subparagraph d of the same statute.in her summation,smarro raised four mitigating circumstances that pierce had no significant prior criminal history.ann.e,that he was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the murders,subparagraph e,his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired,subparagraph e,and any other mitigating factors under the catchall,subparagraph e.she implored the jury to consider that pierce was out of touch with reality and mentally ill at the time of the offense,but she did not seek to have pierce evaluated by a mental health professional,nor did she seek a competency evaluation or an inpatient commitment.the jury returned sentences of death for each of the three murder convictions,after finding that the commonwealth had proved both of the aggravating circumstances.pierce was sentenced to death.
during proceedings in,pierce new attorney,earl kauffman,esquire,argued that smarro was ineffective at the penalty phase for failing to present psychiatric testimony,among other things.pierce,however,again refused to speak to a psychiatrist,thus undermining new counsel strategy for appeal.following hearings,the trial court denied motions,holding that smarro was not ineffective.psychiatric investigation would have been a futile gesture because of pierce refusal to present such evidence.judge savitt explained 
with respect to the issue of psychiatric testimony,trial counsel testified at the july,hearing that defendant had told her in no uncertain terms that he would not speak to either a psychologist or a psychiatrist.in light of this,obtaining a psychiatric witness would have been a futile gesture.furthermore,trial counsel did argue that the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional distress at the time he committed the act based on the testimony of joan pierce and timothy and also that the defendant capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired also based on testimony at trial.
the state supreme court affirmed on july,in commw.pierce.in pertinent part,the court held that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to introduce expert testimony on the issue of pierce mental state and the effects of his drug and alcohol abuse,stating that a n accused can not refuse to cooperate with counsel in preparation of a particular trial strategy and then argue counsel ineffectiveness for failing to pursue that course of action.id.at citing commw szuchon.the court explained 
appellant argues that trial counsel should have recognized that there was something critically wrong with his thought process and forced him,against his own wishes,to present psychological evidence of emotional and mental disturbance in mitigation at the penalty phase.trial counsel testified at the hearing on motions that she requested appellant submit to psychological and psychiatric interviews prior to trial and that appellant vehemently refused to cooperate.in fact at one of the hearings on motions hearings were held on four separate dates appellant testified that he had dismissed his first court appointed attorney over the issue of psychiatric evaluations.appellant emphatically stated that there was nothing wrong with him and that he would not cooperate with preparation of psychological or psychiatric testimony.
pierce,at.no petition for certiorari was filed.
pierce filed a state petition for relief pro se in october.counsel was appointed and an amended petition was filed.the trial court permitted counsel,bernard siegel,esquire,to retain a psychologist,and siegel attempted to have pierce evaluated by allan tepper,to explore with him potential death penalty mitigation factors and issues,and the issue of his state of mind at the time of the offense.pierce refused.the trial court convened a hearing on july,and tepper was permitted to attend to speak with pierce about his refusal to be examined.pierce testified that he did not wish to pursue psychiatric defenses.he noted his high intelligence and asserted that he had certain issues he wished to pursue,including some involving jury instructions.he believed that,with the death sentence in place,his eventual federal habeas appeal would receive greater attention.on the other hand,if the death sentence was vacated,he could spend,years trying to get my appeal heard,and,in any event,he was not afraid to die.app.
tepper testified that,although pierce appeared to have underlying psychiatric problems,he understood that he might be giving up a substantial right in not pursuing the mental illness mitigating issues.moreover,he could listen to what others had to say and voice his opinion.app.the state petition was denied.judge savitt concluded that the issues had been previously litigated,and to the extent that new issues had been raised,pierce voluntarily and knowingly did not wish to pursue any psychiatric defenses.app.
pierce filed a notice of appeal to the state supreme court and siegel petitioned to withdraw as counsel.see commw.pierce.the request was granted and the trial court appointed norris gelman,esquire,to handle the appeal.gelman then moved for leave to withdraw as counsel and that request was granted.id.the trial court then appointed jules epstein,esquire,as pierce third counsel,but pierce moved to proceed pro se on his appeal.id.
pursuant to the state supreme court directive,the trial court held a hearing on november,where both pierce and epstein were present.app.at this hearing,the trial court questioned pierce to determine whether he knowingly wished to waive his right to counsel and proceed pro se,and the court concluded that he did.pierce,at.pierce then proceeded pro se on appeal to the state supreme court,with standby counsel to assist him in complying with procedural rules.id.at.
pierce,when left to his own devices,raised no ineffective assistance of counsel issues concerning a failure to introduce psychiatric testimony in mitigation or on the issue of his mental state at the time of the offense.instead,he raised a host of layered ineffective assistance of counsel claims that were not previously litigated,id.at,concerning jury instructions,identification and examination of witnesses,prosecutorial misconduct,pretrial identifications,the medical examiner testimony,selection of jurors,and a trial exhibit,id.at,among others.the state supreme court heard these claims on the merits,and affirmed on december,id.at.
on january,pierce filed a pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus under and a request for counsel.the district court appointed the defender association of philadelphia to represent him.about a month later,pierce filed a motion for removal of counsel,and a request either for new counsel or standby counsel,which the district court denied.within a week,pierce again moved to have counsel removed,and again the district court denied the motion.
on august,at the request of appointed counsel,robert fox,a psychiatrist,met with pierce at for hours.fox introduced himself as a medical doctor who had come to discuss pierce physical complaints and conduct a physical examination.app.pierce was satisfied with the introduction and agreed to cooperate.fox began by asking pierce to explain the nature of his physical ailments and concerns,and,without further prompting,pierce described in detail bizarre scenarios concerning how correctional officers,by secretly drugging him,had damaged his body and changed his physical appearance 
in addition to this lengthy interview and opportunity to personally observe pierce,fox also reviewed extensive background materials.despite not performing a mental status examination,fox was able to form an opinion.to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,he concluded that pierce suffers from chronic paranoid schizophrenia,that his paranoid psychosis has existed since at least or,and that he also has suffered from polysubstance dependence.medical records from the pennsylvania department of corrections,see appellee brief,at,confirmed pierce paranoid psychosis and auditory hallucinations,he concluded.app.moreover,pierce was suffering from the impact of these illnesses in at the time of his crime and was unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct,fox concluded.app.finally,fox expressed opinions that pierce was not competent to stand trial,and,importantly for our purposes here,that he currently is unable to assist habeas counsel.he added that,if he had seen pierce in a civil context,he would have opined that pierce required a conservator or guardian to prosecute,protect or handle his affairs.id.
counsel filed an amended habeas petition in december,and contended,among other claims,that pierce was incompetent at the time of trial,trial counsel failed to investigate and litigate the issue of his incompetence,and he is currently incompetent.the petition contained only mental health claims that could be raised without pierce input,according to counsel,and not other potential claims that pierce might want to raise,because counsel was unable to have a rational communication with him.see appellee jurisdictional response,at 
in february,habeas counsel filed a petition for involuntary commitment to a forensic facility for an evaluation.relying on fox examination,recent records reviews conducted by robert sadoff,larry rottenberg,and tepper,and their own experiences in the preceding months trying,but failing,to circumvent pierce delusional thinking,counsel asserted that pierce is not rationally able to assist in the habeas proceedings.counsel argued that commitment of a capital defendant in a habeas proceeding was permissible under the supreme court decision in rees peyton,d per curiam.
as we have explained,the petition for involuntary commitment made a reasonably strong showing that pierce was acutely mentally ill in when fox evaluated him.the district court thus held a conference and invited the commonwealth to identify a forensic psychiatrist to participate in an evaluation of pierce current competence to participate in his capital habeas litigation.instead of identifying an expert to address pierce current mental state,the commonwealth filed written opposition to the motion,contending that the state courts,and findings of competency were not stale,and that,even if pierce is not currently competent to conduct this litigation,the district court should explore the possibility of appointing a next friend,whitmore arkansas,d,to assess what pierce wants to do.
in october,the district court granted the motion for a commitment to a secure psychiatric facility for a evaluation to determine pierce current competence to rationally assist habeas counsel and to determine whether he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia or any other mental illness.the order did not identify a particular facility nor did it determine the length of the commitment.the court expressed the belief that appointment of a next friend would not be helpful because the question was whether pierce incompetence rendered him unable to assist counsel,and he did not want to be evaluated voluntarily to answer that question.
the commonwealth moved for reconsideration,or,in the alternative,for permission to appeal under b,arguing that transfer to a psychiatric facility for a forced evaluation triggers certain due process rights which have not been afforded to pierce,and that habeas counsel is forcing a litigation strategy on him that he does not want.the commonwealth further suggested that conflict counsel be appointed.
the district court denied the motion for reconsideration in december and would not certify the issue for appeal under section b.the court stated that it seems to me that reasonable people would agree that based upon the record in this case,the petitioner needs the evaluation ordered by this court the district court indicated the need for a status conference before execution of the commitment order,but the commonwealth filed a notice of appeal.following the appeal,the district court stayed implementation of its commitment order.
our clerk sent a letter to counsel noting the apparent absence of jurisdiction over what appeared to be an interlocutory order and invited responses.both parties filed a response.we then deferred decision on the jurisdictional question and ordered briefing on the merits.the parties have filed briefs,which incorporate their previous jurisdictional responses,all of which we have carefully reviewed.the commonwealth has asked us to find jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine,cohen beneficial indus.loan.coopers lybrand livesay,d,a request we decline.
we will dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.only final decisions of a district court are appealable.an order committing a state capital habeas petitioner for psychiatric evaluation is not a final order on the merits of his habeas petition.section provides a basis for jurisdiction here only if the commitment order falls within a narrow class of collateral orders that may be reviewed.under the collateral order doctrine,we may review an order if it finally resolves a disputed question resolves an important question completely separate from the merits of the case and is effectively unreviewable or inadequately vindicable on appeal from a final judgment.coopers lybrand,at.see also in re ford motor,cir.
the cohen requirements are a matter of an appellate court subject matter jurisdiction,and thus we must assess the question without regard to whether the parties believe that jurisdiction exists.digital equipment desktop direct,d.historically,the supreme court has applied the collateral order doctrine in criminal cases only in narrow circumstances.see flanagan united states,d.see also united states williams,cir rule of finality has special force in criminal prosecutions.strictly speaking,habeas is a civil,not criminal,proceeding,but the supreme court decisions in digital equipment,at,and will hallock,d,make it clear that the collateral order doctrine is a narrow exception that should stay that way,even in civil cases.id.at.importantly,the final judgment rule promotes efficient judicial administration by emphasizing the deference an appellate court owes to the district court decisions on the many questions of law and fact that arise before judgment,koller,d.
we conclude that the balance in this case tips in favor of rigorous application of the final judgment rule.our decision that the collateral order doctrine does not apply here rests on the second cohen prong,concerning whether the order a resolves an important question b completely separate from the merits,and to some extent on the third prong.if any one prong is not satisfied,jurisdiction is defeated.gulfstream aerospace mayacamas,d.we will assume for the sake of argument that the first cohen prong is satisfied,that is,that the commitment for evaluation order finally resolves a disputed question.
the commonwealth contends that a line of cases finding pretrial involuntary commitment orders appealable under the collateral order doctrine,united states deters,cir united states rinaldi,cir united states davis,cir and united states weissberger,apply here,because the commitment is involuntary and the question of involuntary commitment satisfies the cohen importance prong under sell united states,d.moreover,there is no effective relief for involuntary confinement once it has taken place.see appellant jurisdictional response,at.
the commonwealth further asserts that pierce habeas attorneys are trying to commit him against his will,that he does not want to be moved to a psychiatric facility,and there may be stigma attached with such a transfer or,a person who believes himself sane may feel dehumanized and demeaned by commitment.id.at.it asserts that someone who does not want to pursue mental health issues in his habeas litigation which is clearly the position pierce took in state court may feel that commitment is the first step toward forcing him to accept a legal strategy that he does not want.id.the commonwealth goes on to say that it takes little imagination to grasp that pierce habeas counsel hope to create a basis for arguing that he was incompetent to stand trial,or that more mental health evidence should have been presented to the trial court,or during the sentencing hearing.id.at.furthermore,it has a strong interest in defending the conviction and the court order requires release from state custody.
in its merits brief,the commonwealth has complained that habeas counsel obtained an ex parte order from the district court,prior to filing the involuntary commitment petition,which authorized an mri and pet scan of pierce at the university of pittsburgh medical center that was only vacated when the commonwealth discovered the order and protested.see appellant brief,at.
we are not persuaded by these arguments to extend the collateral order doctrine here.first,we do not agree that the issue is completely separate from the merits of the case.coopers lybrand,at.as pierce merits brief plainly evidences,his competence will be a primary basis for his habeas petition.see,appellee brief at the state court record both trial and reveals significant indicia of pierce mental illness,pierce paranoia and impaired mental health dominated his relationships with the attorneys who tried to represent him in state court.thus,we can not address the issues raised in this appeal without touching on an issue central to the merits of the habeas petition.see cipollone liggett group,cir new york metals refining,cir.
second,the commonwealth cases do not support application of the collateral order doctrine.in deters,the defendant lawyer asked for a pretrial competency evaluation under and,and the defendant asked to be examined on an outpatient basis.the court ordered an inpatient commitment,and the defendant appealed on the ground that the commitment order deprived her of liberty without due process.the tenth circuit held that the order was appealable under the collateral order doctrine,reasoning that a deprivation of liberty for days was important.deters,at.
in weissberger,the district of columbia circuit held that an appeal from a competency evaluation order was akin to an appeal from the denial of bail,and,as is the case with denial of bail,review provides no relief for the loss of liberty associated with the competency evaluation.id.at citing stack boyle.the court explained as in the case of pretrial detention,an appellant can not be left without recourse to appellate review in a situation where he faces an immediate and significant loss of personal liberty.weissberger,at footnote omitted.
in rinaldi,the district court ordered the defendant to be committed for days.the defendant,who was not in custody at the time,appealed,and the seventh circuit assumed jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine.applying stack,the court reasoned that,when an order calls for a defendant incarceration,appellate review is proper.id.at.the sixth circuit decision in davis,which involved similar facts,is in accord,id.at.see also united states friedman,cir accord.
thus,deters,weissberger,rinaldi,and davis all involved individuals who were not in custody at the time of the commitment orders.the courts analysis of the issue whether the commitment order was important and effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment turned on a loss of liberty.there is nothing important,as that term is understood under cohen,about the issue raised by this appeal as pierce is in custody as a death row inmate.the cases cited by the commonwealth are not persuasive in the context of this case,because pierce will be in custody in one place or another.importance has a particular meaning under cohen.see ford motor,at.it does not only refer to general jurisprudential importance.rather,an issue is important if the interests that would potentially go unprotected without immediate appellate review are significant relative to efficiency interests sought to be advanced by adherence to the final judgment rule.id.
similarly,whether a right is adequately vindicable or effectively unreviewable under the third cohen prong is answered by a judgment about the value of the interests that would be lost through rigorous application of the final judgment requirement.digital equipment,at.in vitek jones,d,the supreme court held that transfer of a prisoner to a mental hospital triggers certain due process protections that perhaps were not afforded here,but vitek is not particularly instructive because it is not a collateral order doctrine case it does not address the question of importance relative to the interests sought to be advanced by adherence to the final judgment rule.in any event,vitek involved an civil commitment and involuntary treatment unrelated to any ongoing court proceedings rather than an inpatient evaluation for the limited purpose of determining competence to assist counsel.
as noted by the commonwealth,the supreme court recently approved application of the collateral order doctrine to an order forcing medication on a defendant in sell,d.the court reasoned that the legal right to avoid forced medication raises questions of clear constitutional importance and is completely separate from the merits of the action,whether sell is guilty or innocent of the crimes charged and wholly separate as well from questions concerning trial procedures.id.at.with respect to the third cohen prong,the court reasoned that an acquittal would not undo the harm of forced medication.id.at.
the cases relied on by the court,to establish importance under cohen were winston lee,d,involving a serious surgical intrusion into an individual body to obtain evidence that the state had failed to demonstrate a compelling need for,riggins nevada,d,involving forcing a heavy dose of antipsychotic medication on a defendant during trial,cruzan director.of health,d,involving the artificial feeding and hydration of an individual in a persistent vegetative state,and washington harper,d,involving,in a civil rights action,whether due process requires a judicial hearing before a state may treat a convicted prisoner with antipsychotic medication.
we do not interpret sell to require application of the collateral order doctrine here,because we are not faced with the more severe intrusion of forcing antipsychotic medication on an unwilling defendant who is not a danger to himself or ot
