caplinger was indicted and tried on six counts of wire fraud,see,and two counts of international money laundering,see a a.the essence of the government case was that caplinger engaged in a scheme to defraud investors who put money into caplinger purported effort to market immustim,a medicine he represented to be effective in treating and cancer.at a trial held in july,the government relied heavily on the testimony of david weekly and harry kampetis,both of whom had pled guilty to fraud charges stemming from the same scheme.
in before caplinger came onto the scene,weekly,a stock broker,and kampetis,a retired banker,formed the diamond group,an investment partnership based in north carolina.the partnership promised investors that it would invest in prime bank notes and provide a guaranteed return of percent.the scheme was crooked,and the diamond group weekly and kampetis soon experienced difficulty in paying the returns promised to investors.in,at a time when the diamond group partnership was desperate to find ways to avoid a collapse,kampetis was introduced to caplinger,who kampetis believed was a physician operating a clinic in santo domingo,dominican republic.caplinger claimed that he had access to,a drug produced by in havana,and that he had successfully tested the drug on patients with and cancer.caplinger said he had plans to license and market worldwide,and he invited kampetis to join in the venture.caplinger told kampetis that worldwide sales of immustim would generate a significant amount of revenue because of how effective the drug was.caplinger represented that work was under way to obtain a patent on immustim,which would be worth about million.kampetis suggested to weekly that their diamond group invest in a effort to market immustim.
caplinger held himself out to weekly and kampetis as a physician who had received medical degrees from schools in great britain and the dominican republic.in addition,caplinger claimed to have received a number of academic and professional honors,including a nomination for the nobel prize in medicine.at trial the government offered evidence that caplinger had presented false credentials to weekly and kampetis.almost all of caplinger medical degrees were mail order ones bought with no study required.for instance,caplinger claimed to have received a medical degree from the metropolitan collegiate institute mci in great britain and a doctor of science degree from sussex college of technology,also in great britain.an expert witness for the government testified that a medical degree from mci could be bought for with no study required.sussex college of technology was a operation run out of a private home where mail order degrees could be obtained at all levels in all fields,with no study required.the nomination for the nobel prize came from sussex general hospital,whose address was a maildrop there was no hospital facility.caplinger presented evidence that he held a valid medical degree from autonomous university of santo domingo.his witnesses testified that a medical degree could be obtained from this institution by presenting medical degrees earned outside the dominican republic,completing several medical courses,and passing a competency exam.the registrar of autonomous university testified that caplinger had met these requirements.
as part of his effort to persuade weekly and kampetis to invest with him,caplinger presented them with what were purportedly accurate financial statements and records for his corporation,world medical services.the documents showed that the corporation had a net worth of.according to the records,world medical services had purchased a large supply of immustim,and caplinger had already solicited and received orders for its resale.the corporate records did reflect,however,that caplinger operations had earned profits of only in ten years.according to the government evidence at trial,caplinger had provided weekly and kampetis with statements about the value of his corporation that were materially false.
after reviewing caplinger credentials,assessing the financial data that caplinger provided about world medical services,and considering caplinger plan to market immustim,weekly and kampetis decided that the investors they represented and their funds would have a chance to really profit substantially by putting money into caplinger venture.weekly and kampetis began sending money to caplinger in the spring of and continued to do so for the next two years.weekly and caplinger did not inform investors in their diamond group partnership that substantial sums of partnership money about million in all were being invested in caplinger venture.as weekly and kampetis continued to send more and more money to caplinger,they decided that they needed to protect the position of the investors in the united states.in the fall of weekly and kampetis incorporated immuno pharmaceuticals,ipi in the united states and persuaded caplinger to transfer all assets of world medical services to ipi.weekly,kampetis,and caplinger were the primary shareholders in ipi,but they sought additional investors.weekly and kampetis attempted to sell shares of ipi to large institutional investors,such as shearson lehman,but none were interested.they were,however,able to sell shares to individual investors.weekly and kampetis provided potential investors with solicitation materials,including brochures and a video,describing caplinger clinic,the immustim marketing project,and immustim success rates on patients at caplinger clinic.the government did not attempt to prove at trial that immustim is ineffective.weekly told potential investors that investment in caplinger immustim marketing venture would produce lucrative returns.approximately fifteen investors paid a total of to buy shares of ipi stock.these monies were wired to caplinger.
several ipi investors and potential investors,including the following four,testified for the government at trial.jane henderson testified that weekly contacted her about investing in ipi.weekly sent her and her husband a brochure about ipi and an article written by caplinger in spanish.the hendersons were told that with a little more investment immustim could be marketed worldwide.they invested in ipi.henderson testified that she spoke with caplinger on one occasion to seek advice about potential cancer treatment for her grandmother.lagena green,a north carolina actress who is hiv positive,testified that she was approached by weekly and asked whether she would be willing to be a spokesperson for immustim in exchange for free treatment.green was flown on two occasions to the dominican republic where she was treated at caplinger clinic.despite intense pressure from weekly and kampetis to serve as immustim spokesperson,green declined.she did not invest in immustim and did not pay for the treatment she received at caplinger clinic.barry burke,a childhood friend of weekly,invested in ipi after weekly talked up caplinger project and gave burke brochures about ipi that touted the successes of immustim.vincent khau,a potential investor,testified that weekly and kampetis flew him to the dominican republic to meet with caplinger.while there,khau was taken to caplinger resort condominium and shown around caplinger offices.he was given a sample vial of immustim to take home and show to his investment partner.khau backed out of investing over million in ipi after discovering that caplinger had been convicted several years earlier for practicing medicine without a license in north carolina.
weekly and kampetis sent to caplinger,either from diamond group funds or the sale of ipi shares.all of the funds were wired from the united states to the dominican republic.six specific transfers to caplinger were the basis for the wire fraud counts against him on may,on october,on november,on december,on april,and on september.the november transfer of and the december transfer of also formed the basis for the two money laundering counts.caplinger told weekly and kampetis that the was required to keep caplinger clinic operation going.caplinger said that the was needed to pay for a substantial order of immustim.he made constant requests to weekly and kampetis for money during the two years they were involved with him.caplinger represented that funds were needed to pay staff,to pay expenses for the clinic,to buy medical supplies,and to maintain a corporate airplane.caplinger told fbi agent julia mueller that he received almost million from weekly and kampetis,which he used to make payments for immustim supplies,to pay legal bills,to maintain the airplane,and to keep the clinic running.according to caplinger,he did not know the individual sources of the money sent by weekly and kampetis,but he knew that it came from investors solicited by them.
weekly and kampetis learned about caplinger conviction for the illegal practice of medicine in the fall of.the two men nevertheless continued their relationship with caplinger.by january,however,weekly and kampetis could no longer raise funds for caplinger speculative venture.by the spring of that year they were fending off calls from concerned investors demanding interest payments and information about their investments.weekly and kampetis became skeptical about caplinger and his immustim project because the clinic was not generating revenues,and they appeared to be funding the entire operation.by the spring of two years had passed,and weekly and kampetis had not received any return on their investment with caplinger.at that point,they ended their relationship with caplinger and sought legal counsel.in may weekly began cooperating with the fbi.both weekly and kampetis were charged with fraud and entered plea agreements.the government promised to recommend reduced sentences in exchange for their cooperation and testimony against caplinger.
at trial,following the denial of his motion for acquittal,caplinger was convicted by the jury on all eight counts.the presentence report psr,adopted by the district court,used the money laundering guidelines,and not the ones on fraud,to calculate caplinger offense level.the entire received by caplinger by wire was treated as a loss under the money laundering guidelines in calculating the offense level.caplinger objected both to the use of the money laundering guidelines and the treatment of the entire as the loss under those guidelines.fbi agent mueller testified at sentencing that all of the funds wired to caplinger were used to promote his fraudulent scheme.the district court concluded that caplinger continuing enterprise was supported by all of the funds sent to him by weekly and kampetis and that thus represented the appropriate loss under the money laundering guidelines.the district court also adopted,over caplinger objection,the psr recommendation for a enhancement for abuse of trust under.the enhancement was based on caplinger representation,which was passed on to potential investors,that he was a physician.on october,the district court sentenced caplinger to months imprisonment and three years supervised release caplinger was also ordered to pay monetary penalties of in restitution and in special assessments.caplinger appeals his international money laundering convictions and his sentence.he does not appeal his wire fraud convictions.
caplinger first argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove the intent element of the two international money laundering charges.in reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence challenge to a jury verdict,we decide whether there is substantial evidence,taking the view most favorable to the government,to support the verdict.glasser united states.the international money laundering counts were based on two wire transfers from weekly and kampetis to caplinger,the first in november for and the second in december for.to prove that caplinger engaged in international money laundering,the government had to show that he caused funds to be transferred from a place in the united states to or through a place outside with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity.a a.see also id.c a defining specified unlawful activity to include wire fraud.caplinger contends that the government failed to prove that he arranged to have the funds transferred with the intent to promote his unlawful activity,namely,his bogus immustim marketing scheme that was funded by wire fraud.as caplinger recognizes in his brief,we have held under the domestic money laundering statute,a a i a statute containing the same intent to promote intent topromote is proven with evidence that the defendant used proceeds from an unlawful scheme to keep the scheme going.see united states stewart,cir united states wilkinson,cir.caplinger specific argument is that the government failed to prove use because it did not introduce any bank records or other documents to show what was actually done with the money once it was transferred.appellant br.at.in construing the companion domestic money laundering statute,however,we have held that the use of unlawful proceeds to further an unlawful scheme can be proved without records documenting specific expenditures.stewart,at.rather,use can be proved by other competent evidence,including circumstantial evidence,that the defendant applied unlawful proceeds to promote and perpetuate his scheme.id.
the government contends there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to find that caplinger used the and the transfers to keep his illegal scheme going.we agree.the government evidence established that caplinger told weekly and kampetis that he needed the to keep the clinic in operation.caplinger told weekly that he needed the to purchase a large quantity of immustim.caplinger made constant pleas to weekly and kampetis for money to cover clinic expenses,including rent and salaries,medical supplies,and the maintenance of a corporate plane.caplinger was in obvious need of funds in the ten years before weekly and kampetis arrived on the scene,caplinger operation produced total profits of only and caplinger needed the clinic and all of its trappings to attract investors and to assure them that the immustim marketing project was a sound investment.following the transfers from weekly and kampetis,caplinger was able to keep the clinic in operation and maintain the corporate airplane,two indications that the money went exactly where caplinger said it would go.moreover,caplinger himself told the fbi that he used the wired funds to buy immustim,to make repairs on the airplane,and to keep the clinic going.in sum,there was substantial evidence to support the jury finding that caplinger intended to promote his fraudulent immustim marketing scheme through use of the transferred funds.see stewart,at.caplinger convictions on the two counts of international money laundering are therefore affirmed.
we turn next to caplinger challenges to his sentence.we review the district court factual findings at sentencing for clear error,and we review its legal interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo.united states dawkins,cir.
we start with caplinger argument that because this is essentially a fraud case,the district court erred in referring to the money laundering guidelines instead of just the fraud guidelines.guidelines a,however,instructed the district court to refer to the sta
