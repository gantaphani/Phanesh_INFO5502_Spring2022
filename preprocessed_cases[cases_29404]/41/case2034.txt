defendant charles lee gillenwater,ii,was charged with two counts of transmitting threatening interstate communications and one count of transmitting threatening communications by united states mail.after determining that gillenwater was not competent to stand trial,the district court authorized the government to medicate gillenwater involuntarily to render him competent to face the charges against him.while recognizing the important interests at stake for both the government and gillenwater,we conclude that the district court did not err in authorizing gillenwater involuntary medication.
gillenwater once worked on the renovation of the flamingo hotel in las vegas,nevada.gillenwater believes that he and thousands of others were exposed to asbestos during that renovation.he also believes that the government allowed the exposure to occur and helped the hotel cover it up.and gillenwater believes that government and hotel officials came after him when he tried to reveal the exposure and cover up.
in november,gillenwater was charged with two counts of transmitting threatening interstate communications,in violation of c,and one count of transmitting threatening communications by united states mail,in violation of c.
in the proceedings that followed,the government claimed that gillenwater made graphic and disturbing threats against a number of government officials and employees and showed a possible intent and ability to carry them out.according to the government,gillenwater came to the attention of federal authorities in july,when an occupational safety and health administration osha employee reported receiving a threatening email from gillenwater.among other things,the email stated violence is my primary means of communication and it usually takes the form of me choking somebody while screaming can you hear me now er.
federal agents went to gillenwater house to speak with him about the email.he met them with a gun in hand.but gillenwater ultimately put the gun away and spoke with the agents.the agents warned him to refrain from sending threatening emails as it was illegal and could result in his arrest and prosecution.according to the government,gillenwater acknowledged his understanding.
the government claimed that gillenwater was back at it two days later.he allegedly sent an email to department of labor dol employees,which,among other things,advised them to l ive in fear and asked them d o you really want to be between me and my enemy id.at.from there,the situation continued to escalate.according to the government,the volume and content of gillenwater emails eventually prompted dol to block his email address.and gillenwater allegedly did not limit himself to sending threatening emails to osha and dol employees.the government claimed that he also sent threatening emails to senators and federal agents.the emails said things like 
what is justice here should i slice his wife and children open what are your thoughts on this matter id.at.
you and all your little friends,i pick you off one at a time.id.at.
they may think they free,but their heads are in a noose and the trap is about to be tripped.my friends are more powerful than yours.id.
i made the decision to kill.i be starting at the top.have a nice day.id.
i plan to kill her.id.at.
gillenwater admitted to sending at least some of the threatening emails,including one that threatened the life of an osha employee.but gillenwater explained that he sent the emails to bring attention to the government misconduct in the flamingo hotel asbestos exposure and cover up.
federal authorities arrested gillenwater.they found him with a gun and spare ammunition.according to the government,the subsequent federal investigation revealed that gillenwater had military training in the use of guns and that not all of his guns were accounted for at the time of his arrest.while in custody,gillenwater allegedly sent a threatening postcard to an osha employee.
the district court ultimately ordered a competency evaluation.cynthia low performed the evaluation and diagnosed gillenwater with delusional disorder,persecutory type.as described by low,delusional disorder is characterized by the presence of one or more nonbizzare delusions that persist for at least a month.id.at.and patients that suffer from the persecutory type believe that they are being conspired against,cheated,spied on,followed,harassed,or obstructed in the pursuit of goals.id.at.low concluded that the disorder could substantially impair gillenwater ability to assist his attorney with his defense.
the district court found that gillenwater was not competent to stand trial and remanded him to federal custody to determine whether he could attain competency.robert lucking and angela walden weaver performed a second competency evaluation of gillenwater.they reached the same delusional disorder diagnosis as low and concluded that gillenwater was not competent to stand trial.lucking and weaver also concluded that gillenwater could attain competency with medication,namely the antipsychotic drug haloperidol decanoate.gillenwater refused medication.
the government moved to order involuntary medication pursuant to sell united states.the district court held three evidentiary hearings on the government motion.consistent with his competency evaluation,lucking testified that involuntary medication with haloperidol decanoate was substantially likely to render gillenwater competent to stand trial.he also testified that involuntary medication with haloperidol decanoate was medically appropriate and unlikely to produce severe side effects.he rejected other treatment options,including voluntary psychotherapy.
gillenwater then called robert cloninger to testify.cloninger had not met with or examined gillenwater.but he had reviewed the competency evaluations performed by low,lucking,and weaver and related court filings.based on those materials,cloninger concluded that gillenwater did in fact suffer from delusional disorder,as well as from a personality disorder with depressive and narcissistic features.but cloninger disagreed with lucking involuntary medication recommendation.he testified that,in his view,involuntary medication is not effective in treating delusional disorder and may even worsen the condition.cloninger also testified that the use of haloperidol decanoate is inappropriate if the medication is administered involuntarily and that haloperidol decanoate may produce severe side effects.he instead recommended treating gillenwater with voluntary psychotherapy.
on november,chief judge peterson issued a lengthy order authorizing involuntary medication with haloperidol decanoate.
gillenwater appealed both the november,involuntary medication order and the underlying competency determination.while his appeal of the november,involuntary medication order was pending,this court vacated the underlying competency determination,holding that gillenwater was denied a sufficient opportunity to testify at his competency hearing.united states gillenwater,cir.we remanded to the district court for a new competency hearing.
on remand,the case was reassigned to judge suko.the parties agreed that a new competency evaluation was not necessary and that the district court could consider the evidence offered in the initial competency proceedings.the district court held an additional evidentiary hearing at which gillenwater testified at length.on september,the district court issued an order determining that gillenwater was not competent to stand trial and authorizing involuntary medication with haloperidol decanoate.in doing so,the district court incorporated the november,involuntary medication order.
gillenwater appealed the september,involuntary medication order.we consolidated that appeal with his already pending appeal of the november,involuntary medication order.we have jurisdiction under the collateral order exception to.sell,at.
a defendant has a significant constitutionally protected liberty interest in avoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs.id.at quoting washington harper.for as the supreme court has explained,t he forcible injection of medication into a nonconsenting person body represents a substantial interference with that person liberty.harper,at.accordingly,the government may medicate a defendant involuntarily for the purpose of rendering him competent to stand trial only in rare circumstances.united states ruiz gaxiola,cir.
when the government seeks to medicate a defendant involuntarily for competency purposes,it must establish by clear and convincing evidence the four sell factors.see id.at those factors are that important governmental interests are at stake that involuntary medication will significantly further those interests that involuntary medication is necessary to further those interests and that administration of the drugs is medically appropriate.sell,at.
gillenwater contends that the government did not meet its burden on all four sell factors and that the district court order authorizing his involuntary medication must therefore be reversed we review a district court determinations with respect to the first sell factor de novo.see united states hernandez vasquez,cir.and we review a district court determinations with respect to the remaining three sell factors for clear error.see id.
we start with the first sell factor the important governmental interests factor.needless to say,the government has an important interest in bringing to trial an individual accused of a serious crime.sell,at.to determine whether a crime is serious enough to satisfy the first sell factor,we first consider the likely sentencing guidelines range applicable to the defendant and then consider other relevant factors.hernandez vasquez,at.
the government calculates gillenwater likely guidelines range as to months.that is lower than in,for example,hernandez vasquez,where we noted that the government interest in prosecuting a defendant charged with illegally reentering the united states after removal could satisfy the first sell factor.see id.at,identifying likely guidelines range of to months.but the offense conduct alleged in this case is nonetheless serious enough to establish an important governmental interest in gillenwater prosecution.gillenwater is accused of making lurid and distressing threats against a bevy of government officials and employees.he allegedly threatened to,among other things,choke,rape,and kill people who serve our country.the threats allegedly continued for over a year,escalating in volume and violence.and the district court found that gillenwater evidenced a possible intent and ability to carry out th e threats.er.in prosecuting him,the government is seeking to protect through application of the criminal law the basic human need for security.sell,at.indeed,the government is seeking to protect the very integrity of our system of government.
even when a defendant is charged with a serious crime,s pecial circumstances may lessen the importance of the government interest in prosecuting him.id.gillenwater contends that three such special circumstances are at play here.first,gillenwater contends that the government has a lessened interest in prosecuting him because his illness and resulting proclivities towards making threats might make him subject to civil commitment.appellant br.eligibility for civil commitment may diminish the risks that ordinarily attach to freeing without punishment one who has committed a serious crime,sell,at,thereby lessening the government interest in prosecuting him,ruiz gaxiola,at.but there is nothing in the record to suggest that gillenwater is eligible for civil commitment.the district court did not determine whether gillenwater would meet the civil commitment criteria,and none of the experts who evaluated him took a position on that issue.
second,gillenwater contends that the government has a lessened interest in prosecuting him because he has been in custody for about months.t he possibility that the defendant has already been confined for a significant amount of time,as sell explained,affects,but does not totally undermine,the strength of the need for prosecution.at.here,the government maintains a strong interest in prosecuting gillenwater.for one thing,gillenwater is charged with not one but three offenses.if convicted,he may face sentences that run consecutively.see.if convicted,gillenwater may also face supervised release,see,which several of our sister circuits have found significant in evaluating the government showing on the first sell factor,see,united states gutierrez,cir united states nicklas,cir united states bush,cir.supervised release would help ensure that gillenwater does not return to making threats when released into the public.and the monitoring that accompanies supervised release may be especially valuable here because gillenwater allegedly persisted in making threats despite law enforcement intervention.after all,the government alleges that gillenwater returned to sending threatening emails two days after federal agents warned gillenwater that doing so could land him behind bars.what is more,the government alleges that gillenwater sent a threatening postcard while in custody.finally,as explained by one of our sister circuits,the fact of a conviction would create certain limitations on gillenwater subsequent activities,such as his ability to obtain and own firearms,see d,g,which may be particularly important where,as here,gillenwater is charged with making threats against federal officials and employees.bush,f d at.
third,gillenwater contends that he was inclined to commit the subject offenses at least in part because of his mental condition and,thus,such disorder should render it less important to criminally prosecute him.appellant br.as we recognized in ruiz gaxiola,the fact that a defendant mental disorder contributed to his offense may weaken the government interest in prosecuting him,but that will not always be the case.see at.here,the link between gillenwater mental disorder and his charged crimes makes his prosecution all the more important.the government expert testified that without treatment,gillenwater is likely to continue to act on his delusions.and the district court found that he is at substantial risk to engage in the type of violent conduct which is the subject of the criminal proceeding against him if his mental condition is left untreated.order.
turning to the second sell factor,the government must make a showing to establish that involuntary medication will significantly further the important governmental interests at stake.first,the government must show that administration of the drugs is substantially likely to render the defendant competent to stand trial.sell,at.and second,it must show that administration of the drugs is substantially unlikely to have side effects that will interfere significantly with the defendant ability to assist counsel in conducting a trial defense.id.
gillenwater does not challenge the district court determination that administration of haloperidol decanoate is substantially unlikely to have side effects that will interfere significantly with his ability to assist his counsel in his defense.he contends only that the district court clearly erred in determining that administration of the drug is substantially likely to render him competent to stand trial.
we can not agree.the government expert,lucking,testified that haloperidol decanoate is substantially likely to decrease gillenwater delusional beliefs to the extent where he will then be able to interact with and work with his attorney to plan a rational,logical defense.er.lucking has a robust knowledge base,and he presented a strong case for the effectiveness of involuntary medication in rendering gillenwater competent to stand trial.lucking has been board certified in psychiatry and neurology for over years.he has served as a staff psychiatrist at the federal medical center in butner,north carolina,where he evaluated gillenwater,for over years.based on his clinical experience,lucking testified that defendants with psychotic disorders often attain competency when treated with antipsychotic medication.he also presented several recent studies indicating that more than of persons suffering from delusional disorder saw an improvement in their sy
