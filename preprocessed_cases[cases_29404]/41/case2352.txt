we are asked to review a summary judgment dismissal of a claim by an epileptic operator for a county road department under the americans with disabilities act.
from the age of,robert dark has suffered from epilepsy.he controls the condition with medication but still endures the occasional seizure which is usually preceded by a physical manifestation called an aura.an aura is akin to a nervous jerk it indicates the potential for a seizure on the day of the aura,typically no sooner than one hour later.dark says that a seizure follows an aura approximately half of the time.
dark employment with the road department of curry county,oregon the county commenced on march.his position,maintenance and construction worker iii,required,among other tasks,the operation of heavy equipment such as construction vehicles.dark employment record over approximately years reflects satisfactory,at least,job performance.
on the morning of january,prior to his leaving for work,dark experienced an aura.despite this warning,dark reported for work as scheduled and failed to inform anyone of the possibility of his suffering an epileptic seizure.later that day,dark suffered a seizure and fell unconscious while driving a county pickup truck.fortunately,at the time dark was operating the vehicle at a very slow rate of speed.his passenger,another road department employee,gained control of the vehicle and brought it to a safe halt.
in response to this incident,the county requested that dark undergo a medical examination.john melson,a neurologist,performed the examination on march,and concluded that because of the presence of poorly controlled idiopathic epilepsy,dark should not work in high places,he should not work around moving machinery where sudden loss of consciousness would endanger either himself or others,and this would appear to severely limit him from the duties of the job described.
subsequent to receipt of melson report,the road department placed dark on administrative leave.during this process,dark commercial driver license was also suspended.on april,the road department held a disciplinary hearing at which dark was represented by counsel.dark admitted to having experienced an aura on the morning of the incident.
the road department terminated dark employment on april.it communicated its decision in a letter signed by daniel crumley,the department roadmaster,which concluded that dark could not perform the essential functions and duties of his position and that his continued employment posed a threat to the safety of others.
dark appealed these findings to the curry county board of commissioners the board and received a hearing on may.on june,the board affirmed crumley decision to terminate dark employment.it reasoned that dark had acted irresponsibly,recklessly,and with a total disregard of the safety of himself,other employees,and members of the public.
on november,dark filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.following an investigation,the eeoc determined that the evidence does not establish a violation of the americans with disabilities act ada.see et.on march,it declined to sue the county on dark behalf but permitted him days within which to initiate a private action.
thereafter,on may,dark filed this lawsuit in the district of oregon.he sued curry county,the road department,and crumley under the ada and oregon equivalent.see or.stat.et dark first claim for relief alleged that the county violated the ada by discharging him while refusing reasonably to accommodate his disability his second claim alleged a similar violation of the oregon statute.dark seeks recovery of lost wages,future wages,humiliation,and loss of reputation,as well as punitive damages,reinstatement,and attorneys fees.
the county filed a motion for summary judgment on august.the magistrate judge charged with making a recommendation did not receive a response from dark because of an alleged postal error.on september,the magistrate judge recommended granting the county motion.the district court considered the magistrate recommendation and dark subsequently filed memorandum in opposition to defendants motion for summary judgment and supporting affidavits.on november,the court adopted the magistrate recommendation and granted the county motion for summary judgment and dismissed dark lawsuit.dark timely appealed.
dark urges that summary judgment was improperly granted because there are at least three genuine issues of material fact which entitle him to a jury trial,specifically,with respect to the reason given for his termination,his qualifications,and whether he is a direct threat to his fellow employees 
dark first contends that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the county demonstrated a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for his termination.the county responds that t here is no dispute that the plaintiff did engage in misconduct by driving with knowledge of the risk he posed,and without warning any coworkers of the danger he presented.thus,the county argues that dark termination resulted from misconduct or a failure to meet legitimate job expectations.
the county alleged in its motion for summary judgement that there are no disputed facts with respect to the reason for dark termination.but we find some difficulty with this assertion because the record includes two divergent explanations.
the first explanation for dark termination is the letter of april,in which crumley explained his decision in terms of dark alleged lack of fitness to perform the duties of the position.in relevant part,the letter stated 
the allegation that you can not perform the essential functions and duties of the job of maintenance and construction worker iii as described is substantiated 
following your on the job seizure on,the county had sufficient concerns regarding your medical condition to request an independent neurologist to evaluate you 
i accept melson findings that because of the presence of poorly controlled idiopathic epilepsy,you should not work around moving machinery that would prevent you from performing the basic work functions outlined in your job description.
i believe a seizure free condition is critical for workers in your occupation y our condition in my opinion prevents you from performing your duties it is also my conclusion that allowing you to work in your present job for curry county would impose a threat to the safety and lives of your coworkers and the public.
emphases added.true,the letter also details aspects of the january,incident.but nowhere does crumley state that dark driving the pickup truck despite the aura was an independent reason for the termination.
the second explanation,misconduct,is contained in the board order of june.after reciting the relevant facts,the board reasoned 
by operating the truck and heavy equipment on january,dark knowingly put the safety of himself,and the general public in jeopardy.
now,therefore,it is hereby ordered that dan crumley decision to terminate the employment of robert dark is hereby affirmed for the reason that on january,robert dark acted irresponsibly,recklessly,and with a total disregard of the safety of himself,other employees,and members of the public 
the county,in effect,asserts that the board rationale was the only legally relevant reason for dark termination.
the county,however,provides no explanation as to why we should accept such contention.to the contrary,we think that the role of the board was simply to entertain the appeal of an termination.as noted in the board order affirming the termination,p ursuant to the curry county personnel rules,the board mandate was to deliberate and reach a decision to affirm,modify or deny the disciplinary action.the termination letter also considered dark firing to have been a completed act.regarding dark appeal to the board,the letter stated,the appeal must be in writing it must also specify why you believe the dismissal was not in good faith,for cause or was in error.emphases added.and at oral argument,counsel for the county conceded that the effective date of dark termination was april,the date of crumley termination letter.thus,the legally relevant action had already been accomplished before the board took cognizance of dark appeal.
of course,even were we to treat the board decision as the legally operative one,the reason given for dark termination must actually constitute a valid nondiscriminatory explanation,one that disclaims any reliance on the employee disability in having taken the employment action.snead,at.
while courts have indeed recognized a distinction between termination of employment because of misconduct and termination of employment because of a disability,collings longview fibre,cir citation omitted,there is an important caveat.w ith few exceptions,conduct resulting from a disability is considered to be part of the disability,rather than a separate basis for termination.humphrey mem l hosps.ass n,cir the county does not argue that dark misconduct resulted from other than his disability thus,the board explanation,as a matter of law,fails to qualify as a legitimate,nondiscriminatory explanation for dark discharge.
even if the board explanation were legitimate and nondiscriminatory,we must still must consider it in light of the ada standard of causation.
as noted,the county urges us to credit only the rationale provided by the board of commissioners,which was that the road department terminated dark because of his.but the ada does not require that a discriminatory impetus have been the only motive for an adverse employment action.see head glacier northwest,cir baird ex rel.baird rose,cir foster arthur andersen,llp,cir mcnely ocala,cir.rather,the ada outlaws adverse employment decisions motivated,even in part,by animus based on a plaintiff disability or request for an motivating factor standard.head,at emphases added.
causation is a factual inquiry,and we are satisfied that there is record evidence sufficient that a jury could reasonably find that dark was terminated for an impermissible reason.in addition to the april,termination letter,we consider relevant the documentation dark provided,in an affidavit dated september,of six separate accidents for which other road department workers went undisciplined.see collings,at.such evidence gives rise to a genuine issue of material fact as to whether dark disability was a motivating factor for his termination.
even if the county had cleared each of the foregoing hurdles,summary judgment is also inappropriate if dark has shown,by specific,substantial evidence,that the board explanation was mere pretext.see id.at.dark must have availed himself of 
the opportunity to demonstrate that the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment decision.this burden now merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that he has been the victim of intentional discrimination.he may succeed in this either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.
snead,at quoting texas of community affairs burdine,d.
the summary judgment record is replete with evidence suggesting that misconduct was a pretext for discrimination on the basis of disability.first,dark was not immediately terminated after the january,accident,but rather was subjected to a medical examination to determine his fitness for the position.the report generated was entitled,fitness to work evaluation report.as dark aptly stated,the county did not need a doctor opinion to assess whether plaintiff had engaged in misconduct.the record also provides direct evidence of the county motivation for seeking this examination.the april,termination letter stated,following your on the job seizure on,the county had sufficient concerns regarding your medical condition to request an independent neurologist to evaluate you.emphasis added.
second,the documents explaining dark termination support an argument for pretext.the letter placing dark on administrative leave indicates that the county was concerned more with dark general condition than the incident of january,
as you can see,melson has concluded that you can not perform the essential functions and duties of your position of maintenance and construction worker iii in addition,allowing you to continue working in your current job for curry county could impose a direct threat to the safety and lives of your fellow employees and other members of the public.
as already discussed,the termination letter also constitutes substantial evidence suggesting that the misconduct rationale is pretext.in addition,the county itself added to the summary judgment record other direct evidence of disability discrimination.in roadmaster crumley affidavit of august,he states 
a maintenance and construction worker iii spends approximately of his time operating and driving heavy equipment the potential for harm is significant if the worker suffers a seizure while operating heavy machinery on public roads.not only could the plaintiff himself be hurt by an accident,but also his coworkers or the public could be injured,even killed,if the plaintiff had a seizure while driving a truck or heavy machinery.
emphases added.crumley statements are they exhibit a concern with dark future ability,given his epileptic condition,to perform safely the essential functions of his job.given the ada standard of causation and a plaintiff opportunity to show pretext,it is clear that a rationale developed ex post by a reviewing body can not wipe away the original discriminatory justification for an employee termination.see,hernandez hughes missile systems,cir from the fact that the employer has provided conflicting explanations of its conduct,a jury could reasonably conclude that its most recent explanation was pretextual.citations omitted.
third,dark showing of pretext is bolstered by comparative evidence.as already noted,the record includes documentation of similar accidents for which other workers went undisciplined.in response,the county lists several prior incidents in which dark was involved but was not disciplined.its point,we gather,is that dark was treated no differently than other county apparently foregoes discipline for most accidents.and yet in the same breath,in its brief the county unwittingly explains how a reasonable jury could conclude that this evidence actually cuts in dark favor 
the accidents involving other employees were not,and did not give rise to conclusions that the employees were unfit for duty.similarly,the plaintiff prior accidents did not result in discipline.it was not until an accident occurred that was caused by a seizure,that the plaintiff fitness for duty was called into question.
in other words,the county concedes that this accident was special because it involved dark disability.
for all of the foregoing reasons,we must conclude that the county evidence of a legitimate,nondiscriminatory motive does not,standing alone,entitle it to summary judgment.
dark next contends that there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether he was qualified.
the ada defines a qualified individual as an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.emphasis added.dark bears the burden of proving that he is qualified.hutton elf atochem north america,cir.we must consider whether dark can perform the job essential functions without reasonable accommodation,and then,if he can not,whether he can do so with reasonable accommodation.see kaplan city of north las vegas,cir.
the term essential functions refers to the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires.it does not include the marginal functions of the position.n.a job function may be considered essential for various reasons.see id.n i iii.the statute provides that consideration shall be given to the employer judgment as to what functions of the job are essential,and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job,this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.see also n requiring consideration of the amount of time spent performing the function.
here,the county,in a september document entitled job description,lists the essential duties of dark position as follows 
operates grader,dozer,excavator,asphalt distributor,chip spreader,low boy and ditchmaster.
operates dump trucks,loaders,brush cutters,rollers,backhoe,water tankers and truck mounted snow plows.
performs minor blasting for road maintenance projects.includes blasting rocks and opening plugged culverts.
performs manual labor associated with building fences,cleaning culverts,traffic control,pot hole patching,bridge repair,tree trimming,brush cuffing.
maintains equipment by lubricating and making minor repairs.
trains employees in lower classifications in the operation of heavy equipment.
the document also states that one of the aspects that distinguishe s the position from lower classifications is the emphasis on the operation of heavy equipment.this is valid evidence of the essential functions of dark position with the road department.
to prove dark is unqualified,the county points to the various heavy machines and vehicles that dark would be required to operate and around which he would be required to work.it contends that an employee in dark former position would spend approximately of his time operating such heavy equipment.
dark does not contest the county judgment that the operation of heavy machinery is an essential function of the position.instead,dark insists that he is indeed qualified to perform such function.he points out that he has suffered only one epileptic episode during more than years with the road department.moreover,he says,it was only a change in his medication that caused the january,seizure,and two physicians now recommend that dark return to work with minimal or no restrictions.dark,in sum,rejects melson findings and claims that his seizures are again under control.
had dark treating physicians opined that dark was fit to operate heavy machinery at the time of his firing,this perhaps would have given rise to a genuine issue of material fact as to his qualifications without reasonable accommodation.see,fredenburg contra costa county of health,cir.but the physicians actually recommended dark return to work following a period of observation during which he could adjust to the change in his medication.dark provides no evidence that his seizures were under control at the time of his termination.
such dearth of evidence leads to the question of whether dark was qualified with reasonable accommodation.the ada definition of discrimination includes not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business.b a accord morton united parcel,cir 
dark has the burden of showing the existence of a reasonable accommodation that would have enabled him to perform the essential functions of an available job.see zukle regents of university of california,cir citation omitted.to avoid summary judgment,however,dark need only show that an accommodation seems reasonable on its face,ordinarily or in the run of cases.airways,barnett,d emphasis added.
in addition,our cases make clear that the county bore an affirmative obligation to engage in an interactive process in order to identify,if possible,a reasonable accommodation that would permit dark to retain his employment.see allen pacific bell,cir per curiam citing humphrey,at morton,at explaining that summary judgement is available only where there is no genuine dispute that the employer has engaged in the interactive process in good faith nunes,at reversing summary judgment because,inter alia,the record contains no evidence that the employer considered any accommodations to reduce the risks it feared citation omitted see also o to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal,interactive process with the qualified individual with a disability in need of the accommodation.because the county did not engage in any such process,summary judgment is available only if a reasonable finder of fact must conclude that there would in any event have been no reasonable accommodation available.morton,at citation omitted.
here,the record indicates that dark requested accommodation through either a temporary change in his duties reassignment to a new position or the use of accumulated sick leave or medical leave without pay.
dark accommodation proposals are based on his argument that his uncontrolled epilepsy was temporary.dark the concurrence of his treating he could safely resume all functions of his job upon completing the transition to his new medication.though melson,the county physician,doubted dark overall fitness,he also acknowledged the relevance of dark medication adjustments.at the least,dark has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to his qualifications.in this light,we consider whether a reasonable juror could find that any of the accommodations proposed by dark were reasonable and available.
regulations under the ada provide that job restructuring may be a reasonable accommodation required of the employer.o ii.dark argues that the transport of heavy machinery consumed only two to three percent of dark work time,and thus there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether this was an essential function.for the days during which dark commercial driver license was suspended,he argues,this function could have been reallocated to another employee.the county,however,considers this argument a red herring whether dark should be made to drive on the public roads is beside the point when the job essential function is the operation of heavy equipment,occupying of total work time.
the ada does not require an employer to exempt an employee from performing essential functions or to reallocate essential functions to other employees.see part,app.an employer or other covered entity may restructure a job by reallocating or redistributing nonessential,marginal job functions.phelps optima health,cir.the county thus need not restructure dark position by exempting him from the essential duty of operating heavy machinery.dark has not shown job restructuring was an available option.
then there is the possibility of reassignment.dark is a qualified individual under the ada if he can perform the essential functions of a reassignment position,with or without reasonable accommodation,even if he can not perform the essential functions of the current position.hutton,at see also noting that reasonable accommodation may include reassignment to a vacant position.
as noted,dark offered the possibility of r eassignment to a vacant position,either temporary or permanent,and alleges that the evidence shows that there were a number of open positions for which he was qualified around the time of his discharge.the county does not reject the possibility of reassignment,but merely points out that the affidavit serving as dark evidence for the availability of reassignment states only that certain positions have become available since his termination,not that they were available at that time.
dark response is to cite two tenth circuit cases,smith midland brake,cir,and boykin of colorado,cir.these cases hold that vacant positions to which a disabled employee may be reassigned include those that the employer reasonably anticipates will become vacant in the fairly immediate future.midland brake,at citation omitted.
the proposition dark advances is consistent with our previous holding that the duty to accommodate is a continuing duty that is not exhausted by one effort.humphrey,at.it is also contemplated within the eeoc guidelines.see part,app.advising that reassignment is reasonable if the position is vacant within a reasonable amount of time,which should be determined in light of the totality of the circumstances.we adopt the tenth circuit rule in considering reassignment as a reasonable accommodation,an employer must consider not only those contemporaneously available positions but also
