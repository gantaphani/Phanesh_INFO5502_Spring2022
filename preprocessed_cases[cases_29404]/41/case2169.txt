a receiver appointed by a federal district court currently oversees the delivery of medical care to prisoners incarcerated by the california department of corrections and rehabilitation cdcr.medical development international mdi provided medical services for two of cdcr prisons,without a finalized contract.the receiver terminated mdi services.mdi was not paid for much of its work and filed suit against the receiver and cdcr.mdi claim has been before two different federal district courts,but mdi did not obtain relief from either of them.appeals have been taken by mdi from both and have been consolidated before us.
the primary question presented to us is whether the receiver is immune from suit for mdi claim.we conclude that in the circumstances presented here the receiver may be sued in his official capacity and he is not covered by judicial immunity.we also conclude that the federal district court had subject matter jurisdiction over mdi lawsuit after it was removed from state court,and that mdi was not required to obtain permission from the court that appointed the receiver prior to filing suit against him,under a.as a result,we affirm in part and vacate in part the orders that are the subject of this appeal,and we remand for further proceedings.
background 
in june,the district court for the northern district of california established a receivership to take control of the delivery of medical services to all california state prisoners confined by cdcr.plata schwarzenegger,no.teh,wl,at.the court explained that i t is clear that an unconscionable degree of suffering and death is sure to continue if the system is not dramatically overhauled,and determined that the only solution to the systemic failures that had led to these problems was the drastic but necessary remedy of a receivership.id.at see also id.at.
the court charged the receiver with provid ing leadership and executive management to cdcr,with the goals of restructuring operations and developing,implementing,and validating a new,sustainable system.in particular,it assigned the receiver the duty to control,oversee,supervise,and direct all administrative,personnel,financial,accounting,contractual,legal,and other operational functions of the medical delivery component of the cdcr,and equipped the receiver with all powers vested by law in the secretary of the cdcr as they relate to the above functions.
shortly thereafter,the northern district entered another order relating specifically to contracts for medical services entered into by cdcr.it did so because the court perceived what it described as yet another chilling example of the inability of the cdcr to competently perform the basic functions necessary to deliver constitutionally adequate medical health care.cdcr contracts with third parties for most of the medical care it provides to inmates,but,the court explained,in doing so cdcr had failed to competitively bid the contracts,had used flawed negotiating practices,had agreed to excessive rates of compensation,and had failed to secure necessary approvals.to make matters worse,the court concluded that cdcr response to the failures was simply to stick its head in the sand,causing the process for negotiating,processing,renewing,and payment of medical contracts to collapse.
to address this problem,the northern district ordered cdcr to develop new processes for entering into and managing medical contracts.it also ordered cdcr to pay all current outstanding,valid,and medical invoices within days and authorized cdcr to enter into contracts without competitive bidding while it developed the new processes.
in that context,cdcr entered into a relationship with mdi.mdi is an administrator of prison health care systems,headquartered in florida,providing services designed to facilitate the timely and delivery of health care to incarcerated persons.cdcr sought mdi services as part of a pilot program in two facilities,the california state penitentiary,los angeles,and the california correctional institution in tehachapi.specifically,it was proposed that mdi would enter into agreements with physicians and hospitals,assist prison staff in locating medical specialists,implement a centralized system for scheduling and tracking inpatient and outpatient care,and create a centralized billing system for payment claims by providers.
after months of negotiation the parties still had not finalized a contract.nonetheless,cdcr permitted mdi to begin working in the two institutions,purportedly in reliance on the northern district orders described above.
sometime after that,cdcr staff began to worry that because mdi was not licensed to practice medicine in california,mdi might be violating california prohibition on the corporate practice of medicine.as a result of that concern,in january the receiver ordered cdcr to stop all payments on mdi invoices.at a meeting with mdi representatives,the receiver indicated that mdi would be paid only if it was determined that mdi was lawfully providing services in california.in the meantime,mdi was instructed to continue working in the two institutions.despite efforts by mdi to show that its services were lawful,the receiver ended the relationship on april,and expelled mdi from the two institutions.
mdi filed suit in sacramento county superior court against the receiver and cdcr.pursuant to,the receiver removed mdi lawsuit to the district court for the eastern district of california.
the receiver and cdcr then moved the court to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the eastern district granted the motion and dismissed the action.the court,citing barton barbour,explained that t he united states supreme court has held that federal common law bars suits against receivers in courts other than the court charged with the administration of the estate unless the suit is approved by the appointing court.based on reasoning that will be described in greater detail below,the court rejected mdi argument that the bar did not apply to this action because it fit within a statutory exception codified at a.because approval of the lawsuit by the court that appointed the receiver,the northern district,had not been obtained,the action against the receiver was dismissed.
the motion to dismiss as to cdcr was granted as well.the eastern district noted that t he bulk of mdi allegations against the cdcr arise from the cdcr compliance with the receiver orders.because of this,the court concluded that due to the significant overlap in mdi allegations,the interests of judicial economy also support the accompanying dismissal of mdi s causes of action with respect to the cdcr.accordingly,the court dismissed the action as to both the receiver and cdcr.
mdi appealed to this court,but the appeal was stayed by a stipulation of the parties to allow mdi to seek leave from the northern district to sue the receiver.mdi sought such leave,but the northern district denied the request.it held that mdi failed to set forth a prima facie case because the receiver would be immune from mdi suit.it explained that a receiver is absolutely immune from suit for functions intimately connected with his receivership duties.quoting new alaska dev.guetschow,cir.since the court had charged the receiver with the duty to control,oversee,supervise,and direct all contractual functions,and mdi was suing the receiver for terminating whatever relationship may have existed when he suspected illegality,mdi was challenging the receiver conduct in performing the very duties the court had set up the receivership to perform.
mdi then filed a motion for clarification.the motion explained that mdi intended to file a state court lawsuit against cdcr alone and sought guidance as to whether the court also intended its earlier order to rule on cdcr immunity.the northern district declined to provide such guidance.it stated that mdi had not sought leave to sue cdcr in state court,only the receiver,and there is no requirement that such leave to sue cdcr be obtained.because there was no pending case between mdi and cdcr,mdi essentially sought an order deciding whether an immunity defense,if raised,would succeed,a decision the court held would be an unconstitutional advisory opinion.mdi appealed the northern district order.
in addition,mdi also filed a complaint against cdcr,and does,in sacramento county superior court,not naming the receiver as a defendant.the complaint stated seven causes of action breach of contract,wrongful termination of contract,promissory estoppel,quantum enrichment,assumpsit,account stated,and violations of california prompt payment act.the state court stayed the proceedings pending this appeal.
the appeals by mdi from the eastern district and the northern district decisions described above were consolidated.
ii.discussion 
on appeal mdi raises three main issues whether the eastern district erred in exercising removal jurisdiction whether mdi lawsuit fits within the statutory exception to the bar on suing a receiver without permission from the appointing court and whether the receiver is absolutely immune from mdi claim.each issue is addressed in turn.
mdi asserts that the receiver removal of mdi state court complaint was invalid.we disagree.
it appears that mdi is raising this issue for the first time on appeal.after the notice of removal was served,mdi did not move in the eastern district to remand the action to state court.as a result,the only grievance it can raise is lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see c a motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within days after the filing of the notice of removal.
the relevant statute authorizing the removal,a,reads 
a civil action in a state court against any of the following may be removed by them to the district court of the united states any officer or any person acting under that officer of the united states sued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office or on account of any right,title or authority claimed under any act of congress any officer of the courts of the united states,for any act under color of office or in the performance of his duties 
it is obvious that the requirement for removal under the statute is met.a receiver is an officer of the courts of the united states ely valley mines,hartford accident indem,cir.the requirement of any act under color of such office has been construed as requiring a causal connection between the charged conduct and the official authority.id.at.that connection is established where the challenged conduct involves actions entrusted to the receiver in his capacity as receiver.gay ruff.because mdi has conceded that it is suing the receiver over the performance of his duties,the nexus is present.see arizona manypenny,d explaining that the right of removal created by a is absolute for conduct performed under color of federal office,and the policy favoring removal should not be frustrated by a narrow,grudging interpretation of a internal quotation marks omitted.thus,we affirm the eastern district exercise of jurisdiction.
b.the barton rule and a 
mdi also argues that the eastern district erred in dismissing its suit.mdi asserts that it was not required to obtain permission from the northern district to sue the receiver because its action fits within the statutory exception to the general rule requiring an appointing court permission before suing a receiver in another jurisdiction.we agree.
we review jurisdictional questions de novo.see mcguire united states,cir.
the requirement that a party obtain leave from the appointing court before suing a receiver in another venue is.see curry castillo in re castillo,cir.the rule was first announced years ago in barton barbour.the supreme court held that when a plaintiff sues a receiver outside of and without the permission of the appointing court,the court is without jurisdiction to entertain the suit.barton,at.as the court succinctly explained in a later decision when a court exercising jurisdiction in equity appoints a receiver of all the property of a corporation,the court assumes the administration of the estate.the possession of the receiver is the possession of the court porter sabin.it is for that court,therefore,to decide whether it will determine for itself all claims of or against the receiver,or will allow them to be litigated elsewhere.see also barton,at.
there is a statutory exception to the barton rule.the exception was enacted by congress to address a concern expressed in a dissent to barton filed by justice miller.see diners club,bumb,cir explaining that because the original was enacted shortly after barton,and given the content of justice miller dissent,it is clear that the purpose of was to enact the dissent into law.justice miller wrote that he agreed with the majority to the extent that its rule was limited to receivers appointed to wind up a defunct corporation.barton,at.but where the rule was extended to a suit that would not interfere with the actual possession of property which the receiver holds,such a rule requiring permission from the appointing court before an action could be brought against a receiver in a different court was unsupported by authority and unsound in principle.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the exception,currently codified at a,reads trustees,receivers or managers of any property,including debtors in possession,may be sued,without leave of the court appointing them,with respect to any of their acts or transactions in carrying on business connected with such property.
our cases analyzing the interplay between the barton rule and a have most often involved bankruptcy trustees,and the policies underlying the barton doctrine apply with greater force to bankruptcy proceedings than to other proceedings involving receivers.beck fort james in re crown vantage,cir.moreover,many of these cases have dealt with a liquidating trustee,see,id.at,a circumstance in which the barton majority and justice miller agreed that the barton rule should apply,see barton,at.
this case does not fit that pattern,however.the receiver was not appointed to wind up or reorganize,in a bankruptcy sense,cdcr operations.cdcr was and is an ongoing entity,continuing to operate.the northern district assigned the receiver all powers vested by law in the secretary of the cdcr as they relate to the administration,control,management,operation,and financing of the california prison medical health care system.thus,in short,the receiver was the chief executive officer of the medical division of cdcr,a basic part of whose operation includes contracting with and managing those responsible for providing medical care to prisoners,such as mdi.see diners club,at explaining that appellant suit,for breach of contract due to a trustee alleged negligent employment of an untrustworthy employee,clearly was in respect of the trustee transactions in carrying on the debtor business.we have said that a applies only if the officer is actually operating the business,and only to acts or transactions in conducting the debtor business in the ordinary sense of the words or in pursuing that business as an operating enterprise.in re crown vantage,at quoting muratore darr,cir.mdi is challenging the receiver conduct in operating cdcr business in an ongoing or usual manner,as distinguished from actions taken in winding up an enterprise or supervising a bankruptcy reorganization.we conclude that this case fits that category of an ongoing,operating enterprise.
in granting the motion to dismiss the receiver,the eastern district cited in re crown vantage,at,and wrote that d espite its seemingly expansive language,a is rarely employed actually utilized by more narrowly applied.in the court analysis,the relatively small handful of cases interpreting a restrict its application to instances where a receiver has been sued in capacity as an employer,or for torts committed by agents of the in receivership during the course of routine or operations distinct from the receiver official responsibilities.the eastern district reasoned 
u nlike the cases where leave was not required,mdi causes of action against the receiver do not arise from tortious conduct or negligent acts pursuant to,routine,or ordinary business operations unrelated to his offic
