ii.background 
rohrbough worked for the hospital from november,until june,when the hospital terminated her employment.during the final five years of her employment,rohrbough served as the transplant coordinator in the hospital heart transplant unit.in,she became concerned about patient care in the unit due to what she perceived to be a staffing crisis.specifically,rohrbough believed the staffing problems were affecting the quality of care the hospital patients received because labs and other medical tests were performed extremely late and charts were not reviewed in a timely fashion.rohrbough raised her concerns with a number of hospital employees b ecause she wanted the patient care issues that were causing patient negative outcomes to be addressed,and because she believed everyone needed to be held accountable for their action or inaction.
first,rohrbough raised her concerns to nurses nancy ireland and linda stepien,and karin keller,her supervisor.these conversations took place both inside and outside the workplace.she next raised her concerns with margaret frueh,her manager,and joann lindenfeld,the director of the hospital heart transplant unit.rohrbough also discussed the staffing issues during an appeal of her performance evaluation with colleen goode,vice president of patient services and the hospital chief nursing officer,and joyce cashman,the hospital executive vice president.still frustrated by the hospital lack of response,she took her concerns to dennis brimhall,the president of the hospital.rohrbough thought it appropriate to meet with brimhall given that her concerns were related to her employment because they were patient care issues.
brimhall informed rohrbough she had the option of meeting with someone from the hospital risk management unit.rohrbough subsequently met with susan west of the hospital risk management unit.west informed her of the hospital incident reporting system and welcomed rohrbough to create incident reports covering the instances of substandard care she observed.indeed,hospital policies required all employees to write incident reports whenever they encountered unsafe conditions,errors,and near misses.after meeting with west,rohrbough composed eleven such reports.
while her performance evaluation appeal was pending,rohrbough learned of a possible heart transplant misallocation and at the hospital.she reported information regarding this alleged missallocation and to the united network for organ sharing unos,an entity established by congress to administer organ transplants.as transplant coordinator,rohrbough was responsible for contacting unos to place patients on transplant lists,removing patients from transplants lists,and providing information about a particular transplant.in this particular instance,however,rohrbough testified she called unos because her impression was that lindenfeld was not going to be truthful in her report to unos.she contacted the unos representative from her home,identified herself as the hospital transplant coordinator,and described her basis for believing a heart had been misallocated at the hospital.she also discussed the alleged heart misallocation with a reporter from the denver westword,a print weekly.
in february,rohrbough received a performance evaluation that indicated she had failed to meet hospital standards.in march,several of rohrbough coworkers approached the hospital human resources department to express concerns about rohrbough poor job performance and her negative impact on the work environment.in response,rohrbough was placed on administrative leave.she was reinstated,but failed to improve her performance.as a result,frueh terminated rohrbough employment on june.in explaining her decision to terminate rohrbough,frueh testified that a t no time during rohrbough employment at the hospital did i have knowledge of her reports to unos regarding the alleged.therefore,i could not have disciplined rohrbough for this alleged reporting.
rohrbough filed suit against the hospital and frueh,in both her individual and official capacity,alleging the hospital impermissibly retaliated against her for exercising first amendment rights.rohrbough specifically alleges her speech relating to the hospital staffing crisis,the heart misallocation,and incident reports were protected under the first amendment.the hospital moved for summary judgment,arguing that all of rohrbough speech was made pursuant to her official responsibilities and therefore unprotected under garcetti.
the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the hospital.it held that under the standards developed in the wake of garcetti,it was clear that all the speech for which plaintiff was allegedly retaliated against fell squarely within the scope of her official duties.the district court held rohrbough complaints about inadequate staffing by her own admission,directly related to her concerns about patient safety and welfare and fell squarely within her overarching job responsibility as a nurse to ensure those concerns were met.similarly,the district court held the occurrence reports were also written pursuant to rohrbough broader,official duties as a nurse to safeguard patient welfare.finally,with respect to her communications with unos,the district court held this speech was a natural,foreseeable outgrowth of rohrbough official duty to contact unos to place patients on the transplant list or to change a patient status on that list.as a result,the district court held that none of the speech activities on which rohrbough claim was based were subject to protection under the first amendment in the wake of garcetti.on appeal,rohrbough argues the district court erred in determining she spoke pursuant to her official duties as the hospital transplant coordinator.
iii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment for the defendants de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.shero city of grove,cir.summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.furthermore,because this case involves the first amendment,we have an obligation to make an independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.twin peaks charter,cir quotation omitted.
freedom of speech retaliation claim 
in garcetti ceballos,the supreme court reaffirmed that the first amendment protects a public employee right,in certain circumstances,to speak as a citizen addressing matters of public concern.the court recognized the inherent tension between an employee right to free speech and the government employer right to exercise a significant degree of control over their employees words and actions,and concluded while the first amendment invests public employees with certain rights,it does not empower them to constitutionalize the employee grievance.id.at,quotation omitted.
to balance these competing interests,this court employs the inquiry set out in pickering bd.of,and modified by garcetti,at.the inquiry comprises five steps 
whether the speech was made pursuant to an employee official duties whether the speech was on a matter of public concern whether the government interests,as employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public service are sufficient to outweigh the plaintiff free speech interests whether the protected speech was a motivating factor in the adverse employment action and whether the defendant would have reached the same employment decision in the absence of the protected conduct.

the first three steps of the analysis are issues of law to be resolved by the district court,while the last two are ordinarily for the trier of fact,at see also thomas city of blanchard,cir describing step one of the inquiry as a question of whether speech is constitutionally protected and therefore one of law,not fact hesse town of jackson,cir the determination of whether a public employee speaks pursuant to official duties is a matter of law.nevertheless,these cases review disputed facts relevant to step one of the analysis in the light most favorable to the party at the summary judgment stage.see,at v iewing the evidence in the light most favorable to them,plaintiffs speech regarding some of the matters was not made pursuant to their official duties.hesse,at viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff to conclude as a matter of law that plaintiff speech was made pursuant to his official employment duties green board of county comm rs,cir same.accordingly,this court will view any disputed facts relevant to the issue of whether rohrbough spoke pursuant to her official duties in the light most favorable to her in making its determination under the first prong of the analysis.
the garcetti court did not have the opportunity to articulate a comprehensive framework for defining the scope of an employee duties,because the parties did not dispute the presence of the factor.at.the tenth circuit decisions addressing the first step of the analysis have taken a broad view of the meaning of speech that is pursuant to an employee official duties.thomas,at quotations omitted see also casey las vegas indep.sch,cir referring to the first prong of the analysis as a heavy barrier.these decisions,however,have not developed a set of bright line rules to determine when an employee speaks pursuant to her official duties for the purposes of.rather,in line with the court admonition in garcetti that t he proper inquiry was a practical one,at,the tenth circuit has taken a approach,looking both to the content of the speech,as well as the employee chosen audience,to determine whether the speech is made pursuant to an employee official duties.
in general,the court has focused on whether the speech activity stemmed from and was of the type that the employee was paid to do,green,at,and has highlighted that the ultimate question in determining whether speech falls within an employee official duties is whether the employee speaks as a citizen or instead as a government employee,at.as examples of protected government employee speech,green listed communicating with newspapers or legislators or performing some similar activity afforded citizens.at see also garcetti,at listing writing a letter to a local newspaper and discussing politics with a coworker as examples of such speech.the garcetti decision also suggested that a government employee speech is not protected when there is no relevant analogue to speech by citizens who are not government employees.id.at.
regarding the content of an employee speech,the tenth circuit has recognized that not all speech about the subject matter of an employee work is necessarily made pursuant to the employee official duties.brammerhoelter,at.the court has also noted that speech pursuant to the employee duty to report a particular activity is usually within that employee official duties under.see,casey,at holding that speech made pursuant to an employee duty to report to her employer regarding the legality of the employer operations was within the scope of her official duties.
in addition,the court has not foreclosed unauthorized speech or speech not explicitly required as part of an employee job from being within the scope of that employee official duties under.green,at see also,at holding that speech could be considered within the scope of an employee official duty even if the speech concerns an unusual aspect of an employee job that is not part of his everyday functions.to the contrary,green emphasized the employee unauthorized speech at issue inescapably invoke d garcetti admonishment that a government employee first amendment rights do not invest them with a right to perform their jobs however they see fit.at quoting garcetti,at.in this vein,green also noted that protecting unauthorized speech would result in judicial oversight of communications between and among government employees and their superiors in the course of official business and displacement of managerial discretion by judicial supervision.id.quoting garcetti,at.
regarding the employee chosen audience,or chosen method of disseminating speech,the court has similarly refrained from establishing per se rules for determining whether speech is made pursuant to an employee official duties.for example,in,the speech regarding the budgeting of teacher salaries and staffing levels was not within the scope of the plaintiffs official duties in part because the speech occurred outside the school,after hours,and with ordinary citizens and parents.at.similarly,the court has observed that speech directed at an individual or entity outside of an employee chain of command is often outside of an employee official duties.see,thomas,at protecting speech based upon the employee threat to go outside of his usual chain of command and not merely to his supervisors or to the state housing inspector casey,at protecting speech directed to the new mexico attorney general because the employee had no responsibility to report to that entity regarding potential violations of the open meetings act.
by contrast,speech directed at an individual or entity within a employee chain of command is often found to be pursuant to that employee official duties under.see,casey,at leaving unprotected speech directed at a federal authority due to plaintiff responsibility to independently report to that authority green,at leaving unprotected speech directed at third parties regarding drug testing policies because the plaintiff had the responsibility for communicating with clients and with third parties regarding testing.but an employee decision to go outside of their ordinary chain of command does not necessarily insulate their speech.rather,as noted above,the proper focus is ultimately still whether the speech stemmed from and was of the type that the employee was paid to do,regardless of the exact role of the individual or entity to which the employee has chosen to speak.green,at.
in this case,rohrbough alleges she was retaliated against because of her communications regarding the hospital alleged staffing crisis,the alleged instances of substandard care,and the alleged heart transplant misallocation.rohrbough communications with other hospital employees regarding the alleged staffing crisis,the alleged instances of substandard care,and the alleged heart misallocation all fall squarely within the scope of her official duties under the first prong of the analysis.
the alleged stafing crisis 
rohrbough communications with other hospital employees regarding the alleged staffing crisis were made pursuant to her official duties.her own admissions about why she was concerned about the alleged staffing crisis,as well as other undisputed facts about her job at the hospital,demonstrate this speech was within the scope of her official duties as transplant coordinator in the hospital heart transplant unit.rohrbough admits she had the conversations about the staffing crisis because the staffing crisis affected her ability to do her job and provide appropriate patient care.furthermore,she directed her speech toward other hospital employees such as karin keller,her supervisor,margaret frueh,her manager,and lindenfeld,the director of the transplant unit.
rohrbough correctly points out that a government employee speech regarding staffing,although,may fall outside the employee official duties.see,at concluding that plaintiffs speech regarding staffing levels was not made pursuant to their official duties.the speech protected by,however,occurred after hours in groups including
