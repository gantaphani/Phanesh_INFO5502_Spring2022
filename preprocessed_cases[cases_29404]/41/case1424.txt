brenda mote sued aetna life insurance aetna and the arthur andersen disability plan the plan under the employment retirement income security act erisa,et,alleging that aetna and the plan arbitrarily and capriciously terminated her disability benefit payments and that they should be estopped from terminating her disability benefits because the social security administration found her disabled under its regulations.the district court dismissed mote claims against aetna upon finding that aetna was not a proper party to the action,denied mote motion for summary judgment against the plan,and granted summary judgment to the plan on all of mote claims against it.mote appeals.we affirm.
brenda mote was a human resource generalist with arthur andersen llp until she ceased working on april,due to back pain and physical complications,including fibromyalgia stemming from an august accident.on the day that mote stopped working for arthur andersen,she applied for disability benefits under the plan,which was administered by aetna.the plan states that for purposes of erisa,aetna shall act as the plan fiduciary and be vested with discretionary authority both to determine whether and to what extent employees and beneficiaries are entitled to benefits and construe any disputed or doubtful terms of this policy.specifically,mote applied for disability benefits under the plan own occupation definition of disability.that provision states that an employee is totally disabled if the insured employee is unable d uring the first years of disability to perform the material duties of the employee own occupation.the plan approved mote application,and on july,she began receiving disability benefits.following the plan approval of her application,mote continued to receive medical care for her back pain and fibromyalgia,and the plan periodically reassessed her condition to ensure that she remained eligible for disability benefits.
after mote had been receiving disability benefits for five years,on december,the plan notified her that it recently had reevaluated her claim under its stricter,definition of totally disabled and determined that she no longer qualified for disability benefits.under the plan,while an employee only needs to demonstrate that he is unable to perform the material duties of his own occupation during the first five years of his disability,after five years the employee must demonstrate that he is unable to work at any occupation for which he is,or may reasonably become,fitted by education,training or experience.in its letter to mote,the plan stated that it reached its decision after reviewing the office notes of mote treating physicians,various lumbar mris,ct scans,and surgical procedures,as well as statements by mote physicians regarding her physical limitations and restrictions.the letter also informed mote that the plan had hired an independent investigator who,in january,videotaped her engaging in activities that she stated on her april,claim questionnaire that she was unable to perform.the plan letter further stated that it based its decision on the results of mote november,functional capacity examination and her september,independent medical examination,both of which found that mote was capable of performing sedentary work.the letter also noted that the plan consulting physicians reviewed mote medical information on two recent occasions and reached the same conclusion.
mote requested that the plan review its decision.in support of her request for review,mote submitted additional medical evidence from her treating physicians,including her primary care physician,terry west,and her pain management specialist,james gruft,west opined that mote was suffering from a class physical impairment,which rendered her incapable of minimal sedentary activity.he further noted that,in his opinion,maximum medical improvement has been achieved.i do believe she can ever work again.in a letter dated august,west stated that mote suffers from fibromyalgia and chronic back pain,which remain unchanged,and he concluded that mote is still unable to work at this time,due to limitations of motion and need for sedating pain medication.gruft also opined that mote was incapable of sedentary activity,and that he believed that mote condition had retrogressed.
upon its receipt of mote additional information,the plan informed mote that it referred her file for an independent medical review.the plan retained william hall,to conduct its review.in his september,report,hall stated that he reviewed mote medical history and opined 
i must conclude that the weight of the medical credibility be given to the opinions of mote treating physicians and that,absent medical or personal information regarding mote to the contrary,her subjective musculoskeletal symptoms are of such severity to be totally medically limiting.
however,during his initial review of mote medical records,hall was unaware of the videotaped evidence of mote daily activities that the plan obtained from its independent investigator.the independent investigator recorded the videotapes between january,and february.hall subsequently viewed selected portions of the videotapes,which showed mote running errands,driving an elderly relative to doctors appointments,and loading groceries into her car.upon reviewing the videotape evidence of mote functional abilities,hall changed his opinion regarding mote level of disability,stating 
after viewing surveillance videos of mote activities for the dates and durations noted,i do not agree with assessments of severity or with medically limiting conclusions by mote treating physicians.i am not able to identify an objective or absolute impediment to mote pursuing sustained and otherwise unrestricted activities at a light level of exertion.
in a letter dated september,the plan notified mote that,after a full and fair review of the decision to terminate her claim,it was upholding its decision to terminate her disability benefits the plan letter cited a long list of materials that it reviewed in reaching its decision,and stated that the weight of the medical information does not support a condition of total disability.mote then filed suit against both the plan and aetna,claiming that they improperly terminated her disability benefits.the district court dismissed aetna as an improper party,denied mote for summary judgment,and granted the plan for summary judgment.mote appeals.

on appeal,mote first argues that the plan decision to stop paying her benefits after finding that she did not meet the stricter definition of total disability was arbitrary and capricious.in firestone tire rubber bruch,d,the supreme court held that a denial of benefits challenged under a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.diaz prudential ins.of,cir quoting firestone,at.when,as here,the terms of an employee benefit plan afford the plan administrator broad discretion to interpret the plan and determine benefit eligibility,judicial review of the administrator decision to deny benefits is limited to the standard.davis,at citing sisto ameritech sickness accident disability benefit plan,cir.

in this case,mote first argues that the plan decision was arbitrary and capricious because there was no evidence in the record that her condition improved.mote contends that a finding of improvement is necessary because the plan actually terminated her benefits under the own occupation definition of totally disabled,rather than the,any occupation definition.thus,she reasons that if the plan found that she could not perform her position as a human resource generalist in,and there is no evidence that her chronic back pain or fibromyalgia had improved,then the plan had no basis for terminating her benefits.as discussed above,the totality of the evidence indicates that the plan terminated mote benefits based on the,any occupation definition.see supra,at.because that definition differs significantly from the more lenient own occupation definition,we find that even if mote condition did not improve over the period she was receiving disability benefits,that is not determinative of whether she was totally disabled under the definition.accordingly,we evaluate whether the plan arbitrarily and capriciously evaluated the evidence before it in making its determination that mote was capable of performing some occupation,rather than merely her previous occupation.
mote next asserts that the plan did not properly weigh her treating physicians opinions in reaching its termination decision.mote argument is unavailing,however,because erisa does not require plan administrators to accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians.kobs united.ins,cir citations omitted.further,courts may not impose on plan administrators a discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician evaluation.davis,at quoting black decker disability plan nord,d.we also have recognized that m ost of the time,physicians accept at face value what patients tell them about their symptoms but insurers must consider the possibility that applicants are exaggerating in an effort to win benefits or are sincere hypochondriacs not at serious medical risk.leipzig aig life ins,cir.accordingly,the plan did not act improperly when it looked to,and credited,evidence that conflicted with mote treating physicians opinions as part of its deliberative process in evaluating her claim.
mote further argues that the plan reviewing doctors opinions regarding her condition were unreliable and rendered the plan decision arbitrary and capricious.specifically,mote takes issue with the fact that none of the plan physicians consulted a rheumatologist with specialized expertise in fibromyalgia,nor did the plan contact her treating physicians to discuss her fibromyalgia.as a threshold matter,an erisa plan is not required to hire specialists for every claimed malady in cases in which the plan hired an independent expert to conduct a physical examination of the claimant.in this case,the plan hired an independent expert,orthopedic surgeon richard tuttle,to examine mote.the record indicates tuttle conducted an tender points examination of mote to assess her fibromyalgia,which was the same test that mote own physician,gruft,conducted.while mote seeks to impose a requirement on the plan to consult with her treating physicians,the record reveals that gruft is a pain management specialist and not a rheumatologist,and that lee lichtenberg,who is a rheumatologist,only examined mote once.moreover,nothing in the record indicates that mote primary care physician,west,has any particular expertise in fibromyalgia.in addition to hiring tuttle to examine mote,the plan also relied upon the opinions of william hall,whose specialty is unknown,and paul radford,an occupational medicine specialist.while neither of these consultants is a rheumatologist,the fact remains that mote sought disability benefits on grounds other than fibromyalgia,including chronic back pain,migraine headaches,and irritable bowel syndrome,all of which tuttle,hall and radford are just as qualified to opine about as mote treating physicians.accordingly,we do not find that the plan reliance on the opinions of tuttle,hall and radford,in conjunction with the treating records of mote own physicians,as well as other outside evidence gathered during its deliberative process,rendered its decision either arbitrary or capricious 
next,mote argues that hall and radford opinions are suspect simply because the plan hired them.mote assertion that the plan employees or its consultants had an incentive to deny her claim is without support in the record.as we recognized in leipzig aig life insurance,most insurers are well diversified,so that the decision in any one case has no perceptible effect on the bottom line,and thus t here is correspondingly slight reason to suspect that they will bend the rules,absent suspect circumstances such as an insurer or plan administrator pay ing its staff more for denying claims than for granting them.at citing perlman swiss bank,cir.as we have stated previously,erisa plan administrators have a duty to all beneficiaries and participants to investigate claims and make sure to avoid paying benefits to claimants who are not entitled to receive them.davis,at citations omitted.accordingly,the plan would have been remiss if it did not investigate mote disability claim,and its use of independent experts and medical consultants not only was justified,but consistent with its duty to investigate.
mote also asserts that the plan reliance on the results of her november,functional capacity examination fce was unreasonable.in his report,the fce evaluator concluded that mote is currently capable of working at the sedentary physical demand level within the material handling and positional tolerances set forth in the report,of an eight hour day.despite that conclusion,mote asserts that the fce evaluator opinion was not supported by the evaluation findings regarding her severe pain,and that the plan selected portions of the fce report to justify its termination of her disability benefits.her argument fails,however,because the plan never stated that the fce was the deciding factor in its decision.rather,the plan advised mote that it considered that fce in tandem with tuttle september,independent medial examination.the plan december,letter also advised mote that both examinations revealed that she possessed greater physical capability than that stated in her subjective medical history,and that both examinations supported a conclusion that she could work at a sedentary position for a work day.accordingly,we find that the plan consideration of mote november,fce as one component of its deliberative process did not make its decision to terminate mote disability benefits either arbitrary or capricious.
mote then contends that hall opinion is suspect because he changed his conclusion after viewing the videotape snippets of her daily activities and that the plan consideration of the videotapes during its deliberative process was improper.these argument also are without merit.in shyman unum life insurance,cir,we considered an erisa plan denial of benefits decision,which partially was based on evidence gathered by a private detective that contradicted claimant disability claims.id.at.we did not object to the plan surveillance of the claimant,and we held that the plan denial decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious.see also dougherty indiana bell telephone,cir upholding erisa plan decision to terminate disability benefits after surveillance videotape showed the claimant engaging in normal,everyday activities,such as driving his car and hauling shopping bags.mote attempts to distinguish these cases by arguing that the videotapes in this case do not contain evidence contradictory to her treating physicians diagnoses,and thus the plan could not reasonably have relied upon them in its deliberative process.the evidence in the record,however,rebuts mote argument.for example,gruft opined that mote can not operate a motor vehicle,but the videotape shows mote doing just that.the videotapes also contradict gruft claim on his december,functional capacity worksheet that mote could never climb,crawl,kneel,move repeatedly or stoop,but the surveillance videotape shows her kneeling,moving repeatedly,and stooping.in short,the videotapes show mote engaging in many of the activities that she claimed to be unable to accomplish in her application for disability benefits and,consequently,the plan properly considered them.further,hall was justified in altering his opinion regarding mote ability to work after viewing the videotapes,because mote activities on the videotapes were exactly the type of additional,contrary evidence upon which he conditioned his original opinion when he stated that,absent medical or personal information regarding mote to the contrary,her subjective musculoskeletal symptoms are of such severity as to be totally limiting.finally,the record reflects that the plan relied upon the videotapes merely as one piece of the puzzle in its deliberative process and,while they may have altered the outcome,they were not the sole basis for the plan denial of mote claim.accordingly,we find that the plan use of the videotape evidence of mote physical capacity did not render its decision either arbitrary or capricious 
mote further argues that the plan was estopped from asserting that she was not totally disabled because the social security administration ssa later found mote to be disabled under its standards.mote,however,ignores the fact that the plan definition of totally disabled,and the standard used in other erisa plans,is not the same as the standard used for evaluating disability under the social security act,d a.see nord,at.in determining entitlement to social security benefits,the adjudicator measures the claimant condition against a uniform set of federal criteria.t he validity of a claim to benefits under an erisa plan,on the other hand,is likely to turn,in large part,on the interpretation of terms in the plan at issue.quoting firestone,at.we previously have stated that a court may consider ssa determinations as relevant,and an ssa decision could be binding if an erisa plan specifically includes ssa disability as a condition of plan disability.reich ladish,cir.the plan,however,did not include any provisions regarding ssa decisions in its policy.further,even if the ssa decision could have had some bearing on the plan decision,the plan was unable to consider it because the ssa did not award benefits to mote until may,eight months after the plan issued its decision.see tegtmeier,at while social security decisions,if available,are instructive,these determinations are not dispositive emphasis added.accordingly,the plan was not estopped from independently interpreting the terms of its policy merely because the ssa found mote to be disabled pursuant to its standards months after the plan issued its final decision to terminate mote disability benefits.
finally,mote contends that the district court erred by dismissing her claims against aetna upon its finding that aetna was not a proper party to the action.she asserts that she should be able to sue both her employer erisa plan,the plan and the plan administrator,aetna.generally,in a suit for erisa benefits,the plaintiff is limited to a suit against the plan.blickenstaff donnelley sons.short term disability plan,cir.while we have allowed plaintiffs in erisa cases to sue an erisa plan administrator in some limited instances,the operative facts of those cases differ from those in this case.for instance,in riordan commonwealth edison,cir,we permitted a plaintiff to sue the plan administrator to recover erisa benefits because the employer failed to raise the issue in the district court and the plan documents referred to the employer and the plan interchangeably.neither of those pivotal facts is present here.similarly,in mein carus,cir,we allowed a plaintiff to sue his employer to recover erisa benefits because the employer and the plan were closely intertwined.id.at.we are not faced with that situation in this case,since aetna was not mote employer and the plan policy distinguishes between the plan,the employer,and aetna.we thus find that the district court did not err in dismissing aetna from the suit because it was not a proper party to the action.
the district court properly entered summary judgment for the plan and denied mote motion for summary judgment because the plan decision to terminate mote disability benefits was neither arbitrary nor capricious,and because the plan was not estopped from terminating mote benefits based upon the social security administration subsequent finding that mote was disabled under its regulations.the district court also properly dismissed mote claims against aetna because aetna was not a proper party to the action.accordingly,the district court judgment is affirmed.
in cases like this one,the court of appeals is usually de facto the last stop on the road for the litigants.it is thus critical that we get the facts right,even if we agree on the governing legal standards.here,although i agree with the majority assessment of the claims against aetna,the administrator of the plan at issue,i must part ways with its evaluation of brenda mote claims against the disability plan the plan.according to mote treating physicians and other specialists,since at least she has suffered from fibromyalgia,migraines,a sleep disorder,depression,and pain throughout her body.from to,she received benefits from the disability plan sponsored by her former employer,arthur andersen.in,mote disability benefits were terminated because the length of mote disability triggered a shift in the applicable standard for disability,from the earlier one in which she needed to show that she could not perform her own job,to the more stringent one in which she needed to show that she could not perform any work at all.mote appealed the decision,but the plan affirmed itself.mote then filed this suit in federal court,alleging that the plan decision to terminate her benefits was arbitrary and capricious.
although arbitrary and capricious review ties our hands considerably,it is not a rubber stamp.hackett xerox.disability income plan,cir.we have held that a benefits plan governed by erisa must weigh the evidence for and against a benefits determination,and within reasonable limits,the reasons for rejecting evidence must be articulated.halpin grainger,cir internal quotation marks omitted.further,erisa requires that specific reasons for denial be communicated to the claimant and that the claimant be afforded an opportunity for full and fair review by the administrator.id.at.
i see two significant problems in the plan consideration of mote appeal,either one of which would require reversal even under arbitrary and capricious review.first,in denying mote appeal on september,the plan made the following statement reported pain also can not be relied upon as a sufficient indicator of functional impairment since perception of pain may be affected by individual tolerance,motivation or psychological factors.perhaps if this plan had language in it to that effect,that conclusion might be acceptable.but most plans do not,and this one is no exception.to the contrary,section vii,which includes the governing definitions for the plan,says only that total disabled means 
that solely because of an illness,pregnancy or accidental bodily injury,an insured employee is unable d uring the first years of disability to perform the material duties of the employee own occupation and f rom then on,to work at any occupation for which such employee is,or may reasonably become,fitted by education,training or experience.the availability of employment will not be considered in the assessment of the employee disability.
plan,sec.vii.in other words,the plan takes a functional approach to disability.it does not forbid an employee from showing functional incapacity through symptoms.the ability to interpret can not mean the ability to add entirely new language to plans.in my view,mote case is indistinguishable from another erisa case involving fibromyalgia,in which we held that subjective reports of pain can suffice to show one complete disability.hawkins first union.disability plan,cir.the plan therefore made an error of law,or behaved arbitrarily and capriciously,in its analysis.although it was entitled to credit evidence other than mote own reports of pain,it can not begin with the premise that reported pain can never be enough 
the supreme court decision in black decker disability plan nord warns that plan administrators,of course,may not arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant reliable evidence,including the opinions of a treating physician,even though the administrators have no obligation to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant physician,d.in this case,even if there were some language in the plan on which the administrators could hang their conclusion that subjective evidence is never enough to support an award of benefits,the plan still failed to articulate its reasons for rejecting evidence,which is necessary if there is to be meaningful appellate review.halpin,at.it may be that even under the correct standards,a weighing of all the evidence would lead once again to a rejection of her claim.nonetheless,mote is entitled to have the decision,whatever it is,reached through the use of a fair process.the record makes clear that this did not happen.
second,although surveillance evidence can be used to undermine the credibility of a doctor medical opinions where the diagnosis is based substantially on patient reports,whether it was used properly here depends on how it was used and for what purpose.the record indicates that the plan medical reviewer,hall,did not receive all of the surveillance information about mote,which was gathered over days and days of observation.instead,as the majority concedes,he received only a compilation of two hours of footage.after reviewing this material and looking at no other new evidence,hall withdrew his earlier conclusion that mote was totally disabled from working in any occupation.the fact that the tapes themselves are not in the record does not somehow make hall conclusion reliable.no one disputes that he never saw the vast majority of the evidence that was collected.one might just as well view a snippet of mote sitting on a sofa,and conclude that this was all she ever did.hall opinion was based on inherently unreliable evidence and thus should not have been entitled to any weight.
properly used,surveillance evidence can provide a basis for choosing between contradictory medical evidence by rendering some of that evidence less credible.this court has noted that w e can imagine an argument that even if the activity disclosed does not indicate a capacity to engage in work,the fact that it is discrepant with the level of activity described by the treating physician,presumably on the basis of representations made to him by the plaintiff,fatally undermines the plaintiff credibility.hawkins,at.here,the plan contends that the surveillance evidence was used to discredit the treating physicians statements and not as an independent basis for terminating mote benefits,but the record belies this assertion.
mote may well have concluded that there was no need to supplement the record before this court by furnishing all of the surveillance tapes,because even the evidence that hall viewed was generally consistent with the records from mote treating physicians.one problem with the way in which the plan used the surveillance evidence is the fact that it made assumptions that find no support in the record.thus,for example,in its denial of mote appeal,it described the activities viewed in surveillance as mote daily living activities,even though the record contains no evidence that these activities were daily or even regular.as i have already noted,the record contains only the,videotape that,in essence,constitutes a highlight reel of mote most active moments during several days of surveillance.there would have been no need to plant cameras inside mote home in order to collect evidence that fairly reflected her ordinary activities a fair look at the days worth of footage actually obtained would have sufficed.
most troubling to me is that when the activities observed by surveillance are put in context,their utility in assessing mote level of disability appears flimsy at best.mote medical records state that mote overdoes it.others aware of her overdoing it and depend on it.patient aware of need for changes.we have recognized in the past that some disabled people manage to keep going only through superhuman efforts in those circumstances their activities do not negate the fact that they are disabled.see perlman swiss bank.comprehensive disability protection plan,cir.in,gruft noted that mote had a goal of setting boundaries with her mother who is also disabled and setting limits with others generally.the only days where mote was observed undertaking any significant activity were the days she drove her mother to and from her mother doctor appointments once in july and once two years later in january.her activities that day included eating at a restaurant with her mother,where she sat for one hour,and standing up for two minutes after approximately minutes of sitting.the other day of surveillance came on a day where mote was required by the plan to undergo a functional capacity evaluation.she drove minutes each way to that appointment.although these contextual details are in the surveillance notes,there is no indication that hall had access to the written notes or that they were incorporated into the video that he watched.notably,mote cancelled the second day of her evaluation because she was in pain.although one of mote treating physicians noted in her medical records that mote could not operate a motor vehicle,this observation accompanied a new prescription for a sedative.it is entirely possible that the doctor meant to warn against operation of a motor vehicle while taking the drug,rather than to describe mote ability to drive.the tape showing mote picking up her mail and newspapers at the end of her driveway included observations that she limped to the end of the driveway,that the limp significantly worsened on the walk back to the house,and that mote struggled twice with the newspaper,and so i am unable to see how this helps the plan arguments at all.
other courts have concluded that segments of surveillance showing light physical activities by a plaintiff do not amount to a showing that she is able to manage employment.see osbun auburn foundry,d,surveillance evidence that the plaintiff can perform light physical tasks for hours over two days falls far short of demonstrating that he is capable of sustaining a job.the defendant produced no evidence showing how long the plaintiff can perform such tasks,whether he can perform them on a daily basis,or how much pain he must endure in the process.crespo unum life ins.of,d,finding,in a claim of disability due to fibromyalgia,that the defendant comparison between the plaintiff daily activities and the requirements of a job is misplaced,as t here is no evidence anywhere in the record that the plaintiff undertakes these activities including tak
