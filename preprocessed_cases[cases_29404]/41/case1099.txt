plaintiffs shara jenkins jenkins and brenda mulkey mulkey filed this consolidated appeal challenging the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants lloyd evans evans and the rock hill school board school board on their first amendment retaliation and privacy claims.in analyzing the retaliation claims,the district court incorrectly limited constitutionally protected activities to matters of public concern.however,because the district court reached the correct decision on all claims except jenkins retaliation claim against evans,we reverse the district court decision on that claim and affirm its decision on all others.
relevant facts and procedural history 
jenkins and her daughter,shanell 
this case stems from a dispute between jenkins and school officials over the treatment of jenkins daughter,shanell.shanell was enrolled in first grade at rock hill elementary school rock hill in march.that month,shanell was diagnosed with diabetes,and jenkins made arrangements with the school nurse,marsha wagner wagner,for wagner and other school personnel to assist shanell with her diabetes treatment.
there were no problems until shanell started second grade in the school year.jenkins again arranged with wagner for school personnel to assist shanell.however,there was an apparent misunderstanding between jenkins and wagner over whether wagner would administer an insulin shot if she received proper written authorization from jenkins and shanell doctor.this confusion led jenkins to believe rock hill was being uncooperative in caring for shanell.
because rock hill would not administer insulin shots,jenkins contacted evans,the school superintendent,on october.in her affidavit,jenkins alleges evans told her the school was not responsible for shanell medical care and suggested she enroll shanell in a different school.jenkins then contacted the school board on november and the ohio coalition for children with disabilities on november.
the following day,november,jenkins alleges evans called her and told her shanell could not come back to school.this prompted jenkins to contact the department of education office of civil rights,the ohio department of education,a county commissioner,and members of the school board.
after shanell missed over a week of classes,evans relented and allowed shanell to return to school on december.the next day,jenkins claims school personnel barred her from going to shanell classroom,while other freely walked through the building as jenkins normally did.defendants respond that jenkins was stopped at the front office because she was required to comply with the general policy of signing in before seeing her daughter during school hours.jenkins claims that when she confronted evans about this incident and the school role in caring for shanell,evans threatened to involve the lawrence county department of job and family services children services in the matter.jenkins,he allegedly explained,you contacted the office of civil rights and got an investigation started,so i figured i start one of my own.
the next week,on december,the ironton tribune newspaper printed a letter to the editor written by jenkins 
i have a year old daughter who is diabetic and has attended rock hill school for three years.i received a phone call from the superintendent and was told i could bring my daughter back to school.i was told she was enrolled there anymore.
the school took it upon themselves to withdraw her without my permission and said that i was the one who withdrew her.we tried going to the school and got escorted out by a teacher.i made contacts with the state and got her back in school after she missed seven days.
now,we are being treated differently,just because i fighting for my daughter rights.there only one teacher in the school willing to take responsibility for my daughter health issues.this goes to show you how much teachers care about your children.
she also filed a complaint with the department of education,which the agency received on december.
on december,a call was placed from the rock hill principal office to children services.in that call,wagner provided information about jenkins and shanell.children services filed a court complaint against jenkins in january,but the charges were dropped as unsubstantiated in may.
when jenkins accused evans of calling children services,she contends that he responded,i told you i was going to involve children services i do like to be pushed around.i do take that too lightly.when she told evans their disputes would have to be settled in court,he suggested she would be wasting her time.i have a lot more pull than you do,and there no attorney gon na stand up to me,because they know they ca win,she recounts him saying.
also in january,shanell doctor recommended she be,and shanell stopped attending school.rock hill initially provided a tutor but that person stopped tutoring shanell for reasons unknown to her mother.jenkins repeatedly requested evans provide a tutor for shanell but evans allegedly said he could not find anyone willing to tutor her.without a tutor,shanell did not receive her education the last three months of the school year.the next school year,she transferred to another school district.
mulkey and her son,charles 
mulkey enrolled her son charles in rock hill in january.charles had diabetes,so school nurse wagner checked his blood sugar regularly.mulkey received frequent calls from wagner telling her to pick charles up from school because his blood sugar was high or he was not feeling well.mulkey felt that some of those calls were unnecessary.she complained about the calls to wagner.she then brought her concerns to evans,who disagreed with her concerns.evans also suggested the possibility of,which mulkey declined because charles doctor recommended he attend school with other kids.
on march,charles was sick so wagner tried to contact mulkey,but mulkey phone was disconnected.in addition,wagner was running low on medical supplies that mulkey was supposed to supply for charles.wagner,after consulting with the school principal,called children services to report possible child neglect.a children services investigator interviewed her,causing her no expense or hardship,and then closed the case.
two weeks after the children services call,on april,mulkey moved to her father property in another school district and enrolled charles in that district.
ii.standard of review 
the court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.bender hecht dep t stores,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.the court must construe the facts and draw all inferences in favor of the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
iii.discussion 
plaintiffs brought their claims for violations of the first amendment to the united states constitution pursuant to,which allows a plaintiff to vindicate the deprivation of constitutional rights by a defendant acting under color of law.harbin bey rutter,cir.
retaliation 
plaintiffs allege they were retaliated against in violation of the first amendment.there are three elements to a retaliation claim 
the plaintiff was engaged in a constitutionally protected activity 
the defendant adverse action caused the plaintiff to suffer an injury that would likely chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that activity and 
the adverse action was motivated at least in part as a response to the exercise of the plaintiff constitutional rights.
bloch ribar,cir.if the plaintiff meets this burden,the burden of production shifts to the defendant,thaddeus x blatter,cir en banc,but if the defendant can show he would have taken the same action in the absence of the protected activity,he is entitled to summary judgment.id.
in granting summary judgment to defendants,the district court incorrectly held that jenkins and mulkey speech was not constitutionally protected because it did not touch upon a matter of public concern.the public concern test originated in pickering board of education,d and connick myers,d,in which the supreme court held the first amendment protects from retaliation government employees who speak on matters of public concern at.following its rationale in pickering,the court in connick sought to balance the interests of government employees,as citizens,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.id.at.citing pickering,at.to achieve this balance,the court held the speech of government employees is constitutionally protected if it touches upon a matter of public concern.connick was expressly limited to government employees and based solely on the need to balance the free speech rights of government employees with the government needs as an employer.see id.at.thaddeus,at the story of the public concern limitation is a story about the free speech of public employees.
the supreme court has used the public concern test in situations analogous to public employment,where free speech rights must be balanced against the need to effectively manage a governmental entity.see.secondary sch.ath.ass brentwood,d coaches voluntarily participating in an athletic league bd.of county comm rs umbehr,d government contractors.courts have made other similar extensions of the public concern test.blackburn city of marshall,cir describing cases involving doctors suing public hospitals over staff privileges and licensees suing government agencies,but declining to use public concern test in context of towing company owner who sued police official.
beyond those limited extensions,applying the public concern test outside the public employment setting would require us to rend it from its animating rationale and original context.van deelen,at see also eichenlaub twp.of indiana,cir to expand this public concern limitation into the broader context of all citizen speech would wrench it from its original rationale and curtail a significant body of free expression that has traditionally been fully protected under the first amendment.campagna.dep t of envtl,cir friedl city of new york,cir vickery jones,cir united states reyes,cir.
this circuit has likewise recognized the limited nature of the public concern test,in a case that we find dispositive here.gable lewis,cir.in gable,the plaintiff alleged a police officer retaliated against her in violation of her first amendment right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.at.the plaintiff won a jury trial,and the defendant appealed,arguing among other issues that the public concern test should have applied.the sixth circuit rejected the defendant argument,holding that the public concern test is not applicable to petitioning activity outside the public employee context.id.at the court noted that connick created the public concern test because government agencies need the ability to maintain order in their workplaces,which was inapplicable to the situation of a private individual petitioning the government for the redress of grievances.id.likewise,the reason does not apply in the context of parents criticizing school officials.in addition,the court noted that the petition clause itself is not generally limited to matters of public concern as described in the connick case but includes the petitioner private business interests.id.likewise,the supreme court has held that private speech is protected just like speech on public matters.united mine workers illinois state bar ass n,d see also capitol square review advisory bd.pinette,d.
it is logical to extend gable holding from petitioning to all speech because those rights are inseparable.mcdonald smith,d the right to petition was inspired by the same ideals of liberty and democracy that gave us the freedoms to speak,publish,and assemble these first amendment rights are inseparable.thomas collins.it was not by accident or coincidence that the rights to freedom in speech and press were coupled in a single guaranty with the rights of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition for redress of grievances.all these,though not identical,are inseparable.
defendants cite four cases,all from outside this circuit,for their argument the public concern test applies when parents of school children criticize school officials.three of those cases are district court decisions that adopt,without analysis or explanation,the public concern test for parents criticizing school officials.the fourth case is landstrom illinois department of children family services,cir,in which the seventh circuit did not discuss the issue but,instead,merely stated it agreed with the lower court analysis.the lower court had relied on pickering and connick to guide its opinion as to what constitutes an exercise of first amendment rights,and determined parental criticism of school officials must touch upon a public concern to constitute the exercise of first amendment rights.landstrom illinois dep t of children family services.however,as noted above,pickering and connick concern the exercise of first amendment rights only by public employees.because public employees lack free speech rights in the context of their employment,those cases ensure public employees can speak on matters of public concern.it seems apparent to us that the district court in landstrom fell into the same error as the district court in this case.we respectfully decline to follow the seventh circuit mistaken analysis.
nevertheless,defendants argue the public concern test is necessary to prevent frequent disputes between parents and school officials from becoming first amendment lawsuits.but that purpose is served by the other two elements of a first amendment retaliation claim.the element at issue here,constitutionally protected activity,can not be so limited.essentially,defendants contention is that parental speech about school officials is not constitutionally protected if the speech is not about matters of public concern.such a contention is clearly wrong.speech is generally protected by the first amendment,with restrictions on only limited types of speech,such as obscenity,defamation,and fighting words,paul,d,none of which is applicable here.defendants have not pointed to any case from the supreme court or this court that parents criticizing school officials is when the speech is not about matters of public concern.rather,the right to criticize public officials is clearly protected by the first amendment.bloch,at citing glasson city of louisville,cir the right of an american citizen to criticize public officials and policies and to advocate peacefully ideas for change is the central meaning of the first amendment.
had the district court applied the proper definition of constitutionally protected activity,the court would have recognized both jenkins and mulkey satisfy the first element of a prima facie first amendment retaliation claim.jenkins complained to evans,wrote a letter to a newspaper,and contacted government officials and agencies all these activities are constitutionally protected speech.mulkey complained to wagner and evans,which is also constitutionally protected speech 
in jenkins case,the district court did not reach the remaining two elements of a prima facie case,but it is nevertheless evident she satisfies them.as to the second element,a jury could conclude evans alleged actions,dismissing shanell from school,being involved in making a false report to children services,and refusing to provide education through the services of a tutor,would chill a person of ordinary firmness from engaging in speech.jenkins also satisfies the third element because evans allegedly admitted that jenkins complaints prompted him to be involved in reporting her to children services.see.c nothing that on a motion for summary judgment,we view all facts in favor of jenkins.therefore,the district court erred in granting summary judgment to evans on jenkins retaliation claim.
in mulkey case,the district court noted there is no evidence of any retaliation in this case.mulkey did not challenge this determination on appeal,and ther
