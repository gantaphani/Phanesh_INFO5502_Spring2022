after oklahoma state authorities revoked jeffrey lewis license to practice chiropractic medicine,they suspected him of continuing his practice unlawfully.in short order,they swore out an administrative subpoena and searched his office to confirm their suspicions.believing that the search was carried out in violation of his fourth amendment rights,lewis sued.he named as a defendant,among others,ronald tripp,the president of the oklahoma board of chiropractic examiners.at summary judgment,the district court denied tripp claim of qualified immunity,but it did not set forth with specificity the facts supporting its conclusion that tripp violated lewis fourth amendment rights.in these circumstances,our precedent instructs us to review the entire record and determine de novo whether the plaintiff in fact presented sufficient evidence to forestall summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity.armijo wagon mound pub,cir.doing just that,we see no evidence in this record to suggest that tripp was personally involved in the fourth amendment violation lewis alleges.accordingly,we hold that tripp is entitled to qualified immunity.
lewis started practicing chiropractic medicine in norman,oklahoma in,and for almost ten years ran his own business,west norman chiropractic.in march,however,the oklahoma state board of chiropractic examiners revoked lewis medical license,apparently due to untrue statements lewis made in his license application.the board stayed the revocation for one month to allow lewis time to find a replacement to take over his practice.during this period,lewis hired ben sanders,who began treating lewis patients on may.
two weeks later,the board executive director,beth carter,received an anonymous tip that lewis was still practicing medicine,though now without a license.to work out what the board response should be,carter consulted the board legal counsel and the board president,tripp.later that same day,carter swore out an administrative subpoena requiring lewis to turn over a ll medical records,claims,documents forms which indicate name s of patient s from march,to present.at.
carter,accompanied by her assistant,joseph english,and two sheriff deputies,then went to west norman chiropractic to serve the subpoena on lewis.when they arrived,lewis was out of the office,so carter gave the subpoena to an employee.a receptionist then handed over patient treatment cards she had at the front desk.according to lewis,though hotly disputed by tripp,someone also took records from inside lewis personal desk.carter next told various employees,as well as several patients sitting in the waiting room,that the clinic had to close.the clinic remained closed for one week,later reopening under sanders supervision,though the seized patient records were returned until approximately two months later.meanwhile,lewis repeated requests for reinstatement of his license have failed.
upset with the search of his office,lewis responded with this lawsuit,contending that the search violated the fourth amendment of the united states constitution.lewis named as defendants the board,the individual board members,carter,and english.after motions practice,however,all that remains for resolution at this point are lewis claims against tripp.at summary judgment before the district court,tripp argued that he was entitled to qualified immunity.the district court rejected that defense,and tripp now seeks to appeal that ruling to us 
tripp argues that the district court erred in denying him qualified immunity because there are no facts in the record from which a reasonable jury could find that he participated in any of the allegedly unlawful conduct that lewis complains of.for his part,lewis disputes all this,arguing to us that the facts are sufficient to suggest tripp was personally involved.before we can address the parties factual dispute,however,we must first confront a preliminary question concerning our authority to do so.
t o shield them from undue interference with their duties to the public and from potentially disabling threats of liability,public servants,including tripp,are entitled to qualified immunity.harlow fitzgerald.qualified immunity is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability.mitchell forsyth,emphasis omitted.it represents the norm for public officials,harlow,at,and serves to insulate from suit all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law,malley briggs.a plaintiff may overcome a public official qualified immunity only by showing,first,that the official violated the plaintiff federal statutory or constitutional rights,and,second,that the rights in question were clearly established at the time of their alleged violation.pearson callahan.
despite all this,in johnson jones the supreme court indicated that,at the summary judgment stage at least,it is generally the district court exclusive job to determine which facts a jury could reasonably find from the evidence presented to it by the litigants.after doing so,the district court and we may then consider the abstract legal questions whether those facts suffice to show a violation of law and whether that law was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.id.at.ordinarily speaking,it is only these latter two not questions about what facts a jury might reasonably we may consider in appeals from the denial of qualified immunity at summary judgment.of course,determining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact at summary judgment is itself a question of law,ashcroft iqbal,one we routinely review de novo in appeals from the grant of summary judgment.still,johnson held that this practice does normally pertain to appeals from the denial of qualified immunity.see at.so,for example,if a district court concludes that a reasonable jury could find certain specified facts in favor of the plaintiff,the supreme court has indicated we usually must take them as do so even if our own de novo review of the record might suggest otherwise as a matter of law.
johnson rule might appear,at first glance,to foreclose at least a good portion of tripp appeal.after all,his primary complaint seems to be that the district court erred when it found sufficient facts in the record from which a jury could infer his involvement in the allegedly illegal search.but that is the end of the matter,because johnson rule has attracted exceptions that we must also consider.without attempting an exhaustive list of those exceptions,the supreme court has drawn our attention to at least three.
first,the court has indicated that,when the district court at summary judgment fails to identify the particular charged conduct that it deemed adequately supported by the record,we may look behind the order denying summary judgment and review the entire record de novo to determine for ourselves as a matter of law which factual inferences a reasonable jury could and could not make.see behrens pelletier,see also johnson,at if a district court does not state the facts a reasonable jury could find at summary judgment,a court of appeals may have to undertake a cumbersome review of the record to determine those facts.second,when the version of events the district court holds a reasonable jury could credit is blatantly contradicted by the record,we may assess the case based on our own de novo view of which facts a reasonable jury could accept as true.scott harris.third,we need not defer to the district court assessment of the reasonable factual inferences that arise from a complaint at the motion to dismiss stage,but may instead assess for ourselves the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter of law de novo.iqbal.at 
this case falls within the first of these exceptions.the initial obligation of the district court in assessing a qualified immunity defense at summary judgment is to set forth with specificity the who,what,when,where,and a reasonable jury could infer from the evidence presented by the parties.see armijo,at the district court must set forth with specificity the facts that support a finding that the defendant violated a clearly established right see also behrens,at johnson,at.only then can the district court and we,on appeal undertake the job of answering the question whether the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity on those facts as a matter of law.put differently,unless the district court undertakes the essential task of specifying what a reasonable jury could find the facts to be,there is no way it or,later,we can rationally determine whether those facts constitute a violation of clearly established law.
in this case,the district court failed to set forth the facts it believed a reasonable jury could find with respect to the critical question before nature of tripp involvement,if any,in an unlawful search and seizure.instead,the court merely stated that tripp phoned the board office on may and sent two emails to the board legal counsel.the court then immediately and summarily concluded that 
t his and other unspecified evidence proffered by the plaintiff creates a jury question as to whether tripp personally directed,or had actual knowledge of and acquiesced in,the asserted but unspecified constitutional violation.see poolaw marcantel,wl,at cir for liability under section,direct participation is not necessary.any official who causes a citizen to be deprived of her constitutional rights can also be held liable.the requisite causal connection is satisfied if the defendant set in motion a series of events that the defendant knew or reasonably should have known would cause others to deprive the plaintiff of her constitutional rights.internal quotation omitted.
the problem with this discussion is that it does tell us what tripp did or where,when,or why he took any action that might have violated lewis fourth amendment rights.in other words,it does not set forth with specificity the facts that support a finding that the defendant violated a clearly established right.armijo,at.instead,the opinion merely advances the legal conclusion that tripp did so,paraphrasing the legal standard for supervisory liability under we set forth in poolaw and then holding the standard satisfied.such a conclusory legal ruling does not constitute findings of fact to which we can defer.armijo,at 
according to the district court,a reasonable jury could conclude that tripp personally directed,or had actual knowledge of and acquiesced in,some constitutional violation.op.at.but the court offered no indication what that constitutional violation was,and thus what tripp allegedly did.could a reasonable jury find that tripp did offer his staff sufficient training in administrative subpoena work that he told carter to an administrative subpoena or to rifle through lewis papers or to close lewis practice some or all of these things or something else still we do know because the district court never told us.it goes without saying that different facts demand different legal analyses and call for different outcomes.and we can not discharge our duty to say whether or not tripp violated lewis clearly established constitutional rights without first knowing,as a factual matter,what a reasonable jury could find he did.
that said,we scarcely have the district court to blame for the paucity of facts.the reason the district court could tell us anything about the asserted constitutional violation is that the plaintiff,lewis,never described it in his complaint.instead,lewis just presented his own conclusory legal allegation that all of the defendants unlawful conduct violates plaintiff rights to be free from warrantless seizures as guaranteed by the fourth amendment.at.lewis thus left the precise contours of that unlawful conduct to the court imagination.perhaps recognizing this infirmity,he did offer one version of the facts in his opposition to summary judgment in the district court,suggesting that the board including tripp facilitated carter conduct by fail ing to fulfill state statutory requirements to promulgate administrative rules governing internal procedures,direct the executive director,provide training,and timely hire an investigator.objection to motion for summary judgment.at.but that does clear up the confusion because in his appellate briefing lewis has now suggested a different version of the tripp directed carter by telephone and email to prepare a subpoena and to not only seize clinic and financial records,but to close the business and run off the staff.answer br.at.given lewis own indecision about the wrongs he allegedly suffered at tripp behest,it little wonder that the district court found that s ome ambiguity exist ed as to the exact nature of the underlying constitutional violation alleged by lewis.op.at,and did not make specific factual findings about tripp conduct.
given that we lack from the district court a set of facts about tripp conduct to guide our qualified immunity analysis,it falls on us to review the entire record,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to lewis as the plaintiff,and to ask de novo whether sufficient evidence exists for a reasonable jury to conclude that tripp trenched upon lewis clearly established rights.armijo,at when the district court fails to specify the facts in play,the court of appeals must review the entire record,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff to determine de novo whether the plaintiff in fact presented sufficient evidence to forestall summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity see also behrens,at johnson,at.and it is here that we again pick up the parties merits arguments about the content and significance of the record evidence.
viewing the record before us in the light most favorable to lewis,a reasonable jury could find the following facts about tripp alleged involvement in the search and seizure.tripp was the board president,and carter,as the board executive director,worked for him.on the same day that carter went to lewis office to serve the subpoena,tripp copied carter on two emails he sent to the board legal counsel.at.according to carter deposition,these emails concerned lewis unlicensed medical practice and indicated that tripp had spoken with the city attorney office and the police department.id.at.one of the emails contained legal citations,though carter may have received that email after the incident at lewis office.id.at.at according to lewis,tripp also called the board office sometime that same day,though carter did remember the phone call or its contents.at.
these facts readily lend themselves to the inference that tripp suspected lewis of practicing medicine without a license.they also fairly suggest that tripp wanted to report lewis activities to other state authorities who could obtain and execute a search of and perhaps close his practice.but there nothing illegal,let alone clearly illegal,about any of this.indeed,it would seem perfectly normal that the president of a state medical society would wish to report the unauthorized practice of medicine and see it investigated.as it happens,oklahoma law expressly authoriz es and empower s the board to adopt and seek to enforce professional standards and accreditation requirements.see.stat.tit.b to avoid summary judgment,there has to be record evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer something more than this.it not enough that tripp,acting pursuant to his statutory authority,set in motion a series of events that would naturally lead to the lawful execution of a search warrant or the lawful closure of lewis practice.under poolaw,a reasonable jury must be able to conclude that tripp deliberately set into motion a series of events he knew or should known would lead to unlawful action against lewis.
recognizing this obstacle,lewis replies,as best we can tell,that his clearly established fourth amendment rights were violated in two ways.first,he suggests,the administrative subpoena itself was invalid,so carter collection of his records,including from his desk,was actually a warrantless seizure.as he reads oklahoma law,the board only has the authority to subpoena papers for the investigation of matters that may come before it.stat.tit.b,and once lewis had his license revoked,his unlicensed practice of medicine no longer qualified as a matter before the board.on this view,then,the board had
