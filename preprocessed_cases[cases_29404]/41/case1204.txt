at issue in this action is whether the district court properly denied qualified immunity to michigan corrections officers on duty at various points during the isolation,dehydration and eventual death of inmate jeffrey clark.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the representative of clark estate,we affirm the denial of qualified immunity as to of the employees and reverse it as to of them andy dyer,kristine wakefield,rina becher and joann friedt.
according to version of this lamentable episode,here is what happened during the last six days of the bellamy creek correctional facility custody over jeffrey clark.
june.on saturday,june,the prison,located in ionia,michigan,was on heat alert,a warning that applies whenever outdoor temperatures exceed degrees and a warning that applied to the prison from june to july.op.at,ja.at roughly that day,clark collapsed outside while waiting in line to enter the mess hall.two prison officials,captain andy dyer and lieutenant don wise,attended to him,laying him down under the shade of a tree.sergeant kristine wakefield,who also came to clark assistance,observed that h e was crying.he said stuff about his dad,he said stuff about dying.he did make sense,really.he was not connecting a lot of it.ja.she did not perceive any physical problems with clark but thought he had some mental problems.ja.using a wheelchair,wakefield and dyer transported clark to an observation cell.
as its name suggests,an observation cell gives officers an opportunity to observe a prisoner more closely than would be possible if the prisoner were in the general prison population.two observation cells were located near the pod,the control center at the junction of two residence wings in the bellamy prison.each of the observation cells has a small window and two slots through which officers may pass food to the inmate and if appropriate cuff the inmate hands or feet.on the way to meals or exercise,prisoners in the general population pass by the observation cells.
when the officers placed clark in one of the observation cells on june,wakefield observed that he start ed barking like a dog,screaming at the top of his lungs.ja.dyer told sergeant tom lauters,the officer in charge of the unit,that clark need ed to be behavior was real erratic and he needed to be referred for psychological services.ja.some officers on the housing unit,however,told wakefield that they thought clark was faking.ja.
that same day,lauters filled out a psychiatric referral form,called a which stands for reasoning,orientation,behavior,emotions,talk,appearance and relationships,noting that clark had suffered a seizure.ja.when lauters and other officers attempted to move clark to his regular cell later that day,clark stiffened up and his legs just gave out,ja,and when they arrived at his regular cell lauters noticed clark packed duffel bag,from which he inferred that clark had planned to leave his cell and was a manipulator,ja.based on these observations,lauters returned clark to the observation cell.so far as the record shows,this was the last time the door to clark cell was opened while he was alive the officers handled all other contact with him through the slots in his cell door.
june.when officer bruce stout arrived at work at on sunday morning,he found the water to clark cell turned off.sergeant mike harvey,the supervisor of the unit during this shift,telephoned joann friedt,a registered nurse,telling her that prisoner clark was barking and would not talk or respond to me.ja.in response,friedt said that she was aware of it and that she put the form in for psych to with him.ja.
at,during lauters shift,clark was w alking back and forth,barking and yelling.ja.despite this odd behavior,lauters did not determine whether clark was receiving psychiatric care i knew that healthcare was contacted.i left it at that.ja.at,during the night shift,the log book revealed that clark was still beating on the door and yelling.ja.at some point that weekend,inmate andre williams heard clark asking for water.
july.on monday,at,officer anthony vandervlucht noted that clark is acting very strange,talking and yelling at himself.ja.when harvey arrived at,vandervlucht told him that clark was not drinking.by the end of vandervlucht shift at,he had not seen clark sleep.
during harvey morning shift,psychologist mark fox observed clark and noted that he was acting somewhat strangely and that it was kind of difficult to carry on a conversation with him.ja.fox diagnosed clark with psychosis.ja.as fox was leaving,clark asked him if he could turn the water on.fox says he asked harvey to do so but,according to harvey,fox said clark was acting out to try to manipulate his way to a transfer.ja.officer ginger bayne recalled that it was fox who ordered the water turned off.later that day,bayne observed clark drinking from his toilet,an observation she shared with harvey.she acknowledged that clark needed mental health attention but did nothing because that is what the was for.ja.she also noted that the water had been turned off during this shift.
at,during lauters shift,clark threw his food tray on the floor and wall.ja.lauters claims that clark water was never turned off during his shift.when officer brian foreback and lieutenant shirley whittaker relieved lauters later that night,however,foreback observed that the water to clark cell was turned off.foreback could not remember whether the water was ever turned back on during his shift.that night,rina becher,a relief sergeant who was filling in for another sergeant,observed clark pacing back and forth naked and telling me he was selling candy canes.ja.she believed that clark needed to see someone presumably a psychologist or a psychiatrist but was satisfied when she learned that a had been filled out.
july.on tuesday,stout arrived at,relieving whittaker,and again found the water in clark cell turned off.roughly two hours into the shift,harvey instructed stout to turn on the water.another officer observed clark urinating in the corner of the cell the urine ran under the door,leading to complain about the sticky floor.ja.
later that day,tim nelson,unit chief of the outpatient mental health unit,sent deputy warden lee gilman an stating that it is my clinical opinion that prisoner clark is psychotic and should have been or should be referred for intense psychiatric treatment h is current level of functioning requires intense interventions.ja.the record does not reveal any response by gilman to this.that afternoon,lauters,who still did not know whether clark had received medical attention,noticed that clark cell was trashed.ja.officer tom dowker reported that clark refused his dinner that day.
july.on wednesday,clark refused his breakfast.the officer who attempted to deliver his food noticed that the floor,walls,and clark were covered with something that looked like dried food.ja.harvey asked rufus wright,the residence unit manager,if he could move clark and informed wright that the water to the cell was off.it degrees,wright responded,you ca have the water off.ja.
from outside the observation cell,fox observed clark for a couple of minutes,ja,noting that he was virtually and that he was laying on his cell floor when i arrived.he refused to get up and talk to me h e continues to act in an odd manner,but he has become less aggressive in behavior,not banging on the cell doors much unable to assess because inmate is refusing to talk.ja.fox informed harvey that clark had a history of acting out to get into segregation.ja.later,nelson contacted fox regarding a report from an officer concerned about clark condition.according to nelson,fox said he was not going to go back to the housing unit as he had already talked to clark.ja.clark was a manipulator,fox added,and was trying to have things his way.ja.
on the next shift,lauters noticed nothing unusual about clark,though as far as he knew clark still had not received psychiatric help.officer thomas dowker,who worked with lauters every day that clark was in the cell,acknowledged some deterioration in clark condition.officer ricardo dominguez observed clark lying naked on his bed.according to the log book,clark refused to accept his evening meal.during clark time in the observation cell,several inmates heard clark asking for water as they passed his cell on the way to the mess hall.ja.
july.at roughly,during whittaker shift,clark was discovered dead.his body lay naked on the floor,in full rigor mortis,with eyes open and vomit encrusted on his mouth.the water to clark cell was turned off and the toilet was dry.when an emergency medical crew arrived,they asked how long it had been since someone had checked on clark.upon being informed it had been to minutes,one of them said,jesus.he rigored.ja.
michigan detective michael morey investigated the scene and noted a strong odor of urine,a pool of urine beneath clark mattress and debris on the floor,including uneaten food.due to the smearing of filth on the cell window,morey determined that very little of the activity inside that cell could have been observed from the outside.ja.gilman reached the same conclusion due to the filth on the inside of the window of the door,he did not believe that officers in the pod could see anybody in those cells.ja.
an autopsy revealed that clark had died of dehydration.
on march,clark estate,through his sister bonita,filed two lawsuits against a number of prison employees under,alleging that they were deliberately indifferent to clark medical needs in violation of the eighth and fourteenth amendments.ruling on three motions filed by different groups of defendants in the two cases,the district court eventually dismissed the claims against several employees as a matter of law.as to the remaining defendants,the district court ruled that there was a fact dispute about whether they were deliberately indifferent to clark need for water,ventilation and medical care,and that qualified immunity did not apply to these employees because clark right to these necessities and services was clearly established at the time of the incident.thirteen of the employees filed an interlocutory challenge to this ruling,while two of them filed a separate interlocutory challenge to the ruling.we have jurisdiction over each interlocutory appeal,mitchell forsyth,d we give de novo review to the district court summary judgment decisions,thomas cohen,cir and we have exercised our discretion to consolidate the two appeals and resolve them together.
something obviously went wrong during the last six days of the state of michigan custody over jeffrey clark,and the question is whether a triable issue of fact exists over the constitutional responsibility of these defendants for his suffering and eventual death.faced with this grim set of allegations and with the requirement that we must accept them as true at this stage of the litigation,one might be tempted to invoke the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur and let the trial begin.but the constitution gives governments considerable leeway when it comes to the challenges of managing a prison and erects a series of hurdles that allegations of prisoner mistreatment must clear before they proceed to a jury.
first,the standard of care in this area is not negligence,farmer brennan,d,which is why res ipsa loquitur does not apply,sweeney erving.under the eighth amendment,an inmate may bring a claim regarding his conditions of confinement only when he can show that there has been deliberate indifference to his medical needs.estelle gamble,d see also farmer,at.the amendment imposes duties on these officials to ensure that inmates receive adequate food,clothing,shelter,and medical care,and to take reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the inmates.quoting hudson palmer,d.to establish deliberate indifference,an inmate must show that the alleged mistreatment was objectively serious and that the defendants subjectively ignored the inmate medical or safety needs.farmer,at.a claimant may satisfy the subjective prong of this inquiry by establishing that the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety,which is to say the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,and he must also draw the inference.id.at.
second,qualified immunity prevents the officers from being held liable for constitutional violations if the right at issue was not clearly established at the time of the violation.saucier katz,d.under saucier,the dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.at.
turning to the constitutional question,we note that little room for debate exists about the objective component of eighth amendment claim.in the abstract,the deprivation of water and medical care,including psychological services,of course would be sufficiently serious to satisfy this requirement,farmer,at,and the defendants do not argue otherwise.the question is whether the defendants satisfy the subjective component of the claim,a question that we will answer by dividing the defendants into two involved only in treating clark collapse outside the mess hall on june and those involved in his treatment from that day forward.
captain dyer and sergeant wakefield assisted clark after he collapsed outside the mess hall on june.each defendant involvement in clark care ended after the two of them transferred him to lauters unit later that day.while they each perceived that clark needed psychological care,they had no reason to expect that lauters or any of the other defendants charged with clark care would fail to secure that help.nor did they leave it at that.each of them took reasonable steps to ensure that lauters looked out for clark safety in this area.see,ja dyer told lauters that clark needed psychological services ja wakefield radioed to the unit to find out any information that would help us on him.see farmer,at.noting that officials who actually knew of a substantial risk may be found free from liability if they responded reasonably to the risk,even if the harm ultimately was not averted.
has not produced evidence indicating or even suggesting that these defendants had any reason to think clark was not receiving the psychological treatment he needed after june.and there is no evidence that these defendants had any reason to think that clark was dehydrated at this point in time.while it fairly can be said that each of these defendants perceived a risk to clark health,they acted reasonably in response to that perception.clark was moved to an observation cell,and the officers looked into his treatment history and communicated their concerns that clark needed psychiatric assistance.does not allege that these officers had any other responsibility for,or interaction with,clark after this incident.on this record,the constitutional claims of deliberate indifference fail as a matter of law against these two defendants.see williams mehra,cir en banc plaintiff would need to show that the doctors actually knew that their actions constituted an excessive risk to plaintiff health or safety.davis agosto,cir requiring reliable inference s of wantonness internal quotation marks omitted.
the claims against most of the remaining officers are another matter.each of these officers had some involvement with clark after his june collapse,and each of them learned at one time or another about his serious psychological needs or his potential for dehydration.as shown by the following assessment of the evidence,has presented sufficient evidence from which of these defendants all but becher and friedt could have inferred that a substantial risk of serious harm existed to clark health and safety from the deprivation of water or psychological treatment,or both.
deputy warden 
lee gilman 
gilman received an on july from the head of the outpatient mental health unit stating that it is my clinical opinion that prisoner clark is psychotic h is current level of functioning requires intense interventions,ja the record offers no indication that gilman responded to this.
lieutenants 
shirley whittaker 
shifts june through july,to 
whittaker agreed that clark had a mental problem and that he needed some sort of psychologist or other mental health professional,ja the water was turned off during her shifts she did not follow up to ensure that clark was receiving needed care and she was the supervisor on duty the night clark died.
donald wise 
shifts june through july,to 
wise worked every day that clark occupied the cell he observed clark strange behavior he knew the water had been turned off by harvey and lauters and he did nothing to ensure clark received medical treatment.

shift july,to 
becher observed clark pacing back and forth naked and telling me he was selling candy canes,ja she believed he needed psychiatric help and was told that a had been completed for him.
mike harvey 
shifts june through july,to 
on each day that clark was in the observation cell,the water was off for at least part of harvey shift harvey was aware of clark mental illness and that clark was not drinking or eating vandervlucht told harvey that he was concerned that clark was not drinking fox relayed information to harvey that clark wanted water and on july,the day clark died,the water was still off during harvey shift.
tom lauters 
shifts june through july,to 
lauters was told by dyer that clark needed psychological services,ja and he did nothing after filling out a referral form healthcare was contacted,i left it that,ja though clark disturbing behavior persisted throughout lauters shifts.
ginger bayne 
shifts june and july,to 
bayne saw clark drinking from the toilet clark asked her for water she told stout that clark was a problem,ja and while she knew that clark needed mental health care she did not ensure that it was provided.
tom dowker 
shifts june through july,to 
dowker heard screeching,barking,jibberish from clark,ja he thought that clark needed psychological or psychiatric intervention,he perceived clark deteriorating on july and he did nothing to ensure clark was getting help.
brian foreback 
shifts july and,to 
during his july shift,the water was turned off both when foreback began the shift and when he ended it the water was turned off when he began his july shift up until clark dead body was discovered and it appears that foreback did not check on clark during his last shift.
bruce stout 
shifts june and july,to 
stout knew the water was repeatedly turned off in clark cell he knew that clark had exhibited symptoms of mental illness and he did nothing to ensure that clark was getting help.
anthony vandervlucht 
shifts june,to july,to 
vandervlucht realized clark was not drinking water he inferred that this posed a risk to clark health he perceived symptoms of mental illness heard clark barking and yelling and he did nothing to seek help for clark.
joann friedt,nurse 
shift june,to 
harvey telephoned friedt,telling her that prisoner clark was barking and would not talk or respond to me.ja.in response,friedt said that i was aware of it and that i put the form in for psych to with him.ja.
mark fox,psychologist 
shifts visited clark on july and.
as a psychologist,fox was to identify clark psychosis and to address it he did not address the problem during his first examination and gave clark only a cursory examination the day he died,despite his awareness that clark was suffering from psychosis and despite seeing clark in a condition and fox may have ordered the water turned off in clark cell.
as this record evidence shows,each of these defendants,except for becher and friedt,repeatedly perceived sufficient facts to infer that clark faced serious risks to his health and safety.with regard to the dehydration claim,has presented evidence indicating that the water repeatedly was off during many of these defendants shifts,that other inmates heard clark asking for water throughout the week,that officers perceived that clark was not drinking and that the prison was on a heat alert throughout this period.with regard to the claim,many of the officers testified that they believed clark needed psychological attention.see gilman br.at fox diagnosed clark with psychosis id.at gilman was advised that clark needed psychiatric treatment id.at bayne thought that clark had mental health needs id.at vandervlucht thought clark problems were psychological id.at dowker thought clark needed psychological or psychiatric intervention id.at harvey thought that clark had some mental issues id.at whittaker thought that clark needed to be seen by a mental health professional.
despite these widely held beliefs,the record shows that clark languished in his cell for five days without the door being opened and apparently with the officers unable readily to see into his cell for part of this time.even though prison rules required officers to go up the chain of command if they felt that a referral had not secured the requisite assistance for an inmate,these defendants pin much of their defense on the fact that they or others had completed forms.see,ja lauters i knew that healthcare was contacted,i left it at that.while this fact may be relevant to whether the individual defendants recklessly disregarded a risk of harm to clark or responded reasonably to it,the fact does not suffice to establish that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law at this stage of the case given their repeated interactions with clark and repeated opportunities to assess the seriousness of the situation.
none of this,to be sure,establishes that these defendants either singly or as a group showed deliberate indifference to clark.for purposes,we hold only that these defendants could have perceived a substantial risk of serious harm to clark.whether in fact they perceived,inferred or disregarded that risk is an issue for trial.see farmer,at.whether a prison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk is a question of fact subject to demonstration in the usual ways,and a factfinder may conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was obvious.see also comstock mccrary,cir noting that it is permissible for reviewing courts to infer from circumstantial evidence that a prison official had the requisite knowledge.
in contrast to these defendants,sergeant becher and nurse friedt worked just one shift between clark seizure on june and his death on july or july.while a prison employee doubtlessly could exhibit deliberate indifference toward an inmate in the course of one shift,neither friedt nor becher had sufficient exposure to clark to make out a triable issue of fact that any such wantonness occurred on their part.
only one of nurse friedt shifts an shift on sunday,june involved clark.friedt became aware of clark situation by way of a form,which mentioned some type of seizure.ja.a form is used only for psychiatric or mental conditions.ja.as a nurse,friedt was not expected to become involved with issues unless the inmate was being watched for,which was not the case here.she also knew that the officers had not prepared a contact sheet,a fact that was inconsistent with a medical emergency.knowing that the hospital could have been called the night before if there had been an imminent need for care,ja,friedt,without more,fairly could have deduced that the situation with clark was under control.the officers on the scene had not contacted a hospital or a nurse they instead had sought psychiatric care and hours had passed since the original prior to her arrival.quite possibly,on this record,friedt reasonably could have done nothing more.but she did more she called the officer on duty in clark cell block thelen to determine if clark needed medical assistance.officer thelen informed friedt,all he on is custody watch which did not impose a responsibility on friedt.he does not need medical care.ja.when harvey called later,he mentioned that clark was having psychiatric difficulties.since she was not qualified to help an inmate with psychiatric needs,she let harvey know that the referral to the psychiatric department had been completed.in contrast to harvey,no allegation has been made that friedt knew the psychiatric referral had failed to secure clark the help he needed.no evidence indicates that harvey or anyone e
