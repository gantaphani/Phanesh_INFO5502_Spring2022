glennis and clifford bolden appeal their multiple convictions and separate sentences in the western district of north carolina,resulting from charges arising out of a complex medicaid fraud scheme.in their appeals,the boldens challenge their convictions for money laundering and a related money laundering conspiracy,and bolden challenges several of her convictions for the submission of false claims to the government.they also challenge their sentences in several respects.as explained below,we affirm their convictions,but we reverse in part and vacate and remand their sentences in part.
the boldens were indicted in december of by a grand jury in asheville,north carolina,and a superseding indictment was returned in october of the indictment alleged that,from until,the boldens planned and perpetrated an elaborate fraud scheme,improperly obtaining tens of thousands of dollars from north carolina medicaid program medicaid.this fraud scheme was carried out through their operation of emerald health emerald health,a nursing facility owned by henry lane,bolden father the fraud scheme had numerous components,but the object of each was the same the illegal extraction of monies from medicaid for the benefit of one or both of the boldens.
in november of,after a jury trial in asheville,the boldens were convicted of multiple offenses.in particular,each was convicted of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud in contravention of two counts of submitting false claims to the government in violation of six counts of filing false income tax returns in violation of six substantive counts of money laundering in violation of a and a separate count of money laundering conspiracy in contravention of h.bolden was also convicted on eighteen separate false claims charges.
on august,a probation officer submitted reports the psrs to the district court on the boldens.the parties then submitted objections to the psrs and,on october,the court conducted sentencing hearings.bolden received months in prison,and bolden was sentenced to a term of months.in addition,bolden was fined,and bolden was fined.the boldens were each required to make in restitution to the internal revenue service 
following sentencing,the boldens filed timely notices of appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
in their appeals,the boldens raise multiple challenges to their convictions and sentences.in seeking reversal of their convictions,they assert the following the conviction issues 
that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions on the money laundering counts 
that their convictions for money laundering conspiracy are flawed because 
the charge of money laundering conspiracy,in count of the indictment,was legally deficient 
the court committed reversible error in its instructions by constructively amending the money laundering conspiracy charge and 
the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions for money laundering conspiracy and 
with respect to bolden,that the evidence was insufficient to sustain her convictions on the eighteen separate false claims charges.
the boldens also raise assertions of error with regard to their sentences the sentencing issues,specifically maintaining that 
the court erred in grouping their fraud and money laundering convictions 
the court failed to make adequate factual findings on the sentencing issues in dispute and 
to the extent the court factual findings were adequate,they were clearly erroneous 
before turning to their contentions,we review the factual underpinnings for the boldens convictions and sentences 
between and,bolden served as emerald health director of operations and as supervisor of its ventilator unit.as director of operations,she approved emerald health payments to vendors,authorized its capital purchases,transferred funds between its bank accounts,and directed its efforts to obtain reimbursements from medicaid.in sum,she was responsible for most of the administrative and financial decisions of emerald health.beginning in,and until his resignation in early,bolden worked as emerald health director of maintenance.in that capacity,he ordered supplies and supervised emerald health housekeeping and maintenance staff.
the boldens utilized their relationships with emerald health to manipulate north carolina medicaid reimbursement system the north carolina division of medical assistance the dma administers medicaid,a healthcare program for individuals partially funded by the federal government.pursuant to its mandate,medicaid reimburses nursing facilities,such as emerald health,for their treatment and care of medicaid patients.
in making such reimbursements,medicaid initially disburses prospective payments to nursing facilities that treat and care for medicaid patients.admin.code tit.the prospective payment rate on which such payments are based is an estimate of the costs a nursing facility likely incurred in treating a medicaid patient for one day.medicaid has established three separate prospective payment rates,corresponding to the three levels of care provided by nursing nursing care,skilled nursing care,and ventilator care id.each prospective payment rate consists of two components,called direct and indirect components.the direct component consists of those nursing facility costs attributable specifically to patient care,such as nursing,food service,housekeeping,and laundry.id.the indirect component consists of nursing facility costs related to property ownership,administration,and maintenance.id.in order to receive its prospective payments,a nursing facility periodically submits bills to medicaid the medicaid bills.the medicaid bills specify the number of days each medicaid patient resided in the nursing facility and the level of care each received.after receiving and approving a nursing facility medicaid bills,medicaid makes the prospective payments 
at the end of each fiscal year,in order to ensure that the prospective payments were proper,medicaid requires each nursing facility to file an annual cost report the cost report.id.a cost report details both the direct and indirect costs a nursing facility actually incurred in treating and caring for patients.if a nursing facility actual direct costs are less than the direct cost component of the prospective payments it has already received,the facility is obliged to repay the difference to medicaid.if,however,the nursing facility actual direct costs exceed the direct cost component of the prospective payments the facility has received,medicaid issues a settlement payment to the facility.id.
in contrast to direct costs,medicaid does not make settlement payments,or require repayment,for the indirect cost component of a nursing facility prospective payments.id.in other words,unlike with direct costs,medicaid does not make settlement payments to nursing facilities that expended more in indirect costs than was provided for in their prospective payments.by the same token,to the extent a nursing facility does not spend the portion of its prospective payments dedicated to indirect costs,it is under no obligation to repay medicaid.therefore,to the extent a nursing facility can characterize its costs as direct costs,the greater its medicaid reimbursement.
in carrying out their fraud scheme,the boldens manipulated medicaid reimbursement system in several respects in order to inflate the medicaid payments received by emerald health.of importance here,the scheme included the following 
bolden,as emerald health agent,entered emerald health into lease agreements which were used for fraudulent purposes the lease transactions 
the boldens implemented a plan to circumvent medicaid related party regulations the related party transactions 
bolden utilized emerald health to bill medicaid for patients no longer in the nursing facility,and she miscategorized the levels of care provided to various patients on the medicaid bills,as well as on the cost reports the false patient billing 
bolden used emerald health funds to purchase an automobile for her personal use the automobile purchase 
bolden misclassified employees salaries as direct costs on the cost reports the false salary classifications and 
bolden submitted improper expenses to medicaid for equipment purchased by emerald health from a medical supplies company called aequitron the aequitron invoices 
these separate aspects of the fraud scheme are further explained below.
the lease transactions 
beginning in,bolden caused emerald health to enter into certain lease transactions that were used for fraudulent purposes.she perpetrated this aspect of the scheme with the assistance of buford sonny nelson she and nelson used nelson enterprises,which was nelson office supplies business,to arrange leases between emerald health and several leasing companies for the purpose of extracting monies from medicaid.
in a typical lease transaction,nelson would contact a leasing company the lessor and,on behalf of nelson enterprises,represent that he had a customer,emerald health,that was interested in leasing nursing facility equipment.thereafter,the lessor would enter into a lease agreement with emerald health.pursuant to the agreement,the lessor would agree to purchase the equipment from nelson enterprises and lease it to emerald health.in each transaction,the equipment was to be delivered directly from nelson enterprises to emerald health.
when they initiated the lease transactions,bolden and nelson had no intention of providing equipment for emerald health.instead,nelson enterprises would simply invoice the lessors,indicating that the leased equipment had been delivered to emerald health.before disbursing its payment to nelson enterprises,a lessor would contact emerald health to confirm receipt of the equipment.bolden would assure the lessor that emerald health had received and accepted the leased equipment.the lessor would then disburse its payment to nelson enterprises.instead of delivering the leased equipment to emerald health,however,nelson would either send it a portion of the equipment ordered or none at all.nelson would then divide the payment received from the lessor between himself and bolden.thereafter,pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement,emerald health was obligated to make lease payments to the lessor.
for example,in july of,nelson brokered a lease between emerald health and a company called north star leasing north star.prior to arranging the north star lease,bolden borrowed from nelson for the down payment on a vehicle for bolden.nelson then brokered the north star lease,in the sum of,for the purpose of financing emerald health purchase of bathtub equipment from nelson enterprises.after receiving an invoice from nelson enterprises and confirming with bolden that the bathtub equipment had been delivered to emerald health,north star disbursed a payment to nelson enterprises.nelson kept as repayment of his earlier loan to bolden,paid himself as a broker fee,and gave bolden the remaining.this transaction obligated emerald health to make monthly payments of approximately to north star for three years for bathtub equipment it never received.
between and,bolden and nelson involved emerald health in seven lease transactions.in the end,nelson enterprises received over from seven lessors.only of that sum was applied to actual equipment delivered to emerald health.the remaining was divided between nelson and bolden.nelson received approximately and bolden received approximately,of which was used to purchase the automobile for bolden 
bolden classified emerald health lease payments as indirect costs on its and cost reports.on the and cost reports,however,over in payments on the lease transactions were misclassified as direct costs,thereby increasing emerald health medicaid receipts for and.
the related party transactions 
as part of the scheme,the boldens circumvented medicaid regulations on related party transactions.in submitting cost reports to medicaid,a nursing facility must disclose whether any of its costs resulted from transactions with related parties,individuals or businesses having immediate family relationships with the facility.admin.code tit.for related party transactions,medicaid reimburses a nursing facility for only the related party actual costs for goods or services provided to the facility.
in,bolden resigned from emerald health,due to disagreements with his,and established a nursing supplies business called carolina supply company carolina supply.that same year nelson enterprises failed,and bolden decided to extract extra monies from medicaid by having emerald health purchase supplies from carolina supply at inflated prices.due to medicaid limitations on related party transactions,she concealed emerald health purchases from carolina supply by having nelson create a sham business to act as an intermediary between carolina supply and emerald health.
nelson then established a bank account for the sham business,which was called industrial consumer products industrial.carolina supply would bill industrial for various supplies it purportedly shipped to emerald health,and industrial would in turn bill emerald health,at inflated prices,for those same supplies.although the supplies were rarely delivered as ordered,emerald health would pay the industrial bills,and industrial would in turn pay the carolina supply bills.nelson characterized his role in the related party transactions as just selling paper.
emerald health sometimes paid industrial invoices even though no supplies were delivered to emerald health.in other instances,nelson submitted industrial invoices which emerald health did not pay,and for which no supplies were delivered the fictitious invoices.the fictitious invoices were used solely to increase emerald health medicaid reimbursements.
when supplies were delivered,emerald health was usually charged to more than carolina supply actual costs.for example,in,carolina supply purchased washcloths,bath towels,bibs,and fitted sheets at an approximate cost of.in september of,industrial charged emerald health approximately for those items,which emerald health paid.industrial,on november,issued a check to carolina supply for those same items.nelson thus profited by about,while carolina supply made more than.
in carrying out the related party transactions,industrial submitted a total of eight invoices to emerald health two such invoices,totalling about,were never paid.between september of and march of,emerald health paid industrial approximately on the remaining six invoices,and industrial made corresponding payments to carolina supply,the related party,of almost.the cost of the supplies actually delivered to emerald health was about.bolden classified the eight invoices as direct costs on the and cost reports,failing to reveal that they were related party transactions.
the false patient billing 
as part of the fraud scheme,bolden also caused emerald health to systematically charge medicaid for patients who were no longer in its nursing facility due to their hospitalization,discharge,or death.for example,emerald health billed medicaid for its care of patient beulah wallace from april,until april.wallace,however,died on april.emerald health similarly billed medicaid for its care of patient ardna church from june,until september,but church had been discharged from the facility on june.as a result of the false patient billing,bolden was convicted on eighteen false claims charges,and medicaid was overcharged by more than 
the automobile purchase 
in september of,nelson assisted bolden in concealing the use of emerald health funds to purchase an automobile for her personal use.in this aspect of the fraud scheme,bolden first issued an emerald health check for approximately,payable to nationsbank.nelson,purporting to act on behalf of emerald health,took the check to nationsbank in statesville,north carolina,where he purchased a cashier check in that sum,payable to nelson enterprises.nelson next drove to nearby newton,and,using the cashier check,purchased a cashier check from southern national bank,payable to state employees credit union.nelson retained as his fee and used the cashier check to purchase a vehicle for bolden.these transactions served to conceal bolden use of emerald health funds to purchase her personal automobile.the emerald health check to nationsbank was reflected as an indirect cost on the cost report.
the false salary classifications 
as part of the fraud scheme,bolden misclassified several employees salaries as direct costs on the and cost reports.specifically,she improperly classified her own salary,as well as those of an emerald health administrative assistant,two of its accounting clerks,a physician assistant,and a maintenance employee,as direct rather than indirect costs for example,bolden designated lori gann as a medical records clerk,rather than an accounting clerk,in order to misclassify gann salary as a direct cost on the and cost reports.by misclassifying these salaries,bolden overstated emerald health direct costs on the and cost reports by over.
the aequitron invoices 
on several occasions,bolden caused emerald health financial records to overstate expenses by making duplicative accounting entries,thereby double and certain purchases from a medical supplies company called aequitron.in one instance,emerald health received invoices from aequitron for medical supplies it had purchased,for approximately.bolden misclassified these purchases as direct costs on emerald health accounting ledger and on the cost report.she then obtained duplicate invoices from aequitron and expensed them a second time,again misclassifying the duplicates as direct costs on emerald health accounting ledger and on the cost report.
on another occasion,emerald health purchased ventilator equipment from aequitron,which invoiced the equipment for approximately.upon receiving the ventilator equipment,bolden had a lessor pay aequitron for it,and emerald health then leased the equipment from the lessor.bolden recorded the aequitron invoice on emerald health accounting ledger to reflect that emerald health had engaged in three such transactions.she then reported the three purchases of ventilator equipment as direct costs on the cost report 
in sum,the boldens manipulated medicaid reimbursement system in several respects in order to inflate the medicaid payments received by emerald health.bolden caused emerald health to misrepresent the number of medicaid patients it treated and cared for,to conceal the related party transactions on the and cost reports,and to abuse the medicaid reimbursement process by classifying its indirect costs as direct costs on those cost reports.by improperly classifying indirect costs as direct costs,bolden succeeded in eliminating the repayments emerald health would have been obliged to make to medicaid for and.
during fiscal years,and,emerald health actual direct costs were substantially less than the direct cost component of the prospective payments it received from medicaid.as a result,emerald health was required to repay medicaid the sums of,and for those years.by contrast,in fiscal years and,it received settlement payments from medicaid,amounting to in and in.
with this background in mind,we turn to the issues raised by the boldens in this case.
iii.the conviction issues 
as explained above,the boldens,in their separate appeals,challenge their money laundering and related conspiracy convictions.in addition,bolden asserts that there was insufficient evidence to convict her on the eighteen separate false claims counts.we begin our analysis of their contentions on the conviction issues by examining the applicable standards of review.
a.the standards of review 
first,in reviewing the sufficiency of evidence,a verdict must be upheld if there is substantial evidence,taking the view most favorable to the government,to support it.glasser united states.see also united states bennafield,cir.second,we review de novo a challenge to the validity of an indictment.united states loayza,cir.finally,we review for abuse of discretion a district court rulings on jury instructions.united states bostian,cir.in reviewing the adequacy of instructions,we accord the district court much discretion and will not reverse provided that the instructions,taken as a whole,adequately state the controlling law.teague bakker,cir.
b.the money laundering convictions 
the boldens first challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting their convictions for money laundering.each of their six money laundering convictions,pursuant to a,arose out of the related party transactions three of those convictions resulted from checks written by emerald health to industrial,and the other three involved checks written by industrial to carolina supply collectively,the industrial check transactions as explained below,sufficient evidence supports the money laundering convictions.
the money laundering issues 
in the common understanding,money laundering occurs when money derived from criminal activity is placed into a legitimate business in an effort to cleanse the money of criminal taint.the money laundering statute,however,as codified at a,proscribes a much broader range of conduct,specifically prohibiting four distinct types of money laundering activity.in order to contravene a,a defendant must,first of all,know that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some specified unlawful activity.if this proceeds element is satisfied,a money laundering violation occurs when a defendant conducts or attempts to conduct a financial transaction 
intending to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity promotion money laundering or 
intending to engage in conduct contravening or of the internal revenue code or 
knowing that the financial transaction is designed to conceal the nature of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity concealment money laundering or 
knowing that the transaction is designed to avoid a state or federal transaction reporting requirement.
the money laundering counts charged the boldens with involvement in both promotion money laundering and concealment money laundering the instructions advised the jury that,in order to convict on those charges,it was obliged to find the boldens involved in both promotion money laundering and concealment money laundering accordingly,by its guilty verdict on the six money laundering counts,the jury found that they had each engaged in both types of money laundering.
the boldens maintain that their money laundering convictions must be vacated for two reasons.first,they contend that the financial transactions on which their money laundering convictions are based,the industrial check transactions,did not involve the proceeds of the mail and wire fraud that constituted the specified unlawful activity alleged in the indictment.second,they assert that the industrial check transactions failed to satisfy the statutory requirements of either promotion money laundering or concealment money laundering.for the reasons explained below,we reject each of these contentions.
the proceeds element 
the boldens first contend that the evidence failed to prove that the money laundering offenses involved the proceeds of the specified unlawful activity spelled out in the indictment.in particular,it charged their involvement in a mail and wire fraud offense which qualifies as a specified unlawful activity under the relevant money laundering statute.the boldens assert,however,that the mail and wire fraud activity consisted only of the submission of the and cost reports,and that it was not until the submission of those reports that their fraud scheme generated proceeds.according to the boldens,the industrial check financial transactions underlying the money laundering not have involved the proceeds of the specified unlawful activity because they occurred prior to the submission of the and cost reports.
contrary to the boldens contention,the money laundering statute does not require the underlying criminal activity be completed prior to the money laundering transactions.see united states butler,cir funds are criminally derived if they are derived from an already completed offense,or a completed phase of an ongoing offense.internal quotation omitted emphasis added.thus,the key inquiry is not whether the specified unlawful activity was completed prior to the alleged money laundering transaction.instead,we must determine whether the specified unlawful activity generated proceeds prior to the money laundering,and whether the money laundering actually involved those proceeds.
we begin our analysis by noting that certain criminal activities can produce proceeds long before their completion.a mail fraud scheme,such as the medicaid fraud scheme of the boldens,is the prototype of an activity that can generate proceeds before the mailings take place.see united states mankarious,cir a mail fraud scheme can create proceeds long before the mailing ever takes place.indeed,as the tenth circuit recognized in united states massey,cir,a scheme to defraud has a wider meaning than an individual act of fraud.a mail or wire fraud scheme often encompasses a range of activities that occur prior to,and culminate in,mail and wire submissions.accordingly,in order to sustain the boldens money laundering convictions,there must simply have been sufficient evidence for the jury to have inferred that the proceeds came from a fraudulent scheme and that the use of the mails furthered that scheme.mankarious,at.
the boldens scheme to defraud medicaid cast a wide net,and it was not limited to the submission of the cost reports.the scheme included,inter alia,the false patient billing the lease transactions the creation and use of a sham company,industrial the submission of the industrial invoices to emerald health the receipt of the prospective payments and the inclusion of the related party transactions as direct costs on the and cost reports.the cost reports were simply used to justify the prospective payments that emerald health had already received.accordingly,the mail and wire submissions were merely the culminating acts in a scheme that had begun long before.and although their fraud scheme may not have been consummated until the submission of the cost reports,the boldens had completed a substantial part of the scheme prior to the industrial check transactions.
for our purposes,the relevant fact is that the fraud scheme produced proceeds through the prospective payments prior to the financial industrial check which the money laundering convictions were based.the and cost reports merely justified emerald health receipt of those prospective payments.see united states allen,cir concluding that fraud scheme produces proceeds at the latest when the scheme succeeds in disgorging the funds from the victim and placing them into the control of the perpetrators united states morelli,cir concluding for purposes of money laundering statute that the money became the proceeds of fraud as soon as it entered the hands of members of the scheme.the prospective payments constituted the proceeds used by the boldens in the industrial check transactions.accordingly,the contention that the money laundering offenses were not conducted with the proceeds of the fraud scheme must fail.
the promotion and concealment issues 
similarly unavailing is the contention that the industrial check transactions failed to constitute either promotion money laundering or concealment money laundering.according to the boldens,the industrial check transactions were only used to carry on the legitimate business of carolina supply,and they thus did not qualify as promotion or concealment money laundering.indeed,several courts have vacated money laundering convictions where the financial transactions were utilized for legitimate purposes.see,united states,cir concluding there was no evidence that computers purchased in financial transaction charged as money laundering were to be used for anything other than fully legal personal use united states calderon,cir determining there was no evidence that appellant conduct furthered the alleged underlying narcotics trafficking.for the reasons explained below,we reject this contention.
promotion money laundering 
under the evidence,the industrial check transactions were designed to avoid disclosing the related party transactions to medicaid,allowing the boldens to evade medicaid regulatory requirements and charge medicaid inflated costs.further,emerald health payments to industrial compensated nelson for his part in the scheme,encouraging his continued participation therein.finally,carolina supply used the money it received from industrial to purchase and deliver part of the supplies industrial billed to emerald health.these partial deliveries provided an aura of legitimacy to emerald health payments to industrial,allowing the boldens to further conceal their scheme.thus,the circumstances underlying the industrial check transactions are sufficient to justify the finding that the boldens committed promotion money laundering.
in other decisions,we have ruled similarly.for example,in united states wilkinson,cir,we found the evidence sufficient to sustain convictions for promotion money laundering.there,the defendants had obtained loans from a insurance company by misrepresenting that the funds would be used to finance accounts receivable for physicians.the funds were instead employed to promote risky businesses.in their scheme,the defendants created a sham business for the purpose of handling the loans.the insurance company wired loan proceeds to the sham business,which transferred those proceeds to the businesses.we found the transactions to constitute promotion money laundering,in contravention of a a i,because,as judge hamilton explained,the transfer of money from the sham business to the businesses was integral to the success of the overall scheme.id.at.in this case,industrial was a sham business,used solely to deceive medicaid on the related party transactions,and it was thus integral to the success of the scheme.
concealment money laundering 
the evidence also established that the industrial check transactions constituted concealment money laundering,pursuant to a b i.on this point,the boldens maintain that,while the industrial check transactions were designed to avoid the requirements of the medicaid regulations,they were not designed to conceal the fact that emerald health had obtained prospective payments from medicaid.on this basis,they assert that their convictions for concealment money laundering are invalid.
viewed in the proper light,however,the industrial check transactions concealed the fact that the payments medicaid made to emerald health were being used in the related party transactions.as related above,supra part,the boldens and nelson created industrial to hide the fact that emerald health was ordering supplies from carolina supply,a related party.the industrial check transactions concealed this arrangement and enabled medicaid to be billed at inflated prices for the supplies ordered from carolina supply.those transactions also concealed the fact that the money flowing into carolina supply,and ultimately to the boldens,was derived from medicaid funds.
the creation and use of sham businesses is highly relevant to the proof of concealment money laundering.the fifth circuit,in united states willey,cir,observed that the use of a third party,for example,a business entity or a relative,to purchase goods on one behalf or from which one will benefit usually constitutes sufficient proof of a design to conceal.and in united states ladum,cir,the ninth circuit,in an analogous situation,concluded that a defendant who concealed his ownership in a business from a bankruptcy trustee,through the use of nominees who held themselves out as owners of the stores,had committed concealment money laundering.the court reasoned that the use of nominees prevented the bankruptcy trustee from knowing that the defendant was the legitimate owner of the stores.id.at.likewise,the boldens use of industrial concealed the fact that emerald health was billing medicaid at inflated prices for the related party transactions.in sum,the evidence sufficiently proves the allegations of concealment money laundering.
c.the conspiracy issues 
the boldens also challenge,on three separate bases,their convictions for money laundering conspiracy,as charged in count of the indictment.they contend,first,that count was fatally defective second,that the jury instructions on money laundering conspiracy amended the indictment and third,that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions of money laundering conspiracy.
in analyzing the sufficiency of count,we look first to the requirements of an indictment.a valid indictment must allege the essential facts constituting the offense allege each element of the offense,so that fair notice is provided and be sufficiently distinctive that a verdict will bar a second prosecution for the same offense.united states smith,cir citing hamling united states,d see also.c the indictment shall be a plain,concise,and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.as a basic proposition,an indictment is sufficient if it alleges an offense in the words of the statute.united states brandon,cir quoting united states wicks,cir.
the boldens contend that count,which alleged a violation of h was defective in three respects it failed to allege any overt acts it failed to identify the specified unlawful activity that produced the proceeds they conspired to launder and it failed to specify the offense defined in a or that the boldens conspired to commit we examine each of these three contentions in turn.
the first of these specifications,that count is defective for failing to allege overt acts,is baseless.the boldens were charged with and convicted of money laundering conspiracy,pursuant to h,and h does not require an overt act to be either alleged or proven.as we observed in united states godwin,cir,a conspiracy under h,as opposed to a conspiracy under,does not explicitly require proof of an overt act.in addressing a similar challenge to the drug conspiracy statute,the supreme court,in united states shabani,d,held that an overt act is not an element of.as the court observed,congress explicitly required the commission of an overt act as an element of the conspiracy defined in,and the court concluded that congress must be presumed to have acted deliberately in failing to include similar language in.id.at.the drug and money laundering conspiracy statutes and h are drawn in similar terms,and neither requires an overt act.see united states tam,cir the language of h is nearly identical to the language of,which the supreme court held does not require proof of an overt act.see also united states abrego,cir section has language virtually identical to the language of h.thus,because an overt act is not an element of a h offense,there was no need for the grand jury to make such an allegation in count.
the boldens next assert that count failed to identify the specified unlawful activity that produced the proceeds they conspired to launder.we have observed that t he core of money laundering is the laundering transaction itself,and that details about the nature of the unlawful activity underlying the character of the proceeds need not be alleged.smith,at.in any event,count spelled out the unlawful activity that produced the proceeds the boldens conspired to launder.
count incorporated and realleged the overt acts alleged in count one,which charged the boldens with violating the general conspiracy statute.those overt acts included allegations that the boldens established industrial to avoid the federal rules governing related party transactions,that industrial invoices were included on the cost reports,and that,as a result,carolina supply and industrial generated profits from medicaid reimbursement to the facility.count one also alleged that bolden caused the submission of electronic billings to the medicaid program which resulted in the interstate wiring of claims and payments between raleigh,north carolina and dallas,texas.in this context,the boldens had ample notice of the details of the specified unlawful activity mail and wire fraud that generated the proceeds they conspired to launder,and any contention to the contrary must be rejected.
finally,the boldens contend that count is fatally flawed because it failed to specify a specific statutory object of the conspiracy,that is,which one of five four defined in a or single conspired to commit count was not required to allege the specific type of money laundering the boldens conspired to commit it was simply alleging a conspiracy.courts have uniformly upheld conspiracies,and they have consistently concluded that a guilty verdict must be sustained if the evidence shows that the conspiracy furthered any one of the objects alleged.griffin united states,d united states hudgins,cir.for example,the third circuit upheld a conviction where the indictment alleged a conspiracy with three statutory violations of a and a.see united states carr,cir.the court observed that the convictions could be sustained if the defendants knowingly and intentionally committed acts furthering any of the three objects of the conspiracy.id.at.pursuant to the foregoing,this contention must also be rejected.
the boldens next contend that the trial court constructively amended count by impermissibly broadening the identity of the members of the conspiracy.that charge alleged that the boldens did knowingly conspire with one another,to commit money laundering offenses.as such,it omitted an allegation commonly made in such charges,that the defendants conspired with others known and unknown to the grand jury.the boldens contend that,because such an allegation was not made in count,the jury was obliged to find that the boldens had conspired with each other,and the court erred in failing to properly instruct the jury on this point 
a defendant may only be tried on charges alleged in an indictment,and only the grand jury may broaden or alter the charges in the indictment.united states randall,cir internal quotation and citation omitted.an indictment is constructively amended when the essential elements of the offense are altered to broaden the possible bases for conviction beyond what is contained in the indictment.united states keller,cir see also united states floresca,cir a constructive amendment to an indictment occurs when either the government,the court,or both,broadens the possible bases for conviction beyond those presented by the grand jury.where an indictment has been constructively amended,we have found reversible error,and we conclusively presume that the defendant has been prejudiced by the constructive amendment.floresca,at.
in support of their constructive amendment claim,the boldens rely almost exclusively on the eleventh circuit decision in keller,where two defendants were indicted for conspiracy,and the indictment failed to allege that there were unnamed coconspirators.an initial instruction permitted the jury to convict keller if the jury found he had conspired with anyone,while the indictment,like our count,alleged that he had conspired only with his codefendant.the court gave a supplemental instruction,using a hypothetical conspiracy example,emphasizing that keller could be convicted if the jury found he entered into an unlawful agreement with anyone.the jury then convicted keller and acquitted his codefendant.the eleventh circuit ruled that,where an indictment alleges that only two individuals conspired,an essential element of the offense is the identity of the individuals who agreed.id.at.the court observed that,w hile the initial instruction standing alone may not have been enough to constitute an amendment,the trial court exacerbated the problem with its supplemental instructions in response to the jury question.id.at.
contrary to the boldens contention,the instruction did not fatally amend count.even if a coconspirator identity is an essential element of the conspiracy charge but see united states am.waste fibers,cir,the jury,by convicting the boldens of the money laundering conspiracy alleged,necessarily found that they had conspired with each other,as count alleged,and as the instruction permitted 
finally,the boldens contend that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions for money laundering conspiracy.on this issue,they first assert that the industrial check transactions can not be part of a money laundering conspiracy because they did not involve the proceeds of the specified unlawful activity.independently,the boldens contend that,even if the industrial check transactions involved those proceeds,the transactions were not for the purpose of promoting or concealing the specified unlawful activity.as explained in part,supra,these contentions are without merit.the boldens also maintain that the overt acts in count one,incorporated and realleged in count,do not involve money laundering conduct and that the evidence was therefore insufficient to convict.on the contrary,as we explained in part.a,supra,an indictment for money laundering conspiracy need not allege an overt act.in these circumstances,this contention must also be rejected.
d.the false claims evidence 
bolden challenges eighteen of her twenty convictions for violating the false claims statute counts three through eleven,thirteen through nineteen,and she contends that the evidence was insufficient on the essential element of her knowledge that the claims submitted to medicaid were false.her convictions resulted from eighteen separate medicaid bills,between december and april,for emerald health supposed care of patients who had died,had been hospitalized,or had been discharged.
the false claims statute,codified at of title,criminalizes the submission of a false claim to the united states,or any department or agency thereof,if the defendant knows that such claim is false,fictitious,or fraudulent.thus,we must uphold such a conviction if the evidence shows the submission of a false claim and if the defendant acted with knowledge that the claim was false and with a consciousness that he was either doing something which was wrong,or which violated the law.united states maher,cir internal citations omitted see also united states blecker,cir upholding false claim conviction even though there was evidence that the government got its money worth.
although the jury was required to find,in order to convict bolden,that she had knowingly submitted the eighteen false claims to medicaid,it was entitled to do so on the basis of circumstantial evidence.indeed,t he question of one intent is not measured by a psychic reading of the defendant mind but by the surrounding facts and circumstances,circumstantial evidence.united states larson,cir.on the evidence presented,the jury could conclude that bolden knowingly submitted the eighteen false claims to medicaid.she controlled emerald health medicaid bills,and emerald health was strapped for funds.bolden was aware that emerald health patient census was incorrect,and she nonetheless instructed emerald health employees to submit the medicaid bills according to cox,the accounts receivable clerk,many times emerald health would get behind on the census and most of the time they would go ahead and submit a bill to medicaid.cox informed bolden that emerald health patient census was inaccurate,yet bolden instructed her to go ahead and bill medicaid because it was necessary to get money into the facility,and emerald health could,in any event,send in a recoupment if it billed something in error.even if bolden had contemplated correcting these medicaid bills,such an effort would not have been a valid defense to the charges.under,the government was obliged to establish only her knowing submission of the false claims.the jury was entitled to conclude,on the evidence of cox and the related circumstances,that bolden knowingly submitted false claims to medicaid.see united states adamson,cir where sufficiency is at issue,a finding that an accused acted recklessly may be enough to sustain a jury verdict,because a jury may properly infer the requisite intent.emphasis in original united states cincotta,cir concluding that evidence of defendant pervasive involvement in operations of corporation involved in transactions in question was sufficient for a reasonable juror to infer that defendant knew of the conspiracy.
bolden also contends that her submission of false claims to medicaid were simply mistakes,due to poor bookkeeping and accounting practices.she presented this explanation to the jury as a defense,however,and it was rejected.viewed in the proper light,there was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict bolden on each of the false claim charges.
iv.the sentencing issues 
having resolved the issues related to the boldens convictions,we turn to their sentences.in that respect,they first contend that the court erred in grouping their fraud and money laundering offenses.they then assert that the sentencing court failed to comply with rule c of the federal rules of criminal procedure.finally,they maintain that,if the court made adequate findings under rule c,it erred in its calculation of fraud losses,and in its application of adjustments to bolden for offenses involving abuse of position of trust and vulnerable victim s.
a.the standards of review 
in assessing challenges to a sentencing court application of the guidelines,we review factual determinations for clear error and legal issues de novo.united states singh,cir.the grouping of multiple convictions,pursuant to,involves a legal interpretation of guidelines terminology,and we review grouping issues de novo.united states toler,cir.a sentencing court factual findings in its application of the guidelines,made under rule c,are reviewed for clear error.united states souther,cir.when a sentencing court has failed to resolve a disputed fact on which it relied at sentencing,we remand for resentencing.united states morgan,cir.a finding of fraud loss is a factual issue,which we review for clear error.united states godwin,cir.finally,whether a defendant occupies a position of trust is a factual determination reviewable for clear error.united states glymph,cir.
b.the grouping issue 
the boldens contend that the sentencing court erroneously grouped their fraud and money laundering convictions.pursuant to d of the guidelines,all counts involving substantially the same harm shall be grouped together into a single group.in construing d,we have concluded that fraud and money laundering offenses should only be grouped when they are closely related.united states walker,cir quoting united states porter,cir.according to the boldens,their fraud and money laundering offenses are not so closely related as to warrant grouping.we disagree.
in porter,we first considered whether fraud and money laundering may be so closely related as to warrant being grouped together.porter had obtained the proceeds of an illegal gambling operation and laundered those proceeds by purchasing a home.we declined to group his offenses because the money laundering was not in any way integrated with the fraud scheme,the gambling operation.id.at.the only connection between the gambling operation and his money laundering activity was that porter had laundered the proceeds of the scheme.we concluded that,in such a situation,the fraud and money laundering offenses were not so closely related as to justify grouping.id.we observed,however,that the grouping of such offenses would be appropriate where an enterprise generated monies through illegal activities and simultaneously laundered those monies as part of the same continuing transaction or common scheme.id.in walker,we approved the grouping of fraud and promotion money laundering offenses because the money laundering activities were an essential aspect of the fraud scheme.at.walker,an insurance salesman,had diverted funds from his customers to his personal use and made fictitious interest payments to his customers with the proceeds.in so doing,he both concealed and promoted the fraud scheme.in making the fictitious interest payments,he used the proceeds of his fraud scheme to avoid suspicion that fraudulent activity was afoot and to encourage customers to continue paying their premiums.id.
the walker principles are applicable here.the boldens were found to have engaged in both promotion and concealment money laundering,and the industrial check transactions not only concealed the related party transactions from medicaid,they promoted those transactions as an essential component of the fraud scheme.by obtaining funds from the industrial check transactions,the boldens were able to provide emerald health with a portion of the supplies reflected on the industrial invoices.these actions gave an aura of legitimacy to their criminal endeavor and enabled their scheme to continue.as such,the money laundering and the related party transactions were not only closely related,they were inextricably intertwined.in every aspect of the fraud scheme,the boldens goal was the same the improper extraction of monies from medicaid.their money laundering activities were essential to achieving that goal,and their money laundering and fraud activities were part of a continuous,common scheme to defraud medicaid.thus,the fraud and money laundering offenses are closely related and,in the context of the guidelines,were properly grouped together by the sentencing court see united states emerson,cir approving grouping when defendant had embarked upon his money laundering scheme with the intent of promoting his mail fraud swindle united states landerman,cir upholding grouping when money laundering was used to promote and enhance fraud scheme.in these circumstances,the contention that the court erred on the grouping issue must be rejected.
c.the rule issues 
the boldens next contend that their sentences should be vacated because the court failed to comply with rule c specifically,they assert that the court failed to make adequate factual findings on the issues in dispute.in a sentencing hearing,the court,under rule c,is to rule on any unresolved objections to the psr.on controverted matters,the court is to make either a finding on the allegation or a determination that no finding is necessary.pursuant to rule b d,the sentencing court may,once objections are resolved,accept the psr as its findings of fact.
a sentencing court findings on controverted matters ensure a record as to how the district court ruled on any alleged inaccuracy in the psr and allow s effective appellate review of the sentence imposed.united states walker,cir.we have concluded,however,that the court need not articulate findings as to disputed factual allegations with minute specificity.united states perrera,cir.in fact,the court may simply adopt the findings contained in a psr,provided that it makes clear which disputed issues were resolved by its adoption.walker,at citing united states morgan,cir.in the boldens sentencing hearings,the court satisfied rule on nearly all factual disputes.two of those matters,however,warrant further scrutiny from the rule c standpoint bolden fraud loss calculation and bolden vulnerable victim adjustment.
at bolden sentencing hearing on,the court first ruled on several of his objections.it then stated bolden remaining objections are overruled and the court determines that the psr is fully supported by the evidence and the government filing is correct and adopted by the court.although the adoption of bolden psr is sufficient to permit review of his sentence in most respects,it is insufficient on whether the lease transactions were properly included in his fraud loss calculation.neither the psr nor the government filing,the government sentencing memorandum,contained factual assertions sufficient to justify inclusion of the lease transactions in that calculation bolden unsuccessfully sought to exclude approximately attributable to the lease transactions from his fraud loss calculation.he contends that the court failed to find that he directly participated in the lease transactions or that those transactions were in furtherance of jointly undertaken criminal activity.
in calculating fraud loss,a sentencing court must first apply the principles of relevant conduct.see.pursuant thereto,specific offense characteristics,such as the fraud loss properly attributable to a defendant,must be determined on the basis of the acts and omissions committed,aided,abetted,counseled,commanded,induced,procured,or willfully caused by a defendant and in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity,all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.a a b.
the fact that bolden was convicted of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud,which included the lease transactions,does not necessarily mandate a finding that the losses from those transactions constitute relevant conduct attributable to him.notwithstanding the verdict,the court was obliged to make individualized findings on fraud loss.as the court of appeals for the district of columbia has observed 
a jury verdict convicting the defendants of participation in a single conspiracy does not obviate the need for individualized findings by the sentencing court.such a verdict speaks to the scope of the defendant agreement only in very general terms it does not address the question of which specific actions demonstrated at trial were in furtherance of that single conspiracy or were foreseeable to the conspirators.
united states childress.and as judge wilkins has aptly put it one participant in a conspiracy may be held accountable,for sentencing purposes,for a greater or lesser amount than other coparticipants.united states gilliam,cir discussing commentary to a.
bolden psr fails to support a finding that he directly participated in all seven lease transactions.the only connection made in the psr between bolden and the lease transactions is a single lease.according to the psr,the actual purpose of this lease was to finance the purchase of a blue car for clifford bolden.this fact,standing alone,fails to warrant a finding that all the losses from the lease transactions are attributable to bolden.in its sentencing memorandum,the government asserted that bolden was also directly connected to a second lease.it asserted that he had attended a seminar in new york with respect to this second lease,and that he an emerald health check making a payment on it.while the court adopted the sentencing memorandum,the assertions made therein also fail to support the finding that bolden is accountable for all the losses arising from the seven lease transactions.
in further support of the fraud loss calculation on bolden,the government contends that the losses arising from the lease transactions were appropriately includable under the second prong of a,that they were reasonably foreseeable and in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.the commentary to provides guidance on this point,observing that the scope of a defendant criminal activity is not necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy,and hence relevant conduct is not necessarily the same for every participant,cmt.as such,a sentencing court,in applying,must first determine the scope of the criminal activity a defendant agreed to jointly undertake,the scope of the specific conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant agreement.id.emphasis added.
the commentary to also provides that,i n determining the scope of the criminal activity that the particular defendant agreed to jointly undertake,the court may consider any explicit agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others.id.the commentary points out,however,that the fact that the defendant is aware of the scope of the overall operation is not enough to hold him accountable for the activities of the whole operation.united states studley,cir.instead,a sentencing court must assess and determine the role the defendant agreed to play in the operation.id.
in light of the commentary to,several circuits require a sentencing court to make particularized findings with respect to both the scope of the defendant agreement and the foreseeability of his conduct before holding the defendant accountable for the scope of the entire conspiracy.united states campbell,cir emphasis in original see also studley,at concluding that sentencing court must make particularized findings as to scope of the criminal activity agreed upon by the defendant and whether the activity was foreseeable to the defendant united states bush,cir requiring individualized findings concerning scope of criminal activity undertaken by defendant and whether activity was reasonably foreseeable to defendant united states evbuomwan,cir same.we agree with our sister circuits that a sentencing court,in order to hold a defendant accountable for the conduct of his coconspirators,should make particularized findings with respect to both prongs of a b.as to bolden,however,neither the psr nor the sentencing the findings on the scope of the criminal activity he agreed to jointly undertake,or whether all the lease transactions were reasonably foreseeable as such,his fraud loss findings are inadequate 
bolden contends that the sentencing court failed to make adequate factual findings on her sentencing adjustment based on vulnerable victim,pursuant to.in ruling on bolden objection on this point,the court stated that t he defendant objection to the vulnerable victim enhancement is overruled.after sustaining her objections to adjustments for sophisticated concealment and role in the offense,the court found that the psr was correct in all other respects and was fully supported by the supporting affidavits filed by the government.
bolden asserts that the psr recommendation of the vulnerable victim adjustment rested on a legally erroneous interpretation of the terms victim and vulnerable,and that the psr failed to apply the targeting requirement,as necessitated by the guidelines.in recommending the vulnerable victim adjustment,the psr relied on the guidelines,which provide for such an adjustment i f the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was unusually vulnerable due to age,physical or mental condition,or that a victim was otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.the psr,in recommending the adjustment,stated that t he investigation revealed information from various sources that residents received inadequate care,due in part to the lack of adequate staff at the long term care nursing home facility.
in order to apply the vulnerable victim adjustment,a sentencing court must identify the victims of the offense,based not only on the offense of conviction,but on all relevant conduct.united states,cir we therefore reject the defendant argument that,for the purpose of,a victim of the offense is only an individual considered a victim of the specific offense of conviction.accordingly,the residents of emerald health would be victims of the fraud scheme if bolden failed to provide them with adequate care as a result of the scheme.
under the guidelines,we utilize a test for assessing the applicability of the vulnerable victim adjustment.first,the victim must be unusually vulnerable,united states holmes,cir,and second,the victim must also have been targeted by the defendant because of the victim unusual vulnerability.see also,cmt.this adjustment applies where an unusually vulnerable victim is made a target of criminal activity by the defendant.it is insufficient for a sentencing court to find only that a victim is elderly or physically infirm,it must also determine that the victim vulnerability or susceptibility facilitated the defendant crime in some manner.united states monostra,cir.while it is indisputable that the residents of emerald health were elderly,and many of them likely suffered from both mental and physical ailments,neither the sentencing court nor the psr found the vulnerability of emerald health residents to have facilitated bolden offenses.the court also did not find that emerald health residents were targeted because of their unusual vulnerability.united states gary,cir ruling that,before applying vulnerable victim adjustment,a sentencing court first must find that defendant initially chose his victim because of her particular vulnerability.in these circumstances,we vacate this aspect of bolden sentence 
d.the fraud loss calculation bolden 
bolden next contends that the court clearly erred in calculating her fraud loss.pursuant to b of the guidelines,a sentencing court is obliged to increase,on a graduated basis,the offense level of a defendant convicted of fraud,depending on the amount of loss resulting from the fraud scheme.bolden challenges the inclusion in her fraud loss of her salary and that of a physician assistant,the aequitron invoices,and costs included on the cost reports for which supporting invoices could not be found.
bolden first maintains that the court erred in including her salary and the salary of a physician assistant,frank dickerson,in her fraud loss calculation.she contends that dickerson salary was a proper direct cost of emerald health and,in the alternative,that there is no evidence connecting her to the improper classification of his salary or showing that the misclassification was deliberate at trial,a medicaid investigator and a medicaid auditor each testified that only those salaries directly related to patient care are proper direct costs on the cost reports.thus,administrative salaries,such as bolden,are reportable on the cost reports only as indirect costs.additionally,the compensation of physicians and physician assistants are separately reimbursed by medicaid and are not includable on the cost reports.according to the medicaid auditor,a physician assistant,such as dickerson,should have bill ed the medicaid program directly.as such,the court did not err in deciding that dickerson salary was an improper direct cost on the and cost reports.
there was also an ample basis for the court findings that bolden was responsible for the misclassification of dickerson salary and that the misclassification was deliberate.first,she was responsible for the management of emerald health,including classification of its expenses and preparation of the cost reports.emerald health also listed dickerson on those reports as its director of nursing,rather than as a physician assistant,to conceal the misclassification of his salary as a direct cost.finally,there was evidence that bolden was responsible for the misclassification of other employees salaries,thus permitting the sentencing court to infer that she was responsible for the improper classification of dickerson salary in these circumstances,the court did not err by including dickerson misclassified salary in bolden fraud loss calculation.
bolden also challenges the inclusion of her own salary in her fraud loss calculation.she contends that,although she performed administrative duties as emerald health director of operations,she also served as supervisor of its ventilator unit.moreover,because the salary of this supervisor is properly a direct cost,she asserts that her full salary was not includable in her fraud loss calculation.in support of this contention,bolden relies on the testimony of emerald health former medicaid auditor,who testified that the job description of the supervisor would support an argument that the portion of her salary for that position was properly a direct cost.however,bolden offered no evidence that her actual duties in the ventilator unit involved any direct patient care.indeed,according to the medicaid investigator,absent a study to ascertain how much time bolden dedicated to administrative work compared to how much she spent on direct patient care,it was improper to classify any portion of her salary as a direct cost.
significantly,the reclassification of bolden salary occurred in march of,when she was preparing the cost report and attempting to find ways to avoid another large repayment to medicaid in these circumstances,it was entirely proper to include bolden entire salary in her fraud loss calculation.
bolden also maintains that the sentencing court miscalculated her fraud loss by including nearly attributable to emerald health transactions with aequitron.this sum resulted from the of a aequitron invoice originally issued for a ventilator equipment purchase.the court included the in bolden fraud loss calculation,and she contends it did so erroneously 
bolden asserts that the of the aequitron invoice was simply an accounting error.she also maintains that,even if it was fraudulent,there is no direct evidence tying her to it.in the absence of direct evidence,however,there was ample circumstantial evidence justifying the court finding that it was a fraudulent act rather than a mistake.importantly,there was evidence tying bolden to the duplication of other aequitron invoices.in addition,she knew how the medicaid cost reporting system operated,she controlled emerald health finances,she possessed the authority to classify expenses,and she was motivated to avoid another significant emerald health repayment to medicaid.as such,the court did not err in including the aequitron invoice in bolden fraud loss calculation.
bolden final contention on her fraud loss calculation relates to the inclusion of approximately in costs billed to medicaid by emerald health for which vendors invoices could not be located the missing invoice costs.she asserts that the government failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the missing invoice costs were fraudulent.see united states harris,cir.as explained below,the sentencing court erred in its inclusion of the missing invoice costs in bolden fraud loss calculation.
during the investigation of emerald health,the medicaid investigator conducted an extensive audit,comparing the costs specified on the cost reports with those listed on emerald health cash disbursement journal,its bank records,and its invoices from service and supply companies.even though the cash disbursement journal and the bank records were supportive of the cost reports,the investigator concluded that the missing invoice costs were fraudulent because he could not find supporting invoices for them.the missing invoice costs were accordingly included in the psr fraud loss calculation for bolden.
prior to the sentencing hearing,bolden objected to the inclusion of the missing invoice costs in her fraud loss calculation,asserting that they were treated as fictitious even though emerald health cash disbursement journal and bank records reflected those costs as having been paid to more than twenty vendors.the government made no effort to contact the vendors to verify its position on the missing invoice costs,and bolden filed affidavits from several of the vendors,indicating that at least part of those costs were valid.she also produced an affidavit of a former emerald health employee,indicating that he had ordered supplies from certain of the vendors during and.at trial,the medicaid investigator acknowledged that the bank records in connection with the missing invoice costs appeared to be accurate.finally,bolden contended that,although the invoices relating to the missing invoice costs had been misplaced,they were legitimate.indeed,several emerald health employees testified at trial that emerald health business operations were disorganized and subject to poor bookkeeping.
in response,the government did not dispute bolden affidavits,and it acknowledged in its sentencing memorandum that the evidence connecting bolden to the fraudulent overstatement of the missing invoice costs is less than compelling.it failed to produce any testimony that the missing invoice costs were fraudulent,and its primary position was that bolden had the motive and as emerald health director of operations the opportunity to fabricate those costs.at the sentencing hearing,the government asserted that the issue on the missing invoice costs was for the court to decide based on the facts and circumstances.it chose not to make any further argument on the issue,and the court overruled bolden objection.
in sum,the government evidence on the missing invoice costs consisted of the opinion of a single witness,who admitted that the documentation underlying those costs appeared to be legitimate.it failed to produce further evidence,and it admitted that its evidence on this issue was less than compelling.bolden,on the other hand,came forward with an explanation of why the missing invoice costs were legitimate,and she produced affidavits corroborating,to some extent,her position.in these circumstances,we conclude that the court erred in including those costs in bolden fraud loss.
abuse of position of trust bolden 
finally,bolden contends that the sentencing court erred in applying the abuse of position of trust adjustment the trust adjustment to her sentence.she asserts that,although she may have occupied a position of trust with emerald health,she held no such position with respect to medicaid,and the court erred in applying the trust adjustment to her.pursuant to,an adjustment in the base offense level is authorized i f the defendant abused a position of public or private trust in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.the commentary to explains that a position of trust is characterized by professional or managerial discretion,and points out that the trust adjustment applies where the position of trust contributed in some significant way to facilitating the commission or concealment of the offense,cmt.
we have observed that the question of whether an individual occupies a position of trust should be addressed from the perspective of the victim.united states moore,cir quoting united states queen,cir.in order to apply the trust adjustment to bolden,the sentencing court was obliged to first identify the victims of her fraudulent activities.and in this case,the victims were medicaid and the american taxpayers.see united states adam,cir concluding that victims of medicaid fraud were the american taxpayers.as such,the court could apply the trust adjustment to bolden only if she occupied a position of trust as to medicaid.
the psr addressed bolden position of trust only as to emerald health.in its sentencing memorandum,however,and at the sentencing hearing,the government maintained that she occupied a fiduciary relationship as to medicaid,which she abused in committing and concealing the fraud scheme.it took the position that,because of bolden relationship to medicaid,the trust adjustment should be applied to her.the court overruled bolden objection to the trust adjustment,and it adopted the remaining portions of her psr.thus,the court implicitly adopted the government position that bolden occupied a trust relationship as to medicaid.
bolden maintains that the court erred in finding that she occupied a position of trust as to medicaid,asserting that medicaid conferred no discretionary authority on her.as director of operations of emerald health,however,she possessed substantial discretionary authority.medicaid entrusted bolden with thousands of dollars in prospective payments to emerald health,that were to be used for the benefit of its medicaid beneficiaries.and her abuse of that authority contributed significantly to the commission and concealment of the fraud scheme.
we have upheld application of the trust adjustment in situations where physicians have defrauded medicaid.see adam,at.in adam,the adjustment was found appropriate for a physician involved in medicaid fraud because such activity is terribly difficult to detect because physicians exercise enormous discretion.see also united states hoogenboom,cir medical service providers occupy positions of trust with respect to private or public insurers such as medicare within the meaning of guideline.compellingly,the second circuit,in united states wright,cir,has upheld application of the trust adjustment in similar circumstances.in wright,the defendants had embezzled funds from a residence facility.the court observed that public funds were entrusted to the facility,for the benefit of its patients,and the defendants,through their positions at the facility,had embezzled the funds without fear of timely detection by the government,who entrusted them with the funds.id.at.the court concluded that application of the trust adjustment was appropriate in such a situation,when viewed from the standpoint of the governmental agencies that entrusted the funds to the facility management to use them properly for the of the intended beneficiaries.id.as in wright,bolden,through her position at emerald health,was entrusted by medicaid with its funds,and she abused the trust placed in her.thus,the court did not err in finding that bolden occupied a position of trust with respect to medicaid,and we affirm its application of the trust adjustment.
pursuant to the foregoing,we affirm the convictions of the boldens,we affirm the grouping of their fraud and money laundering offenses,and we affirm the application of the trust adjustment to bolden.we reverse the inclusion of the missing invoice costs in bolden fraud loss calculation.finally,we vacate and remand on the fraud loss calculation of bolden and on application of the vulnerable victim adjustment to bolden 
affirmed in part,reversed in part,vacated in part,and remanded 
in referring to the indictment,we mean the superseding indictment,on which the boldens were tried,convicted,and sentenced.
lane was also charged in the indictment.he entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the government,however,and consented to pay in restitution and penalties to medicaid.
because lane,as part of his deferred prosecution agreement,paid in restitution and penalties to medicaid,the government stipulated,for purposes of the boldens sentencing,that full restitution had been made to medicaid.
if the sentencing court factual findings are adequate,the boldens assert that the court clearly erred by a improperly calculating fraud loss b finding that bolden occupied a position of trust and c finding that emerald health residents were vulnerable victims of bolden fraudulent activity.
the boldens challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on several of their convictions,as well as the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the court sentencing rulings.on the conviction issues,we review the facts in the light most favorable to the government with respect to the sentencing issues,we review the facts in the light most favorable to the district court determinations.united states wilkinson,cir because the defendants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence we present the facts in the light most favorable to the government.united states brown,cir evidence underlying a district court sentence is reviewed by viewing the evidence,and inferences drawn therefrom,in the light most favorable to the district court determination.
approximately of emerald health residents were covered by medicaid.
in referring to medicaid,we utilize the term to encompass the dma.
at the time emerald health submitted the bills to medicaid that are involved in this case,the daily prospective payment rates were for ventilator care,approximately for skilled nursing care,approximately and for intermediate nursing care,approximately.
nursing facilities in north carolina actually submit their medicaid bills electronically through electronic data systems eds,a medicaid contractor in raleigh,north carolina.eds,acting on behalf of medicaid,then makes payments to the nursing facilities by wire transfer.
although the boldens personally obtained substantial sums of money from the fraud scheme between and,they failed to report those monies on their income tax returns.as a result,they were each convicted of six counts of filing false federal tax returns.their tax convictions are not on appeal.
although nelson was involved in several aspects of the fraud scheme,he was not charged in the indictment.he entered into a plea agreement with the government and was a key witness in the boldens trial.
bolden also misappropriated cash from emerald health with the assistance of nelson,activity the government characterized as a operation.for example,in august of,nelson enterprises submitted an invoice to emerald health in the sum of,purportedly for the purchase by emerald health of a copying machine.although emerald health paid the invoice,it did not receive the copier.instead,when nelson enterprises received payment from emerald health,nelson gave to bolden and kept for himself.bolden listed this copier purchase as a direct cost on the cost report.
in march of,bolden had nelson backdate three industrial invoices to reflect sales transactions between industrial and emerald health in august of the backdated invoices.the backdated invoices were then included on the cost report,thereby increasing emerald health net receipts from medicaid for that year.
in addition to billing medicaid for patients not in its nursing facility,emerald health falsified its medicaid bills for patients it actually treated.it charged medicaid at the more costly ventilator care rate for medicaid patients,even though such patients actually received less costly intermediate or skilled nursing care.see supra note.
the evidence at trial was that the salaries of the accounting clerks and the physician assistant were improperly reflected as direct costs on the and cost reports.bolden salary,as well as that of the administrative assistant and the maintenance employee,relate to the sentencing proceedings only,and were included in bolden fraud loss calculation.
the of the aequitron invoice was not in evidence at trial.it was used only as relevant conduct for purposes of bolden sentencing.
