background 
plaintiffs,relatives of the decedent,charles hernandez,originally filed this suit in a florida court on july,alleging a cause of action under against the defendants,seminole county,florida,and a number of the county officers and employees.plaintiffs claim that hernandez,a pretrial detainee,died while in the custody of the defendants as a result of their deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.two of the named defendants are debra dube and her professional association,debra dube associates,hereinafter the dube defendants.plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that the dube defendants were under contract with the county to provide medical services to inmates such as hernandez.plaintiffs claim that dube prescribed contraindicated medications to hernandez and that she subsequently failed to transfer him to an appropriate medical facility once his condition deteriorated.
on september,the plaintiffs entered into an agreement with the dube defendants,with a purpose of defeating any possible removal of the case from state court.in exchange for the dube defendants agreement to withhold their consent to removal,the plaintiffs agreed to limit any recovery against dube to the limit of her insurance policy.plaintiffs also agreed not to seek damages against dube in the event that her insurance carrier refused to provide coverage.
shortly thereafter,on november,the other defendants joined in filing a notice of removal in the united states district court for the middle district of florida.the defendants,in their notice of removal,stated that the dube defendants did not consent to removal but that their consent was not required because they were nominal parties as a result of the september agreement.plaintiffs then filed a motion to remand the case to state court,citing a lack of unanimity among the defendants.
on january,the district court held an evidentiary hearing to resolve these issues.after reviewing the september agreement and hearing testimony from counsel about dube continuing interest in the litigation and intent to vigorously defend,the district court concluded that the dube defendants were not nominal parties and that the case should therefore be remanded to state court due to the lack of unanimous consent to removal.defendants challenge that decision on appeal.
ii.discussion 
before we can address the merits of the district court position,we must first decide whether we have jurisdiction over this appeal.as a general rule,we can not review a district court decision remanding a case to state court.specifically,congress has provided that 
an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,except that an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed pursuant to section of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.
d west supp.with one exception not relevant here,d appears to bar appellate review of any remand decision by a district court.the simplicity of the statutory language is misleading,however,because there are a number of judicially created exceptions that provide for appellate review of remand decisions.defining the contours of these exceptions has proven to be an elusive task.consequently,straightforward is about the last word judges attach to d these days in re amoco petroleum additives,cir.
the most notable exception to the bar on appellate review of remand decisions was announced by the supreme court in thermtron products,hermansdorfer,d.the district court there remanded a case to state court,citing concerns about its overcrowded docket.the defendants petitioned the sixth circuit to issue a writ of mandamus directing the district court to retain jurisdiction over the case.they argued that the case was properly removed and that the district court did not have the discretion to remand the case on the grounds asserted.citing d,the sixth circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction to review the district court remand decision.the supreme court reversed.the court recognized that d must be read in pari materia with c,which provides the grounds on which a district court can remand a case to state court the result,the court noted,is that only remands based on grounds specified in c are insulated from review under d.id.at.at.and,because the ground for the district court remand decision was not based on c,the court held that d did not bar appellate review of that decision.id.
defendants rightly do not argue that the exception alluded to in thermtron applies here.c implicitly recognizes two bases upon which a district court in one case a remand when there is a lack of subject matter jurisdiction or a defect other than a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.snapper,redan,cir.the district court based its remand decision on a perceived defect in the removal process,specifically,the defendants failure to satisfy the unanimity requirement of the failure to join all defendants in the petition is a defect in the removal procedure.see in re bethesda mem l,cir.consequently,when a district court remands a case on that basis,its decision is normally insulated from appellate review.see russell american home assur,cir citations omitted noting that a district court remand for lack of unanimity is clearly based on a defect in the removal process.
that conclusion applies with equal force to cases where defendants argued in the district court that a party was either nominal or fraudulently joined.see garbie daimlerchrysler,cir noting that appeals court had no jurisdiction over a remand decision issued over the objections of defendant,who claimed that the plaintiffs who destroyed diversity were fraudulently joined or nominal parties,and holding that removing defendant contrary argument in support of appellate jurisdiction was frivolous tramonte chrysler,cir recognizing that the district court remand decision,which was issued despite defendant claim that another party had been fraudulently joined to defeat diversity,would not ordinarily be subject to review on appeal because it was unquestionably based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see also albert bayerische motorenwerke aktiengesollschaft bmw,cir holding that d bars review of district court decision to remand based on district court finding that the defendants who withheld their consent to removal were not nominal parties nor fraudulently joined to the same effect are those decisions holding that d bars appellate review of a district court remand decision based upon a finding that the amount in controversy was insufficient or that a party whose joinder would destroy diversity was a necessary and indispensable party.see,christopher,cir holding that appellate court lacked jurisdiction to review district court remand decision where the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to the plaintiff failure to show that the requirement had been met arnold state farm fire and cas,cir recognizing that the court lacked jurisdiction to review a district court determination that the requirement was not met where that determination appeared to be premised on a mathematical error smith american states preferred ins,cir dismissing appeal of remand decision for lack of jurisdiction where district court remand decision was premised on its find
