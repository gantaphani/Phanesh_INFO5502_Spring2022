donna sloan appeals the district court judgment affirming the decision of the commissioner of the social security administration ssa denying her application for disability insurance benefits under title ii of the social security act.see c.a new ssa ruling clarifies the extent to which the agency should consider medical opinions from sources other than those deemed acceptable medical sources.the ssa must determine whether the new ruling affects its decision in this case.we reverse and remand.
sloan first applied for benefits in december claiming total disability as a result of depression,anxiety disorders,back pain and migraine headaches.she is a graduate with four semesters of college.her work history includes having been a clerk,a secretary,a file clerk,a store clerk,and a paratransit driver.she reports to have struggled with anxiety and depression since childhood,with a nervous breakdown at age sixteen.she last worked on november,when she was fired by her temporary service agency for absenteeism.
sloan suffered a panic attack on october,which sent her to a hospital emergency room complaining of chest pain and numbness.she had taken nitroglycerin,which had not helped.a doctor diagnosed possible unstable angina with a secondary diagnosis that included anxiety with depression and prescribed effexor and xanax.she returned to the emergency room the next day after suffering an adverse reaction to her new medications.
on october,sloan visited her physician,ben gaumer,an osteopath,complaining of numbness in her arms and chest,problems thinking,and being shaky.gaumer diagnosed anxiety and depression.over the next few months,gaumer adjusted her medications,which included vistaril,tranxene same,and premarin menopausal symptoms.though sloan had ups and downs,gaumer noted several times she was happy and her judgment,insight and memory were normal.gaumer told her during this period her working days were over.he recommended she apply for disability.
in august,gaumer filled out the physician certification section of a form sloan was filing to seek forgiveness of her student loans.he wrote,severe my opinion sloan is totally disabled from this condition and i have no hope of will persist the rest of her life.
in may,gaumer wrote,cont current meds overall,i see definite improvement but not well his last examination of sloan was september,when he described her as sad and anxious and suffering from depression and anxiety,along with nightmares and diarrhea gaumer declined to give a diagnosis of sloan mental condition for the social security proceedings as he is not a specialist.
at the request of the disability determination service dds,sloan visited greg cohen,in february for a disability examination which focused primarily on her physical symptoms.cohen found sloan did have significant migraines from time to time she did not have any significant problems in terms of a back injury or back related problems and any disability that she has is probably more related to psychiatric problems if at all and neurological problems and i believe those probably would benefit from continued workup.
in march,also at the request of dds,sloan underwent a psychological evaluation by jennifer mac connell,a psychologist,and richard martin,a licensed psychologist in their report,mac connell and martin concluded sloan had the cognitive capabilities required to perform unskilled work,and her judgment was intact 
given her social and vocational history,she will not likely experience significant problems in her relationships with,supervisors,or the public.however,her memory,attention,and concentration abilities may vary somewhat as a function of her overall emotional condition.in summary,sloan appears to have the intellectual abilities to handle a number of unskilled vocational options.
emphases added.they rated her global assessment of functions gaf as having been mild impairment for the prior year,and dropping to moderate impairment at the time she was tested.though mac connell and martin made reference to sloan emotional condition,they did not comment on how they thought it bore on her ability to perform any sort of work.
a psychologist,laura mutchler,examined sloan in october.gaumer had suggested seeing a psychiatrist,but she could not pay the costs out of pocket,and was instead referred to mutchler,who assigned sloan a gaf of serious impairment.she noted sloan was struggling with her decision to apply for disability benefits.she recommended individual therapy for sloan and an assessment of her medications.mutchler report was also signed by a psychiatrist.
in accordance with mutchler advice,sloan began seeing charlotte kraai,a licensed mental health social worker,in november.they met for a total of ten sessions over the next seven months.in a february report,kraai described sloan as debilitated and assessed her as having a gaf of.she wrote 
little has changed in the time she has been coming to therapy.if she continues to attend therapy and take prescribed medications prescribed appropriately by her physician,she can make some improvement through continuing to challenge irrational beliefs and continue teaching her coping skills with probably very slow progress based on her initial response to therapy.
kraai analysis of sloan current condition was restriction of daily living activities,severely impaired social functioning,and deficiency of concentration.kraai predicted decompensation in work or worklike settings.high likelihood as much of stress that contributed to current mental distress is workplace related.she rated sloan mental ability to remember and understand instructions,procedures and locations as difficult or impossible for her.she opined that sloan would probably have difficulty relating to authority figures and as she easily feels threatened pressured and could quickly become overwhelmed and rapidly decompensate.kraai analysis was by a psychiatrist,kent kunze,who wrote next to his signature,reviewed but not evaluated by me.
patti campidilli,a licensed clinical social worker,had counseled sloan earlier,from november to february,and from july until october.in may,sloan decided to return to her after being dissatisfied with the counseling she received from kraai and finding campidilli would charge her a lower fee as a former patient.they met monthly from june to december.campidilli noted at the outset in june that sloan had a difficult time making decisions,concentrating,and remembering information regarding dates and times.in a january report,campidilli wrote 
i believe donna would have a very difficult time working at an acceptable pace for any employer.she tends to tire easily and has very little energy to perform tasks.her inability to concentrate or focus would also make it difficult for her to work for someone.donna tends to worry,almost obsessively,about what others are thinking of her and her performance.this kind of worry would be a hindrance to her job.i believe she would continue to be quite nervous and would,therefore,have a hard time completing her job duties with confidence and accuracy.campidilli also noted she did not think sloan was seeing her doctor as often as she should because she is completely responsible for those expenses.
she concluded,i believe donna will never be able to work full time again.at the present time the limitations of her depression combined with her physical condition would make it quite difficult for her to work at any job for any consistent amount of time.
on january,sloan completed a daily activities questionnaire,in which she reported she regularly did laundry,cleaned dishes,changed sheets,vacuumed,took out the trash,and washed her car she occasionally cooked that she enjoyed reading,listening to the radio,doing some family history work on her computer,and watching movies and television shows and she lived with her mother,whom she took grocery shopping once weekly.she also reported going to the bank,the beauty shop,her doctors offices,and the pharmacy.overall,she reported as to her ability to drive an automobile,as necessary,several times a week.
on the other hand,sloan reported in the same document she no longer performed an
