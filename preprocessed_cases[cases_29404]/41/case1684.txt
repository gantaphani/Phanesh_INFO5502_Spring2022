background 
on june,forsyth was found lying on the floor of his wife bedroom,with the bodies of his wife and their three children lying on the bed therein.he had gunshot wounds to his head and wrist.forsyth now suffers from amnesia and can not remember much of what occurred on june,including any events related to the murders.
william robert mcmordie,a clinical neuropsychologist,interviewed forsyth four times in june and july of,altogether spending about seven and hours with him.mcmordie informed trial counsel that,in his professional opinion,forsyth was competent to stand trial and that mcmordie evaluation of forsyth did not support an insanity defense.
loren olson,a psychiatrist,saw forsyth on about ten occasions while he was still in the hospital following the murders and before he was indicted.olson testified that forsyth understood the gravity of his legal situation.olson also stated that if a defendant is amnesic for the events surrounding an alleged crime,it is impossible to determine whether he understood the nature and quality of his actions or whether he had the mental capacity to know the difference between right and wrong.
mark souza,a psychiatrist,stated that forsyth amnesia was real and would prevent him from testifying about the events of june.souza also testified that forsyth was aware of his legal circumstances and that souza knew of no impairment to forsyth ability to communicate with his counsel other than the amnesia.souza stated that he could not form an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty about possible conditions of insanity or diminished responsibility because forsyth had no memory of his mental state regarding the events of june,and because the other available evidence of forsyth state of mind was insufficient to form the basis of an opinion regarding those matters.
michael taylor,a psychiatrist retained by the state,evaluated forsyth on october.it was his opinion that forsyth was not suffering from any type of mental disease or defect at the time of the murders and that he was capable of distinguishing between right and wrong at that time.although taylor did not directly communicate his opinions to trial counsel before forsyth trial,trial counsel assumed from the fact that the state did not call him to testify at the competency hearing that taylor agreed that forsyth was competent to stand trial.
william logan,a forensic psychiatrist,interviewed forsyth for about six hours on october,and reviewed a number of documents related to the trial and some other documents possibly relevant to forsyth psychological state.he opined that forsyth was not competent to stand trial.he further opined that forsyth suffered from a major depressive disorder complicated by psychotic features at the time of the murders and that this mental disease prevented him from being able to tell the difference between right and wrong or to appreciate the nature and quality of his conduct.
prior to the murders,forsyth had had extensive contact with psychological professionals.a psychological report completed following the murders indicated that forsyth had received psychotherapy since for anger and violent impulses,marital and family problems,and general depression.it is unclear how regular forsyth visits were in the,but after his youngest son died in a bicycle accident in,he was placed on an medication,in addition to receiving ongoing counseling.after forsyth pleaded guilty to assaulting his son with a paddle in,the school board asked taylor to evaluate whether forsyth should be reinstated as a bus driver.taylor reported no evidence of any psychiatric disorder and recommended that forsyth be reinstated.the psychologist that forsyth was seeing noted in december that forsyth had been chronically depressed for at least one year.forsyth completed a minnesota multiphasic personality inventory mmpi ii test in may,apparently in connection with impending divorce and custody proceedings.the results were evaluated by two psychologists,one in and one in,both of whom said that the results were not consistent with either major depressive disorder or any other major psychiatric illness.
as recounted earlier,the iowa court of appeals rejected the claims raised in forsyth appeals from the denial of relief.in the present proceeding,the district court held that the iowa court had not unreasonably applied any federal law,nor had it unreasonably found any facts in light of the evidence before it.forsyth ault,july.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court conclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.malcom houston,cir.
a state prisoner is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus from a federal court only if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.thus,the state court decision must be objectively unreasonable,and not merely incorrect,for us to grant the writ.lockyer andrade,d.we presume that the state court findings of fact are correct,and the prisoner has the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.e.
a defendant sixth amendment right to counsel is violated if counsel performance was so inadequate that the resulting breakdown in the adversarial process undermines confidence in the result of the proceeding.bell cone,d.counsel performance is constitutionally deficient if it is objectively unreasonable and results in actual prejudice.malcom,at.prejudice exists only if there is a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different had counsel performance been adequate.id.there is a strong presumption that counsel strategic choices were reasonable.mcgurk stenberg,cir.
competency to stand trial 
forsyth argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to argue adequately that he was incompetent to stand trial.a defendant is incompetent to stand trial if he is unable to understand the charges he faces and the consequences involved or he is unable to communicate with counsel with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.cooper oklahoma,d.a defendant is presumed competent and bears the burden of proving otherwise.iowa rieflin,iowa see cooper,at.noting that such rules are not proscribed by the constitution.
trial counsel primary argument at forsyth hearing was that forsyth amnesia rendered him unable to assist in his own defense.at forsyth relief hearing,trial counsel testified that the mental health experts were asked generally about forsyth competency and that they focused on his amnesia as bearing on that question.despite the expert testimony that forsyth amnesia was real,amnesia alone is not sufficient under iowa law to establish incompetency to stand trial.see iowa emerson,iowa.accordingly,the iowa court rejected forsyth claim.
forsyth now contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that forsyth delusion that his family was still alive rendered him incompet
