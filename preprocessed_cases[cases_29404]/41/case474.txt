opinion of the court 
hospitals that are disadvantaged by their geographic location may reclassify to a different wage index area for certain medicare reimbursement purposes by applying for redesignation to the medicare geographic classification review board board.section of the medicare,medicaid,and schip balanced budget refinement act of,stat.section,enacted ten years after the board was established,creates a separate mechanism by which qualifying hospitals located in urban areas shall be treat ed as rural for the same reimbursement purposes.to avoid supposed strategic maneuvering by hospitals,the secretary of the department of health and human services issued a regulation providing that hospitals with section status can not receive additional reclassification by the board on the basis of that status.see a iii reclassification rule.
geisinger community medical center geisinger,a hospital located in an urban area,received rural designation under section but was unable to obtain further reclassification by the board pursuant to the reclassification rule.geisinger sued the secretary,sylvia matthews burwell the administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms,marilyn tavenner and the chairman of the board,robert eaton,in their official capacities collectively,appellees,challenging the reclassification rule as unlawful.the district court upheld the regulation under chevron,natural res.def.council,and granted summary judgment in favor of appellees.because we conclude that section is unambiguous,we will reverse.
the medicare program provides a system of health insurance for eligible elderly and disabled individuals under title xvii of the social security act,et.under d,or subsection d,hospitals are reimbursed for inpatient costs at fixed rates for categories of treatment through an inpatient prospective payment system ipps.calculating inpatient reimbursement payments under ipps is a process.first,the secretary establishes a nationwide standardized rate for all subsection d hospitals located in an urban or rural regional area.d a d.second,among other variables,cms adjusts the standardized rate by a wage index that reflects the difference between hospitals local wages and costs and the national average.id.d e.
a hospital wage index is the wage index the secretary assigns to the specific geographic area where the hospital is located.hospitals located in rural areas receive a wage index that applies to all rural areas in their state.hospitals located in urban areas are grouped and treated as a single labor market based on the area,known as the core based statistical area cbsa,in which they are physically located.higher wage indices,which reflect higher labor costs in relation to the national average,correspond to higher reimbursement rates.thus,the wage index is a significant determinant of the way hospitals are reimbursed for inpatient care costs.
ipps may yield inequitable results where,for instance,a rural hospital lower wage index does not accurately reflect its labor costs because it competes for the same labor pool as hospitals in a nearby but higher urban area.thus,in and,congress amended the medicare act to allow a hospital to seek reclassification from its wage index area to a nearby wage index area if it meets certain criteria.see robert wood johnson.hosp.thompson,cir explaining the history of the board reclassification system.and in,because only a limited number of hospitals were reclassified under those laws,congress established the board to systematically decide hospitals various reclassification requests.see d.the board shall consider the application of any subsection d hospital requesting that the secretary change the hospital geographic classification for purposes of determining the hospital average standardized rate or wage index.id.d c.congress gave the secretary authority to formulate guidelines to be used by the board in rendering its decisions.id.d d i the secretary shall publish guidelines to be utilized by the board in rendering decisions on applications submitted under this paragraph.
under those guidelines,which are generally listed at et,a hospital seeking reclassification must show proximity to the area to which it seeks redesignation,a,b that the hospital average hourly wage ahw is higher than other hospitals in the area in which it is located,id.d iii and that the hospital ahw is comparable to hospitals in the area to which it seeks redesignation,id.d iv.for all three criteria,there are more relaxed standards for hospitals located in rural areas.for instance,the proximity rule requires that urban hospitals be located within miles of the area to which it seeks reclassification,but only requires rural hospitals to be within miles.id.b.in addition,certain special status hospitals,such as rural referral centers rrcs,are exempt from the first and second requirements.see d d iii a,d.
in,ten years after the board was established,congress enacted section.section allows hospitals located in urban areas to be treated as hospitals located in rural areas for the purpose of determining three aspects of medicare reimbursement inpatient reimbursement,d e outpatient reimbursement,id.t and critical access hospital eligibility,id.c b i.only the first component,which amends subsection d,is at issue here.it reads in full 
d is amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph 
e i for purposes of this subsection,not later than days after the receipt of an application in a form and manner determined by the secretary from a subsection d hospital described in clause ii,the secretary shall treat the hospital as being located in the rural area as defined in paragraph d of the state in which the hospital is located.
ii for purposes of clause i,a subsection d hospital described in this clause is a subsection d hospital that is located in an urban area as defined in paragraph d and satisfies any of the following criteria 
i the hospital is located in a rural census tract of a metropolitan statistical area as determined under the most recent modification of the goldsmith modification,originally published in the federal register on february.
ii the hospital is located in an area designated by any law or regulation of such state as a rural area or is designated by such state as a rural hospital.
iii the hospital would qualify as a rural,regional,or national referral center under paragraph c or as a sole community hospital under paragraph d if the hospital were located in a rural area.
iv the hospital meets such other criteria as the secretary may specify.
id.d.in the conference report accompanying section,congress highlighted several benefits of a hospital receiving section status 
hospitals qualifying under this section shall be eligible to qualify for all categories and designations available to rural hospitals,including sole community,medicare dependent,critical access,and referral centers.additionally,qualifying hospitals shall be eligible to apply to the medicare geographic classification review board for geographic reclassification to another area.the board shall regard such hospitals as rural and as entitled to the exceptions extended to referral centers and sole community hospitals,if such hospitals are so designated.
the secretary,in implementing section,was concerned that the statute would create an opportunity for some urban hospitals to take advantage of the board process.see.she was afraid that some hospitals,claiming to be disadvantaged by their urban status,could first be reclassified as rural under section and thereby receiv e the benefits afforded to rural hospitals,and then subsequently claim disadvantage from that rural status and seek reclassification through the board back to the urban area for purposes of their standardized amount and wage index.id.as a result,the secretary issued the reclassification rule 
an urban hospital that has been granted redesignation as rural under the regulation implementing section can not receive an additional reclassification by the board based on this acquired rural status for a year in which such redesignation is in effect.
a iii.under the reclassification rule,a hospital with section status can not be reclassified by the board to a different wage index area for any year the hospital maintains that status.to seek reclassification by the board,therefore,a subsection d hospital must cancel its section designation.
geisinger is a,general,acute care hospital physically located in the scranton wilkes barre hazelton,pa cbsa.it applied for designation as a section hospital and was approved,effective june.it also applied for designation as an rrc and was approved,effective july,on august,geisinger cancelled its section status,effective october.
on august,geisinger submitted two applications to the board to redesignate to a different urban area,effective october,on the basis of its section status,a primary application as a rural hospital to reclassify to the allentown bethlehem easton,pa nj cbsa allentown cbsa and on the basis of its cancelled section status,effective october,a secondary application as an urban hospital to reclassify to the east stroudsburg,pa cbsa east stroudsburg cbsa,which would be considered only if the former was denied.geisinger estimates that reclassification to the allentown cbsa would increase its reimbursement payments by approximately million per year and to the east stroudsburg cbsa by approximately million per year.
the mile distance between geisinger and the allentown cbsa fails to meet the proximity requirement under the secretary rules for hospitals located in urban areas,but it meets the more relaxed criteria for hospitals located in rural areas.see id.b.but for the reclassification rule,therefore,geisinger primary application as a hospital with section status would be considered by the board using the rural standards.however,because it was l eft with no choice but to try to comply with the secretary illegal regulatory scheme or lose millions of dollars in reimbursement,geisinger cancelled its section status so that the board could alternatively consider its application to the east stroudsburg cbsa,whose requirements it could meet as an urban hospital appellant br.at.
on september,while its applications were pending before the board,geisinger filed a complaint in the district court for the middle district of pennsylvania.count i alleged that the reclassification rule violates section.count ii alleged that the reclassification rule violates the administrative procedure act apa,et.geisinger sought a declaratory judgment that the reclassification rule was unlawful and a permanent injunction,an order of mandamus,or both,prohibiting the agency from applying the reclassification rule to its pending applications and ordering it to apply the rural standards.
the parties filed for summary judgment and the district court granted appellees motion on december.see geisinger cmty.med.ctr.burwell,civ,wl.the district court first explained that it had subject matter jurisdiction because geisinger challenged the legality of the reclassification rule itself and not the agency decisions on its applications,over which the medicare act precludes judicial review.see d c iii ii providing that board decisions may be appealed to the secretary and that t he decision of the secretary shall be final and shall not be subject to judicial review.on the merits,the district court held that because congress did not expressly provide that section extends to the board reclassification process,and because congress granted the secretary broad authority to administer that process,section was ambiguous at step one of chevron,at.at step two,the district court concluded that the secretary decision to eliminate the potential for inconsistent reclassifications of the same hospital for the same period and other unintended consequences the reclassification rule was a reasonable accommodation of section and therefore should be upheld.geisinger,wl,at.geisinger timely appealed.
on february,the board did not treat geisinger as located in the rural area of pennsylvania and denied geisinger primary application for reclassification to the allentown cbsa.it approved geisinger secondary application for reclassification to the east stroudsburg cbsa on the basis that geisinger had cancelled its section status.reinforcing the application of the reclassification rule,the administrator of cms affirmed the board decision on june,
the district court exercised jurisdiction under and and et.we exercise appellate jurisdiction under.
the court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.montone city of jersey city,cir.under the apa,a reviewing court may hold unlawful or set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions that are found to be,inter alia,not in accordance with law.while we usually afford deference to an agency interpretation of a statute it is charged with administering,when we are called upon to resolve pure questions of law by statutory interpretation,we decide the issue de novo without deferring to the agency.port auth.trans hudson sec y,dep t of labor,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
because this case concerns a challenge to an agency construction of a statute,we use the familiar analysis set forth in chevron.first,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.we proceed to step two if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue.id.at.then,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute,and the regulation must be given deference unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.
the precise question at issue here is whether the secretary is required to treat hospitals with section status like hospitals physically located in rural areas for purposes of board reclassification.id.at.based on the plain language of the statute,we conclude that congress has unambiguously expressed its intent that the secretary shall do so.because congress intent is clear,we complete our analysis at step one and do not proceed to step two to determine whether the reclassification rule is a permissible construction of section.
to determine whether a statute is unambiguous under step one,court s should always turn first to one,cardinal canon before all others we have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.bank germain,u.that is,because we presume congress expresses its intent through the ordinary meaning of the words it uses,an exercise of statutory interpretation must begin by examining the plain and literal language of the statute.see united states geiser,cir.and w here the statutory language is plain and unambiguous,further inquiry is not required.rosenberg xm ventures,cir in re price.state police fed.credit union,cir we are to begin with the text of a provision and,if its meaning is clear,end there.
while we also read the language in its broader context of the statute as a whole,see id.at,this court made clear in united states geiser that legislative history should not be considered at chevron s tep o ne,at in re phila.newspapers,llc,cir where the statutory language is unambiguous,the court should not consider statutory purpose or legislative history.following the court established precedent on this matter,we will not consider legislative history in our step one analysis 
with this framework in mind,we turn to the text of section.the relevant portion reads for purposes of this subsection the secretary shall treat the hospital with section status as being located in the rural area as defined in paragraph d of the state in which the hospital is located.d e i.the parties make several and structural arguments supporting their interpretation of the statute that we group into three categories and discuss in turn.
geisinger first argument relates to section opening clause,f or purposes of this subsection.id.the subsection to which the statute indisputably refers is subsection d,which,as discussed,addresses a wide range of rules for inpatient care reimbursement under the medicare program,including the requirements for calculating the standardized rate for rural and urban regional areas,id.d d adjusting the wage index on the basis of a hospital local geographic area,id.d and administering the board reclassification process,id.d.geisinger alleges that this clause,which explicitly directs the secretary to apply section for purposes of subsection d,requires the secretary to apply section to subsection d,the board reclassification process.we agree.
one of our most basic interpretive canons is that a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions,so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant.corley united states,alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted see also rosenberg,at t he preferred construction of a statute and its regulations is one that gives meaning to all provisions.here,congress must have intended that section apply comprehensively over subsection d,including subsection d,because the language f or purposes of this subsection would not have any purpose or meaning if it did not.
appellees counter that because section is not applicable to every paragraph within subsection d,whether section must apply to the board reclassification process is ambiguous.for instance,the command that a hospital shall be treated as rural is not applicable to subsection d,which requires the secretary to make certain publications in the federal register,d or subsection d,which limits administrative and judicial review,id.d.in other words,there are some subsection d provisions for which the hospital rural status is irrelevant.
but this does not contravene congress intent demonstrated by using the clause f or purposes of this subsection that section governs everywhere it is applicable it does not contravene congress intent that section governs everywhere a hospital rural status is relevant.babbitt sweet home chap.of cmtys.for a great,t he definition of take in a provision of the endangered species act applies f or the purposes of this chapter,that is,it governs the meaning of the word as used everywhere in the act.as discussed,a hospital geographic location has a dispositive effect on the hospital designated standardized rate and wage index.in turn,it has a dispositive effect on the board reclassification process,the statutory purpose of which is to redesignate the hospital from rural to urban or vice versa for purposes of receiving a new standardized rate or wage index.see d c.this bolsters our conclusion that congress intended section to apply to these specific processes.thus,we must read section as mandating that for purposes of board reclassification,which is inextricably intertwined with a hospital rural or urban designation,the board shall treat the hospital as rural.
the district court disagreed with this construction,concluding that the statute does not discuss the board reclassification process at all,nor does it discuss the intersection of redesignation and geographic reclassification under the medicare act.geisinger,wl,at see also appellees br.at arguing that section is silent with regard to board reclassification.appellees further contend that if congress had intended that subsection d hospitals be able to take advantage of both reclassification procedures almost simultaneously,piling exception on top of exception,then it would have done so more clearly.appellees br.at.
in other words,the district court and appellees read ambiguity into the statute because of what it does not say,rather than read it for what it plainly says.to be sure,congress did not explicitly provide that section applies to subsection d.but it did explicitly provide that section applies for purposes of subsection d,which covers subsection d and had covered it for ten years before section was amended.to comprehensively amend subsection d which contains dozens of paragraphs and subparagraphs concerning inpatient reimbursement,many of which involve a hospital rural or urban status rather than each provision within it,congress necessarily used broad language.still,a s a general matter of statutory construction,a term in a statute is not ambiguous merely because it is broad in scope.see in re phila.newspapers,at see also diamond chakrabarty,broad general language is not necessarily ambiguous when congressional objectives require broad terms.if the phrase was not intended to cover subsection d,contrary to the literal reading of the text,then congress would have noted which paragraphs of subsection d were specifically excluded or included.it did not.and despite appellees attempt to infer intent against layering the two reclassification processes,the court can not ignore the plain language of the statute.our task is to apply the text,not to improve upon it.pavelic leflore marvel entm t.
next,geisinger points to the portion of the text mandating that hospitals with section status be treated as being located in the rural area as defined in paragraph d of the state where the hospital is located.d e i.paragraph d defines rural area as any area outside an urban area.id.d d.because there is only one definition of rural within subsection d,geisinger argues,congress must have intended that the board evaluate applications from hospitals with status under section in the same way it evaluates applications from hospitals physically located in rural areas.
appellees argue,however,that geisinger interpretation is permissible under the plain language of the statute,but it is not compelled.another interpretation of section,they reason,is that the secretary must treat section hospitals as rural for all inpatient reimbursement purposes and,therefore,must not reclassify those hospitals as urban under the board reclassification process.
to be sure,a provision is ambiguous only where the disputed language is reasonably susceptible of different interpretations.in re phila.newspapers,at internal quotation marks omitted.but just because a particular provision may be,by itself,susceptible to differing constructions does not mean that the provision is therefore ambiguous rather,a provision is ambiguous when,despite a studied examination of the statutory context,the natural reading of a provision remains elusive.in re price,at.here,the natural reading of section and the statutory scheme reinforces geisinger view.
section does not say that we can not reclassify the section hospital as urban.it says we must treat the section hospital as rural for purposes of subsection d,including subsection d.this means that section hospitals must be able to participate in the board reclassification process and seek redesignation from their current location to another location for purposes of receiving a new standardized rate or wage index.to this end,section mandates that hospitals with section status be treated as rural,which has meaning and implications under the medicare act.see supra part thus,hospitals with section status should apply as being located in the rural area of their state and be evaluated by the board under the more relaxed standards regularly applied to rural hospitals.considering this broader,contextual view together with the text,in re price,at,we find the statute unambiguous.appellees view that section hospitals can not be reclassified as urban would,in effect,prohibit hospitals with section status from reclassifying under subsection d,contrary to the plain and natural reading of the statute.
third,and finally,geisinger focuses on section command that the secretary shall treat hospitals with section status as rural.d e i emphasis added.geisinger argues that the shall language in section must be viewed as mandatory.see,united states monsanto,u.indeed,t he word shall is ordinarily the language of command.alabama bozeman,internal quotation marks omitted.
appellees do not dispute that section uses mandatory language,nor do we.appellees argue,rather,that because congress granted the secretary authority to promulgate guidelines for the board reclassification process,see d d,the reclassification rule was a permissible and necessary exercise of that authority in the supposed gap that section created.appellees emphasize that n othing in section constrains the secretary broad discretion to establish criteria for board reclassification,which is precisely the type of legislative that courts entrust to an agency sound discretion.appellees br.at quoting santomenno ex rel.john hancock trust john hancock life ins,cir.
but this authority was granted in subsection d,which,again,covers the board reclassification process.while the secretary is unquestionably authorized to issue guidelines regarding board reclassification,to design the proximity standards for urban versus rural hospitals,it does not follow that the secretary is authorized to disregard the plain language of section.rather,section mandate that the secretary shall treat section hospitals as rural without adding any discretionary language as congress used in subsection d and elsewhere in section itself,see d e i referencing the receipt of an application in a form and manner determined by the secretary id.d e ii iv establishing as the last criterion for section eligibility any other criteria as the secretary may specify,lends itself to the opposite conclusion.w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.russello united states,alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.congress could have granted the secretary discretion to administer section.it did not.rather,it used commanding language and the court must give that language effect,notwithstanding the secretary independent authority to develop guidelines used in the board reclassification process.
section refers to subsection d in its entirety,which includes the board reclassification process requires the secretary to treat section status hospitals as rural,which has a singular definition and implications under the medicare act and uses mandatory language shall.altogether,we read section to reflect congress unambiguous intent on the precise question at issue,chevron,at for subsection d purposes,including administering board applications for wage index reclassification,the secretary shall treat section hospitals as located in the rural area of the state.because congress intent is clear,we end our inquiry here and do not reach chevron step two.see id.at if a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.
congress has unambiguously expressed its intent that the secretary shall treat section hospitals as rural for board reclassification purposes.see d e i.we conclude,therefore,that the reclassification rule is unlawful and reverse the district court order granting appellees summary judgment motion.
the majority offers a reading of section.in fact,the majority may even offer the most persuasive interpretation of this statutory provision.however,it is not this court job to adopt what it believes to be the best reading of the statute.instead,we must use the familiar analysis set forth in chevron.majority opinion at.under this doctrine,we must first decide whether or not congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,natural res.def.council.if we conclude that the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific question at issue,the court must then consider whether the agency approach is based on a permissible construction of the statute.see,id.at.chevron deference is premised on the idea that where congress has left a gap or ambiguity in a statute within an agency jurisdiction,that agency has the power to fill or clarify the relevant provisions.santomenno ex rel.john hancock trust john hancock life ins,cir quoting core commnc ns,verizon,cir,cert.denied.accordingly,the court must leave undisturbed a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies that were committed to the agency care by the statute unless it appears from the statute or its legislative history that the accommodation is not one that congress would have sanctioned.chevron,at citation omitted.we must defer to an agency reasonable construction of a statute whether or not it is the only possible interpretation or even the one a court might think best.holder martinez gutierrez,citing chevron,at.because i believe that section is ambiguous and that the reclassification rule constitutes a permissible interpretation of this statutory provision,i must respectfully dissent.
section refers to subsection d in its entirety which includes subsection d,expressly requires the secretary to treat a section hospital as being located in the rural area as defined in subsection d d of the state in which the hospital is located,and,in the process,uses mandatory language,provides that the secretary shall treat the hospital as being located in a rural area.id.at.even if section unambiguously requires that a section hospital be treated as though it were a hospital located in a rural area for purposes of subsection d,it does not follow that this statutory provision unambiguously requires the secretary and the board to consider applications filed by section hospitals under the same exact criteria the secretary adopted to govern reclassification applications filed by hospitals physically located in rural areas.
i agree with the district court as well as the united states district court for the district of connecticut that section is silent as to whether hospitals reclassified as rural under section must be considered eligible for board reclassification pursuant to subsection d see lawrence mem l hosp.burwell,civ.jba,wl,at,geisinger cmty.med.ctr.burwell,d,wl,at lawrence mem l hosp.burwell,d.section does not expressly address the specific criteria that must be satisfied in order to obtain board reclassification.even though it contains mandatory language,this statutory provision does not expressly direct the secretary or the board to treat section hospitals exactly the same as hospitals physically located in rural areas as part of the board reclassification process.in fact,the provision does not address the board reclassification process at all nor does it take into account the intersection or relationship between board reclassification under subsection d,on the one hand,and section reclassification,on the other hand.
according to the majority,the district court and appellees have read ambiguity into the statute based on what it does not say,as opposed to what it plainly says.however,what it does not say id.at is of special significance here given congress creation of two reclassification mechanisms.both section and subsection d effectively serve as exceptions to the general principle that a hospital reimbursement is tied to its physical location.does section unambiguously grant hospitals like geisinger the right to take advantage of both reclassification procedures almost simultaneously,piling exception on top of exception and to do so under the same board reclassification standards that otherwise apply to hospitals physically located in rural areas appellees brief at.given the statutory silence,the answer to this question must be no.according to appellees,section could reasonably be read as a directive for the secretary to treat section hospitals as rural for all purposes,thereby prohibiting any further reclassification under subsection d.while this may not be the best reading of the statutory provision,the majority goes too far by claiming that it is contrary to the plain and natural reading of this provision.after all,section broadly applies to subsection d and states,inter alia,that the secretary shall treat the hospital as being located in the rural area of the state.congress,in any event,left what could only be considered a gap between two distinct reclassification mechanisms,which the secretary attempted to fill by adopting the reclassification rule.santomenno,at citation omitted.in fact,congress delegated to the secretary broad discretionary authority over the board r
