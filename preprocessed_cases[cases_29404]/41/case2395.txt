a class of medicare beneficiaries the beneficiaries,whose claims for coverage of their health care services were denied based on local coverage determinations lcds challenge rules issued by the secretary of health and human services the secretary which give criteria to contractors for adopting lcds.the beneficiaries contend that the criteria governing the lcds are substantive rules required to be promulgated under either the notice and comment requirements of the administrative procedures act apa,b and c,or the promulgation requirements of the medicare act.the district court held that the unpublished criteria are not subject to the formal rulemaking requirements of the apa and the medicare act because they are interpretive rules.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
a.the medicare act and lcds 
the medicare act creates a health insurance program providing benefits to eligible elderly and disabled individuals.title xviii of the social security act.parts a and b provide coverage for various items and services,but exclude payment for items and services that are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury a a emphasis added.
medicare is administered nationally by the center for medicare and medicaid services cms.cms contracts with private insurance companies,who together with local peer review organizations collectively contractors or medicare contractors process claims for medicare beneficiaries.essentially,a medicare claim submitted for payment is approved or denied by a medicare contractor in making coverage decisions,medicare contractors rely on national coverage determinations ncds and local coverage determinations lcds.the secretary adopts ncds to exclude certain items and services from coverage on a national level that are not reasonable and necessary under the agency interpretation of the medicare statute.see f b.these determinations are binding on all medicare contractors nationwide.when no ncd applies to a claim,medicare contractors must still apply the reasonable and necessary limitation of the medicare statute in determining whether to pay a claim and at what amount.the secretary requires medicare contractors to use lcds to aid in this,when the contractor identifies an item or service that is never covered in certain circumstances and wishes to establish automated review or when widespread,significant risk to medicare funds dictates.program integrity manual pim ch.lcds are used only on a basis and may differ between contractors in different regions of the country.f b.the secretary has issued guidelines for contractors to follow in creating lcds.it is these guidelines,giving criteria for the creation of lcds,that are at issue in this appeal.
the guidelines are currently contained in the secretary program integrity manual pim the pom is a compilation of guidelines which cms issues to instruct medicare contractors on how to conduct medical review of medicare claims submitted by medicare providers and suppliers for payment.neither the pim,nor the individual guidelines in question,are published in accordance with formal apa rulemaking procedures.
b.the class action 
beneficiaries are a nationwide class whose claims either have been denied or will be denied based on lcds they brought suit in district court in challenging two particular provisions of the pim concerning lcds.section,coverage provisions in lcds,gives guidelines for when a service may be covered by a contractor pim ch.section,least costly alternative,requires contractors to only partially pay for an item or service that substantially exceeds the cost of what is required for treatment.pim ch.contractors must apply this principle when determining payment for durable medical equipment dme and may apply it to services,as well.id.
the medicare beneficiaries allege the secretary violated the apa,b and c,and the medicare act,by failing to provide notice and comment prior to promulgating the pim provisions governing lcds.the beneficiaries and the secretary filed for summary judgment.the district court granted the secretary motion and denied the beneficiaries motion,holding that section is both a procedural and interpretive rule,and section is interpretive and not binding with the force and effect of law therefore,neither section was subject to the notice and comment rulemaking requirements of the apa or of the medicare statute.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the determination that an agency rule is interpretive and not legislative as a matter of law see hemp indus.ass dea hemp industries,cir ellison robertson,cir.
the apa requires agencies to advise the public through a notice in the federal register of the terms or substance of a proposed substantive rule,allowing the public a period to comment.see b and c.this is termed the notice and comment requirement of the apa.th e requirement is designed to give interested persons,through written submissions and oral presentations,an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.chief prob.officers of california shalala probation officers,cir.generally,t he procedural safeguards of the apa help ensure that government agencies are accountable and their decisions are reasoned.sequoia orange yeutter,cir.
the notice and comment requirement,however,does not apply to interpretative rules,general statements of policy,or rules of agency organization,procedure,or practice.b a.the singular question we are asked to address is whether the secretary pim provisions constitute substantive rules subject to formal rulemaking requirements or whether the manual provisions are interpretive and thus exempt.
interpretive rules under the apa do not have the force of law 
in shalala guernsey mem l,d,the supreme court described an interpretive rule as one issued by an agency to advise the public of the agency construction of the statutes and rules which it administers.the ninth circuit has put it this way in general terms,interpretive rules merely explain,but do not add to,the substantive law that already exists in the form of a statute or legislative rule.legislative rules,on the other hand,create rights,impose obligations,or effect a change in existing law pursuant to authority delegated by congress.hemp industries,at cir internal citations omitted 
hemp industries cites with approval the circuit framework for distinguishing between interpretive and legislative rules set out in american mining congress mine safety health admin.american mining.hemp industries,at.specifically,the ninth circuit agreed that legislative rules have the force of law,while interpretive rules do not,and adopted a test for determining whether a rule has the force of law 
when,in the absence of the rule,there would not be an adequate legislative basis for enforcement action 
when the agency has explicitly invoked its general legislative authority or 
when the rule effectively amends a prior legislative rule.
adequate legislative basis 
hemp industries says if there is no legislative basis for enforcement action on third parties without the rule,then the rule necessarily creates new rights and imposes new obligations.this makes it legislative.at.as an example,american mining pointed to of the securities exchange act.that provision,governing proxy authority,proscribes no specific that in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe.american mining,at quoting b.absent the sec promulgation of proxy rules,therefore,the statute would be an empty would provide no legislative basis for the enforcement of anything at all.the american mining case itself provides another example where there was an inadequate legislative basis for enforcement without the rule in question.the statute in that case required an operator to maintain such records as the secretary may reasonably require id.
in contrast,the medicare statute does contain a standard for approval of claims apart from the pim provisions and the lcds.if the pim provisions and resulting lcds did not exist,medicare contractors would still have an overarching duty to deny claims for items and services that are not reasonable and necess
