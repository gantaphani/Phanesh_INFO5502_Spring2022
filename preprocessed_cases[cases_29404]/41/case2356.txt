we consider whether a habeas petition must be granted when a state court jury does not separately determine whether a sexually violent predator suffers from a mental condition that renders him dangerous beyond his control.
in,warren serving in the united states navy in violent sexual offenses against three girls.rose was,pled guilty,and received a sentence in federal prison.he was paroled in,having served seven years.rose then violated the terms of his parole by contacting,hitting,and twice raping his.he was returned to federal prison for five years and was released in.less than a year later,rose reoffended,committing a lewd act on a girl he was babysitting.he was convicted in state court of committing a lewd and lascivious act upon a child under the age of and was sentenced to a term of three years in state prison.
in,the sacramento county district attorney office filed a petition to commit rose involuntarily as a sexually violent predator svp pursuant to california sexually violent predator act svpa.see cal.welf.inst.code et.the trial court denied the svpa petition and rose received parole in.
less than a year later,rose parole was revoked based on charges that he had contact with a minor,gave false information to his parole officer,and failed to maintain a logbook.after hearing testimony from rose,his parole agent,and others,the state parole board found that rose had violated two special conditions of his parole,and assessed rose four months in prison for each violation.
following rose return to prison,the state filed a second svpa petition,which was tried to a california superior court jury.there,rose requested the following instruction,which the trial court declined to give 
in order to find that rose is a sexually violent predator,the state must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that rose is currently suffering from a mental condition that renders him dangerous beyond his control.
rather,the trial court instructed the jury that 
the term a sexually violent predator means a person who,has been convicted of a sexually violent offense against two or more victims for which he or she received a sentence,and has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes him a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he will engage in sexually violent predatory criminal behavior.
further,the trial court instructed the jury on the requirements for finding a mental disorder 
diagnosed mental disorder includes a congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to the commission of criminal sexual acts in a degree constituting the person a menace to the health and safety of others.
the jury concluded that rose was a sexually violent predator within the meaning of the svpa.consequently,rose was placed in custody for a period,consistent with the svpa.though his original civil commitment term expired in,the state filed recommitment petitions in and,and rose remains in atascadero state hospital 
after exhausting the claims relevant to this petition in state court,rose timely filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court,contending that it was error for the state trial judge to refuse to instruct the jury that it must find him dangerous beyond his control.the district court denied the petition and rose timely appealed 
rose contends that the state court refusal to instruct the jury that it must find that he was dangerous beyond his control was an unreasonable application of kansas hendricks,d,and kansas crane,d see d.
in kansas hendricks,the supreme court analyzed the constitutionality of the kansas sexually violent predator act,which establishes procedures for the civil commitment of persons who,due to a mental abnormality or a personality disorder,are likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence.at.citing.stat.ann.et.there,the supreme court determined that the act satisfied substantive due process considerations,explaining that 
we have sustained civil commitment statutes when they have coupled proof of dangerousness with the proof of some additional factor,such as a mental illness or mental abnormality.see,allen illinois,d illinois statute permitting commitment of mentally ill and dangerous individual minnesota ex rel.pearson probate court of ramsey.minnesota statute permitting commitment of dangerous individual with psychopathic personality.these added statutory requirements serve to limit involuntary civil confinement to those who suffer from a volitional impairment rendering them dangerous beyond their control.the kansas act is plainly of a kind with these other civil commitment statutes it requires a finding of future dangerousness,and then links that finding to the existence of a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes it difficult,if not impossible,for the person to control his dangerous behavior.stat.ann.b.the precommitment requirement of a mental abnormality or personality disorder is consistent with the requirements of these other statutes that we have upheld in that it narrows the class of persons eligible for confinement to those who are unable to control their dangerousness.
the kansas supreme court subsequently interpreted the hendricks decision to to rose commitment under the kansas svpa is unconstitutional absent a finding that the defendant can not control his dangerous behavior.in re crane.upon grant of certiorari,the supreme court of the united states squarely rejected the kansas supreme court view,concluding that involuntary commitment statutes may be upheld if the confinement takes place pursuant to proper procedures and evidentiary standards,there is a finding of dangerousness either to one self or to others,and proof of dangerousness is coupled with the proof of some additional factor,such as a mental illness or mental abnormality.crane,at.quoting hendricks,at.
the court dismissed the contention that hendricks required total or complete lack of control,id.at,but concluded that it does require some determination,id.at.that is,there must be proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior,id.at,which must be sufficient to distinguish the dangerous sexual offender whose serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder subjects him to civil commitment from the dangerous but typical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal case,id.at.citing hendricks,at.foucha louisiana,d.
here,the california court of appeal reviewing rose claim of instructional error reasoned that the jury instructions did not violate hendricks and crane 
the statutory language in the california svpa is similar to the language used in the kansas act upheld in hendricks and crane.people buffington th,d.like the kansas statute,california svpa requires the jury to find that the offender has a diagnosed mental disorder that affects his emotional or volitional capacity,which predisposes him to the commission of criminal sexual acts and makes it likely that he will engage in sexually violent predatory criminal behavior.under crane these criteria are sufficient to establish the offender has a current mental condition that causes him serious difficulty in controlling his behavior.
people rose,wl.
the california supreme court reached the same conclusion shortly thereafter in people williams,cal th,d.
rose claims he is entitled to habeas relief because the trial court failed to instruct the jury that it had to find rose was currently suffering from a mental condition that renders him dangerous beyond his control.this failure to instruct the jury,rose argues,amounts to a due process violation,and an unreasonable application of hendricks and crane.
in crane,the supreme court specifically stated that a finding of complete inability to control one behavior is not necessary to satisfy due process.the court declined to give the phrase lack of control a particularly narrow or technical meaning,but rather recognized that in cases where lack of control is at issue,inability to control behavior will not be demonstrable with mathematical precision.it is enough to say that there must be proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior.crane,at.tellingly,crane
