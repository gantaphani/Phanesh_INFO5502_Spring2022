order and amended opinion 
the opinion filed on may,is amended as follows 
on slip opinion page,line of footnote,insert the following text before the sentence that begins with we note that hawaii revised statute neither did the district court abuse its discretion in denying the center request to amend its complaint.see flowers first hawaiian bank,cir we review for abuse of discretion the denial of leave to amend after a responsive pleading has been filed.

on slip opinion page,at the end of footnote,insert the following text consideration of these documents and changes is best left to the district court,not to the court of appeals for initial analysis.there is good reason why we generally do not consider issues for the first time on record has not been developed,the district court has not had an opportunity to consider the issue,and the parties arguments are not developed against the district court decision.
with these amendments,the panel has voted to deny the petition for panel rehearing.judges mckeown and clifton vote to deny the petition for rehearing en banc and judge bright so recommends.the full court has been advised of the petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc and no judge has requested a vote on whether to rehear the matter en banc.see fed.the petition for panel rehearing and the petition for rehearing en banc are denied.
the city and county of honolulu,hawaii honolulu,has a long history of comprehensive regulatory oversight over its visual landscape,an effort designed to protect the area unique and scenic resources.for example,in,honolulu was among the first municipalities to enact a comprehensive ordinance regulating signs,see state diamond motors,haw,and,in,honolulu first passed what later became revised ordinance of honolulu the ordinance,which prohibits aerial advertising.
the question presented in this appeal is whether the ordinance may be used to restrict an advocacy group from towing aerial banners over the beaches of honolulu.to answer this question,we must first decide whether the ordinance is preempted by federal law,and,if not,whether it passes constitutional scrutiny under the first amendment and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.less than five years ago,we answered the preemption question in the negative.skysign int l,city and county of honolulu,cir.nothing presented in this appeal persuades us that we should depart from that precedent.as to the constitutional question,we hold that the ordinance passes constitutional muster.the ordinance is a reasonable and viewpoint neutral restriction on speech in a nonpublic forum,and the banner towing prohibited by the ordinance is neither a historically important form of communication nor speech that has unique identifying attributes for which there is no practical substitute.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of honolulu.
background 
honolulu aerial advertising ordinance is part of a scheme aimed at regulating outdoor advertising in order to protect the critical visual landscape that has made the area famous.the linkage between the scenic viewscapes and the economic of honolulu,including its tourist industry,is not disputed.as one witness aptly stated,looking out to sea from waikiki beach without commercial or promotional interruption is as crucial to the hawaii visitor and resident experience as is the uninterrupted viewing of the canyon for travelers to the grand canyon f ew things can damage the distinctive character of a scenic view faster than a large moving sign pulled through the center of the field of vision.
given the importance of preserving the area coastal and scenic visual beauty,and in an effort to prevent potentially dangerous aerial distractions for its coastal vehicle traffic,honolulu enacted the ordinance,which,with few exceptions,prohibits aerial advertising 
a except as allowed under subsection b,no person shall use any type of aircraft or other or buoyant airborne object to display in any manner or for any purpose whatsoever any sign or advertising device.for the purpose of this section,a sign or advertising device includes,but is not limited to,a poster,banner,writing,picture,painting,light,model,display,emblem,notice,illustration,insignia,symbol or any other form of advertising sign or device.
b exceptions.
subsection a shall not prohibit the display of an identifying mark,trade name,trade insignia,or trademark on the exterior of an aircraft or or buoyant airborne object if the displayed item is under the ownership or registration of the aircraft or airborne object owner.
subsection a shall not prohibit the display of a sign or advertising device placed wholly and visible only within the interior of an aircraft or or buoyant airborne object.
subsection a shall not apply to the display of a sign or advertising device when placed on or attached to any ground,building,or structure and subject to regulation under chapter or.such a sign or advertising device shall be permitted,prohibited,or otherwise regulated as provided under the applicable chapter.
the center for reform and its director gregg cunningham collectively the center challenge the ordinance because it prevents the center from carrying out its aerial advocacy campaign over honolulu beaches.the center is a advocacy group that hires airplanes to tow aerial banners over heavily populated areas.these banners are typically and display graphic photographs of aborted fetuses.the center has used this publicity technique in many states and has found it to be very effective in spreading its message.
absent specific authorization,federal aviation administration faa regulations prohibit operation of civilian aircraft over densely populated areas.e.consequently,prior to towing its banners,the center obtained permission from the faa in the form of a certificate of authorization certificate.the certificate states that it authorizes aerial advertisement banner towing,but contains a note stating that it does not constitute a waiver of any state law or local ordinance.the certificate grants authorization to tow banners in the contiguous united states of america,alaska,hawaii,and puerto rico.
upset that under the ordinance it could not tow banners over honolulu,the center filed suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the ordinance.the center alleged that the ordinance violates its right to free speech under the first amendment and its right to equal protection under the fourteenth amendment and that federal law preempts the ordinance.the district court denied the center motion for preliminary injunction and we affirmed that ruling.center for reform,city and county of honolulu.cir.
the center and honolulu then filed for summary judgment and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of honolulu.center for reform,city and county of honolulu,d the district court rejected the preemption argument and held that the ordinance did not violate the center constitutional rights.
i.the ordinance is not preempted by federal law 
within certain constitutional limits and absent explicit language preempting state law,congress may implicitly preempt state law through a comprehensive regulatory scheme that occupies the entire field being regulated,leaving no room for state or local supplementation 
absent explicit preemptive language,congress intent to supercede state law altogether may be found from a scheme of federal regulation so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it,because the act of congress may touch a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject,or because the object sought to be obtained by the federal law and the character of obligations imposed by it may reveal the same purpose.

even where congress has not entirely displaced state regulation in a specific area,state law is to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.such a conflict arises when compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.
pac.gas,at.quotation marks and citations omitted see also barber,at.
the center argues that congress,via the faa,occupies the entire field of tow banner regulation,and further,that the faa certificate impermissibly conflicts with the ordinance.the ninth circuit has already spoken on this issue,upholding the ordinance against a virtually identical federal preemption challenge.skysign.in skysign,we explained that advertising is an area traditionally subject to regulation under the states police power,and we therefore presume that federal law does not displace honolulu regulatory authority over advertising absent a clear statement of the federal intent to do so,either by congress or by the faa as congress delegate however,no such presumption applies to section,the aerial signage ordinance,which rather than addressing advertising generally specifically targets for regulation an area where there has been a history of significant federal presence,navigable airspace.id.at citations omitted.neither congress nor the faa has exerted its statutory authority to a degree that warrants a holding that it has preempted the entire field.id.at.although congress has left open the door for the faa to do so through the use of its authority to develop regulations for the use of navigable airspace without some affirmative accompanying indication,the faa regulatory scheme does not compel a conclusion that the agency has sought to occupy the field to the full.id.
we also analyzed whether a faa certificate of waiver,which is similar to the certificate in this appeal,precludes the enforcement of the ordinance under principles of conflict preemption.id.at.if the federal law contemplates coexistence between federal and local regulatory schemes,conflict preemption does not come into play.id.the certificate of waiver in skysign contemplated such a coexistence,as evidenced by a specific provision that provided t he aircraft operator,by exercising the privilege of this waiver,understands all local laws and ordinances relating to aerial signs,and accepts responsibility for all actions and consequences associated with such operations.id.at.the faa handbook,which is the same one analyzed in skysign and in this appeal,suggests including similar provisions in waivers for banner tow operations that the certificate and its special provisions do not supersede any local,state,or city ordinance s prohibiting aerial advertising.id.at.the center certificate contains precisely such a provision,stating that the certificate does not constitute a waiver of any state law or local ordinance.
in the face of compelling precedent to the contrary,the center urges that skysign is no longer controlling because after the case was decided,the faa issued a notice on october,that proposed deletion of certain provisions of the faa handbook.faa notice n.we give the notice no weight because it on october,without any change to the faa handbook.see west,united states,cir stating that failed legislative proposals and accompanying recommendations in committee reports are not sufficient evidence to suggest that there is any relevant congressional intent to which this court could defer,judgment vacated on other grounds,d.thus,the substance of the proposed change in the faa handbook merits no review on our part.for the same reason,we have no occasion to analyze a letter from the faa deputy chief counsel explaining the proposed changes 
because the faa handbook and regulations before us remain the same as they were in skysign and the center certificate contemplates the coexistence of local and federal law,we are bound by skysign no preemption conclusion.skysign,at w e conclude that the application of honolulu ordinances does not impede the federal policy or purpose in issuing the certificates of waiver.we recognize though,as we did in skysign,that congress itself,or through the faa,may have the authority to completely occupy the field of banner towing or regulate it in such a way that could preempt the ordinance.see id.at.we need not decide that issue here,however,because in the present appeal,no such affirmative regulations justify federal preemption we now turn to the center claim that the ordinance violates the first amendment.
ii.the ordinance does not violate the first amendment 
it is uncontested that the banner towing at issue is a form of speech protected under the first amendment.the center has a targeted message that it wishes to communicate.but it is also well settled that the government need not permit all forms of speech on property that it owns and controls.int l soc y for krishna consciousness,lee,d.to assess a first amendment free speech claim,we first must identify the nature of the forum,because the extent to which the government may limit access depends on whether the forum is public or nonpublic.preminger principi,cir quoting cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d.
a.the airspace is a nonpublic forum 
for purposes of first amendment analysis,public property fits into one of three main categories a public forum,a designated public forum,or a nonpublic forum.preminger,at.any public property that is neither a public nor a designated public forum is considered a nonpublic forum.diloreto downey unified sch.dist.bd.of,cir.
public fora are places that have traditionally been devoted to expressive activity,such as public parks and sidewalks.preminger,at.restrictions in public fora are justified only if they serve a compelling state interest that is narrowly tailored to the desired end.id.this level of review is known as strict scrutiny.designated public fora are nonpublic fora that the government affirmatively opens to expressive activity.id.as with public fora,restrictions on designated public fora must pass strict scrutiny.id.
areas not traditionally or explicitly opened to expressive activity are deemed nonpublic fora,which are subject to a more lenient standard of on nonpublic fora need only be reasonable and viewpoint neutral.id.examples of nonpublic fora include airport terminals,lee,at,highway overpass fences,brown cal.dep.of,cir,and interstate rest stop areas including perimeter walkways,see jacobsen bonine,cir.
a review of the history,purpose,and physical characteristics of the airspace at issue leads us to conclude that it is a nonpublic forum.as to its history and purpose,the airspace does not fit the public forum category because it is not among those places that have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and,time out of mind,have been used for purposes of assembly,communicating thoughts between citizens,and discussing public questions.lee,at.a traditional public forum is property that has as a principal purpose the free exchange of ideas.id.alteration in original quoting cornelius,at.
like the airport terminal in lee,the highway overpass fences in brown,and the interstate rest stops in jacobsen,the use of the airspace for banner towing is a relatively modern creation that hardly qualifies for the description of having immemorially time out of mind been held in the public trust and used for purposes of expressive activity.lee,at.in fact,one would be hard pressed to find another forum that has had its access as historically restricted as airspace.the faa has strict regulations governing the airspace and for more than years honolulu has regulated aerial advertising.in light of the numerous restrictions placed on the use of the airspace in and around honolulu,its principal purpose can hardly be characterized as promoting the free exchange of ideas.id.at.see united states kokinda,d contrasting a public street,which is a necessary conduit in the daily affairs of a locality citizens with a postal sidewalk constructed solely to provide for the passage of individuals engaged in postal business.
the physical characteristics of the airspace also underscore that it is not a public forum.the airspace is not,as the center argues,an extension of the fora below,namely the beaches.we do not express any opinion as to whether the beaches are public fora because the record is not developed on this point and this categorization is not necessary to our analysis.but even assuming that the beaches are public fora,the airspace above is not a public forum by extension.
spatial proximity to a public forum is determinative only if the two areas are physically indistinguishable.see,united states grace,d sidewalks leading to the united states supreme court building indistinguishable in both location and purpose from other public sidewalks and thus public fora.in kokinda,the supreme court explained grace as requiring the location and purpose of the property to be examined before it is deemed a public forum by proximity or extension.at.examining the location and purpose of the airspace surrounding the beaches of honolulu,the airspace is easily distinguishable from the fora below.the airspace is physically separate from the ground or beaches,requires special equipment and authorization for access,and has never typically been a locus of expressive activity.
nor can the airspace be classified as a designated public forum,which is created only when the government has expressly dedicated the property for expressive conduct.preminger,at citing widmar vincent,d.the regulated airspace is the antithesis of an intentional opening of a nontraditional forum for public discourse.cornelius,at.the ordinance explicitly prohibits using honolulu airspace as a forum for expressive conduct and neither party cites a single example where expressive activity was sanctioned to occur in honolulu airspace.further,honolulu airspace is not naturally compatible with expressive activity.
we are thus left to examine the airspace as a nonpublic forum,in which the ordinance does not violate the first amendment as long as it is reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and viewpoint neutral.brown,at quotation marks omitted.
b.the ordinance is viewpoint neutral 
the ordinance prohibition against airborne signs or advertising devices is viewpoint free.viewpoint discrimination is a form of content discrimination in which the government targets not subject matter,but particular views taken by speakers on a subject.id.at citing children of the rosary city of phoenix,cir.the ordinance prohibits the display in any manner or for any purpose whatsoever any sign or advertising device by an aircraft or other or buoyant airborne object.the ordinance says nothing about the content of the signs or the views expressed.in contrast to the laws at issue in other sign cases,the ordinance makes no distinction between commercial signs and other displays.see,metromedia,city of san diego,d.nor does it distinguish between commercial speech or political speech.and,finally,the ordinance draws no lines by subject matter such as countenancing speech on behalf of candidates and yet restricting it on behalf of issue advocacy groups or by viewpoint such as distinguishing among views on abortion.in short,the prohibition is entirely neutral.
the only relevant exception to the absolute bar on advertising is that the ordinance permits an identifying mark,trade name,trade insignia,or trademark on the exterior of an aircraft if the displayed item is under the ownership or registration of the aircraft or the airborne object owner.b.this exception,which pertains to the external marking of an aircraft,is a common sense one.honolulu would be hard pressed to say that aircraft flying over the beach are prohibited from displaying their name and logo,such as hawaiian airlines,aloha airlines,quantas airlines,or united airlines,when the faa is charged with prescribing regulations for identification of aircraft.b.
despite the facial neutrality of the ordinance,the center argues that the ordinance is not viewpoint neutral because it discriminates between commercial advertising and political speech.under the ordinance,the center argues,one could fly the goodyear blimp carrying a commercial message,yet would be prohibited from towing banners carrying the center political message.this argument mischaracterizes the ordinance.
it is true that once the government opens up a forum,it may not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint.police dep t of chicago mosley,d.but,the ordinance does not do so.the identifying mark exception differentiates only as to the medium used for the,identifying marks on aircraft versus towed not on the basis of any particular viewpoint.for example,the district court posited that the center could fly a blimp having its own identifying marks,even if its marks contained a political message 
plaintiffs complain that,under the wording of the statute,the goodyear blimp would be allowed to cruise the skies above waikiki beach,while their would not.this is not discrimination.if plaintiffs so choose,they too would be permitted to purchase a dirigible or other aircraft,emblazon their own identifying mark on it,and fly above the beach.
center for reform,d at.
although the center hypothetical blimp would be limited to displaying an identifying mark,trade name,trade insignia,or trademark that is valid or permissible under the applicable faa and trademark laws,the center would nonetheless be as free as goodyear to fly its own craft with identifying markings.thus,to the extent permitted by federal law,and having nothing to do with the ordinance,the center could employ an identifying mark if it were under the ownership or registration of the aircraft or the airborne object owner.b.the result is that if the center has an aircraft or airline and an identifying mark,such as pro life for america or abortion kills,it too could fly the aircraft over honolulu beaches without running afoul of the ordinance.of course such a scheme may be subject to federal restrictions that are not before us in this appeal.the ordinance easily passes the hurdle of viewpoint neutrality.
c.the ordinance is reasonable 
the reasonableness analysis focuses on whether the limitation is consistent with preserving the property for the purpose to which it is dedicated.brown,at quotation marks omitted.any limitation must fulfill a legitimate need,y et,in a nonpublic forum,the restriction need not constitute the least restrictive alternative available.preminger,at.
it is well established that regulation for purposes of preserving aesthetics and promoting safety falls within the legitimate and substantial interests of local governments.see,metromedia,at.nor can there be substantial doubt that the twin goals that the ordinance seeks to safety and the appearance of the substantial governmental goals.see also members of city council of los angeles taxpayers for vincent,d it is well settled that the state may legitimately exercise its police powers to advance esthetic values.ackerley commc ns of the,krochalis,cir t he court has continued to rely on its conclusion in metromedia that a city interest in avoiding visual clutter suffices to justify a prohibition of billboards.the government need not provide detailed proof that the regulation advances its purported interests of safety and aesthetics.krochalis,at as a matter of law seattle ordinance,enacted to fur
