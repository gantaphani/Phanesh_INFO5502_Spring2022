background 
procedural history 
plaintiff filed suit against defendants on october,seeking damages for injuries she allegedly sustained as a result of silicone breast implants that she received in march of,which were manufactured by heyer schulte,a corporation now owned by defendants.on june,defendants filed a motion for summary judgment,claiming that plaintiff cause of action was under the statute of limitations set forth in kentucky revised statute.on august,the district court entered a memorandum opinion granting defendants motion for summary judgment,and on august,the district court entered its corresponding order dismissing plaintiff suit.this timely appeal ensued.
in march of,leonard weiner surgically implanted heyer schulte silicone breast implants in plaintiff.plaintiff elected to have this surgery because her breasts had become quite enlarged when she was pregnant with her daughter,and her breasts remained large postpartum due to engorgement which caused a degradation of the contour and support of her breasts.in the two months following the surgery,plaintiff saw weiner three times for visits.plaintiff did not see a physician again regarding her breast implants until march of,when she saw norman cole.plaintiff claims that she went to see cole because her breasts hurt and they were still hard and still red and they were immobile and she was getting red rashes across them.in an effort to soften plaintiff breasts,cole performed a closed capsulotomy on plaintiff that involved physical manipulation of her breasts in order to break the fibrous capsules.although the capsulotomy was effective at first,plaintiff breasts eventually returned to the hardened state.at that point,cole recommended that plaintiff have the implants removed and replaced.
in march of,plaintiff underwent surgery to have the heyer schulte implants replaced with dow corning implants.in january of,the left implant was replaced with another dow corning implant and,in september of,plaintiff had both implants removed and replaced with a pair of silicone implants manufactured by mentor.during the surgery,the operating physician discovered that the previous silicone dow implants had ruptured,and that silicone had escaped into plaintiff breast tissue.in march of,plaintiff underwent breast surgery again,at which time her mentor implants were replaced with another set of mentor implants.finally,in march of,plaintiff had the mentor silicone implants replaced with saline implants manufactured by mcghan.

plaintiff had filed the instant suit against defendants and dow corning on october,claiming the breast implants manufactured by defendants and dow corning were the proximate cause of injuries from which she suffered,and she sought damages for these injuries under theories including strict liability,negligence,failure to warn,and breach of express and implied warranties.
in october of,plaintiff received a notification of status letter regarding the settlement of a class action lawsuit filed against defendants.plaintiff opted out of the settlement class by signing the form so indicating on october.the form contained the following language 
note the running of any applicable statutes of limitation or repose with respect to the claims against person and entities named as released parties in the original global dow corning,mentor,and resume months after the date this form is received in the claims office.
at.plaintiff signed form was mailed to the claims office on november.plaintiff added a products liability claim to her october,complaint on october.
discussion 
this court reviews a district court order on a motion for summary judgment de novo.see miller am.heavy lift,cir.likewise,this court reviews a district court determination that a complaint was filed outside the relevant statute of limitations de novo.see id.
defendants argue that the district court properly dismissed plaintiff claims as inasmuch as kentucky statute of limitations bars plaintiff personal injury action.defendants contend that plaintiff claims began to accrue on march,when she had the heyer schulte implants removed and replaced with dow corning implants,and because plaintiff did not file suit until or,her claims with respect to defendants were well beyond the limit.
defendants further contend that plaintiff claims are not saved by the application of kentucky discovery rule.according to defendants,under that rule,the statute of limitations still began to run on march,because that was the point at which plaintiff should have reasonably known that the implants caused her injury,even if she was not aware of the full extent of the injuries at that time.in other words,defendants do not claim that the statute of limitations began to accrue immediately after she had the heyer schulte implants on march,rather,defendants argue that the point in time that it could be said that plaintiff reasonably knew or discovered that the implants caused her injuries was march,the date upon which she had the implants removed and replaced at the advice of her physician.in support of this contention,defendants rely upon plaintiff testimony that she went to see cole in march of because her breasts hurt and they were still hard and still red and they were immobile and she was getting red rashes across them,at,and after cole tried to correct the problems of which plaintiff complained by performing capsulotomies,plaintiff finally underwent surgery to have the removed and replaced with dow corning implants on march.therefore,according to defendants,by march,plaintiff knew of the injuries allegedly caused by the if she was not fully aware of the extent of her that plaintiff date of accrual for purposes of the statute of limitations was march,thereby making march,the last day of the statutory period.
plaintiff responds by arguing that the date she reasonably became aware that her complaints were due to a defective product was in october of when she received the notification of status letter regarding the settlement of a class action lawsuit filed against defendants.plaintiff further argues that because the form provided that the applicable statute of limitations would resume months after the date the form was received in the claims office,because plaintiff form was received in the claims office on november,and because she filed her products liability claim on october,she was well within the statute of limitations.finally,plaintiff argues that defendants should not be allowed to assert the statute of limitations affirmative defense inasmuch as defendants entered into the class action settlement thereby constituting an admission of fault and,by opting out of the settlement agreement,the statute of limitations began a new.we disagree with plaintiff arguments.
date plaintiff claim against defendants accrued for injuries that she allegedly received as a result of the heyer schulte implants 
under kentucky law,a personal injury action must be commenced within one year after the cause of action accrued.see.ann.a banks baldwin.generally,this means that the plaintiff must file suit within one year of the alleged injury.see caudill arnett.however,kentucky law also provi
