for the second time,we consider what health benefits retired orange county employees have under contract with the county of orange county.the retired employees association of orange county retired employees or reaoc,which represents retired employees and their spouses,sued the county,alleging that the retired employees have an implied vested right to the pooling of their health care premiums with those of current employees pooled premium.like the district court,we are sympathetic to the retirees plight.as the california court of appeal reflected in an earlier case involving medical benefits for retirees,t he spiraling cost of health care in america is simply unconscionable.the present high cost of medical insurance has unfortunately become a fact of life which in most instances results in disparate rates and medical coverage for those who can least afford it,including retirees.ventura cnty.retired emps.ass cnty.of ventura,d.nonetheless,we have no choice but to affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the county because reaoc failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding its alleged implied contract right to the pooled premium,leaving its implied contract claim without factual or legal support.
factual and procedural background 
history of the county pooled benefits 
this suit arises from the county decision to stop pooling retired and active employee health insurance premiums.the county first began providing group medical insurance for its retired employees in.the county subsequently decided to cover retiree health insurance premium costs through a monthly grant.
over a decade later,the county board of retirement retirement board voted,due to budgetary concerns,to stop providing monthly grants for prospective retirees but to continue the grants for employees retiring before june.orange cnty.emps.ass cnty.of orange,d.this decision provoked the first round of benefits litigation,which took six years to wind its way through the california courts.id.at.the orange county employees association ocea and other unions asked the county board of supervisors board to override the retirement board decision on statutory grounds,but the board refused orange cnty.emps.ass n,d at.the california court of appeal ruled that the statutory scheme permits local agencies to consider the differences between retired and active employees in providing health benefits.id.at.the court of appeal also upheld the county decision,stating that the relevant statute does not mandate equal treatment of active and retired employees.id.at.
apart from the dispute over responsibility for payment of premiums,another cost dispute began to brew over premium rates.from through,on an annual basis,the county approved one premium rate for active employees and another rate for retired employees.under this separate premium rate structure,the board intended for each group premiums to cover that group claims and administrative costs.
then,starting in and continuing through,the county decided to pool health insurance premium rates for retired and active employees.the board approved the pooled premium to equaliz e active and retiree rates and to resolve a budget shortfall for retiree healthcare costs that resulted from a large number of retiree insurance claims mistakenly being reported as active employee claims.pooling retiree premium rates with those of active employees immediately increased retiree rates by on average,a less drastic measure than the alternative considered of increasing only retiree premium rates by on average.over time,however,the pooled premium substantially subsidized retiree premium rates.according to expert testimony,the pooled premium remained an important issue in negotiations between the board and the unions.the board approved these pooled health plan rates on a yearly basis.
the county continued to face mounting budgetary concerns,caused in part by high health insurance premium costs.in,the county conducted a review of its retiree health insurance program.after further negotiations between the county and various labor unions,the parties reached an agreement,effective january,to reform the county health care program.in relevant part,the agreement split the insurance rate pool.this pool splitting meant that active employee health benefit premiums would be calculated separately from those of retired employees.although reaoc did not directly participate in these negotiations,it did take part in related discussions with other labor unions and the county.
ii.challenges to the county termination of the pooled premium 
in response to the county decision to terminate the pooled premium,reaoc filed suit in the central district of california seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.among other claims reaoc argued that the county longstanding practice of pooling and the county representations to employees regarding that practice created an implied contract right to continued pooled premiums for employees who retired prior to january.retired emps.ass of orange cnty.cnty.of orange reaoc i,d.on for summary judgment,the district court granted the county motion for summary judgment on all claims.id.at.the district court determined that california courts have refused to find public entities contractually obligated to provide specified retirement benefits like those reaoc seeks in the absence of explicit legislative or statutory authority.id.at.the court found that the county has no contractual obligation to continue providing the pooling benefit to retirees.id.at.
reaoc appealed the judgment with respect to its contract clause claims.in response,we certified the following question to the california supreme court whether,as a matter of california law,a california county and its employees can form an implied contract that confers vested rights to health benefits on retired county employees.retired emps.ass of orange cnty.cnty.of orange reaoc ii,cir.the california supreme court answered affirmatively,stating that vested health benefits can be implied under certain circumstances from a county ordinance or resolution.retired emps.ass of orange cnty.cnty.of orange reaoc iii,cal th,d,cal the court declined,however,to determine whether such circumstances had been met with respect to reaoc and the county.id.we remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings in light of reaoc iii.retired emps.ass of orange cnty.cnty.of orange reaoc iv,cir per curiam.
on remand,the district court again granted the county motion for summary judgment.addressing reaoc implied contract theory,the district court held that u nder california government code section,any right to employee compensation must in some way be approved by the board of supervisors with a resolution or ordinance.the court concluded that reaoc bears the burden of proving that the relevant statutes or ordinances reflect clear legislative intent to enter into such a contract and that it failed to make this showing.
we begin with the undisputed proposition that the county and its retired employees have an express contract that includes health benefit provisions.that contract is the product of negotiations resulting in binding mous when adopted by county resolution between the county and the retired employees.the retired employees acknowledge that none of the mous contain express provisions regarding pooling.instead,the retired employees argue that the contract contains an implied right to the pooled premium.see reaoc iii,d,at noting that the retired employees stated that they have an express contract and are seeking recognition only of an implied term of that contract.the issue we consider on appeal is whether,under california law,such an implied term exists with respect to the pooled premium.
framework for evaluating an implied contract right 
in reaoc iii,the california supreme court provided guidance on assessing implied contract rights in the context of municipal employee benefits under california law.it held that a vested right to health benefits for retired county employees can be implied from a county ordinance or resolution,when the statutory language or circumstances accompanying its
