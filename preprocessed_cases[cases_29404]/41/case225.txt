walgreen,walgreen of san patricio,and walgreen of puerto rico collectively,walgreen sued john rullan,the secretary of the puerto rico health department secretary,under,challenging the constitutionality of a commonwealth of puerto rico statute requiring that all pharmacies seeking to open or relocate within the commonwealth obtain a certificate of necessity and convenience.et.walgreen asserts that this statute is unconstitutional because it impermissibly discriminates against or excessively burdens interstate commerce and violates due process.the district court rejected these arguments.because we conclude that the statute impermissibly discriminates against interstate commerce,we reverse.
background 
in,congress passed the national health planning and resources development act.see,stat.this statute was designed to correct perceived imperfections in the health care market.among its goals,the statute was intended to restrict skyrocketing health care costs and prevent the unnecessary duplication of services.see patrick john mcginley,beyond health care reform reconsidering certificate of need laws in a managed competition system.
to achieve these goals,congress,inter alia,conditioned the states receipt of certain federal funds on the enactment of certificate of need programs.under these programs,the states reviewed proposed health care facility construction projects and permitted projects to proceed only after a demonstration of sufficient need for the services see generally lauretta wolfson,state regulation of health facility planning the economic theory and political realities of certificates of need,depaul health care.
in,puerto rico which is treated as a state for present purposes responded to the federal initiative by enacting a certificate of need law.et the act.the act provided that no person may acquire or construct a health facility without having first obtained a certificate of necessity and convenience granted by the secretary.id.the act defined a certificate of necessity and convenience as a 
document issued by the secretary of health authorizing a person to carry out any of the activities covered by the act,certifying that the same is necessary for the population it is to serve and that it will not unduly affect the existing services,thus contributing to the orderly and adequate development of health services in puerto rico.
id.at e.the act identified health facilities required to obtain a certificate,id.d,provided criteria for granting a certificate,id,permitted the secretary to promulgate additional certificate criteria,id,and established administrative and judicial review procedures governing the certificate review process,id.to.
as originally enacted in,the act did not apply to pharmacies.four years later,the puerto rico legislature amended the definition of health care facilities to include pharmacies.see law of july,amending et.this amendment,inter alia,provided that any pharmacy in existence on october,was exempt from the certificate requirement.see.when the amendment was enacted,over percent of pharmacies operating in puerto rico were concerns.there is no legislative history surrounding the enactment of the amendment,but the secretary asserts that the purpose of the amendment was to encourage the location of pharmacies in underserved areas of puerto rico.puerto rico is the only jurisdiction that has applied its certificate of need law to pharmacies.
twelve years after its enactment,congress repealed the national health planning and resources development act,stat.while several states followed suit by repealing their certificate of need laws,puerto rico remains in effect.
as mentioned above,the act provides detailed procedures for the certificate approval process.the process begins with a proposed pharmacy submitting a letter advising the health department of its intention to file a certificate request.within thirty days of sending this letter,the proposed pharmacy must file the formal certificate application.see.
after the secretary receives the application,he publishes a notice in a widely read newspaper announcing the request.see id.he also notifies all affected persons by mail.see regulation of the secretary of health,art.iv b regulation.among the affected persons are existing pharmacies located within one mile of the proposed pharmacy site.these entities then have the right to oppose the granting of a certificate to the proposed pharmacy provided that they give written notice of their opposition to the secretary and proposed pharmacy within days.id.
once the notification process is complete,the secretary almost always issues the certificate if no one objects.see infra at.but if there is opposition from an affected person,which the secretary acknowledges is,without exception,an existing pharmacy located within one mile of the proposed pharmacy site,the secretary assigns the case to the health department hearings division for an administrative hearing.the hearing is often delayed to permit the parties time for discovery.at the hearing,the parties present,inter alia,expert testimony concerning the expected impact that the proposed pharmacy will have on competition in the local area.at the conclusion of the hearing,the parties submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.the hearing officer then forwards a recommendation to the secretary for final action.
in making his final determination,the secretary considers various statutory criteria,including 
the relationship between the transaction for which the certificate is requested,and the service development plan,if any,of the petitioner 
the present and projected need of the population which will be affected by the proposed transaction of the services to be provided thereby 
the existence of alternatives to the transaction for which the certificate is requested,or the possibility of providing the proposed services in a more efficient or less costly manner than that proposed by the petitioner and 
the relationship between the health system operating in the area and the proposed transaction.
in addition,the secretary considers other criteria,established by regulation,including whether the proposed pharmacy will benefit certain unattended populations,disabled,or elderly populations and whether the proposed pharmacy will be located in an area that is already saturated by existing pharmacies.regulation,art.f art.vi.
after the secretary rules on the certificate request,the losing party may ask for reconsideration.see.the losing party may also seek judicial review in the puerto rico circuit court of appeals and eventually in the puerto rico supreme court.see id.typically,the judicial review process takes in excess of a year to conclude,and the secretary decision is often stayed during this period.thus,even if the certificate is ultimately granted,the entire administrative and judicial process usually takes several years to complete.
ii.the district court opinion 
in the district court,walgreen claimed that the act,as applied to retail pharmacies,is invalid because it discriminates against or excessively burdens interstate commerce.after filing cross motions for summary judgment,the parties agreed to try the case on affidavits,depositions,and exhibits in a published opinion,the district court rejected walgreen claims.see walgreen rullan,d.
the district court rejected walgreen discrimination argument because the act requires any local economic interest seeking to obtain a certificate to jump through the same bureaucratic hoops as an entity and thus treats all newcomers evenhandedly.id.at.the court also declined to find discrimination,even though all existing pharmacies were exempt when the act was amended to include pharmacies,because the statute made no distinction between local and national pharmacies.id.at.after concluding that the act was,the court determined that the act did not excessively burden commerce.see id.at.the court ruled that the act imposes minimal burdens on interstate commerce because it does not prohibit pharmacies from entering the puerto rico market.see id.the court also recognized the act legitimate purpose of encouraging pharmacies to locate in underserved areas of puerto rico,though recognizing that walgreen presented a solid case that the act was not helping the commonwealth achieve this goal.id.at.thus,the court held that g iven the act modest burden on interstate commerce,the burden is clearly not excessive in relation to its putative local benefits.id.at emphasis in original.
iii.discussion 
on appeal,walgreen renews its arguments challenging the constitutionality of the act as applied to retail pharmacies.because walgreen appeals the district court decision following a bench trial,we review factual findings for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.see keyes sec y of the navy,cir.
the constitution grants congress the power to regulate interstate commerce.see const.art.i,cl.while the commerce clause text provides only an affirmative grant of power,for over years,the clause has been interpreted to contain a negative aspect known as the dormant commerce clause.see laurence tribe,american constitutional law ed citing cooley bd.of wardens,how.the dormant commerce clause doctrine,which applies to puerto rico on the same terms as it applies to the states,see united egg producers dep t of agric.of,cir,limits the power of states to erect barriers against interstate trade,lewis bt investment managers,d see also doran.turnpike,cir.
under the dormant commerce clause,if a state law has either the purpose or effect of significantly favoring commercial interests over interests,the law will routinely be invalidated unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism.houlton citizens coalition town of houlton,cir quoting west lynn creamery,healy,d.if the state law regulates and interests evenhandedly,the statute will be upheld unless the burden imposed on interstate commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.pike bruce church,d.
while these rules are easy to recite,their application to a particular factual setting is often difficult.recognizing this difficulty,the supreme court has cautioned that the dormant commerce clause inquiry should be undertaken by eschew ing formalism for a sensitive,analysis of purposes and effects.west lynn creamery,at.with these principles in mind,we consider whether puerto rico certificate of need law,as applied to retail pharmacies,discriminates against interstate commerce.
on its face,the act applies neutrally.all commercial interests wishing to open or relocate a pharmacy in puerto rico must obtain the same certificate no matter their place of origin.but viewed more critically and in light of the secretary enforcement of the act,the act discriminates against interstate commerce by permitting the secretary to block a new pharmacy from locating in its desired location simply because of the adverse competitive effects that the new pharmacy will have on existing pharmacies.
as set forth above,when the puerto rico legislature amended the act in to include pharmacies as covered health care facilities,it exempted all existing pharmacies from the certificate requirement.of the pharmacies operating in puerto rico at this time,percent were locally owned.thus,the act,as amended,excused an almost entirely local class of pharmacies from the certificate requirement.pac.northwest venison producers smitch,cir recognizing that grandfather clause exempting interests can indicate discriminatory nature of statute citing raymond motor,rice,d.
what more again as set forth above this group of existing pharmacies not only was excused from the certificate requirement but also has been permitted to wield substantial influence in the enforcement of the certificate requirement against proposed new pharmacies.the secretary acknowledges that,unless an existing pharmacy objects to a certificate request,he almost invariably issues the certificate.yet when there is an objection,he begins the costly and administrative and judicial procedures established by the act and frequently declines to issue requested certificates at the conclusion of the process.
thus,in practice,the act permits an existing pharmacy to object simply because it fears additional competition.and this practice is not only within the letter of the act,it is within its spirit as well.the act provides that the secretary may deny a certificate if a new pharmacy will unduly affect existing services.e.moreover,the regulations enforcing the act direct the secretary to reject a new pharmacy request if the proposed location is already saturated with existing pharmacies.regulation,art.vi.the law is thus protectionist both de jure and de facto.
this protectionist regime has had discriminatory effects.while the secretary has rejected virtually no unopposed applications percent of opposed applications have been denied.the negative effects on applicants have been particularly pronounced.over fifty percent of entities have been forced to undergo the entire administrative process compared to less than percent of local applicants.moreover,of those applicants forced to endure the hearing process,the secretary has granted certificates to ninety percent of the local applicants but only to percent of applicants.in,percent of pharmacies were under local ownership,and in,percent of pharmacies were locally owned.the statistical evidence thus strongly indicates that the act,as applied by the secretary,has limited competition in favor of the predominantly local group of existing pharmacies.
the supreme court has invalidated,on dormant commerce clause grounds,regulatory schemes that permit a state to deny an operating license on the basis that the opening of a new facility in a particular location will cause undue competition for existing facilities see hood sons,dumond.invalidating state agency refusal to grant a license for a milk producer to operate in a desired locality because the relevant market was already adequately served buck kuykendall.invalidating a rule that a state could deny an interstate transporter a certificate of necessity and convenience to use state roads because the area is already being adequately served george bush sons maloy.similar see also medigen of pub.serv.comm of,collecting cases invalidating various certificate of convenience and necessity schemes because they discriminate against interstate commerce,aff cir.a court has also struck down,on dormant commerce clause grounds,a law which gave interests the ability to manipulate a facially neutral regulatory scheme to establish advantages over interests.see mcneilus truck ohio,cir holding that facially neutral scheme which gave established local interests the ability to block licensing of entities by refusing to contract with them had the effect of discriminating against interstate commerce.
the act,insofar as it applies to pharmacies,suffers from both of these infirmities.it permits the secretary to deny a proposed pharmacy market access at its desired location simply to limit competition.further,the secretary invokes this authority only upon the urging of a member of the largely local group of existing pharmacies,thereby permitting a predominantly local group to manipulate the regulatory scheme for its own advantage.for these reasons,the act discriminates against commerce by permitting established pharmacies to retard,burden or constrict the flow of commerce for their own economic advantage.see h p hood sons,at.
the secretary advances several arguments defending the act.first,he claims that the act does not burden commerce sufficiently to trigger the dormant commerce clause doctrine because it does not bar any pharmacy from operating in puerto rico.he contends that the act is permissible because every pharmacy can open somewhere on the island.
this argument takes too narrow a view of the kind of restrictions that affect the flow of commerce.laws may implicate the commerce clause if they ban a business from establishing operations in only one part of a state,even though the rest of the state remains open.see dean milk madison.holding invalid an ordinance which bars certain milk producers from selling milk within city limits accord fort gratiot sanitary landfill.dep t of natural resource
