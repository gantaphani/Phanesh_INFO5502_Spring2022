we consider whether health care providers are entitled to intervene in a case challenging the constitutionality of a federal appropriations rider enacted to protect their interests.
california,like a number of other states,has a statute that compels emergency health care providers to deliver medical services for any condition in which the person seeking such services is in danger of loss of life,or serious injury or illness.cal.health safety code a.the statute makes no exception for abortion services and can therefore be understood to mandate such services when needed to preserve the life or health of the patient.
in,congress attached a rider to an appropriations bill,in an effort to dissuade states from forcing health care providers to offer abortion services.see consolidated appropriations act,pub,stat.the rider,dubbed the weldon amendment after its sponsor,congressman and doctor dave weldon,prevents federal,state and local governments from receiving certain federal funds if they discriminate against health care providers that refuse to provide,pay for,provide coverage of,or refer for abortions see id.div.f,d,stat.at.
in light of the weldon amendment,enforcement of california health and safety code section would arguably make california ineligible for certain federal funds.this caused california to bring suit in federal court seeking a declaration that the amendment is unconstitutional on the grounds that it exceeds congress spending power and authority and violates the fifth and tenth amendments.alternatively,the state sought a declaration that enforcement of section would not disqualify it from receiving federal funds otherwise available under the consolidated appropriations act.while the weldon amendment does not,technically,compel california to refrain from enforcing section against doctors who refuse to perform abortions,california argues that,as a practical matter,it will be precluded from so enforcing its law for fear of losing billions in federal aid.in support of this theory,the state presented an affidavit from its attorney general stating that,so long as the weldon amendment is in place,he will have no choice but to refrain from exercising his authority to enforce california police powers.
among the arguments raised by the united states in this litigation is that california lacks standing because it faces no imminent threat that the weldon amendment will be enforced against it,in part because it has not shown any plans to enforce section.in response,the state argued as follows in its brief below 
f ollowing the passage of the weldon amendment,the california attorney general office has received complaints about two women allegedly being denied emergency medical services at a california hospital.these complaints have been referred to the california department of health services,and this state agency will initiate an investigation into the complaints pursuant to its statutory authority under the california health and safety code.
that these complaints have been received by the california attorney general office document sic that california need to enforce health and safety code section is not unforeseeable,as defendants would have this court believe.instead,the undisputed evidence in this case shows that state officials are already receiving information about alleged denials of emergency medical services in california 
plaintiffs combined opposition to for summary judgment and reply,at emphasis added internal citations omitted.
two separate appellants to intervene both as of right,see.a,and with the district court permission,see id.b.the first group,the alliance of catholic health care,is a health care association representing catholic health care providers in california.alliance members object to providing any abortion service,even when essential to preserving the health or life of the mother.the other entity,known as the medical groups,consists of several organizations whose members will provide abortion services only in a very small class of emergencies.the medical groups contend that their members risk being prosecuted under section because they take a far narrower view than does california of what constitutes a medical emergency justifying an abortion.
the existing parties opposed intervention and the district court ruled in their favor.finding that the proposed intervenors did not have a significant protectable interest in the case,and that disposition of the case would not impede their ability to protect their interests,it denied intervention both as of right and as a discretionary matter.this appeal followed.
on appeal,appellants challenge only the denial of intervention as of right under rule a.intervention as of right is governed by federal rule of civil procedure a.we construe rule a liberally in favor of potential intervenors.sw.ctr.for biological diversity berg,cir.in determining whether intervention is appropriate,we apply a test 
the motion must be timely the applicant must claim a significantly protectable interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action the applicant must be so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede its ability to protect that interest and the applicant interest must be inadequately represented by the parties to the action.
sierra club epa,cir.appellees concede that the intervention motions were timely,so we address only the last three factors.
an applicant has a significant protectable interest in an action if it asserts an interest that is protected under some law,and there is a relationship between its legally protected interest and the plaintiff claims.donnelly glickman,cir.the united states forthrightly conceded at oral argument what seems beyond congress passed the weldon amendment to protect health care providers like those represented by the proposed intervenors they are the intended beneficiaries of this law using the encouragement of congress spending power to try and protect their conscience rights.
the proposed intervenors interest thus is neither undifferentiated nor generalized.see united states alisal water,cir quoting pub.serv.patch,cir.for the health care providers represented by proposed intervenors,the weldon amendment provides an important layer of protection against state criminal prosecution or loss of their medical licenses.if the weldon amendment is declared unconstitutional or substantially narrowed as a consequence of this litigation,they will be more likely to be forced to choose between adhering to their beliefs and losing their professional licenses.such an interest is sufficiently direct,and substantial.dilks aloha airlines,cir per curiam.
california and the united states point out that the weldon amendment does not give the proposed intervenors any enforceable rights,nor does it seek to protect any of their existing legal rights.however,our intervention caselaw has not turned on such technical distinctions.rather,we have taken the view that a party has a sufficient interest for intervention purposes if it will suffer a practical impairment of its interests as a result of the pending litigation.
in county of fresno andrus,cir,for example,the underlying litigation concerned a federal statute passed to protect small farmers on lands receiving federally subsidized water.the statute did not confer any rights on the small farmers instead,it required owners of larger farms,as a condition of receiving federally subsidized water,to dispose of any excess land over a certain acreage at rates.id.at.in allowing the small farmers to intervene,we noted that w e have rejected the notion that rule a requires a specific legal or equitable interest,and that the small farmers were precisely those congress intended to protect with the statute.id.at.
the proposed intervenors interest in the litigation here is at least as substantial as that of the farmers in county of fresno.congress passed the weldon amendment precisely to keep doctors who have moral qualms about performing abortions from being put to the hard choice of acting in conformity with their beliefs,or risking imprisonment or loss of professi
