craig mershon appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to louis university and its trustees collectively the university in this action alleging a failure to accommodate and retaliation in violation of title iii of the americans with disabilities act of ada,and section of the rehabilitation act of as amended.we affirm.
the following is a summary of the undisputed facts.mershon is and sight impaired due to complications of cerebral palsy.he took courses at louis university from through the spring of in both graduate and undergraduate studies.mershon first applied to the graduate school in to pursue a master of arts degree in the department of english as a classified student.while the application process was pending and the university was awaiting the receipt of necessary application materials,the university permitted mershon to enroll in classes as an unclassified graduate student and later upgraded his status,pursuant to mershon request,to that of a conditional admit the university allowed him to remain in conditional status for two terms instead of following the usual limit.when mershon sought to change his proposed field of study from english to american studies,the graduate school granted this request,changed his field of study,and reclassified his status from a conditional admit to an unclassified graduate student with an incomplete application.to complete his graduate school application,he still needed to submit additional materials.
in early august,the university granted mershon application to enroll in the college of arts and sciences as an undergraduate student on a probationary basis,due to his poor academic performance he had a cumulative graduate grade point average of appellees app.at.this status rendered him ineligible to maintain his enrollment as an unclassified graduate student.mershon stated that he received several requested accommodations from through,including large print materials,a tape recorder,note takers,and extra time.appellant,mershon depo.at.the university changed his status from probationary to that of a classified student with an undeclared major to enable him to qualify for financial aid because he was not eligible for financial assistance from the state vocational rehabilitation agency when he was not taking courses.after the fall term,his undergraduate gpa was.his cumulative gpa fell to by the spring term,and by the end of the spring semester for the academic year,mershon cumulative gpa had fallen to as a probationary undergraduate student.see appellees app.at.mershon asserts that the university stopped providing accommodations in,resulting in his inability to complete course work for a number of courses.
in july,mershon requested reinstatement as an unclassified graduate student.this status would entitle him to certain benefits and financial support from the state rehabilitation agency.mancini,the chair of the department of american studies,refused to allow mershon to enroll in a american studies course until he completed his graduate school application,eliminated several incomplete undergraduate grades,and was admitted to the graduate school.mershon graduate school application would not be complete until he had taken and submitted his graduate record examination general test score and submitted a combined autobiographical of career goals.mershon protested this decision by meeting with the university associate provost,ellen harshman.mershon explained his need to be an unclassified graduate student in order to obtain benefits and financial support from the state rehabilitation agency,but harshman would not interfere with mancini academic judgment.harshman stated in her affidavit that she had several meetings with mershon regarding academic matters,library privileges,and accommodation concerns.harshman stated that she had to instruct mershon to limit his contact with her office staff because his behavior was aggressive and upsetting to her staff.
in october,mershon petitioned the graduate school to be classified as an unclassified graduate student in the american studies department.the university granted the petition,certified him as eligible to receive federal financial aid,and changed his status from a classified undergraduate student to an unclassified graduate student with an open and incomplete application file to become a graduate student in american studies.as such,to register for a particular graduate course,mershon was required to obtain prior permission of the department chair of any department offering a course he wished to take.during both the fall and spring terms,mershon attempted credit hours and earned credit hours.in january,the chair of the history department denied mershon request to register as an unclassified graduate student in a history course because mershon had not been formally admitted into that department graduate program,his gpa was below the standard accepted by the department,and he lacked adequate undergraduate course preparation.
in may,the university director of financial aid disqualified mershon from receiving federal financial aid because he did not meet the academic progress requirements established by federal cumulative gpa as an unclassified graduate student was in the spring of appellees app.at,and his cumulative gpa in courses was id.at.mershon registered for three courses in august,but the university administratively dropped his enrollment because he failed to make adequate payment of tuition,as required of all students.
in november,jan chapin,an investigator for the office for civil rights,united states department of education,reported to officer david wright of the united states federal protection services now part of the department of homeland security that mershon had contacted her by telephone regarding a potential complaint of discrimination against the university.she represented to officer wright that during their phone conversation mershon had twice stated,m y professor makes me so mad that i want to put a bullet in his head.appellant add.at.she reported that mershon disclosed to her that the professor of whom he spoke was matthew mancini,who,as chair of the department of american studies,had previously refused mershon admission to a graduate level course.
officer wright contacted jack titone,the university director of public safety,and relayed the report made by chapin.director titone,in turn,consulted the associate provost for enrollment management,edwin harris,informing him of the threats and requesting confirmation of whether mershon was currently enrolled as a student or could be restricted from campus.harris confirmed that mershon was not enrolled and agreed that the university could prohibit him from entering its premises.director titone then issued a directive to university department of public safety officers informing them that mershon should be prohibited from entering the campus because of the threats he had made against a professor.the same day,three officers stopped mershon from entering the campus.
mershon filed suit against the university and its trustees,asserting discrimination on the basis of his disability in the failure to accommodate him while he was a student and retaliation for expelling him from campus after he complained of the failure to accommodate.the district court granted the university motion for summary judgment,concluding that mershon had failed to present any evidence of a retaliatory motive in his expulsion from campus or of a failure to accommodate.mershon appeals.

retaliation 
mershon argues that the district court erred in finding that he failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.the ada prohibits discrimination against any individual who has opposed an unlawful act of discrimination,made a charge of discrimination,or participated in any manner in an investigation or proceeding under the ada a.to establish a prima facie case of retaliation and survive summary judgment,a plaintiff must demonstrate that he engaged in a statutorily protected activity,that an adverse action was taken against him,and a causal connection between the adverse action and the protected activity.amir,at.if this prima facie showing is made,the burden then shifts to the defendant to proffer a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action.id.at citing hicks,at.the burden of production then shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the defendant reason is a pretext for discrimination.id.at citing hicks,at.
mershon established a prima facie case sufficient to shift the burden of production to the university.he demonstrated that in november he called jan chapin of the office for civil rights of the united states department of education to complain that he believed the university was not accommodating his disability,which is a statutorily protected activity that the university took an adverse action against him by banning him from the campus and that the adverse action,which occurred the very next day when he attempted to enter the campus,was causally related to his telephone call to chapin.the burden then shifted to the university to proffer a legitimate nondiscriminatory explanation for the adverse action.the university presented evidence indicating that mershon complaint to chapin was perceived as a threat to harm a professor and that campus security simply acted to protect the university faculty and students from threatened violence.the district court concluded that mershon failed to present evidence sufficient to show that the university decision to ban him from campus was a mere pretext for disability discrimination rather than a legitimate response to a perceived threat.after a thorough review of the record,we agree.
mershon argues that he never threatened to harm mancini when he spoke to chapin,and thus,a question of fact existed and the district court impermissibly resolved a credibility determination.in the summary judgment context,we accept mershon statements of fact and do not resolve credibility disputes.see yates rexton,cir in determining whether a plaintiff has met its burden with respect to pretext in a summary judgment motion,a district court is prohibited from making a credibility judgment or a factual finding from conflicting evidence.whether mershon actually made threats to harm mancini was a fact in dispute,but this fact did not preclude summary judgment.although mershon denied having made the threats to harm mancini,mershon admitted that he made a phone call to chapin complaining about mancini refusal to allow him to register and the university alleged failure to accommodate him.mershon did not dispute that chapin sincerely perceived that he had made a threat against mancini,nor did he dispute that chapin communicated to others her perception that he had made a threat.appellees add.at.johnson v.at t,cir t he proper inquiry is not whether at t was factually correct in determining that johnson had made the bomb threats.rather,the proper inquiry is whether at t honestly believed that johnson had made the bomb threats.thus,even assuming as true that mershon never threatened to harm mancini,there is no dispute that the university reasonably believed and acted upon chapin report and her perception that mershon had made a threat against a faculty member.the district court did not make an impermissible credibility determination.see united parcel,cir concluding that the defendant,not the district court,had made the credibility determinations and had done so reasonably and in good faith.
once the university set forth a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action of banning mershon from campus,mershon had the burden to establish that he was the victim of intentional discrimination by showing that the university proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.reeves sanderson plumbing,d quoting burdine,at.mershon made no showing that the university proffered explanation for the adverse action was false or that the university acted in bad faith in relying on chapin report.to the contrary,mershon admitted that the university acted upon a perceived threat when it banned him from the campus.even assuming,as mershon asserts,that this underlying reason was false because he had in fact made no threat,mershon presented no evidence from which to conclude that the university officials knew or even suspected as much.johnson,at stating that even if at t was mistaken in its belief that michael johnson had made the threats,any such mistake does not automatically prove that at t was instead motivated by unlawful discrimination asserted reason must be a pretext for discrimination.
mershon asserts that the short amount of time between his conversation with chapin and the university adverse action against him is suspicious and lends an inference of discrimination on account of his disability.our review of the record convinces us that the timing of mershon expulsion from campus casts no doubt on the veracity of the university explanation.the close proximity between his conversation with chapin and the university swift action instead supports its assertion that it acted quickly out of a legitimate concern for the safety of its faculty and students,and nothing in the record indicates that the university explanation was a mere pretext for discrimination.see,at finding no pretext where there was no evidence that the reasons given were an attempt to disguise an illegal discriminatory motive.
failure to accommodate 
mershon argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his ada and rehabilitation act claims that the university failed to provide him with reasonable accommodations for his disability.title iii of the ada prohibits a private person who owns a place of public accommodation from discriminating against an individual on the basis of a disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations of any place of public accommodation.a.discrimination under title iii specifically includes the failure to make reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedure to accommodate a disabled individual,unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the services.b a ii.
likewise,the rehabilitation act requires reasonable accommodations when an otherwise qualified disabled student,a,would otherwise be denied meaningful access to a university,stern of osteopathic med.health sciences,cir.title iii of the ada does not expressly articulate an otherwise qualified standard in most circumstances,no qualifications are required to enjoy a public accommodation as secured by title iii.basic qualifications come into play,however,when the context is that of education.in this context,the otherwise qualified idea is implicit in title iii acknowledgment,noted above,that requested modifications need not be provided if they will fundamentally alter the nature of the program.see b a ii.it is beyond question that it would fundamentally alter the natu
