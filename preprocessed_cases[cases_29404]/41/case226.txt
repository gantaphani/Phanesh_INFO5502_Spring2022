sharon primus claims in this medical malpractice case that her breast cancer progressed undetected to a serious level as a result of and substandard care by an air force doctor.the district court concluded otherwise and granted judgment for the united states after a trial on primus claim under the federal tort claims act ftca,b.see primus united states,supp d.on appeal,primus contends that the evidence does not support the court ruling,and she further asserts that her case was unfairly prejudiced by the exclusion of crucial expert testimony.finding no reversible error,we affirm.
background 
the medical care underlying this case began with a routine physical examination in,which revealed a lump in appellant breast at the time,appellant husband was an air force officer stationed at luke air force base in arizona,and appellant was referred to a surgeon at the base.he concluded that there was no evidence of cancer.nearly two years later,in july,appellant first saw earl walker,another base surgeon and the doctor whose treatment is at issue in this case,because of a cyst in her right breast.walker detected a lump by palpation,prompting him to make a preliminary finding of fibrocystic disease.he ordered a mammogram,and at a appointment in early august,again diagnosed the mass as fibrocystic disease.he described it then as a,smooth lump.according to medical evidence presented at trial,a cancer is usually hard and irregular.
appellant was examined by walker for a third,and final,time in january.his notes refer to a lump,and he recommended that appellant have another mammogram in july.in june,appellant saw a nurse at the base,diane musselwhite,who noted that appellant had a lump in her breast.the record indicates that no mammogram was done.
in july,appellant and her family moved to massachusetts.she became pregnant the next month,and during a series of subsequent physician visits,the condition of her a hardened area in her right attributed to the normal effects of pregnancy.in october,richard galgano,a primary care doctor at a private medical clinic,saw appellant and noted a lump in the outer portion of her right breast.appellant told galgano that doctors had diagnosed a lump in that breast as noncancerous two years earlier,and she also told him that the mass had been stable in size and was not painful.no diagnostic tests were ordered.
nearly a year and a half later,in march,appellant consulted a general practitioner about the possible removal of the lump in her right breast.he referred her for testing and then to a surgeon when a mammogram indicated the presence of cancer.on march,the surgeon,kevin,diagnosed breast cancer based on the mammogram and palpation of the lump,which was described in his subsequent report as mobile and hard,and two square centimeters in size.a biopsy confirmed the presence of cancer,and on may,appellant breast and lymph nodes were removed in a radical mastectomy.she began chemotherapy the next month.
appellant filed two civil actions stemming from her medical treatment,both claiming that she suffered personal injuries because her cancer was not timely diagnosed and treated.the first lawsuit was filed in massachusetts against galgano and his employer,brighton marine health center,the second one currently before originally filed in arizona pursuant to the ftca,and it sought damages from the united states based on walker treatment in and.the two cases were consolidated after the arizona case was transferred to massachusetts.a simultaneous trial was held,with the case against the united states tried to the court,as required by,and the case against galgano tried to a jury appellant prevailed in the jury trial and was awarded for negligence and for future pain and suffering.that judgment was affirmed on appeal.see primus galgano,cir.
in the portion of the trial,the district court ruled in favor of the united states.it concluded that appellant had failed to show either,that the breast cancer detected in was traceable to the lump palpated by walker four years that walker deviated from the applicable standard of care by failing to investigate the breast mass more aggressively.
appellant challenge on appeal is.first,she claims that the court improperly excluded the testimony of an expert radiologist,severely damaging her ability to prove causation.second,she claims that the evidence does not support the court factual determinations as to causation and standard of care.we address each of these in turn.
ii.exclusion of additional expert witness 
appellant claims that the district court abused its discretion in denying her motion to allow late designation of an additional expert witness.three months after the deadline for disclosure of new experts,see.a c appellant had sought to add the testimony of darrell smith,an expert radiologist,to counter the testimony of the government expert pathologist,james connolly.the court,after conducting a hearing on appellant motion,ruled that she had failed to meet her burden of showing substantial justification for her tardiness.see.c.the court,however,did allow appellant to supplement the testimony of her previously designated expert,mary jane houlihan,to rebut connolly testimony.
appellant complains that the court failed to consider all of the relevant factors in reaching its decision,including that the government would have suffered no prejudice from the late submission while the harm to her from exclusion was substantial.she further argues that the court decision is due limited deference because excluding it was tantamount to dismissal of her case,and such a drastic sanction should be imposed only in limited circumstances,natural beverage,cir.
we decline to the district court in this instance.the adoption of rule c in gave teeth to a significantly broadened duty to comply with case management orders,wilson bradlees of new england,cir,and mandatory preclusion is the required sanction in the ordinary case,id.quoting klonoski mahlab,cir although preclusion of expert testimony is a grave step,not to be undertaken lightly,thibeault square d,cir,the court here acted with due deliberation.
the court noted that plaintiff had been granted multiple extensions to complete her discovery and expert designations ultimately,the united states disclosed its expert reports on january,obliging appellant to respond by february.no response was forthcoming.the government filed a motion for summary judgment at the end of march.although appellant sought and obtained extensions to respond to that motion,none of the requests stated a need to obtain additional expert testimony not until she filed her opposition to the motion for summary judgment,on may,did she move to designate an additional expert witness.
the lack of urgency in the request was further reflected at the hearing on the motion to designate a new expert,where appellant counsel told the court that appellant previously named expert,houlihan,was comfortable with rebutting connolly herself.counsel stated that strategically it would be better to have an extra person there and available,but also said that we have every reason to believe houlihan can effectively professionally counter connolly.in a related ruling,the court in fact assisted appellant in that effort.describing as close the question whether to grant appellant belated request to supplement houlihan testimony,the court allowed the submission so that appellant could more fully respond to the government experts 
the court,moreover,considered,but was unimpressed with,appellant explanations for her tardiness.counsel attributes the delay to multiple factors difficulties in securing an available expert the unexpected weight given to connolly testimony in the government motion for summary judgment and the discovery after the deadlines of smith availability but in light of appellant representation to the court that,in effect,smith testimony would be cumulative of houlihan,none of these bespeaks an abuse of discretion on the part of the district court.difficulties in securing witnesses are presumably a standard problem appellant may have been surprised by the government use of connolly testimony,but it had been available to her and late discovery of a new potential witness can not on its own require the court to disregard its previously set timetable.deadlines would have no meaning if such rationales were sufficient to support reversing a trial court judgment as an abuse of discretion.
the district court also was concerned that the united states had prepared a summary judgment motion in reliance on appellant earlier disclosure of her expert evidence.whether or not appellant is correct that the case management rules and rule c sanctions were not aimed at this sort of prejudice,we can not fault the court for considering the time and expense involved in the government having prepared a dispositive motion.to be sure,evidentiary changes on the eve of trial are much more problematic and disruptive of trial preparation.see,batlle,cir upholding exclusion where plaintiffs disclosed new expert witness barely a week before trial thibeault,at many court recognized the introduction of new expert testimony on the eve of trial can be seriously prejudicial to the opposing party.but contrary to appellant contention,what occurred here was not simply a matter of inconvenience or timing real resources were expended on legal work that was premised on the expert evidence submitted before the deadline.that work was relevant not only for the summary judgment motion,but for trial preparation as well.
given these circumstances,and particularly counsel verbal assurance that,in effect,appellant case would not be significantly compromised by exclusion of the additional witness,we can not view the court decision as so wide of the mark as to constitute an abuse of discretion,macaulay anas,cir.that it acted within reasonable bounds is also reflected in the court willingness to allow belated supplementation of houlihan testimony to meet appellant need.we therefore affirm the court decision to exclude smith testimony from the trial.
iii.causation and standard of care 
to prove that the medical care she received from walker was negligent under arizona thus was compensable under the ftca appellant needed to show both a departure from a reasonable standard of care and proximate cause between his treatment and her injury.see.medical malpractice act thompson sun city cmty,emphasis omitted trier of fact must find for the defendant unless it find s a probability that defendant negligence was a cause of plaintiff injury.the district court findings that she satisfied neither of these obligations are reviewed for clear error.see la esperanza de,perez y cia.de puerto rico,cir bench trial findings of fact subject to clear error review.a.we deem a finding clearly erroneous only when,after reviewing the entire record,we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.garcía pérez santaella,cir quoting anderson city of bessemer city,d internal citation omitted.
appellant task on appeal is thus daunting.she not only bears the initial burden of proving the probability of a link between negligent care by walker and the severity of her breast cancer,but she also must firmly convince us that the district court ruling against her was unsupportable.our review of the record leaves us unpersuaded.
we begin with appellant contention that the district court erred in finding that walker treatment did not fall below the standard of care reasonably expected of health care providers in similar circumstances.appellant specifically claimed that walker should have pursued more testing to evaluate the persistent lump in her breast,ordering either a targeted ultrasound or fine needle aspiration.the record,however,contains ample evidence to support the court determination that,with respect to breast lumps as small as appellant,these techniques were not sufficiently effective in the early that they were a mandatory element of reasonable care.the court cited the testimony of susan pories,a breast cancer surgeon at beth israel deaconess medical center beth israel,who explained that ultrasonography was generally incapable of visualizing a mass of less than two centimeters in diameter and that fine needle aspiration of a mass as small as appellant at the time walker treated her,four to six millimeters would have been close to impossible.
that view was reinforced by other testimony.janet baum,a radiologist and director of breast imaging at beth israel,testified that ultrasound was just beginning to be used in,and that she would not have recommended its use for such a small lesion because,even if the lesion were visible,you really could evaluate it adequately.appellant expert,houlihan,a breast surgeon and director of the breast care program at beth israel,acknowledged that performing fine needle aspiration on a mass of that size technically can be difficult.
appellant contends that the court conclusion on the standard of care is flawed because the court failed to consider the history of the growth of her breast mass,a progression that should have informed the standard of care and required the employment of additional diagnostic procedures.walker did not ignore the implications of appellant history,however,having recommended another mammogram and further evaluation six months following appellant last appointment with him.appellant did not return to walker,and the record indicates that a mammogram was not done again for three years 
in sum,the district court conclusion,based on expert testimony,that the small size of the mass rendered ultrasound and fine needle aspiration of doubtful value,combined with walker articulated intent that appellant and her doctors remain watchful,does not permit us to term clearly erroneous the court finding that walker did not deviate from the applicable standard of care.
that conclusion on standard of care effectively disposes of the case.appellant theory of recovery is that walker should have done more investigation,which would have revealed the nature of the small mass in her breast with such early detection,appellant claims she would have avoided the more serious cancer and risk of death that subsequently occurred.without a finding that walker negligently treated appellant,however,we need not consider the causal link between his care and appellant injury.even if the lump walker palpated in july was the source of the cancer found in her right breast in,there is no medical malpractice and no recovery if walker diagnostic approach reflected the degree of care,skill and learning expected of a reasonable,prudent health care provider in similar circumstances.
we nonetheless choose to address briefly the district court debated by the parties on appellant fell short of proving that the cancerous lump detected in was the same mass,in an early stage,encountered by walker.the district court cited as crucial the testimony offered by,the surgeon who performed appellant mastectomy,who had reviewed appellant medical history,testified that he was unable to say whether there was a the earlier lump and the tumor he removed.
testimony that the medical indicators were inconclusive was balanced on either side by the appellant and the government experts.testifying for appellant,houlihan stated that a relationship between the two masses was indicated by the similarity in location.the government experts,meanwhile,opined that the pathology reports showed a rapid growth rate for the excised tumor,suggesting that it was of more recent development.connolly,chief of anatomical pathology at beth israel and the expert whose testimony appellant had sought to counter with smith excluded evidence,concluded that the tumor likely was doubling in size every thirty rate too fast for the two masses to be related.supporting the theory that the cancer was of more recent origin,baum testified that her review of appellant and mammograms did not reveal any abnormal masses.in response to the rapid growth theory,houlihan testified,essentially,that one can not work backward from the tumor itself to know how long it was there,galgano,at,and noted that these tumors will frequently change their behavior during their lifespan.she acknowledged,however,that the tumor was very at the time that it was rem
