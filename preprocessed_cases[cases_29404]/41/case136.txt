plaintiffs are the parents of a child removed from them by the state after extensive proceedings resulted in a finding that the best interests of the child required termination of their parental rights.in re,no.pc.the parents then sued in federal court,asserting violations of statutory and constitutional rights during the termination proceedings and particularly in reunification efforts mandated by state law.they sought injunctive relief to prevent a foster family adoption of the child,as well as monetary damages.
plaintiffs appeal from a district court order dismissing their suit for lack of jurisdiction and on the basis of issue preclusion.because the injunction sought would negate the state court judgment and because the factual issues underpinning plaintiffs present claims for damages were addressed by the state court,the district court dismissal on rooker feldman and on issue preclusion grounds was appropriate.we affirm.
we take the facts largely as described by the district court and drawn from the record of the state court proceedings.there are no facts in dispute that are material to the motion to dismiss.all facts recited are a matter of public record.
on december,plaintiffs janeen miller and james mahood brought their biological infant daughter,to the emergency room of mercy hospital in portland,maine,reporting that she had experienced a seizure.fearing they were unable to treat,the medical staff transferred the to maine medical center that night.upon her arrival,doctors promptly diagnosed with severe failure to thrive,a diagnosis applied to infants whose physical development lags far below usual levels for age.stedman medical dictionary ed.despite the doctors serious concerns about condition,miller and mahood objected to the performance of various medical tests,some of which were time sensitive,and insisted that symptoms were caused by a flu shot she had received that fall.after miller and mahood continued to resist efforts to treat for two days and gave vague and inconsistent answers about feeding patterns,medical staff became concerned for welfare while in her parents care.the treating physician relayed her concerns to the maine department of health and human services dhhs.
on december,dhhs obtained an order of preliminary child protection,placing the child in dhhs temporary custody.doctors expanded their diagnosis of condition to include acute potentially metabolic acidosis temporary hypothyroidism vitamin d deficient rickets profound developmental delays and inadequate immunizations.
on may,a state district court judge entered a jeopardy order,placing in the full custody of dhhs.in addition to recounting medical issues,the order identified the jeopardy presented to by each of her parents.the court particularly noted miller mental health issues,including a potential psychotic disorder,as well as mahood tendency to be passive in his relationship with miller,a trait that the state court determined adversely impacted mahood protective judgment.the parents agreed to the entry of the jeopardy order.
the issuance of the jeopardy order also required dhhs to engage in statutorily mandated efforts to reunify with her parents.under maine law,if a jeopardy order removes a child from parental custody and grants custody to dhhs,dhhs must play an active role in efforts to rehabilitate and reunify the family.see a a see also in re christmas,me.maine law also places responsibilities on the child parents,including r ectify ing and resolv ing problems that prevent the return of the child to the home and t ak ing part in a reasonable rehabilitation and reunification plan.a b see also in re christmas,at.
dhhs placed in a therapeutic foster home,where her health steadily improved.dhhs also worked with parents to develop a reunification plan,and assigned defendant kristen nichols,a social worker,to assist in the reunification effort.following a psychiatric evaluation of miller,dhhs determined that reunification services should be provided to the parents separately.mahood relocated to a separate residence from miller,and had regular supervised visits with each of the parents individually.however,despite a agreement between the parties mandating mahood separation from miller in all areas,as a condition of reunification,mahood and miller maintained a relationship with each other.
ultimately,dhhs concluded that reunification efforts had been unsuccessful.on october,dhhs filed a petition for the termination of parental rights,alleging that biological parents remained unable or unwilling to protect from jeopardy and were unable or unwilling to change in a timeframe designed to meet the needs of their daughter.
between august and december of,the maine district court held nine days of hearings,reviewing testimony from witnesses,including miller and mahood.on january,the court issued a order.after comprehensively evaluating the evidence that miller and mahood were unfit parents for,the state court found that miller suffered from severe untreated mental health issues and mahood demonstrated deficient protective judgment.
the court specifically concluded that miller lack of insight into her own mental health issues and her inability to recognize any contribution she or mahood made to failure to thrive and developmental delays,in the face of the overwhelming evidence in th e record,provide d clear and convincing evidence that she was unable to protect from jeopardy and was unlikely to change in a reasonable period.it also found that mahood similarly continue d to lack insight as to the reason for removal and continue d to show no appreciation for the impact of his failure to exercise independent protective judgment on failure to thrive and the developmental delays from which she may never recover.these conclusions,among others,supported the court determination that miller and mahood parental rights had to be terminated.
the state district court further held that dhhs ha d made reasonable efforts to rehabilitate and reunify the family,citing a variety of services that the agency had provided the family.noting that foster parents were prepared to adopt her,the court concluded that it was in the best interest of,who had been in foster care for more than two years,that parental rights be terminated.
miller,mahood,and guardian ad litem all filed requests for additional findings of fact and conclusions of law.on february,the state court issued an order,responding to some of the requests and deeming further findings unnecessary.
miller and mahood appealed the termination order to the maine supreme judicial court.on august,the law court affirmed the judgment.its brief opinion held that the state trial court could have found clear and convincing evidence in the record to support its determinations and that the argument that dhhs did not engage in legitimate reunification efforts wa s not supported by the record.in re,decision no.mem.the parents subsequent motion to reconsider was denied.
on october,miller and mahood filed a complaint in the federal court in maine against both nichols and her supervisor,brenda harvey,the commissioner of dhhs.the complaint sought injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent adoption by her foster family,as well as damages under the americans with disabilities act ada,the rehabilitation act,the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa,and for various constitutional claims under.
the complaint alleged in part that during the period when she served as caseworker,nichols made no effort to accommodate miller possible mental illness and was consistently biased in favor of foster parents,and that this violated the ada and rehabilitation act.plaintiffs claimed that nichols sought to condition mahood reunification with his daughter on his promise never to associate with miller,in violation of both parents first amendment rights to free association.they also argued that nichols threatened them with termination of parental rights if they did not waive their religious objections to immunizing,in violation of their first amendment rights to religious freedom.they further asserted that nichols deliberately disclosed unfavorable information from miller mental health records during a medical evaluation of,while withholding more favorable information,in violation of hipaa.
on january,the federal district court of maine held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims for injunctive and declaratory relief under the rooker feldman doctrine.miller nichols,d.it further found that plaintiffs claims for damages were barred by the doctrine of issue preclusion and that,in any event,plaintiffs had no private right of action for hipaa violations.id.at.accordingly,it granted defendants motion to dismiss.this appeal followed.
the existence of federal subject matter jurisdiction,of a cause of action,and the applicability of res judicata,in the form of issue preclusion,are questions of law,subject to de novo review in this court.see amoche guar.trust life ins,cir subject matter jurisdiction andrew robinson int l,hartford fire ins,cir failure to state a claim global naps.dep t of,cir issue preclusion.
rooker feldman precludes jurisdiction over plaintiffs motion for injunctive relief 
the district court correctly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review plaintiffs motion for injunctive relief to prevent adoption.the rooker feldman doctrine precludes federal jurisdiction over a challenge to a state court judgment to which the challenger was a party see exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d puerto ricans for party dalmau,cir see generally wright,miller cooper,supra.only the supreme court of the united states may invalidate state court civil judgments.exxon mobil,at.
federal courts application of the rooker feldman doctrine does not depend on what issues were actually litigated in the state court.maymó meléndez álvarez ramírez,cir.rather,rooker feldman bars jurisdiction whenever parties who lost in state court seek review and rejection of that judgment in federal court.puerto ricans for party,at internal quotation marks omitted.
here,plaintiffs motion for injunctive relief is an effort to do an end run around the state court judgment.in maine,an order terminating parental rights explicitly severs biological parents right to participate in adoption proceedings.the desired injunction would amount to a reversal of the maine supreme judicial court ruling on the termination of plaintiffs parental rights,which permitted to be adopted.see see also hoblock,at.accordingly,the district court dismissal of plaintiff motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was both necessary and appropriate.
no private right of action under hipaa 
plaintiffs conceded both before the district court and on this appeal that hipaa does not create a private right of action.the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs claims on this basis without additional discussion.plaintiffs argument that we should devise a new cause of action to accommodate their claim must fail.see alexander sandoval,d raising up causes of action where a statute has not created them may be a proper function for courts,but not for federal tribunals.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
c.the factual issues underlying plaintiffs claims were addressed by the state court and are barred by issue preclusion 
the district court also correctly held that the factual issues underlying plaintiffs remaining claims were addressed by the state court judgment and can not be relitigated under the doctrine of issue preclusion.issue preclusion reflects the fundamental principle that courts should not revisit factual matters that a party previously litigated and another court actually decided.see,enica principi,cir see also wright,miller cooper,supra,at.it is well settled that state court decisions have the same preclusive effect in federal courts that they would have in the state where the judgment was issued.see matsushita indus.epstein,d.federal courts may not employ their own rules in determining the effect of state judgments,but must accept the rules chosen by the state from which the judgment is taken.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also westcott constr.firemen fund of,cir wright,miller cooper,supra,at.we look to maine preclusion law.
maine courts apply a test to determine if issue preclusion applies,asking first if the identical issue was determined by a prior final judgment and second if the party estopped had a fair opportunity and incentive to litigate the issue in a prior proceeding.portland water dist.town of standish,me internal quotation marks omitted.the doctrine precludes courts from revisiting factual matters that meet this test,even when a second action seeks a different remedy than the initial litigation.see also macomber macquinn tweedie,me.
mutuality of parties is not required for issue preclusion.as plaintiffs concede in their brief,their argument that the parties to the prior action must be identical for issue preclusion to arise finds no support in maine law.see hossler barry,me finding mutuality of parties unnecessary for application of issue preclusion see also wright,miller cooper,supra,at.
we first address whether the identical factual issues plaintiffs raise in federal court were previously decided in the maine state courts proceedings.plaintiffs federal district court complaint alleges that nichols violated their statutory and constitutional rights by not making adequate efforts to reunify the family.the precise mechanisms for their failure were alleged to be neglecting to accommodate miller disability,unlawfully sharing damaging mental health information with a state evaluator,falsely claiming to be a licensed social worker,inappropriately insisting that mahood cut ties with miller to avoid termination of his parental rights,and threatening to terminate plaintiffs parental rights if they did not waive their religious objections to vaccinating plaintiffs sued defendant harvey under a theory of supervisory liability for nichols conduct.
although plaintiffs make a variety of claims,the theme of their briefs in both the federal district court and this court is the failure to accommodate the parents needs in the context of the reunification obligation their arguments in any event depend on an identical factual issue the alleged biased failure to accommodate and,for purposes of issue preclusion analysis,are one and the same.plaintiffs complaint also references violations of civil rights,identifying only first amendment religious and associational rights and privacy rights that they allege were violated during the reunification process.the state court proceedings addressed the factual issues underpinning each of these claims.
we do not accept plaintiffs assertion that a state court has only addressed an issue for purposes of issue preclusion if the earlier state court opinion contains an explicit discussion of the facts.that is not the law see grubb,at.see also hoult hoult,cir wright,miller cooper,supra,at.nor do we reach the state argument that the entry of any termination order necessarily means that the court found,as a matter of fact,that dhhs made reasonable but unsuccessful efforts at reunification and this necessarily,as a matter of law,precludes any further claims of lack of reasonable accommodations.instead,we find that,on this record,plaintiffs actually made,and the state courts addressed,the contention that the state social work agency was biased and had not accommodated the parents needs.
under maine law,courts may review the record and assess specific findings made by the prior court to determine precisely what issues were addressed in a prior judgment.see macomber,at evaluating the record as well as a previous court order before concluding that issue preclusion did not bar plaintiff claim see also wright,miller cooper,supra,at.
an explanation of the maine law on termination of parental rights sets the stage for our evaluation of the factual issues addressed in the state court proceedings.under the state statute,dhhs must make good faith efforts to cooperate with parents in pursuit of reunification.id.at a a.this obligation arises as soon as the child is deemed to have entered foster care.id.at 
the record reflects that plaintiffs vigorously challenged at eve
