jose pedroza pedroza,an employee of national steel and shipbuilding company national steel,petitions this court to review the determination of the benefits review board brb or board that claimant pedroza is not entitled to benefits under the longshore and harbor worker compensation act longshore act or lhwca,et,because his psychological injuries were caused by national steel legitimate,adverse personnel decisions.we have jurisdiction to review a final order of the brb.c.
both parties agree that substantial evidence supports the findings of the administrative law judge alj and brb that pedroza psychological injuries were a result of legitimate personnel actions.this leaves this court with one question are psychological injuries that result from legitimate personnel actions compensable under the longshore act we answer this question in the negative,therefore affirming the brb in this decision and in marino navy exchange service,and sewell noncommissioned officers open mess.
pedroza was involved in an accident,as a load handler at the naval base in san diego,california,loading and unloading materials from the uss boxer on august.while pedroza was unloading the uss boxer,he struck a volt cable line.this caused an explosion.after the accident,pedroza did not seek medical attention.though he now claims that he suffered anxiety after the accident,pedroza never told his or supervisors about it.
a year after the accident,national steel transportation department manager,brian mathiasan,wrote a letter to pedroza about the accident.the letter informed pedroza that the august,accident was caused by his negligence.after reading the letter,pedroza sought medical attention at national steel dispensary and kaiser permanente.
pedroza wrote a letter to refute mathiasan assessment.in his letter,pedroza apologized for the accident and waged a complaint against national steel for their disregard of his health and well being after years of service.pedroza also asserted he was unfairly treated by national steel for their failure to write a similar letter to the rigger who accompanied him during the accident.
on january,pedroza had a meeting with his supervisors to discuss job safety.at this meeting,pedroza informed his union safety supervisor that his immediate supervisor actions adversely affected his ability to perform his job.during the meeting,mathiasan informed pedroza about ways in which he could improve his work performance.mathiasan also issued a verbal warning to pedroza,that if he was unable to improve his performance,he would be demoted.
after the meeting,pedroza performance improved for a short period of time.on july,mathiasan met with pedroza to discuss his job performance.at this meeting,mathiasan gave pedroza four memos from his supervisors regarding his poor work ethic.after the meeting,pedroza went on leave from work for three months.
while on leave,pedroza sought medical attention for his psychological problems.when pedroza returned to work,he was demoted because of his poor work performance and failure to fill out the proper safety forms after the accident.national steel felt that someone with pedroza lengthy service record was better served by being demoted than by being fired.
a month later,pedroza doctor placed him on medical leave for five months.while on medical leave,pedroza filed a workers compensation claim for psychological injuries caused by his stressful working conditions.
during the alj hearing,pedroza provided medical evidence to demonstrate that his disability was caused by his workplace.bayardo,an occupational psychiatrist,found that pedroza psychiatric condition and disability was predominately related to his workplace.bayardo diagnosed pedroza with chronic,mild post traumatic stress disorder as a result of the accident.national steel refuted bayardo findings by providing three psychiatrists evaluations of pedroza each of the psychiatrists reported pedroza depression was a result of national steel disciplinary action and reprimands.
the alj denied pedroza workers compensation claim,because the medical evidence provided by both parties supports national steel contention that pedroza disability was a result of the july disciplinary action and not the august accident.the alj relied on marino to deny pedroza claim.holding that an employee psychological reaction to legitimate,good faith personnel actions by the employer is not compensable because it does not constitute a working condition that congress intended to compensate under the longshore act.
on appeal,pedroza contended that the alj erred in failing to address whether the claimant condition was caused by prolonged and cumulative stress at the workplace and the alj erred in finding that pedroza depression and anxiety were a result of the reprimands and demotion.the board agreed with pedroza and held the alj erred by failing to take into account the general working conditions that could have led to pedroza psychological injuries.the brb relied on marino and sewell.sewell,holding that a claimant must demonstrate that his psychological disability was caused by stressful working conditions irrespective of disciplinary and termination proceeding against the claimant to successfully claim benefits under the longshore act.as a result of applying marino and sewell,the brb ordered the alj to determine whether the claimant daily work environment,such as daily interactions with his supervisor,triggered his psychological injuries 
national steel filed a motion for reconsideration en banc.hearing this case en banc,the board denied the motion for reconsideration.the board directed the alj to determine if pedroza injuries were caused by the employer personnel actions or general working conditions.
on remand,pedroza presented a prima facie case that his injuries were due in part to general working conditions.however,the alj denied his claim,because national steel was able to rebut pedroza claim by providing substantial,comprehensive,and negative evidence that pedroza psycho logical injuries were due solely to legitimate personnel actions and not compensable.
on appeal,pedroza contended that the brb lacked the authority to create policy,such as the marino doctrine and the board action established a class of exemptions that frustrated congressional intent to hold employer strictly liable for injuries to their employees.the board rejected pedroza arguments.the brb held legitimate personnel actions,such as the reduction in force in marino,do not constitute general working conditions.the board articulated that b of the longshore act gives the board and courts the authority to decide questions of law or fact raised in appeals.implicit in the statutory authorization is the ability to determine what type of events constitute working conditions.
