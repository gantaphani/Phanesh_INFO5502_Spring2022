paul then moved for a writ of habeas corpus under,arguing,among other things,that he was denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel at trial and sentencing.the district court denied relief without a hearing,and denied paul application for a certificate of appealability.a panel of this court granted a certificate on two questions relating to the assistance of counsel whether trial counsel were ineffective for failing to investigate and present evidence of appellant mental,medical,and physical history,and whether trial counsel were ineffective for failing to investigate and assert appellant incompetence to stand trial.on appeal,paul also contends that he was mentally incompetent to proceed in the district court during this habeas corpus action.this court granted a certificate of appealability on the question whether appellant has a constitutional right to competence during federal habeas corpus proceedings and,if so,whether that constitutional right was violated.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court denial of paul motion.
paul was convicted of murder,while aiding and abetting another,for the killing of sherman williams at the hot springs national park in arkansas according to evidence adduced at trial,on june,paul and an acquaintance,trinity ingle,followed williams from downtown hot springs to a walking trail in the national park,where they first robbed and beat williams,and then shot him in the head and shoulder.paul and ingle attempted to hide the body by dragging it away from the trail.four days later,a hiker found williams body under logs and rocks,with hands and ankles bound by duct tape.a medical examiner testified that williams suffered gunshot wounds to the head and chest,and that the wound to the head caused his death.williams vehicle was found in a remote area of the park,and ingle latent fingerprint was recovered from inside the car.
as explained in our opinion resolving paul direct appeal,several of paul acquaintances testified that he confessed to involvement in the murder.kris rogers testified that paul admitted that he and ingle had killed an old man in the park after beating him and kicking him in the head.according to rogers,paul stated that he and ingle both shot williams before dragging the body into the woods.christine lapaglia testified that paul told her that he had killed someone when he kicked him and broke his neck.cindy wallace testified that paul had a recurring dream about following an old man,taking his money,beating him severely,and then shooting him in the head.dan coughlin testified that paul admitted that he and another man had robbed an old man,and then shot and killed him.paul older brother testified that paul and ingle had picked him up on the afternoon of williams murder in a vehicle that matched the description of williams stolen car.see paul,at.rebecca pingle testified that she saw paul on the day of the killing and that paul was limping.paul told kris rogers the day after williams was killed that his foot hurt.and after admitting to rogers that he had been involved in williams killing,paul showed rogers his shoe,which looked like it had been splattered with blood.
paul left arkansas shortly after the murder,and he was eventually apprehended in south carolina in august.after his arrest,paul confessed to participating in williams murder,but denied shooting williams himself.paul stated that after he and ingle followed williams into the federal park,ingle drew a caliber revolver from his waist and pointed it at williams,demanding williams money and car keys.according to paul statement,ingle instructed paul to bind williams wrists and ankles using duct tape,after which ingle struck williams using the butt of his gun and then kicked williams twice in the head,while paul kicked him once in the chest.paul stated in the interview that he started to leave the scene when ingle said that he was not going to do prison time for the robbery.paul said the two men turned and walked back to williams,where ingle shot him twice.paul explained that he and ingle then dragged the body approximately thirty feet off the hiking trail,and that paul hid the victim wallet under some rocks.ingle was convicted in a separate trial for aiding and abetting first degree murder and use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.he was sentenced to life imprisonment.see united states ingle,cir.
paul trial counsel presented no witnesses during the guilt phase of proceedings,and relied on of prosecution witnesses to develop evidence in support of a defense.during the penalty phase,paul counsel presented testimony from paul mother,paula paul,and an audio recording of ingle,created surreptitiously by the government,in which ingle made statements to a cellmate that arguably supported paul mitigation case after a short deliberation,the jury decided to impose a sentence of death.
paul filed his motion,spanning pages,on january.the district court denied relief on january.with respect to alleged ineffective assistance of counsel regarding investigation of paul personal history,the district court,citing saunders united states,cir,held that paul allegations were insufficient to allow an assessment of potential prejudice to the defense,because he had failed to identify the conjectural witnesses and the substance of their testimony.alternatively,the court found no basis to conclude that the evidence discussed generally by paul likely would have changed the result of the trial,because the proposed testimony would have been cumulative at best.the court observed that the jury unanimously found four mitigating factors,that eight jurors found a fifth mitigating factor,and that the jury thus apparently accepted the mitigation testimony of paul mother.as for counsel assistance on the issue of paul competency,the court ruled that trial counsel was sufficiently diligent,and that it was highly unlikely that the court would have ordered another competency hearing if counsel had requested it.in response to this order,paul filed a motion to reconsider or to vacate the order,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e and b,and submitted witness declarations to support his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court denied the motion,concluding that the arguments and affidavits raised issues that were previously addressed,and did not alter the court conclusions.a.
the first issue identified in the certificate of appealability is whether paul constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel was violated when his attorneys failed to investigate and present evidence of paul mental,medical,and physical history.paul argues that counsel failure in this respect prejudiced him at both the guilt and penalty phases of the trial.
to establish ineffective assistance of counsel,paul must show that his counsel performance was deficient,and that he suffered prejudice as a result.strickland washington,d.to show prejudice,paul must demonstrate a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different but for the deficient performance.malcom houston,cir.a reasonable probability is less than more likely than not,kyles whitley,d,but it is more than a possibility.white roper,cir.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland,at.
paul argues that counsel failed to interview and present prospective witnesses who could have strengthened his case at both phases of the trial.he points to several declarations gathered from these witnesses by counsel to demonstrate that favorable evidence could have been presented on his behalf.paul contends that if this evidence had been submitted to the jury,there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have acquitted him of capital murder or imposed a sentence of life imprisonment rather than death.
the government defends the professional competence of paul trial counsel,emphasizing that counsel spent several months preparing for trial,hired a mitigation specialist to compile background materials and to locate witnesses,requested additional funds albeit unsuccessfully when the specialist exhausted what was authorized by the district court,sought psychiatric experts to examine paul,presented a mitigation case through paul mother and the of ingle,and succeeded in persuading many jurors to find several mitigating circumstances.the government also proffers strategic reasons why counsel may have limited their mitigation case to one live witness,pointing to paul disruptive behavior in the courtroom,and the potential that extending the trial in that situation would have caused the jury to react unfavorably to paul.indeed,the mitigation specialist declared that she learned that the defense chose not to present an extended mitigation case because of jeff behavior in the court room.a.
the district court,however,rejected paul claims of ineffective assistance of counsel without a hearing,and the record is not developed concerning counsel contemporaneous rationale for the actions that paul now challenges.there appears to be a disagreement among the circuits on whether the reasonableness of counsel performance may be assessed solely by reference to strategy that a hypothetical attorney might have pursued under the circumstances,without any inquiry as to counsel actual strategy,see,cofske united states,st cir chandler united states,nn.cir bonin calderon,cir,or whether the petitioner is entitled to inquire into whether his counsel actually employed a purposeful strategy before a decision is reached on the adequacy of performance,see thomas varner,nn.cir greiner wells,cir.our court has said that where trial counsel is unable to recall or explain the reasons underlying a decision at trial,we will examine counsel trial tactics and strategy as revealed by the state court record,and we have held counsel performance competent in that situation where we could readily reconstruct at least two strategic reasons why counsel may have made this decision.fretwell norris,cir.but we have located no circuit precedent that directly addresses how the court should evaluate counsel performance in the absence of an evidentiary hearing or where counsel admits that a particular decision was negligent or not strategic.we deem it unnecessary in this case to delve into these matters,because we conclude the record shows conclusively that paul did not suffer prejudice from what he now alleges was deficient performance by counsel.see hill lockhart,d because petitioner in this case failed to allege the kind of prejudice necessary to satisfy the second half of the strickland washington test,the district court did not err in declining to hold a hearing on petitioner ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
with respect to the guilt phase,paul argues that further investigation by counsel would have produced witnesses to testify that paul had a history of exaggerating his badness,and that trial counsel in also should have interviewed paul accomplice,ingle,who provided a statement in that exculpates paul.paul argues that the evidence of his tendency to exaggerate,combined with ingle acceptance of responsibility for the murder of williams,would have persuaded the jury to disbelieve paul admissions to several persons that he participated in the murder.
to support this claim,paul presents a declaration from richard mccaslin,a boyhood friend of paul,who recounts that paul once made up a story about shooting a kid at a shopping mall,but it never happened.a.paul cites a report of psychiatrist seymour halleck that when paul was hospitalized at the rivendell psychiatric hospital,he once reported to a counselor that he had killed somebody,although t his never happened.a.and he relies on a declaration of michael roberson,who knew paul as a youth,that it makes sense that jeff tended to exaggerate his badness to gain status with his peers,as he had learned this from his father,who was not a true master at much except the art of lying and living a lie.a.the ingle declaration from asserts that paul tried to convince ingle to leave the park before williams was killed,and avers that ingle alone shot williams while paul yelled at him to stop.a.
the district court concluded that paul contention that counsel was ineffective in declining to present a history of false admissions by paul was strained at best,and we conclude there is no reasonable probability that a jury would have acquitted paul of capital murder if counsel had taken these additional steps.paul trial counsel already elicited the same witnesses who reported paul admissions about the williams paul had a history of concocting stories.christine lapaglia testified that she did not believe paul admission about the williams murder.she acknowledged that he just known to tell lies,and said she thought paul had made up the story because they were breaking up.cindy wallace testified that paul admission did sound real,and that she had caught paul several times telling her things that were not true.additional testimony that paul had made up stories many years earlier about his badness would have been largely cumulative of evidence already presented,and likely less powerful than testimony already elicited from the very witnesses to whom paul made admissions about the williams murder.
the certificate of appealability does not encompass whether counsel were ineffective for failing to contact ingle,because that matter does not relate to paul mental,medical,and physical history.but even if we were to expand the certificate to consider the point,we do not think there is a reasonable probability that the guilty verdict would have been different if paul counsel also had sought to contact ingle about testifying in paul defense.most important,paul provides no reason to believe that,at the time of paul trial in june,ingle would have offered to take full responsibility for the murder of williams and to exculpate paul.at that point,ingle had just been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.he was about to commence a direct appeal,in which he argued that his conviction should be reversed,and the case remanded for a new trial.see ingle.there is scant reason to believe that ingle,still represented by counsel in his direct appeal,would have waived his rights against and given public testimony that would have ensured his conviction in the event of a new trial.that alone is reason to conclude that paul suffered no prejudice from counsel failure to contact ingle about testifying in paul defense 
even if ingle had testified consistent with his declaration,moreover,the jury would have had good reason to be skeptical of ingle account.ingle declaration is inconsistent with statements he made in april during a recorded conversation with an fbi informant.in that discussion,ingle used apparent of bob and andy when describing the murder of williams.see tr.although some portions of the recording could suggest that paul was less culpable than ingle,see supra,at,ingle statements clearly indicated that both participants played a role in the murder,to wit andy and bob,they,you know,did this for some money,you know tr.bob and andy both did this,tr.in response to the question,did both of all shoot him or just one of all whenever one did it both did it,tr.and whenever bob making cocking of gun sounds again,andy automatically you know,they,they work together.tr.in the unlikely event that ingle had volunteered to testify at paul trial,any testimony along the lines of the declaration could have been impeached substantially by ingle recorded statements in.we therefore conclude that paul has failed to make a sufficient showing to undermine confidence in the jury guilty verdict on the capital offense.
paul also contends that if trial counsel had conducted further investigation and presented additional witnesses at the penalty phase of his trial,then there is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have voted to impose a sentence of life imprisonment rather than death.because an evaluation of this contention requires a predictive judgment about how jurors would have weighed the totality of the evidence,including the new evidence that paul now cites,see williams taylor,d,it is important first to review the record that was created in the trial itself,and the findings made by the jury on that record.
the government presented a strong case on aggravating factors that supported a sentence of death.the jury unanimously found that paul intentionally aided and abetted in the killing of sherman williams,and it unanimously found three statutory aggravating factors and six aggravating factors in support of the death penalty the defendant committed the offenses in an especially heinous,cruel or depraved manner,in that they involved torture or serious physical abuse,the defendant committed the offenses with the expectation of the receipt of something of pecuniary value,the victim was particularly vulnerable due to old age,the defendant is likely to commit criminal acts of violence in the future which would be a continuing and serious threat to society,the defendant successively eluded capture by the fbi until his arrest in august,the defendant demonstrated a lack of remorse for the capital offense,the victim was killed to prevent the defendant from being identified as a participant in the robbery,the victim had personal characteristics as an individual human being,and the family of the victim has suffered injury and loss as the result of the victim death.a.the new evidence proffered by paul would not undermine any of the evidence in aggravation,or the jury findings on those factors.
the mitigation case relied on the testimony of paul mother,paula paul,who spoke about paul background,including his mental,medical,and physical history.paula testified about positive aspects of paul life,saying that he fostered an extremely close relationship with his maternal,loved a stray dog he adopted,carried a picture of paula in his wallet,and helped support the family financially.in particular,paula testified that paul received excellent school grades,regularly attended church,sunday school,and church camp,and was enthusiastic about the boy scouts,where he earned several merit badges.in the seventh grade,paul received the most outstanding achievement award for improved student.
paula also testified about the hardships that paul faced as a youth.these included an absentee and abusive father,the family constant relocation,and marital problems experienced by his parents.several times during paul childhood,paul father,dennis,secretly packed up all of his belongings and just disappear ed for up to five weeks at a time.dennis did not provide steady income to support paul and his family,and never maintained a job for more than a year while paul was growing up.as a result of dennis irregular employment,the paul family moved at least four times during paul middle and high school years,enrolling him in new schools each time,and creating stress for paul during his youth.paul also experienced stress as a result of the tumultuous relationship between paula and dennis,including a separation when paul was three years old,and an extramarital affair conducted by dennis in.paula described one instance in which dennis severely cut paul face,when he was eight years old,in a demonstration that was designed to impress dennis friends.dennis lied about the cause of the injury for years,claiming that paul accidentally had fallen on the knife.
these and other stressors,according to paula,began to influence paul in a negative way during middle school.paul fought with other children,and his grades declined from a to d and f.paul was charged in a juvenile proceeding for making an obscene gesture towards a neighbor.he failed the second half of the seventh grade,and later failed his first two years of high school.he stopped attending boy scouts and church.around this time,paul was caught stealing cigarettes,and later was arrested in separate incidents for stealing a car,burglarizing home electronics equipment,and shoplifting.when paul turned,he was charged as an adult for pointing a shotgun at someone,and he spent several months in jail before his parents posted bail.paul later violated the terms of his parole and spent approximately six months in state prison.paula sought to counter paul criminal history by arguing his innocence.
finally,paula testified about paul troubled mental health history,including two stays at rivendell psychiatric hospital,the possibility that dennis had suffered a past mental breakdown,and a family history of alcoholism and drug abuse.as a young child,paul was diagnosed with attention hyper activity deficit disorder and placed on ritalin.paula testified that paul had been treated twice as an inpatient at rivendell psychiatric residential treatment home,one time pursuant to court order after he was found guilty of auto theft,and a second time after paul tried to commit suicide.paula testified that dennis had been discharged from the military after having a mental breakdown.she characterized dennis as a pathological liar who created stories to impress people.paula testified that paul took after this habit of dennis and often told tall tales.paula also testified that paul has a family history of alcohol and drug abuse.although dennis does not drink,she said that paul paternal grandparents are alcoholics,and his uncles are either alcoholics or addicted to drugs.paul paternal grandfather has been involved in two related accidents,including twice when paul was very young and in the car.
paula recalled that paul mental state grew worse after he witnessed a shooting,which paula characterized as this little boy head being blow off.according to paula,paul had frequent nightmares about the event and developed insecurities,stopped sleeping regularly,ceased studying,and never wanted to be alone.paul became unable to sleep unless he was in bed with his mother,and did not sleep apart from her until he was years old.paul insecurity grew so acute that he even slept in paula hospital bed after she had surgery.around this time,paul developed a nervous condition of picking at his face until sores developed.and since he was a child,he had a habit of biting his knuckles until they bled.paula testified that paul had been treated for his behavioral problems at both the child study center in the little rock children hospital,and at community counseling.
this evidence clearly had an effect on the jury,as paul trial counsel were successful in persuading the jurors unanimously to find four factors that mitigated against a sentence of death,namely that the defendant experienced parental neglect,abandonment,and corruptive influence,that the defendant experienced parental abdication as to holding the defendant accountable for his behavior,that the defendant experienced chaotic family instability,and that the defendant identified with criminally convicted peers.in addition,eight jurors found the mitigating factor that the defendant experienced modeled parental irresponsibility six jurors found it mitigating that the defendant was youthful at the time of the offense,and that the defendant witnessed a shooting in a mall and three jurors found that there existed any other factors in defendant background or character that mitigate against imposition of the death sentence.a.
paul now contends that trial counsel should have investigated additional witnesses,and presented testimony from friends and relatives regarding paul medical,mental,and physical history.much of the proposed testimony concerns abuse that paul suffered at the hands of his father.heather declared that paul bore the brunt of his father raging fists.cyrilda sue teague stated that paul father repeatedly beat paul black and blue,and that she observed him beaten from head to toe and with bruises all over his back,his stomach,his arms,including one occasion when paul eye was swollen so badly he could see out of it.paul uncle,james massey,declared that a physical attack on paul by his father was just a very regular occurrence in that house,and that paul father frequently threw paul into walls and choked him.massey recounted the incident in which paul father hit paul in the face with a thrown knife,leaving his face badly scarred.michael roberson declaration described how paul face was cut when his father was practicing one of these martial arts techniques with him,and explained that paul father had a tendency to lose control in fits of rage.paul maternal grandfather,hubert massey,stated that paul father repeatedly hurt paul as a child,including by pulling him from the ground by the ears,throwing him against a wall in anger,or wailing the tar out of paul in another room.zach dryden declared that paul was very afraid of his father,and that paul father once grabbed a kid by his testicles and shook him around and threw him against the wall.
other proposed evidence cited by paul pertains to his compassionate personality.declared that paul had a concern for animals,especially vulnerable ones,and once picked up or rescued a truly ugly mutt from the side of a road.hubert massey stated that paul was a good little boy who was very gentle and loving and really cared for animals.cyrilda sue teague declared that paul was one of the sweetest children i have ever met,while martha massey said that he had the sweetest disposition,and richard mccaslin proffered that he knew paul a kind and compassionate person,especially with the mccaslin children.
viewing paul proffer in the context of the trial record as a whole,we are not persuaded that there is a reasonable probability that if paul trial counsel had gathered and presented this additional evidence,then the jury would not have selected a sentence of death.much of the new evidence cited by paul is largely cumulative of evidence that was presented through his mother at the penalty phase of the trial.paul mother testified about paul difficult childhood,including the incident in which paul father struck paul in the face with a knife and produced a wound that required extensive surgery.the jury clearly gave weight to her account,unanimously finding three mitigating factors relating to paul troubled upbringing.the additional evidence that paul proffers concerning his compassionate nature is also largely duplicative.paul mother testified at trial that he cared for animals,shared a close relationship with his,and supported his family financially.
if paul trial counsel had presented these additional witnesses at the penalty phase,moreover,it is likely that there would have been negative repercussions for paul case.a graphic description of a defendant childhood can affect the jury appraisal of his moral culpability,see williams,at,but the evidence proffered by the new witnesses in this case is not uniformly helpful.two of the witnesses connected dennis paul behavior with negative characteristics of the defendant.stated that dennis paul pushing paul to be badder and tougher than he actually was had the effect of sending paul into his gang group to prove himself.a.roberson said it made sense to him that dennis philosophy would lead paul to associate with a street gang.a.mccaslin declared that paul and ingle were members of rival gangs until paul negotiated a peace treaty.a.dryden declaration explains that paul once ran away from home and stole a car,although he attempted to minimize the seriousness of the incident.extending the mitigation case also likely would have exposed the jury to more of paul inappropriate courtroom demeanor,thus hampering his efforts to secure a favorable verdict at the penalty phase.paul mitigation specialist averred that the defense chose not to put on the mitigation that we had developed because of jeff behavior in the court room,a,and one of the psychiatrists who examined paul explained that counsel called only one mitigation witness,jeff mother,feeling that any continuation of the trial would only result in jeff damaging himself further.a.
we recognize that the jury findings do not preclude the possibility that more detail about paul difficult and abusive childhood or his compassionate character may have caused the jury to give more weight to mitigating factors that some or all of the jurors already found,but we must consider the incremental benefit of the proffered evidence in the context of the entire record.nothing that paul offers detracts from the government strong case in aggravation,and the weight of this evidence is a proper and significant factor in considering whether paul has established prejudice.see williams,at.malone vasquez,cir.the mitigation case at trial covered much of the same ground as the newly proffered evidence.the record at trial gave the jury an opportunity to consider the same mitigating factors to which the new evidence pertains for similar or identical reasons.we acknowledge that the evidence of physical abuse by paul father presented at trial was not as extensive as that proffered in this habeas proceeding,but the jury certainly was not given reason to develop a benign conception of paul childhood,as in rompilla beard,d.unlike the record in williams taylor,d,and wiggins smith,d,the mitigation case here did include a good deal of mitigating information about paul childhood,sufficient to convince all jurors that paul experienced parental neglect,abandonment,and corruptive influence,parental abdication as to holding the defendant accountable for his behavior,and chaotic family instability,and to persuade eight jurors that paul experienced modeled parental irresponsibility.the nature of some of the proffered evidence,and further exposure of the jury to paul unruly behavior in the courtroom,likely would have increased the weight of the government case in aggravation,and counteracted any incremental gain that might have been made on the mitigating side of the balance.
taking the record as a whole,therefore,we conclude that paul proffered evidence concerning his medical,mental,or physical history is insufficient to undermine confidence in the jury verdict in the penalty phase.accordingly,even assuming that paul could show that the performance of trial counsel was constitutionally deficient,he has not established resulting prejudice 
the second issue identified in the certificate of appealability is whether trial counsel were ineffective for failing to investigate and assert paul incompetence to stand trial.paul contends that counsel performed deficiently in this respect,and that effective assistance would have resulted in a decision that he was incompetent to stand trial.to address this claim,it is necessary first to recount the proceedings in the district court regarding paul competence.
in november,the district court granted a motion filed by paul trial counsel,and ordered paul to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he was insane at the time of the alleged offenses,and whether he was suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to proceed with the trial.on february,health professionals in the mental health division at fci butner,north carolina,diagnosed paul with antisocial personality disorder,but concluded that he was not suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent for purposes of trial.a.based on this report,paul stipulated on april,that he was mentally competent to proceed with trial.paul trial counsel then retained a psychiatrist to help prepare mitigation evidence for use in a potential penalty phase.after conducting a psychiatric examination on may,the mitigation psychiatrist,anthony semone,concluded that paul was suffering from a borderline psychotic panic or possibly an acutely psychotic decompensation.semone opined that paul was not now able sufficiently to understand the charges against him,that he was unable to cooperate sufficiently with counsel in effectively assisting in his own defense,that he was not now able at all to make a rational and informed decision with respect to the plea arrangement offered by the attorney,and that he was at serious risk of being unable to control himself throughout the rigors of trial.a.based on this new report,paul trial counsel sought funding for a third psychiatric exam by irving kuo,and the district court granted the motion.kuo,however,reached a conclusion contrary to that of semone,and opined that paul was competent.a.thereafter,paul counsel did not seek a competency hearing in the district court,and the case proceeded to trial.
paul now contends that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to investigate adequately his background and mental health,and failing to raise in the district court his competence to proceed.he relies on the report of semone,his own disruptive behavior during the course of the trial,and declarations from several lay witnesses regarding his family and personal history.these declarations include statements of paul uncle that paul would see things,mostly people,in the room with us,which were not there,and that s ometimes he told me they would talk to him.paul maternal grandfather describes a family medical history of alcoholism,drug use,depression,schizophrenia,and suicide five relatives have attempted suicide,one family member has been diagnosed with schizophrenia,and one family member has been committed to a mental facility.
the district court rejected this claim of ineffective assistance,ruling that trial defense counsel was sufficiently diligent in considering and pursuing the competency issue.the court found it highly unlikely as no doubt perceived by trial defense counsel that the trial court would have interrupted the trial to order yet another competency hearing even if defense counsel had asked for petitioner behavior,while unwise and detrimental to him and his cause,did not indicate he was uncontrollable,or that he did not understand the situation.
again,although the district court resolved this claim without a hearing,there are substantial reasons to believe that counsel performance was not constitutionally deficient.counsel sought a psychiatric examination before trial,but received a report concluding that paul was competent to proceed.counsel continued nonetheless to develop competency issues for purposes of mitigation,and when a second psychiatrist opined that paul may be incompetent to proceed,counsel sought and received funding for an examination by a third psychiatrist.only after this third psychiatrist reached an opinion contrary to the second,such that counsel was faced with two psychiatric opinions that paul was competent to proceed,did counsel elect to forego a request for a formal competency hearing in the district court.the district court itself,moreover,observed that counsel no doubt perceived that it was highly unlikely that the court would have agreed to hold a competency hearing after the trial was underway.
nonetheless,if we assume for the sake of argument that counsel performance was deficient,we conclude that paul has not shown a reasonable probability that the district court would have found him incompetent to stand trial.two psychiatric examinations conducted for the purpose of determining whether paul was competent to stand trial concluded that he was competent.much of the family history cited by paul is not directly relevant to the question whether paul himself was competent to stand trial in june.it may have given counsel reason to investigate paul mental competence,but counsel in fact did investigate this point by obtaining three professional opinions.much of paul family history of mental health problems,moreover,was detailed in the psychological report submitted to the court on february.a.that report informed the trial court that paul had been hospitalized at rivendell mental health treatment facility in after attempting suicide,that paul uncle had been diagnosed with schizophrenia,and that paul brother had been discharged from the navy for mental reasons.much of the family and personal history that paul now cites is therefore cumulative of information that trial counsel discovered and disclosed through this report.the historical information,moreover,related to afflictions that paul suffered years before the trial,and which thus had little if any bearing on his competence to proceed in june.for these reasons,the alleged shortcomings of trial counsel in addressing paul competence to stand trial do not undermine our confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.
the third issue identified in the certificate of appealability is whether paul has a constitutional right to competence during federal habeas corpus proceedings and,if so,whether that constitutional right was violated paul cites the english prohibition on execution of the insane,and argues that it was justified as a way of preserving the condemned ability to make arguments on his behalf.see blackstone,commentaries i f,after judgment,he becomes of memory,execution shall be stayed for peradventure,says the humanity of the english law,had the prisoner been of sound memory,he might have alleged something in stay of judgment or execution.see also sir matthew hale,the history of the pleas of the crown sir john hawles,remarks on the trial of charles bateman,how.tr.it follows from this rationale,he contends,that a prisoner also has a right to a stay of habeas corpus forum in which he may raise arguments on his he can communicate rationally with counsel.
in his brief on appeal,however,paul does not argue directly that he enjoys a constitutional right to be competent during a habeas corpus proceeding,and the authority most nearly on point runs against the claim.bush,d see also rector clark,cir rejecting a contention that ford should be extended,in the context of a first federal habeas proceeding,to include an counsel requirement that is,a determination of whether the convict possesses the ability to inform counsel or the court of any fact which might exist which would make the punishment unjust or unlawful.rector bryant,d marshall,dissenting from denial of certiorari explaining that the eighth circuit concluded that petitioner ability to recognize or communicate facts that might make his punishment unlawful or unjust was of no legal consequence,and acknowledging that justice powell in ford rejected an counsel definition of incompetence,but urging the court to consider a strong argument to the contrary.
paul argues instead that a right to competence is grounded in federal law,and he relies principally on a decision of the ninth circuit in rohan ex rel.gates woodford,cir,which recognized a statutory right to competence during the course of a first federal habeas petition.rohan concluded that the petitioner constitutional claim of a right to competence was debatable,id.at,but substantial enough to trigger the principle that statutes should be interpreted to avoid substantial constitutional questions.the court then implied a right to competence from the statutory right to counsel for death penalty defendants provided by q b,now codified at e,reasoning that if meaningful assistance of counsel is essential to the fair administration of the death penalty and capacity for rational communication is essential to meaningful assistance of counsel,then it follows that congress mandate can not be faithfully enforced unless courts ensure that a petitioner is competent.at.the ninth circuit held that the petitioner was entitled to a stay of habeas corpus proceedings until he regained competence to communicate rationally with counsel,and paul seeks the same relief here.
our certificate of appealability does not encompass paul statutory claim to a right of competence,and paul argument might be rejected on this basis alone.see c united states taylor,cir.to overcome that problem,paul relies on slack mcdaniel,d,which held that a certificate should issue on a procedural issue,where a petitioner demonstrates that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of a denial of a constitutional right,and whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling that barred consideration of the constitutional claim.see also nichols bowersox,cir en banc.as we understand paul argument,he contends,in a variation on slack,that his ability to communicate rationally with counsel is necessary to the presentation of his constitutional claims,so that consideration of his statutory claim is necessarily antecedent to consideration of his constitutional claims.in particular,he asserts that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel often depend on facts outside the record,and that a litigant can not effectively pursue such claims unless he is competent.see rohan,at.
at least on the facts of this case,we are not persuaded that the certificate of appealability should be expanded to encompass paul claim of a statutory right to competence.paul alleges that his incompetence arose after his attempted suicide in november.as of that date,however,paul already had filed his habeas corpus motion and a,appendix on december.the government had responded on june,and the court issued its decision based on those lengthy pleadings.to the extent counsel needed assistance from paul in developing facts outside the record,that work was completed before november.
this is not a situation,therefore,where counsel must speculate about what the petitioner might have told him if the petitioner had been competent when the arguments were formulated.rohan,at.if there is a statutory right to competency in proceedings,the scope of the right must correspond to what mental capabilities the litigant needs to assist in the conduct of the litigation.see holmes buss,cir.once a habeas corpus motion is submitted to the court,and the parties are merely awaiting a decision,there is no need for rational communication between counsel and client in furtherance of the motion.unlike the constitutional claims in slack,therefore,consideration of paul constitutional claims were not barred by a preliminary,more precisely in this case,by the district court failure sua sponte to stay the proceedings after november paul alleged incompetence did not bar paul from presenting his sixth amendment claims 
even were we to follow paul this far down the path,however,and expand the certificate of appealability in a manner that presents his claim to a statutory right to competence,our reaction to the claim is similar to that of the seventh circuit in holmes 
as a matter of first impression,we might doubt the legal significance of a person lacking the mental competence to prosecute,or to assist his lawyer in prosecuting,a federal habeas corpus proceeding.technically,habeas corpus is a civil proceeding rather than a criminal one.realistically,it is a stage initiated by the criminal defendant rather than by the state and it is odd to think that someone who initiates a proceeding can then freeze it by claiming to be mentally incompetent.an incompetent person can of course have a legal claim,and it will be prosecuted by his guardian or in the antiquated legal phrase his next friend,but the fact of his incompetence will not be allowed to interrupt or delay the proceeding.
at.the seventh circuit,nonetheless,declined to reject rohan,and thereby to create a conflict in the circuits,because the state in that case did not challenge the claimed right to competence and assumed it throughout the proceedings.by contrast,the government here vigorously disputes the existence of a statutory right to competence.
we also find it unnecessary,for different reasons,to reach a definitive conclusion on the question whether a statutory right to competence exists.as in clayton roper,cir,we conclude that even assuming that a habeas petitioner has a right to competence during habeas proceedings,a right that encompasses the ability to communicate rationally with counsel,this petitioner is not entitled to relief.the district court here determined during the course of the habeas proceeding that paul was competent to proceed,and this finding is neither clearly erroneous nor prejudicial.the court factual finding was made in light of events that occurred during the habeas corpus proceeding,so we recount them here in some detail.
as we have explained,the district court authorized two mental health examinations of paul to assess his competence to stand trial.the report of the first experts concluded that paul was competent.the record shows that after paul mitigation expert,semone,voiced an opinion that paul was not competent to stand trial,a second expert,kuo,was retained to examine that question,and he expressed an opinion that paul was competent.a.the defense then elected not seek a competency hearing,and the case proceeded to trial.in its order denying the motion,the district court considered the record,including its personal observations of paul disruptive behavior at trial,and said it had no difficulty in concluding that petitioner was competent to stand trial and to assist in his own defense.
the issue of mental competence arose in this habeas proceeding on november,when counsel moved to authorize access to paul by mental health professionals.counsel advised the court that paul had attempted suicide by hanging at the federal penitentiary on november.counsel later reported,in september,that informal conversations with correctional officers led them to understand that paul was not breathing when he was found hanging by his neck on november,but that he was resuscitated by correctional officers.counsel also stated that paul broke through a glass window in the observation unit to which he was moved,and then attempted to cut himself with shards of glass.counsel conducted a telephone call with paul on november,the day after the attempted suicide,and according to what one of paul attorneys described as his armchair psychology,paul made statements during the call that were clearly delusional.a.on december,the court granted the motion,and authorized a consultation between paul and two mental health professionals.
two days later,however,the court received a handwritten letter from paul,in which paul asked to be declared competent to waive further appeals hindering the imposition of this sentence upon me.paul further stated,i do know that i am guilty of the crime which resulted in williams sherman untimely and unnatural death,and i regret the pain caused by my robbing,kicking and incapacitating williams.the letter concluded please consider my appeals dropped.a.in response to this letter,the court requested that paul counsel postpone any meetings between paul and mental health professionals until further notice from the court.on december,after visiting paul,paul counsel filed a document,prepared by counsel and signed by paul,in which paul withdrew his uncounseled expression of his desire to waive his appeal.this document stated that paul would continue to pursue his motion,and that he repudiated the positions expressed in his pro se letter to the court.
paul corresponded again with the court in may.in a typewritten letter to the district judge,paul explained that he had a case before the court at the habeas corpus stage,and asked the court to consider the applicability of the supreme court decision in banks dretke,d,decided on february.in a handwritten addendum,paul wrote that if the court did not conclude that he was entitled to a new trial or vacated guilty verdict based on banks,then he did not wish to proceed to the circuit and would ask for an execution date to be set.a.in an order dated june,the court concluded that banks was distinguishable from paul case,and denied paul request for discovery to pursue a claim based on banks and brady maryland.
on july and,the court received yet another pair of letters directly from paul.in these letters,paul again expressed his desire to terminate litigation and to proceed with the sentence handed down by the court.paul wrote,among other things,that he had experienced a supernatural amount of punishment since he was moved to the death row unit at terre haute,and that no one would choose to appropriate a living death such as this for themselves.paul stated that he had no reliable source to acquire answers needed to remedy an unbearable situation.the court then scheduled a hearing on the matter via video conference on august.on august,the day before the hearing,paul counsel renewed their request that the court authorize mental health experts to meet with paul.the motion was accompanied by a declaration of halleck,the psychiatrist,recounting that halleck had spoken with paul by telephone on january,and that paul expressed some very bizarre and disjointed ideas and beliefs.halleck said he formed the firm impression that paul was very likely experiencing a serious psychotic illness that could interfere with his ability to make rational choices or understand his legal rights,but that it would be necessary for halleck to evaluate paul in person to reach a definitive conclusion.a.
the court then proceeded on august with the hearing,which included a lengthy colloquy between the court and paul via video conference.early in the hearing,during discussions between the court and counsel,paul interjected the following statement 
paul i would like attorneys are emotionally close to me in this case,i love them dearly,but i i fully competent to make this decision on my own.although i not going to sit up here and try to speak legalese with you,the decision that i made is to forego the habeas petition,waive it,and i would like to proceed forward with an execution date before november,as per the judgment rendered against me by the jury in your court and upheld by you through your rulings on my direct appeal and the rulings,the concurrent rulings,of the eighth circuit.that what i want to do.
and i do appreciate the work that my attorneys have done for me.you have any questions about my psychiatric stability at the moment,the justice department psychiatrist team here in the prison,as well as north carolina,have all declared me competent,and you sure they could fax you copies of any report or whatnot that you would need.i am competent,and i would like to secure an execution date before november,if possible,and if you will work with me on that i appreciate it.that what i want to do.
paul later discussed with the court his may letters regarding banks dretke,acknowledged receipt of the court ruling on that point,and expressed his understanding that if his habeas corpus waiver was approved,then he would be put to death by execution.paul then had the following exchanges with the court 
the court now your lawyers have said for you,that they think you been doing crazy things and funny things,that they they have a serious question that you really know what you doing,that you in there.is there any reason they should think that 
paul well,obviously they think so,but that not the issue i speaking with you,and that what you think,then feel free to question me on it and let me consider the questions,in specific,that you have about that as far as the staff here is concerned,i have report after report saying that my affect is normal and that my behavior,with the exception of a couple of disciplinary problems is fine,competent.
the court but would you agree with me that if a person does know for sure where he is or he hallucinating,hears voices,or maybe tries to take his own life,there might be a question that he okay 
paul i agree.i agree.yeah,i agree wholeheartedly with what you saying i do believe that train of thought really applies to me.i know where i at.
i hear voices when people are talking to me,as far as taking my own life,i have a death sentence.i did i do have to,you know,not hearing any voices that are speaking to me.
the court is anybody trying to convince you that you ought to give up the ship and just let it happen,or is this something you are trying to decide or deciding on your own 
paul well,you speaking,what you implying is are there some kind of undue influence on me no,not that this is the decision that i making after having been convicted of aiding and abetting murder and having my direct appeal denied and being sentenced to death.i did make this decision for myself.i was convicted by a jury of my peers,which is what you know for a fact is the truth.i was convicted.i was sentenced to death.this decision was taken out of my hands.what i asking you,your honor,and would basically be appreciative,or i hope so,is that we forego this pro forma appellate review,and if you could help me facilitate an execution date for some closure before november,that all i asking.
the court i want you understand as clearly as i can convey it to you that this is a matter of great concern to me,that i be able to read you correctly and fairly.it a heavy responsibility so please understand,i am trying my best to be sure that i understand what you saying to me,and that nobody is forcing you or that you not out of your mind or anything,but that you just laying it out and saying it how you feel about it.is that what you doing 
paul well,one is forcing me to speak right now,as far as some personal insight,i ready,and that all there is to it.i ready.i i not rambling moron.ca presume to know what will happen after a man dies,and so obviously there trepidation about that,but it inevitable,and there you go.i mean,i have to face it.i have to face it.i do want to be,you know,on this any longer,and,you know,on a personal level,wish that you would understand that,and do want to say,you know,obviously,i feel favorably about my counsel.if they have to be released my appointment in order to facilitate this before november,then please consider this a verbal request to do so.regret everything that happened,but i ready.
later in the hearing,paul counsel attempted to advise the district court about the details of paul suicide attempt in november,but paul repeatedly pressed the mute button on the videoconferencing equipment,and argued that the information was irrelevant.a.paul also objected when counsel advised the court that a diagnosis of schizophrenia appears in paul prison file.paul told the court that he was given some medication for sleep,not for schizophrenia,and that as far as the hanging incident goes,i was just trying to save money.a.
after this hearing,the court invited briefs from the parties on whether paul was competent to waive his petition for writ of habeas corpus,and to request that his death sentence be carried out.see rees peyton,d.on august,however,paul counsel filed a motion seeking to terminate the proceedings relating to paul attempted waiver.this filing included a document signed by paul,which said that his earlier decisions were made before consulting with his attorney and without understanding what he was doing,and that paul wished to withdraw his request to drop his appeals 
in january,the court entered its final order on the habeas corpus petition.in that order,the court found,based on the results of the hearing on august,that petitioner is fully capable of being able to determine whether he wishes his post conviction efforts to continue.the court said that paul impressed the court as being fully lucid and aware that both his attorneys were desperately trying to dissuade him from the course of action he appeared to want to follow,and that paul showed remarkable patience with his attorneys.the court then made the following findings regarding paul competence to determine the course of proceedings 
the court has no reservations about petitioner mental ability to determine whether he wishes to proceed with the appellate process.based upon his letters to the court and his conduct,conversation,and general demeanor during the video conference hearing,the court believes petitioner was and is fully capable of determining whether he wants to proceed.that said,it follows that if petitioner be fully competent to determine that he wished to terminate the appellate process,he is also fully competent to change his advice of determine that he wishes to proceed with that process.this is what petitioner has done and the court agrees with both petitioner and respondent that the court should proceed to a disposition of the pending petition without further delay.
the court also denied paul motion for access to mental health professionals,finding in light of the august hearing and the record as a whole that there was no basis for allowing such access 
it is evident from these findings that the district court believed paul was capable of rational communication with his attorneys and with the court regarding the habeas corpus proceeding.we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that the court was mistaken the finding is not clearly erroneous.the district court did not come to this matter with a
