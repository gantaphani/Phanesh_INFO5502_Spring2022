an arizona statute bars patients eligible for the state medicaid program from obtaining covered family planning services through health care providers who perform abortions in cases other than medical necessity,rape,or incest.see.b.such abortions are already ineligible for medicaid coverage and so must be paid for with private funds.the arizona law extends the ineligibility to services such as gynecological exams and cancer screenings unless the patient provider agrees to stop performing privately funded elective abortions.
before the arizona law could go into effect,planned parenthood of arizona and several individual plaintiffs filed this lawsuit challenging the arizona law as a violation of the federal medicaid act.that act provides that state medicaid programs must allow medicaid recipients to obtain care from any provider qualified to perform the service or services required,and that enrollment in a medicaid plan shall not restrict the choice of the qualified provider from whom the individual may receive family planning services.a a c.this provision is known as the act requirement.see planned parenthood of comm r of the.state dep t of health,cir.
finding that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their medicaid act claim and would be irreparably harmed were the statute to become effective,the district court first entered a preliminary injunction barring implementation of the arizona law while this lawsuit was pending.arizona appealed that injunction to this court.meanwhile,proceedings continued in the district court,with that court ultimately holding that the arizona law runs afoul of the medicaid act requirement and granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs.to enforce that judgment,the district court permanently enjoined arizona from enforcing the law against medicaid providers.arizona again appealed.
the district court entry of final judgment and a permanent injunction moots arizona appeal of the preliminary injunction.see planned parenthood of cent.arizona,cir sec mount vernon mem l park,cir.we therefore dismiss that appeal case,and consider here only arizona appeal of the summary judgment order and permanent injunction case.
for the reasons here summarized and further explained below,we affirm.first,joining the only two other circuits that have decided the issue,we hold that the medicaid act requirement confers a private right of action under.see planned parenthood of,at harris olszewski,cir.
second,echoing the seventh circuit recent determination with regard to a nearly identical indiana law,we hold that the arizona statute contravenes the medicaid act requirement that states give medicaid recipients a free choice of qualified provider.see a planned parenthood of,at.the arizona law violates this requirement by precluding medicaid patients from using medical providers concededly qualified to perform family planning services to patients in arizona generally,solely on the basis that those providers separately perform privately funded,legal abortions.
background 
medicaid and the free choice of provider requirement 
medicaid is a cooperative program to help people of limited financial means obtain health care.under the program,the federal government provides funds to the states,which the states then use along with state funds to provide the care.see fed of indep.bus.sebelius.each state designs,implements,and manages its own medicaid program,with discretion as to the proper mix of amount,scope,and duration limitations on coverage.alexander choate.but that discretion has limits to receive medicaid funding,states must comply with federal criteria governing,among other matters,who is eligible for care,what services must be provided,how reimbursement is to be determined,and what range of choice medicaid recipients must be afforded in selecting their doctors.see et sebelius.at.if a state medicaid plan fails to conform to the statutory criteria,the secretary of health and human services hhs may withhold medicaid funds from the state,either in whole or part.see sebelius.at holding portions of unconstitutional but noting that n othing in our opinion precludes congress from requiring that states accepting such federal medicaid funds comply with the conditions on their use.
at issue here is the provision of the medicaid act known as the requirement.see planned parenthood of,at.that provision imposes two criteria upon state medicaid plans first,with some exceptions,state plans must generally allow medicaid recipients to obtain care from any provider who is qualified to perform the service or services required and who undertakes to provide such services.a a.second,the provision adds an additional,more specific layer of protection for patients seeking family planning services,requiring that enrollment of an individual eligible for medicaid in a primary care system,a medicaid managed care organization,or a similar entity shall not restrict the choice of the qualified person from whom the individual may receive services under section a c of this title,i,family planning services.id.a b a c.section a b thus carves out and insulates family planning services from limits that may otherwise apply under approved state medicaid plans,assuring covered patients an unfettered choice of provider for family planning services.
arizona house bill 
in spring,the arizona legislature enacted house bill hb,which provides 
arizona or any political subdivision of arizona may not enter into a contract with or make a grant to any person that performs nonfederally qualified abortions or maintains or operates a facility where nonfederally qualified abortions are performed for the provision of family planning services.
leg.serv.ch.west codified at.b.hb defines a nonfederally qualified abortion as an abortion that does not meet the requirements for federal reimbursement under title xix of the social security act,the requirements of the hyde amendment,as applied to the medicaid act.id.f.see generally harris mcrae,explaining the background of the hyde amendment.under the hyde amendment actually,a rider that congress attaches to each year appropriations legislation federal funds including medicaid funds may not be used to pay for abortions except in cases of danger to the life of the mother,rape,or incest.see consolidated appropriations act,stat,
planned parenthood challenge to hb 
planned parenthood of arizona is a nonprofit network of clinics that offer a range of family planning and reproductive health services,including annual gynecological exams,pap smears,testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases,and contraceptive counseling.for those services,planned parenthood has a longstanding provider agreement with arizona medicaid program,known as the arizona health care cost containment system or ahcccs pronounced access.together,planned parenthood of arizona clinics treat about medicaid patients each year,for which the clinics receive about in payments 
in addition to the family planning and reproductive health services described above,five of the planned parenthood clinics in arizona also perform abortions.except under the narrow circumstances permitted by arizona and federal law,planned parenthood does not receive any public funds or reimbursement for the abortions it performs.
in summer,planned parenthood received a letter,sent by ahcccs to all arizona medicaid providers,concerning the implementation of hb.the letter asked planned parenthood to return a signed form attesting that,as of august,it would not perform any abortions or maintain or operate a facility where any abortion is performed except in cases of rape,incest,or medical necessity.if planned parenthood did not return the signed attestation by the deadline,the letter explained,ahcccs would terminate its provider participation agreement and would no longer reimburse planned parenthood for any medical services.
rather than sign and return the form,planned parenthood and several individual plaintiffs filed suit to block hb from going into effect.the individual plaintiffs are three arizona women who,through medicaid,receive family planning services at the planned parenthood clinics in yuma and flagstaff,and eric reuss,an in private practice in scottsdale,who,like planned parenthood,has a medicaid provider agreement with ahcccs the initial complaint alleged that hb violates the medicaid act requirement as well as several constitutional provisions.finding that planned parenthood was likely to succeed on its medicaid act claim,the district court granted a preliminary injunction barring arizona from implementing hb while the lawsuit was pending.arizona timely appealed the preliminary injunction to this court.
meanwhile,planned parenthood moved for summary judgment solely on the medicaid act claim,which it stipulated would fully resolve the case.in february,the district court granted summary judgment for planned parenthood,holding that hb violates the medicaid act requirement.under that requirement,the district court explained,arizona unambiguously lacks the authority to limit the range of qualified medicaid providers for reasons unrelated to a provider ability to deliver medicaid services.based on its legal ruling,the district court permanently enjoined arizona from enforcing hb against plaintiffs,from disqualifying otherwise qualified providers from receiving medicaid reimbursement for medical services covered by medicaid on the basis that these providers provide otherwise legal abortions,and from requiring providers to sign the attestation form issued by ahcccs in furtherance of hb or enforcing any previously signed attestation forms.arizona timely appealed to this court.we consolidated the new appeal with arizona already pending preliminary injunction appeal.
discussion 
a confers a right of action 
there is an issue to be addressed at the threshold whether planned parenthood has pleaded a viable cause of action.planned parenthood asserts a right of action for enforcement of the medicaid act requirement under.arizona objects,maintaining that the provision does not satisfy the requisites for a claim.joining two of our sister circuits,we hold that a may be enforced through individual lawsuits.see planned parenthood of,at harris,at 
section creates a federal remedy against anyone who,under color of state law,deprives any citizen of the united states of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws.section thus authorizes lawsuits to enforce individual rights under federal statutes,not the broader or vaguer benefits or interests a federal statute may implicate.city of rancho palos verdes abrams,emphasis added quoting gonzaga doe.
to determine whether a federal statutory provision creates a private right enforceable under,we consider three factors first,congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff second,the plaintiff must have demonstrate d that the right assertedly protected is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence and third,the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms.blessing freestone,internal citation and quotation marks omitted.if all three prongs are satisfied,the right is presumptively enforceable through.gonzaga,at.the defendant may overcome the presumption by demonstrating that congress foreclosed private enforcement expressly or impliedly,by creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual private lawsuits.id.at quoting blessing,at.
that congress intended the requirement to create an individual right is evident arizona does not contend otherwise.the statutory language unambiguously confers such a right upon patients,mandating that all state medicaid plans provide that any individual eligible for medical assistance may obtain such assistance from any institution,agency,community pharmacy,or person,qualified to perform the service or services required.a emphasis added.while express use of the term individuals or persons or similar terms is not essential to finding a right for purposes,usually such use is sufficient for that purpose.ball rodgers,cir see also gonzaga,at pointing to similarly individually focused language in title vi of the civil rights act of,and title ix of the education amendments of,a,as prototypical examples of language.the two other federal circuits that have directly considered the medicaid provision under the framework have agreed that it contains language sufficient to establish the first gonzaga requisite for a right enforceable under.see planned parenthood of,at harris,at 
nor does arizona question whether the statute is couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms,blessing,at,as it indubitably is.see a a state plan for medical assistance must.
arizona challenge centers,instead,on the vague and amorphous prong of the standard.see blessing,at.the concern underlying this factor is that some statutory rights do not give courts meaningful instruction for the resolution of particular cases.watson weeks,cir.where a provision suppl ies concrete and objective standards for enforcement,that concern does not arise.id.at.in the medicaid act context,a provision will satisfy this prong of the right requirement if a state compliance with the provision can be ascertained by reviewing sources such as a state medicaid plan,agency records and documents,and the testimony of medicaid recipients and providers.ball,at.
the requirement does supply concrete and objective standards for enforcement.watson,at.the provision specifies that any individual medicaid recipient is free to choose any provider so long as two criteria are met the provider is qualified to perform the service or services required,and the provider undertakes to provide the recipient such services.a.these are objective criteria,well within judicial competence to apply.the second criterion raises a simple factual question no different from those courts decide every day.for example,a doctor could establish that requisite by submitting a declaration or sworn testimony that she is willing to provide medicaid patients with the service in question.the first criterion,whether the doctor is qualified to do so,may require more factual development or expert input,but still falls well within the range of judicial competence.the requirement could be established,for example,by a combination of evidence as to the medical licenses the doctor holds and evidence as to the licenses necessary under state law to perform family planning services.together,the two criteria do not require courts to engage in any balancing of competing concerns or subjective policy judgments,but only to answer factual,questions was an individual denied the choice of a qualified and willing provider the answer to these questions is likely to be readily apparent.harris,at.
arizona contends otherwise,seizing on the statutory term qualified as too vague for the court to enforce.we disagree.
watson held that a provision requiring states to set reasonable eligibility standards was too vague for judicial enforcement because the provision did not tie reasonableness to any objective standard.at citation and quotation marks omitted emphasis added.by contrast,the statutory term here,qualified,is tethered to an objective benchmark qualified to perform the service or services required.a a emphasis added.a court can readily determine whether a particular health care provider is qualified to perform a particular medical service,drawing on evidence such as descriptions of the service required state licensing requirements the provider credentials,licenses,and experience and expert testimony regarding the appropriate credentials for providing the service.this standard is not subjective or amorphous,and requires no balancing it is no different from the sorts of qualification or expertise assessments that courts routinely make in various contexts.
in light of the foregoing analysis,we hold that medicaid beneficiaries enjoy an unambiguously conferred individual right to a free choice of provider under a.arizona makes no attempt to demonstrate that congress has expressly or impliedly foreclosed remedies for this right,nor would any such attempt succeed.see ball,at.medicaid requirement therefore creates a right that may be enforced under.
hb violates a 
we now turn to the merits of the case whether hb,as applied in the context of arizona medicaid program,violates the medicaid act requirement 
we begin,as always,with the cardinal canon of statutory construction congress says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.bank germain.in determining the scope of a statute,we giv e the words used their ordinary meaning,moskal united states,internal quotation marks and citation omitted,unless congress has directed us to do otherwise.
the relevant medicaid provision states 
a state plan for medical assistance must provide that a any individual eligible for medical assistance may obtain such assistance from any institution,agency,community pharmacy,or person,qualified to perform the service or services required,who undertakes to provide him such services,and b an enrollment of an individual eligible for medical assistance in a primary care casemanagement system,a medicaid managed care organization,or a similar entity shall not restrict the choice of the qualified person from whom the individual may receive family planning services 
a emphasis added.a ny means all except to the extent that congress add s language limiting the breadth of that word.merritt dillard paper,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.so a state medicaid plan must allow any given medicaid recipient to seek family planning care from any and all providers,subject only to two limitations the provider is qualified to perform the service or services required and the provider undertakes to provide the patient such services.we agree with the seventh circuit that r ead in context,the term qualified as used in a unambiguously relates to a provider capab ility of performing the needed medical services in a professionally competent,safe,legal,and ethical manner.planned parenthood of,at.our reasons for so concluding are several.
first,the term qualified is not specially defined within the medicaid act.we therefore read that term,as it appears in a,as conveying its ordinary meaning,which is having an officially recognized qualification to practice as a member of a particular profession fit,competent.oxford english dictionary ed see also black law dictionary ed p ossessing the necessary qualifications capable or competent.and,as the overall context of the medicaid act is the provision of medical services,the pertinent professions which providers must be qualified to practice are the various medical professions.
second,were there any doubt as to how we should read the word qualified in a,congress removed it by adding the further specification qualified to perform the service or services required.a a emphasis added.we must give effect,if possible,to every word of a statute.united states menasche,internal quotation marks omitted.here,the words to perform the service or services required modify the adjective qualified,telling us that congress meant for that adjective not to refer to a medicaid authorization,but to denote the capability to carry out a particular activity perform ing the medical service that a given medicaid recipient requires.the provision thus indexes the relevant qualifications not to any criteria whether imposed by the federal government or the states,but to factors external to the medicaid program the provider competency and professional standing as a medical provider generally.the verb perform here is key it confirms that the relevant question is not whether the provider is qualified in some sense specific to medicaid patients,but simply whether the provider is qualified in a general sense to perform,carry out,the service in question,whether for medicaid patients or for any other patients.see perform,oxford english dictionary ed.a to carry out in action,execute,or fulfil.b to do,carry out,execute,or accomplish an action,operation,process,function.
arizona urges us to read a as having the opposite meaning from the one we ascribe to it rather than guaranteeing patient choice,arizona contends in its briefs,the provision empowers states to restrict patient choice to a limited list of providers for any reason supplied by state law.arizona argument hinges on construing the statutory term qualified not according to its ordinary meaning,but instead as a term of art conferring upon the states plenary authority to withhold medicaid funds on any policy grounds they prefer to pursue.under arizona reading,states can determine for any reason that a provider is not qualified for medicaid purposes,even if the provider is otherwise legally qualified,through training and licensure,to provide the requisite medical services within the state.
there are three fatal flaws with arizona reading of the statute.the first,to restate the obvious,is that i n determining the scope of a statute,we do giv e the words used their ordinary meaning,moskal,at internal citation and quotation marks omitted,unless the statute directs us to do otherwise.as a court,we are not vested with the power to rewrite the medicaid act,but rather must construe what congress has written.see.state bd.of educ.for charter sch.u.dep t of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.nowhere in the medicaid act has congress given a special definition to qualified,much less indicated that each state is free to define this term for purposes of its own medicaid program however it sees fit.
second,as a court,we have a duty to give effect,if possible,to every word of a statute.menasche,at internal quotation marks omitted see also united states lkav,cir.it is for us to ascertain neither to add nor to subtract,neither to delete nor to distort.state,at quoting cases,more or less,each containing six jars of jam united states.arizona reading detaches the word qualified from the phrase in which it is embedded qualified to perform the service or services required and from the overall context of the medicaid statute,which governs medical services.
additionally,w e must avoid an interpretation that would produce absurd results.lkav,at internal quotation marks omitted.read as arizona suggests,the requirement would be.if the states are free to set any qualifications they want no matter how unrelated to the provider fitness to treat medicaid patients then the requirement could be easily undermined by simply labeling any exclusionary rule as a qualification.planned parenthood of,at.
for instance,were arizona free to define qualified for a purposes to mean doctors who do not perform elective abortions,then another state might be equally free to extend medicaid funds only to doctors who do perform such abortions.if a state wished to interpret qualified to mean only osteopaths or only,or only or only smokers,or only affiliates of the state university medical school,on the grounds that only doctors within that category are worthy of receiving medicaid funds,then,on arizona reading of a,it would be free to do so.giving the word qualified such an expansive meaning would deprive the provision within which it appears of any legal force.moreover,that interpretation would permit states freely to erect barriers to medicaid patients access to family planning medical providers others in the state are free to use.such a result would eliminate the broad access to medical care that a is meant to preserve.planned parenthood of,at.when a natural reading of a statute leads to a rational,result,an alteration of meaning is not only unnecessary,but also extrajudicial.state,at.
finally,the provision appears in a list of mandatory requirements that apply to all state medicaid plans.on arizona reading,however,the provision does not set any requirement at all for state plans.instead,it permits states to impose for medicaid purposes whatever standards for provider participation it wishes.
for all these reasons,the provision unambiguously requires that states participating in the medicaid program allow covered patients to choose among the family planning medical practitioners they could use were they paying out of their own pockets.
while we could perhaps stop there,we recognize that a section of a statute should not be read in isolation from the context of the whole act.richards united states.taking that broader approach,we conclude that our reading of a is bolstered rather than undermined by considering its statutory context.even if the word qualified within the requirement were ambiguous in isolation which,for all the reasons we have surveyed,it is not it would lose all trappings of ambiguity when considered within the medicaid act as a whole.
elsewhere in the act,congress has enumerated specific circumstances under which the hhs secretary may waive a state compliance with the requirement enunciated in a.for example,b authorizes the hhs secretary to grant w aivers to promote and efficiency.under that subsection,the secretary may waive the requirement so that a state may implement a system,b,or limit medicaid recipients choice of providers to those who meet,accept,and comply with state reimbursement,quality,and utilization standards,id.b.as another example,authorizes the secretary to waive the requirement to the extent necessary for a state to carry out an approved demonstration project.id.a a.
if arizona reading of a were correct,these waiver provisions would be unnecessary.after all,it is arizona position that states can preclude medicaid beneficiaries from choosing otherwise appropriate service providers by defining certain classes of providers as unqualified,for a purposes,for any reason supplied by state law.if that were so,then states would not need to go to the trouble of requesting waivers of a from hhs to implement systems or hold providers to state efficiency standards.they could simply define all providers as unqualified for the purposes of a.
arizona agrees that we must read a within its statutory context,but points instead to a different provision of the medicaid act,the provision at p.that component of the act provides 
in addition to any other authority,a state may exclude any individual or entity for purposes of participating under the state plan for any reason for which the secretary could exclude the individual or entity under section,or b of this title.
p.arizona reads the phrase i n addition to any other authority to mean that states have plenary authority to exclude providers from their medicaid plans.just as indiana did in defending its similar law,arizona reads the phrase for more than it worth.planned parenthood of,at.this standard savings clause signals only that what follows is a list and does not imply that the states have an unlimited authority to exclude providers for any reason whatsoever.id 
moreover,to the extent that p sheds light on a,it does so in a way that undermines,rather than aids,arizona argument.the language refers to any other authority emphasis added,followed by a provision providing states with authority to exclude providers on specified grounds.this sequence indicates that the medicaid act itself must provide that other authority,just as it supplies the authority covered by the rest of the subsection.were it otherwise were states free to exclude providers as they see fit then the bulk of p itself would be unnecessary,as the authority it supplies would be superfluous.
further,the bases for excluding a provider from a state medicaid plan by p all refer to various forms of malfeasance such as fraud,drug crimes,and failure to disclose necessary information to regulators.planned parenthood of,at.read in context,the p savings clause empowers states to exclude individual providers on such grounds directly,without waiting for the secretary to act,while also reaffirming state authority to exclude individual providers pursuant to analogous state law provisions relating to fraud or misconduct.it does not suggest that states may categorically exclude a class of providers on grounds unrelated to medical competency or legal and ethical propriety.
both a itself and other provisions of the medicaid act admit of some exceptions to the rule,but none apply to this case.
first,various provisions of the medicaid act allow states,as arizona has done,to seek permission from hhs to limit recipients choice to the extent necessary to implement standards or a demonstration project,see,describing waivers for demonstration projects b describing waivers for efficiency,or,without a waiver,to exercise a statutory option to implement a system for medicaid recipients,see id.a.these exceptions have no bearing on this case.even if a state otherwise exercises its option to implement a system,a b makes clear that as to family planning services,state medicaid plans must afford recipients the full range of free choice of provider.similarly,efficiency waivers provided under may never be used to restrict the choice of the individual in receiving family planning services.id.b,a c.and while arizona waiver is pursuant to,for demonstration projects a type of waiver that can perhaps extend to family planning services if the secretary so provides the secretary has not so provided for arizona.rather,as the district court determined,arizona waiver extends to the general free choice guarantee in a a only to the extent necessary to enroll recipients in managed care,and does not extend at all to the family planning services guarantee in a b.
second,a itself enumerates several exceptions to its scope.for example,it does not apply in puerto rico,guam,or the virgin islands,nor does it interfere with states separate statutory authority to subject new providers to a temporary moratorium under kk.see id.a b.the provision also specifies that it shall not be construed to require states to allow persons or entities convicted of a felony for an offense inconsistent with the best interests of beneficiaries to participate in their medicaid programs.id.again,none of these exceptions apply here arizona is not a territory exempt from the requirement,plaintiffs are not new providers being excluded pursuant to a temporary moratorium,and arizona does not contend that any of the plaintiffs have been convicted of felonies.
finally,several provisions of the medicaid act in addition to p recognize both federal and state authority to exclude individual providers from public health care programs on grounds related to fraud,patient abuse,criminal activity,improper billing or,and the like.the secretary is required to exclude providers convicted of certain crimes related to health care fraud,patient abuse,or controlled substances,see a,and is also permitted to exclude providers for certain other enumerated reasons,including certain types of convictions,license revocations,failures to disclose,false representations,and defaults on loans,see id.b see also id.b listing grounds on which secretary may refuse to enter into or terminate a provider agreement.another provision,the provision mentioned above,empowers states to exclude providers on any of these same grounds.id.p.again,these exceptions do not apply here.hb does not set out grounds for excluding individual providers from arizona medicaid program demonstrated to have engaged in some type of criminal,fraudulent,abusive,or otherwise improper behavior.rather,it preemptively bars a class of providers on the ground that their scope of practice includes certain perfectly legal medical procedures.
for the same reason,none of the cases cited by arizona in which courts have upheld the exclusion of particular providers from state medicaid programs supports the proposition that states may exclude classes of providers from their medicaid programs because of legislative disapproval of those providers scope of services.
guzman shewry,cir,affirmed the denial of a preliminary injunction to a physician suspended from california medicaid program because he was the subject of a fraud investigation,pursuant to a state law requiring the temporary suspension of any provider under such an investigation.id.at citing cal.welf.a.in affirming the district court denial of the injunction,guzman held only that the medicaid act does not preempt state laws providing for suspension of providers in cases of possible fraud or abuse,as well as for other reasons having to do with professional competence,professional performance,or financial integrity.id.at quoting b.guzman did not address the provision,and
