in this civil rights case,brought pursuant to,morgan calvi beseeches us to reverse the entry of summary judgment in favor of various county and municipal defendants in succession,she attacks the constitutionality of summary judgment,the district court assessment of the evidence,and the court concomitant refusal to consider certain claims on the ground that they were outside the compass of her complaint.discerning no error,we affirm.
background 
the pivotal facts are laid out in considerable detail in the recommended decision of the magistrate judge,see calvi city of rockland,civ,wl,and we assume the reader familiarity with that decision.
on january,a operator,reacting to a male caller later identified as matthew hayden who had locked himself in his room because a woman was brandishing a knife in his house,dispatched officer kenneth smith of the rockland police department to talbot avenue,rockland,maine.several people,most of them unrelated,lived at that address.smith was familiar with the locus,having gone there the day before to settle a dispute between calvi and another tenant,kevin warren.
the dispatcher told smith that calvi had been identified as the.when smith arrived at the residence,the landlord lawrence frier agreed to go inside and find calvi.around the same time,had fled the the dispatcher and asked if it was safe to go back.upon learning that the police were on the premises,he returned and played an audiotape for smith.warren told smith that four,frier,calvi,and present when the tape was made inside the dwelling.apparently,calvi had begun yelling at warren because he made faces at her.when warren an alleged martial arts expert approached calvi,she snatched a butcher knife from the sinkboard.
on the tape,calvi,obviously upset,could be heard launching a series of accusations at warren.frier could be heard imploring calvi to be reasonable and,at one point,stating to her morgan,that a felony.warren eventually fled,and hayden called the police.
by the time that frier located calvi,another officer was at the scene.calvi told smith that she wanted to tell her side of the story.smith,however,arrested her on the spot,charged her with criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon,see.ann.tit,and stated that she could relate her version later.frier gave calvi bail money and told smith to be gentle because she was frail and had recently undergone elbow surgery.
smith placed calvi in handcuffs and them behind her back so that they would not tighten.he then marched her outside,deposited her in his cruiser,and belted her in for transport to the knox county jail.smith fellow officer,sergeant jeffrey mclaughlin,was at the scene but had no real interaction with calvi mclaughlin spent his time talking with warren and hayden.
when handcuffing calvi and assisting her into the back seat of the cruiser,smith,who had been trained as a paramedic,did not observe any debilitating condition.he did notice,however,that calvi was crying during the drive to the jail.all in all,calvi was handcuffed for no more than fifteen minutes.
while calvi has several disabilities,the only one relevant here is a birth defect that required surgical straightening of three of the fingers on her left hand.although this disability is painful,it has never prevented calvi from doing routine activities such as dressing herself,feeding herself,or working at.
upon arriving at the lockup,smith transferred custody of his prisoner to a knox county correctional officer,rebecca gracie.gracie unlocked the handcuffs,patted calvi down,and placed her in a holding cell.after other required aspects of the booking process had been completed,another knox county officer fingerprinted calvi.gracie was present during the fingerprinting but had no direct involvement with calvi at that stage.
calvi claims that the officer who fingerprinted her repeatedly pushed her fingers down hard,in spite of being told that she had a hand deformity.she further claims that the fingerprinting caused injuries to her wrist and surgically repaired middle finger.calvi eventually was released on bail that same day.
in due course,calvi brought suit against smith,mclaughlin,and gracie in each instance alleging excessive force and against the city of rockland,knox county,and the county sheriff,daniel davey in each instance alleging secondary liability,failure to supervise,failure to train.she did not sue,and has never sued,the knox county correctional officer who fingerprinted her.
following pretrial discovery,the various defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court referred the motions to a magistrate judge,see.b,who recommended that they be granted.see calvi,wl,at.over calvi objection,the district judge adopted the recommended decision and entered summary judgment in favor of all defendants see calvi city of rockland,civ,wl.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.the summary judgment standard 
it is common ground that appellate review of an order granting summary judgment is de novo and is confined to the record that was before the district court.see mandel boston phoenix,cir.in effecting such review,the court of appeals must take as true the facts documented in the record below,resolving any factual conflicts or disparities in favor of the nonmovant.see houlton citizens coal.town of houlton,cir.the court must draw all reasonable inferences from the assembled facts in the light most hospitable to the nonmovant.id.only facts,so marshaled,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c,will the entry of summary judgment be affirmed.see depoutot raffaelly,cir.
in implementing the summary judgment standard,an issue is considered genuine if it may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party at trial.garside osco drug,cir.by like token,a fact is considered material if it possesses the capacity to sway the outcome of the litigation under the applicable law.amusements,town of dedham,cir.
of course,the nonmovant may defeat a summary judgment motion by demonstrating,through submissions of evidentiary quality,that a trialworthy issue persists.celotex catrett,d.doing so,however,requires more than the frenzied brandishing of a cardboard sword.as we have warned,a conglomeration of conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation is insufficient to discharge the nonmovant burden.depoutot,at quoting reynolds tobacco,cir.
it is with this standard in mind that we turn to calvi claims of error.
iii.the constitutional claim 
in a broadside directed at the district court proceedings as a whole,calvi contends that summary judgment is an unconstitutional abridgement of her seventh amendment right to trial by jury.that contention is hopeless.
summary judgment has a unique place in federal civil litigation.its role is to pierce the boilerplate of the pleadings and assay the parties proof in order to determine whether trial is actually required.wynne tufts.sch.of,cir.the device allows courts and litigants to avoid trials in unwinnable cases,thus conserving the parties time and money,and permitting courts to husband scarce judicial resources.mccarthy northwest airlines,cir.so viewed,a grant of summary judgment does not compromise the seventh amendment jury trial right because that right exists only with respect to genuinely disputed issues of material fact.see harris interstate brands,cir.
not uniquely,the district of maine local rules require the filing,with every motion for summary judgment,of a short and concise statement of the material facts,with appropriate record references.see me.b.a related rule provides in pertinent part that a party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall submit with its opposition a separate,short,and concise statement of material facts which shall admit,deny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party statement of material facts and unless a fact is admitted,shall support each denial or qualification by a record citation.id.c.calvi asserts,without any citation to persuasive authority,that these rules are unconstitutional because they ensure a trial by paper that,
