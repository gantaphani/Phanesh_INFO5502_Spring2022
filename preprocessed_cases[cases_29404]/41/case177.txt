background 
on february,ramírez was admitted at the san juan va medical center complaining of abdominal pain and general discomfort.he was diagnosed with appendicitis,but an appendectomy performed that day showed a normal appendix.an electrocardiogram ekg performed that same day showed an inferior infarct dead cardiac muscle tissue and abnormalities in his heart rhythm,which suggested a deficiency of blood supply to part of his heart.according to ramírez,the va did not inform ramírez of these results.a va doctor recommended that,after his discharge,ramírez be given a stress test.the next day,cardiac enzyme studies showed normal results.on february,an infectious disease specialist examined ramírez because he showed evidence of probable infection.that doctor recommended a battery of tests,including serial ekgs,cardiac enzyme studies,a cardiology evaluation,and an abdominal sonogram if abdominal pain persisted.on february,the hospital ordered an echocardiogram for a closer inspection of ramírez heart.on february,ramírez was discharged and the hospital recommended a visit at the surgical clinic.
the echocardiogram ordered by the hospital was performed on may.it showed abnormalities in the heart movement suggestive of a prior myocardial infarction and a mild dysfunction of the left lower chamber of the heart.on may,ramírez was seen at the surgery clinic,and was described as doing well.he was given a appointment for november,but he did not keep that appointment.
on october,ramírez was admitted to the emergency room of the mayaguez va outpatient clinic complaining of a history of abdominal pain,which had worsened in the last three days.ramírez blood pressure was elevated,but he was described as being in no acute distress and his heart and extremities were described as normal.ramírez was discharged with a prescription for an antispasmodic and he was instructed to return the following day.
ramírez returned to the outpatient clinic the next day,october,saying that he was feeling the same.his blood pressure was again high,but his abdomen was described as normal and the treating physicians noted again that he was not in acute distress.he was discharged with another prescription for antispasmodics.up to this point,ramírez had been under the va constant and exclusive care since.
later that day,ramírez went to the emergency room at la concepción hospital complaining of chest pain.ramírez blood pressure was high and an ekg showed an old inferior wall myocardial infarction old dead cardiac muscle tissue,as well as an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction heart muscle tissue that was dying due to a deprivation of blood supply.he was admitted to the intensive care unit.
on october,la concepción hospital referred ramírez to hospital perea for a cardiac catheterization.that test detected three partially or totally obstructed heart vessels.on october,ramírez was transferred to luke hospital where he underwent coronary bypass surgery on october,and was discharged on november.
on february,ramírez filed a timely administrative claim the first claim with the va alleging that on october and,the va mayaguez outpatient clinic failed to diagnose and treat the condition angina that caused the myocardial infarction that led to surgery on october.as a result of this claim,the parties engaged in settlement negotiations according to ramírez,on march,during settlement negotiations,the va informed ramírez that the ekg performed in february showed a coronary condition that could have been treated.ramírez claims this was the first time he had heard about those ekg results.he also claims that the parties agreed that,as a condition of settlement,the parties would sever the part of the claim relating to the failure to treat the coronary condition revealed by the february ekg the second claim,and ramírez would submit that claim on a later date.as evidence of that agreement,ramírez points to a letter sent by his lawyer to the va confirming the settlement and stating,we are willing to sever the part of the claim which covers the damages resulting from the heart operation,and resubmit the same.it appears that the va never responded to this letter.on april,ramírez signed a settlement agreement for.
on march,ramírez filed a second administrative claim alleging that the va failure to treat ramírez coronary condition contributed to his need for the open heart surgery.more than three years later,on may,the va denied ramírez second claim on timeliness grounds,noting that the administrative claim was filed outside the two year period established by b.in its letter denying the claim,the va indicated that during the investigation of the first claim and its subsequent settlement,it had considered ramírez coronary artery disease claim and rejected it 
on december,ramírez filed a complaint in federal district court against the va for money damages under the federal tort claims act ftca,b,alleging that the va failure to treat his coronary condition amounted to medical malpractice,which resulted in his suffering a myocardial infarction that required open heart surgery.on january,the district court adopted magistrate judge report and recommendation granting summary judgment in favor of the va on the grounds that the action was.
ii.standard of review 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.see napier deesie,cir.we will reverse the lower court if,after viewing the facts and making all inferences in favor of the party,the evidence on record is sufficiently to permit a rational fact finder to resolve the liability issue in favor of either side.coyne taber partners i,cir see.
iii.discussion 
the ftca is a limited waiver of sovereign immunity by the united states whereby a claimant can sue for the negligent or wrongful act or omission of certain government employees.b.however,a tort claim against the united states shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate federal agency within two years after such claim accrues.b.the general rule is that a tort claim accrues at the time of the plaintiff injury.united states kubrick,d.however,under the discovery rule exception,a claim accrues when the plaintiff discovers,or should have discovered,the factual basis for the cause of action.gonzález united states,cir.
ramírez makes three arguments on appeal that his second claim is not.his first argument is that his first claim put the va on notice of his second claim,and that therefore they were both filed on february.in support of his argument,ramírez points out that the va admitted to considering the merits of the second claim as part of its investigation of the first claim.
under the ftca,a n action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the united states unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate federal agency.a.this process is intended to provide sufficient notice to the united states so that it can investigate the alleged incident of negligence.see lópez united states,cir.an agency must receive enough information in the claim filed in order to begin the investigation.sec y of dep t of defense,cir.accordingly,the test to satisfy this requirement is an eminently pragmatic one as long as the language of an administrative claim serves due notice that the agency should investigate the possibility of particular potentially tortious conduct and includes a specification of the damages sought,it fulfills the requirement.dynamic image,united states,cir.
ramírez first claim did not include facts about the failure to treat his coronary condition it made no reference to any medical treatment he did or did not receive before october.rather,it was limited to the misdiagnosis and inadequate standard of care which the veteran received on october and.appellant br.that set of facts could not have put the va on notice of his second coronary condition claim,which is based on alleged malpractice occurring more than a year earlier.that the va went beyond the facts stated in the first claim in preparation for settlement negotiations does not change this analysis.the test is whether the claim put the government on notice of the cause of action,not whether the government knew about the cause of action.our inquiry,therefore,is simply whether the facts stated in the claim put the agency on notice of particular potentially tortious conduct.dynamic image,at.here,the facts presented spoke only to the va conduct in failing to diagnose ramírez heart attack there was simply no information about the va treatment or lack thereof of a coronary condition detected one year earlier.
ramírez second argument is that his claim was timely because,under the discovery rule,his claim did not accrue until march,when he learned during settlement negotiations that the february ekg showed that he had a coronary condition which the va failed to treat.ramírez argues that his march,claim was timely because it was brought within two years of the accrual date of march.
under the discovery rule,a claim accrues when the party has knowledge of both the injury and its cause.united states kubrick,d.pursuant to this rule,a claim accrues when the plaintiff discovers,or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the factual basis for the cause of action.gonzález,at see also callahan united states,cir accrual is triggered by the discovery of sufficient facts about the injury and its cause to prompt a reasonable person to inquire and seek advice preliminary to deciding if there is a basis for filing an administrative claim against the government.internal quotation marks omitted.the standard is an objective one in order to toll the statute of limitations pursuant to the discovery rule,the factual basis for the cause of action must have been inherently unknowable at the time of injury.gonzález,at.inherently unknowable means that the factual basis is incapable of detection by the wronged party through the exercise of reasonable diligence.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court held that the coronary condition cause of action the second claim accrued no later than october,the day of the surgery because,by that time,ramírez had sufficient facts to alert a reasonable person that the va might have been negligent in the course of his treatment after the february ekg.the district court further held,in the alternative,that ramírez was on notice of the coronary condition claim by february,when the first claim was filed,because by that time,ramírez had already retained counsel to investigate the matter and represent him during the administrative proceedings.
we agree with the district court that ramírez had sufficient information to trigger the statute of limitations clock,at the latest,on february,when he hired a lawyer to prosecute his first claim against the.on october,the date of ramírez coronary bypass surgery,ramírez knew that he had a coronary condition,he knew that his heart condition had deteriorated to the point that surgery was required,and he knew that he had had an ekg and an echocardiogram in,which were followed by a battery of other tests.this information alone could lead a reasonable person to inquire into the care he had received at the va in the years preceding the surgery,particularly where his medical treatment had been exclusively provided at that hospital.but even if this information was not enough,surely the hiring of legal counsel on february,brought ramírez a critical step closer to facilitating the discovery of possible malpractice in the treatment he received at the.once he retained legal counsel to prosecute a malpractice claim against the va,ramírez was armed with enough information,and now had added resources to discover the factual basis for a related second cause of action.a plaintiff,through his attorneys,bears the responsibility of both inquiring among the medical and legal communities to determine whether he had an actionable claim and bringing any such claim within the statutory period.gonzález,at.
ramírez final argument is that his second claim should be equitably tolled because the va allegedly agreed to the claim resubmission as part of the settlement of the first claim.
although ramírez appeal refers to the doctrine of equitable tolling,we construe his argument to be based on equitable estoppel the two doctrines are closely related,but distinct.equitable tolling applies when the plaintiff is unaware of the facts underlying his cause of action,gonzález,at,while equitable estoppel applies when a plaintiff who knows of his cause of action reasonably relies on the defendant conduct or statements in failing to bring suit,vistamar,cir.ramírez claim that the va agreed to the delayed submission of the second claim appeals to equitable principles relating to the propriety of his reliance upon the defendant conduct.because it is fairly clear that ramírez argument is based on equitable estoppel rather than equitable tolling and because the two doctrines are often used interchangeably,we treat his argument as such.see puerto rico,cir the plaintiff argument muddles the doctrines of equitable estoppel and equitable tolling.because the plaintiff asserts elements of both doctrines,we will analyze the equitable arguments under both estoppel and tolling theories.see also ins,cir courts themselves often use the terms equitable tolling and equitable estoppel interchangeably or incorrectly.
in irwin department of veterans affairs,d,the supreme court held that there is a rebuttable presumption that equitable tolling is a defense to all statutes of limitations in suits against the government.however,this court has not explicitly extended irwin holding to equitable estoppel.see berman united states,cir.however,the supreme court itself in irwin treated equitable estoppel as a form of equitable tolling when it cited an equitable estoppel case to support the proposition that the court has allowed equitable tolling in situations where the complainant has been induced or tricked by his adversary misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass.irwin,at.citing glus brooklyn dist.terminal,d applying equitable estoppel where adversary misrepresentation caused plaintiff to let filing period lapse by representing to plaintiff that he had seven years in which to sue see also goodhand united states,cir irwin explicitly albeit in dictum treats equitable estoppel as a form of equitable tolling.parenthetical in original.moreover,we see no reason for distinguishing between equitable tolling and estoppel as defense to the ftca statute of limitations.courts of appeals that have addressed whether equitable estoppel is a defense to the ftca statute of limitations have assumed that it is.see,goodhand,at lehman united states,cir see also winter united states,cir unpublished opinion holding that the government was equitably estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense because the va engaged affirmative misconduct.thus,we hold that equitable estoppel may be invoked against the government in a claim under the ftca.
in heckler community health services,the supreme court explained that a party seeking to assert equitable estoppel must demonstrate that the party to be estopped made a definite misrepresentation of fact to another person having reason to believe that the other would rely upon it the party seeking estoppel relied on the misrepresentations to its detriment and the
