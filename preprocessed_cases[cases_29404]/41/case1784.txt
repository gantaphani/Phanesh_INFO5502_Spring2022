brandi standridge and kenya phillips,as class representatives,sued union pacific railroad company union pacific for sexual discrimination under title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et,as amended by the pregnancy discrimination act of pda,k.the district court granted standridge and phillips motion for partial summary judgment on july,and entered final judgment in their favor on february.union pacific appeals.for the reasons discussed below,we reverse.
background 
union pacific,a freight company headquartered in omaha,nebraska,provides health care benefits to those of its employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements agreement employees.these agreement employees receive benefits through one of five plans.while the plans provide benefits for services such as routine physical exams,tetanus shots and drug and alcohol treatments,they exclude coverage of allergy serum,immunization agents,biological sera and drugs that treat infertility.they also exclude both male and female contraceptive methods,prescription and,when used for the sole purpose of contraception.union pacific only covers contraception when medically necessary for a purpose such as regulating menstrual cycles,treating skin problems or avoiding serious health risks associated with pregnancy.
standridge and phillips are two of the approximately female agreement employees of age employed by union pacific during the time period relevant to this litigation.standridge and phillips used prescription contraception for contraceptive purposes,and the plans did not cover the costs of their contraception.they,along with two other female employees,brought individual suits against union pacific alleging that union pacific discriminated against its female employees by not providing coverage of prescription contraception in violation of title vii,as amended by the pda.the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated the four similar actions against union pacific and transferred the consolidated action to the district of nebraska.the district court granted class certification,named standridge and phillips as class representatives,and certified the class as a ll females employed by union pacific railroad company after february,enrolled in one of the agreement plans who used prescription contraception,at least in part for the purpose of preventing pregnancy,without insurance reimbursement from said plan.
the district court granted standridge and phillips motion for partial summary judgment,finding that union pacific failure to cover prescription contraception constitutes a violation of title vii,as amended by the pda.in holding that the coverage was discriminatory against women,the district court cited the language of the pda,the purpose of its enactment,the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc interpretation of the pda application to prescription contraception and reasoning from other district court decisions.the district court rejected standridge and phillips argument that unplanned pregnancies have a negative social impact.it also rejected union pacific arguments that a requirement to cover prescription contraception would have a large financial impact that the denial of all contraception results in equal treatment of men and women that contraception deals with fertility and is not a medical condition related to pregnancy that union pacific covered benefits are,not preventive and that there is no medical necessity for contraception with respect to fertility because pregnancy is a normal human condition.the district court held that union pacific violated title vii,as amended by the pda,because it treats medical care women need to prevent pregnancy less favorably than it treats medical care needed to prevent other medical conditions that are no greater threat to employees health than is pregnancy.in re union pac.employment practices,d.after a stipulation by the parties regarding attorneys fees,the district court entered final judgment in favor of standridge and phillips,staying enforcement pending union pacific appeal.

pda analysis 
as an initial matter,the district court incorrectly characterized union pacific policy as the denial of prescription contraception coverage for women.union pacific excludes all types of contraception,whether prescription,or surgical and whether for men or women,unless an employee has a medical necessity for the contraception.while prescription contraception is currently only available for women,contraception is available for men and women.therefore,the issue is whether union pacific policy of denying coverage for all contraception violates title vii,as amended by the pda.
union pacific argues that the district court erred in holding that the pda requires coverage of contraception.it contends that the pda only relates to discrimination against a woman for medical conditions that occur or may occur after she becomes pregnant,while the use of contraception only relates to human fertility before pregnancy.standridge and phillips argue that contraception is covered by the pda because it is related to the condition of pregnancy.
title vii provides that i t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual sex.a.congress created the pda to amend this provision in response to the supreme court holding that the exclusion of pregnancy benefits did not violate title vii.see gilbert,d.the pda provides 
the terms because of sex or on the basis of sex include,but are not limited to,because of or on the basis of pregnancy,childbirth,or related medical conditions and women affected by pregnancy,childbirth,or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all purposes,including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs,as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work this subsection shall not require an employer to pay for health insurance benefits for abortion,except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term,or except where medical complications have arisen from an abortion.
neither the circuit courts nor the supreme court has considered whether the pda applies to contraception the supreme court,though,has discussed the scope of the pda in newport news shipbuilding dry dock eeoc,d,and international union,united automobile,aerospace agricultural implement workers of america,uaw johnson controls,d.in newport news,the supreme court held that a company health insurance plan that provided greater pregnancy benefits to its female employees than to the female spouses of its male employees was a violation of title vii,as amended by the pda.at.in its opinion,the court acknowledged that the enactment of the pda overturned its gilbert decision.id.at.the court further analyzed the pda in johnson controls in the context of a bona fide occupational qualification defense.johnson controls would not allow a woman who had the potential to become pregnant to work in jobs with actual or potential lead exposure because of the associated fetal health risks.johnson controls,at.the court held that an employer could not prevent a woman from working in those positions when it did not also prevent men from working in those positions,unless her reproductive potential prevent ed her from performing the duties of her job.id.at.since reproductive potential did not prevent women from performing the duties of the positions in question,the court held that discriminating against women on the basis of potential pregnancy was a violation of title vii,as amended by the pda.id.
in krauel iowa methodist medical center,cir,we applied these supreme court precedents and held that the pda does not extend to infertility treatments.we concluded that the phrase related medical conditions in the pda refers only to medical conditions associated with pregnancy and childbirth,the specific terms that precede the general phrase.id.quoting norfolk ry.am.train dispatchers ass n,d,for the principle that when a general term follows a specific one,the general term should be understood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration.infertility is strikingly different from pregnancy and childbirth because infertility prevents conception,while pregnancy,childbirth and medical conditions related to them can occur only after conception.id.therefore,krauel holds that infertility is outside of the pda protection because it is not pregnancy,childbirth,or a related medical condition.id.at.
in concluding that the pda does not extend to infertility,we also distinguished the supreme court holding in johnson controls.while noting that the pda does cover differential treatment of an employee based on health concerns that may arise during her pregnancy,we held that johnson controls does not support an expansion of the pda to cover fertility matters prior to conception because p otential pregnancy,unlike infertility,is a medical condition that is because only women can become pregnant b ecause the policy of denying insurance benefits for treatment of fertility problems applies to both female and male workers it is id.at.
with the guidance of these decisions,we now determine whether contraception is related to pregnancy for pda purposes.while contraception may certainly affect the causal chain that leads to pregnancy,we have specifically rejected the argument that a causal connection,by itself,results in a medical condition being related to pregnancy for pda purposes.id.at rejecting the argument that infertility is related to pregnancy because there is a causal connection between such a condition and pregnancy.union pacific argues that contraception,analogous to infertility,is.standridge and phillips argue that the district court correctly found that contraception implicates potential pregnancy and that the pda covers contraception because it prevents a condition.
following krauel,we hold that contraception is not related to pregnancy for pda purposes because,like infertility treatments,contraception is a treatment that is only indicated prior to pregnancy.contraception is not a medical treatment that occurs when or if a woman becomes pregnant instead,contraception prevents pregnancy from even occurring.see collegiate dictionary ed defining contraception as the deliberate prevention of conception or impregnation.as in krauel,the result in johnson controls does not require coverage of contraception because contraception is not a term like potential pregnancy,but rather applies to both men and women like infertility.in conclusion,the pda does not require coverage of contraception because contraception is not related to pregnancy for pda purposes and is 
we are not persuaded by the contention of standridge and phillips and the amici members of congress that congress intended to address the coverage of prescription contraception in the pda.in their views,the pda was a broad response to the gilbert decision,and congress wanted to protect women in all areas concerning pregnancy,including the prevention of it.however,the plain language of the pda makes no reference to contraception.additionally,the house and senate legislative histories do not mention contraception.see erickson,d at noting that congress had no specific intent regarding coverage for prescription contraceptives in.this silence by congress on the issue of contraception can not be interpreted to expand the pda to cover contraception.see tafflin levitt,d dismissing a party argument concerning jurisdiction because congress silence indicated it did not even consider the issue see also krauel,at 
we also do not agree with standridge and phillips argument that the pda express exclusion of coverage of abortion,without an accompanying express exclusion of coverage for contraception,implies an intent to include coverage of contraception.abortion is the termination of a pregnancy,collegiate dictionary,while contraception prevents pregnancy from even occurring.while we do not need to decide whether the pda would cover abortion without this exclusion,abortion arguably would be related to pregnancy in a manner that contraception is not because abortion can only occur when a woman is pregnant.in contrast,there would be no reason for congress to expressly exclude a treatment that is not related to pregnancy for pda purposes,such as contraception.
finally,we are not persuaded by the eeoc decision that interpreted the pda as requiring employers to cover prescription contraception for women if they cover other prescription drugs and devices,or other types of services,that are used to prevent the occurrences of other medical conditions.eeoc commission decision on coverage of contraception,available at.an agency interpretation that is found in an opinion letter,policy statement,agency manual or enforcement guideline lack s the force of law and is not entitled to deference under chevron natural resources defense council,d.christensen harris county,d see also eeoc arabian am.oil,d,superceded by.a codified as amended at f.this eeoc decision is similar to a policy statement or enforcement guideline and we respect such interpretations only to the extent that those interpretations have the power to persuade.christensen,at.quoting skidmore swift.since congress did not give the eeoc authority,the amount of deference we give to this decision will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.arabian am.oil,at.internal quotation omitted.
we find the eeoc decision to be unpersuasive.the decision addressed a policy that denied coverage of prescription contraception but included coverage of the surgical contraceptive methods of vasectomies and tubal ligations.union pacific coverage is different because it excludes coverage of all contraception for women and men,both prescription and surgical.additionally,the decision compares prescription contraception to the broadest possible spectrum of other preventive treatments and services without citing a persuasive basis for doing so.furthermore,the eeoc did not issue any guidance on the issue of coverage of prescription contraception until years after the enactment of the pda.the delay brings into question the consistency and persuasiveness of the eeoc position.therefore,we find this decision unpersuasive on the question before us.
in conclusion,based on the language of the pda and our previous holding in krauel,we hold that the pda does not encompass contraception.contraception,like infertility treatments,is a treatment that is only indicated prior to pregnancy because contraception actually prevents pregnancy from occurring.furthermore,like infertility,contraception is a term.therefore,union pacific denial of coverage for contraception for both sexes did not discriminate against its female agreement employees in violation of title vii,as amended by the pda.
title vii analysis 
along with its argument that the pda does not require coverage of contraception,union pacific argues that its exclusion of contraception coverage does not discriminate against its female agreement employees under a general title vii analysis.title vii prevents an employer from making employment decisions that are based on an employee gender.see kratzer rockwell,cir.however,when an employer action is not based on a sex classification,it is not a violation of title vii.see piantanida wyman,cir.
standridge and phillips brought a claim of disparate treatment based on gender discrimination.to establish this disparate treatment claim,standridge and phillips must show,in part,that other employees outside of the protected group were allegedly treated more favorably and were similarly situated in all relevant respects.gilooly,at internal quotation omitted.while an employer must treat its employees similarly,it does not have to treat employees in a protected class more favorably than other employees.texas of cmty.affairs burdine,d holding that title vii does not require an employer to give preferential treatment to minorities or women.
in determining whether union pacific treated the similarly situated male employees more favorably than the protected female employees,we must compare the health benefits that union pacific plans provided for men and women.the district court compared the medicines or medical services that prevent employees from developing diseases or conditions that pose an equal or lesser threat to employees health than does pregnancy.union pacific,d at.it found that the health plans treated men more favorably because the plans covered preventive medicines and services such as medication for baldness,routine physical exams,tetanus shots,and drug and alcohol treatments.union pacific argues that the district court comparator was too broad because it treated pregnancy as a disease that needed to be prevented instead of focusing on the narrow issue of contraception.
we decline to address whether pregnancy is a disease.instead,we simply hold that the district court erred in using the comparator medicines or medical services that prevent employees from developing diseases or conditions that pose an equal or lesser threat to employees health than does pregnancy.as previously discussed,this case concerns union pacific coverage of contraception for men and women.the proper comparator is the provision of the medical benefit in question,contraception.union pacific health plans do not cover any contraception used by women such as birth control,sponges,diaphragms,intrauterine devices or tubal ligations or any contraception used by men such as condoms and vasectomies.therefore,the coverage provided to women is not less favorable than that provided to men.thus,there is no violation of title vii.
iii.conclusion 
accordingly,we reverse the district court judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the court holds union pacific exclusion of prescription contraception coverage does not violate title vii of the civil rights act of,title vii,as amended by the pregnancy discrimination act of pda.because i agree with how the district court framed the discrimination inquiry,and therefore agree with its conclusion that union pacific policy discriminates against women under title vii,as amended by the pda,i respectfully dissent.
the court ends with the following pronouncement in footnote five union pacific provides an equal policy for its female and male employees.ante at.this is a good place to begin.when one looks at the medical effect of union pacific failure to provide insurance coverage for prescription contraception,the inequality of coverage is clear.this failure only medically affects females,as they bear all of the health consequences of unplanned pregnancies.an insurance policy providing comprehensive coverage for preventative medical care,including coverage for preventative prescription drugs used exclusively by males,but fails to cover prescription contraception used exclusively by females,can hardly be called equal.it just is so.
the court begins its analysis by finding the district court erred in confining its inquiry to union pacific exclusion of coverage for prescription contraception used by women because its policy also excludes coverage for contraception coverage condoms and surgical procedures to prevent male fertility vasectomies.the district court did not err in limiting its inquiry to prescription contraception.that its policy does not provide coverage for condoms is pacific has not identified any health insurance policy which would provide coverage for,contraceptive devices available in drug stores and gas stations nationwide.as for vasectomies,even if we were to look at its exclusion of coverage for vasectomies,the policy nonetheless discriminates against females.when a policy excludes coverage for vasectomies,the medical effect of this exclusion is born entirely by women,as the record demonstrates women are the only gender which can become pregnant.
the court holds union pacific failure to cover prescription contraception is not covered by the pda because prescription contraception use occurs prior to pregnancy.because such reasoning is at odds with the supreme court construction of the pda,i respectfully disagree.first,it must be noted title vii is a remedial,civil rights statute and,as such,it should be broadly construed.allen entergy,cir.title vii provides in relevant part 
it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual sex or to limit,segregate,or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,because of such individual sex 
a.congress enacted the pda to amend the definition of sex in title vii.as such,the pda provides in relevant part 
the terms because of sex or on the basis of sex include,but are not limited to,because of or on the basis of pregnancy,childbirth,or related medical conditions and women affected by pregnancy,childbirth,or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all purposes 
while the plain language of the pda does not specifically include conditions,there is some indication congress intended the act to cover discrimination.congress used the phrase related medical conditions.the word related indicates the pda covers more than mere pregnancy.in this case,the district court relied on the second clause of the pda which is drafted even more broadly than the first,covering women affected by pregnancy,childbirth,or related medical conditions.in re union pac.employment practices,d,emphasis added because the pda plainly states that its protection from discrimination,including discrimination in receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs,applies to women affected by pregnancy and not merely to pregnant women,the clear language of the statute requires that union pacific plans treat the risk of pregnancy no less favorably than the plans treat other similar health risks.finally,as noted by certain members of congress,writing as amici on behalf of standridge and phillips,the first clause of the pda specifically states the terms because of sex or on the basis of sex include,but are not limited to,because of or on the basis of pregnancy,childbirth,or related medical conditions.brief for certain members of the congress as amicus curiae.the use of the phrase include,but are not limited to mandates a broad reading of the pda because it suggests congress was being illustrative rather than exclusive with the list following the phrase.see fed.land bank of paul bismarck lumber.t he term including is not one of definition,but connotes simply an illustrative application of the general principle.the pda legislative history also promotes a broad construction of the act to include.representative ronald sarasin explained the pda gives a woman the right to be financially and legally protected before,during,and after her pregnancy.cong.rec.daily ed.october,statement of sarasin,a manager of the house version of the pda emphasis added.
even if congress did not intend the pda to cover discrimination,the supreme court ostensibly broadened the scope of the pda to include discrimination in international union,united automobile,aerospace agricultural implement workers,uaw johnson controls,d.the court found classifying employees on the basis of childbearing capacity,whether or not they were already pregnant,must be regarded,for title vii purposes,in the same light as explicit sex discrimination.id.at.in johnson
