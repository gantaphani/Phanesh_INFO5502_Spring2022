washington state revoked kathie costanich foster care license and instituted guardianship termination proceedings against her following an investigation by a department of social and health services dshs social worker,sandy duron,which purportedly revealed emotional abuse of the children in costanich care.finding fundamental inaccuracies in the investigation,an administrative law judge alj reversed the license revocation.the court of appeals of washington ultimately upheld the alj determination.costanich.state dep t of soc.health.
this appeal arises from costanich claim against duron,dshs and other dshs officials for deprivation of her due process rights to her foster care license and guardianship of her dependents.costanich appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of all dshs personnel on the basis of absolute and qualified immunity.we must decide whether the dshs officials are entitled to absolute or qualified immunity for the separate acts of the investigation,the declaration filed in support of the guardianship termination,and the revocation of costanich foster care license.we affirm the judgment for all dshs officials,including for conduct related to the revocation of costanich foster care license.
factual and procedural background 
costanich and her husband have been foster parents since for some of the neediest and most difficult foster children in the system.costanich,at.as the court of appeals of washington noted,
all of these children had been victims of abuse or neglect and many had severe behavioral,developmental,and medical problems.kathie specialized in violent,sexually aggressive youth say and medically fragile infants.costanich was also the president of foster parents of washington state fpaws and a trainer for dshs.before the abuse allegations,the most recent state evaluation described the costanich foster home as a unique and valuable resource unsurpassed by any foster home in the state.
id.as of july,the costanich house was home to six male foster children,age,age,and age one male under dependency guardianship age and two sisters also under dependency guardianship,age and age and had resided in the costanich home since their infancy.
during a session with his therapist in july,alleged that costanich was physically and emotionally abusing the children.sandy duron,a social worker for the child protective services cps section of dshs,initiated an investigation based upon the therapist referral.she interviewed all of the children,aides who worked in the costanich home,some of the children therapists,family and friends,and costanich herself duron reported that all of the children claimed costanich used profanity regularly,and all but one claimed that she directed profanity at the children and used physical violence.all of the adult interviewees also admitted that costanich used profanity,but they differed on whether it was directed at the children and whether costanich used physical violence.
duron also reported that specifically told his therapist about an incident that allegedly took place while the family was vacationing at a cabin on lake cavanaugh.according to duron,said that costanich observed an altercation between and a female aide,restrained by putting her hands around neck and choking him,and said i kill you,bastard.duron reported that account of the incident was basically the same,and that a friend of the family who witnessed the incident and costanich herself reported that costanich physically restrained,though their accounts varied as to the severity of the restraint.according to duron,also told his therapist that costanich got mad at and told him to move his black ass and clean his room.also heard costanich call a cunt and saw her grab hair.
duron also reported that told her that he saw costanich rub sheets in face.
cartwright,a clinical psychologist who reviewed the dshs records but did not interview the children,opined that swearing at children may lead to or exacerbate behavioral problems.dshs held meetings in which the costanich case was discussed.based upon the meetings,interviews,and consultations,duron concluded that the allegation of emotional abuse was founded and that the allegation of physical abuse was inconclusive.
in the fall of and spring of,and therapists wrote to dshs,reporting that the children were doing very well in the costanich home and strongly recommending against removal specifically,therapists,cowles and adler,prepared a sworn letter describing in detail disabilities,his substantial improvements in the costanich home,their strong disagreement with the decision to remove from the costanich home,and not ing that dcfs did not,in a reasonable manner,consult with his providers on how this removal from the foster home was to be conducted even though this was.and therapist,vincent,prepared a sworn letter describing the loving and nurturing relationship between the girls and costanich and noting the vast emotional damage that removing them will cause the children.therapist,crabbe,wrote of the stability of the costanich home and the progress that had made there,and noted that a change in placement would be detrimental to emotional and mental health.
the record also reflects that at least six adult witnesses wrote to dshs,stating that duron was a hostile interviewer who twisted their words and attributed to them statements they did not make.for example,tori mclaughlin,a family friend,wrote that duron asked her the same questions repeatedly when she did not receive the answer she wanted.diane isley,a court appointed special advocate casa who has worked with costanich for a decade,prepared a sworn letter stating that duron attributed to her a false statement about a child running from the costanich home.
these letters did not cause dshs to alter its conclusion of founded emotional abuse.dshs informed costanich of this finding in a meeting in november.according to the testimony of several officials,dshs also told her that if she would not appeal the finding of emotional abuse and would agree to participate in a corrective management plan,dshs would not seek termination of her guardianship of and it is unclear from the record whether dshs ever made a formal offer and,if so,whether costanich considered it.
dshs made its formal finding of emotional abuse in a december,letter addressed to costanich and signed by defendant cps investigations supervisor beverly payne.a cps section manager,kyle smith,upheld the finding on march,even though his office had contacted several of the witnesses who told cps of their complaints as to duron investigation.costanich requested an administrative hearing on march.on march,the state filed a petition to terminate costanich guardianship of and b.the petition was supported by duron declaration that costanich uses profanity,and derogatory racial terms as means to discipline and intimidate the children.before the state court could issue a decision,the kalispel tribe of indians,of which and are members,intervened and assumed jurisdiction of their cases.the tribe placed the girls with relatives for the summer of,and then returned the girls to costanich in august,dshs,acting through defendant licensor ingrid mckinney,revoked costanich foster license.defendant james bulzomi reviewed the revocation decision and signed the revocation letter.costanich other foster children,except for,who was also under a dependency guardianship,were removed.
in the fall of and winter of,the alj held nineteen days of evidentiary hearings.witnesses testified,including,duron,costanich,various dshs officials,therapists,and costanich aides.the alj reversed dshs license revocation determination,concluding that the finding of emotional abuse was not supported by substantial evidence.based on live witness testimony,the alj found that costanich used profanity around the children,but did not direct it at them,though she did ask to move his black ass.the alj found statements to his therapist and duron statements and reports not credible due to the unaddressed inconsistencies.
dshs appealed the alj decision to the dshs board of appeals,which reversed.relying primarily on duron report and on her claim that she recorded her interviews with the children,the board of appeals review judge determined that substantial evidence supported the conclusion that costanich directed profanity at the children,including calling a bitch and a cunt,that she threatened to kill,and that she told to move his black ass,all of which constituted emotional abuse.while the review judge did acknowledge that duron investigation suffered from several errors,he declined to find her report and notes inherently unreliable.
costanich appealed the board decision to the king county superior court,which reversed,finding that the review judge exceeded his authority by making new and inconsistent findings of fact.the court of appeals of washington affirmed,reinstating the alj conclusion that the finding of emotional abuse was not founded.costanich,at.the court of appeals held that b ecause the review judge based his additional,contradictory factual findings solely on hearsay evidence the alj rejected as lacking credibility,the review judge acted outside the scope of his authority.id.at.it also awarded costanich attorney fees under washington equal access to justice act,finding that dshs was not substantially justified in revoking costanich license once it became aware of the problems with duron investigation.costanich,at.
while her appeal of the board decision was pending in superior court,costanich filed a civil rights action in washington state court,asserting claims under and state tort against the state of washington,dshs,sandy duron,and dshs officials carol schmidt,beverly payne,james bulzomi,robert stutz,and ingrid mckinney.dshs removed the action to federal court,where it was held in abeyance pending the state court appeal.the individual defendants then moved for summary judgment,claiming absolute immunity for the investigation,the allegedly false declaration in support of guardianship termination,and the revocation of costanich foster care license.they also asserted qualified immunity for claims arising from their remaining actions.costanich moved for partial summary judgment on her claim against duron,arguing that duron fabrication of evidence in her report and declaration deprived costanich of her right to due process.the district court granted defendants for summary judgment on all federal claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state court causes of action.costanich and the dshs officials timely.

iii.discussion 
costanich claims that duron and the other dshs officials violated her fourteenth amendment due process rights by depriving her of liberty and property interests in her foster care license and dependency guardianship of and the district court correctly concluded that duron is not entitled to absolute immunity for the investigation and submission of the declaration in support of the guardianship termination petition,while holding that all other dshs officials were absolutely immune from suit as to the license revocation and enjoyed qualified immunity on all remaining claims.we agree with the district court that duron is entitled to qualified immunity for her investigation and submission of the declaration in support of the guardianship termination proceedings,but for somewhat different reasons we conclude that deliberately fabricating evidence in civil child abuse proceedings violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment when a liberty or property interest is at stake and that genuine issues of material fact exist on the question of deliberate fabrication.we further conclude,however,that,because it was not clear at the time these events took place that this right applied in the context of proceedings adjudicating a foster care license and termination of guardianship,duron did not deprive costanich of a constitutional right that was clearly established.accordingly,duron is entitled to qualified immunity for the alleged evidence fabrication and declaration in support of the guardianship termination proceedings.
absolute immunity 
it is well established that a defendant immunity from a suit is dependent on the common law immunities existing at the time of enactment.imbler pachtman,granting a prosecutor the same absolute immunity under that the prosecutor enjoys at common law.interpreting the supreme court decision in kalina fletcher,we recently reaffirmed that it is only the specific function performed,and not the role or title of the official,that is the touchstone of absolute immunity.miller gammie,cir en banc per curiam.two principal functions are at issue here the institution of license revocation proceedings by duron,mckinney,and bulzomi,and the investigation and the submission of a declaration in support of guardianship termination by duron.
license revocation proceedings 
the district court properly concluded that duron,mckinney,and bulzomi were absolutely immune from suit for their involvement in costanich foster care license revocation proceedings.we have long held that social workers have absolute immunity when they make discretionary,decisions to institute court dependency proceedings to take custody away from parents.beltran santa clara county,cir en banc quoting miller,at see also meyers contra costa county dep t of soc,cir.we have noted that,like a prosecutor,t he social worker must make a quick decision based on perhaps incomplete information as to whether to commence investigations and initiate proceedings against parents who may have abused their children.meyers,at see also id.the social worker independence,like that of a prosecutor,would be compromised were the social worker constantly in fear that a mistake could result in a and financially devastating civil suit.thus,the critical decision to institute proceedings to make a child a ward of the state is functionally similar to the prosecutorial institution of a criminal proceeding,and,therefore,deserves absolute immunity.miller,at.the institution of a license revocation proceeding is sufficiently analogous to a decision to institute a custody termination proceeding to deserve absolute immunity.
investigation and filing of declaration in support of termination proceedings 
adhering to our en banc decision in beltran,the district court also correctly concluded that duron is not entitled to absolute immunity for investigating charges against costanich or for filing the declaration in support of the guardianship termination proceedings.
in beltran,we held that social workers are not entitled to absolute immunity from claims that they fabricated evidence during an investigation or made false statements in a dependency petition affidavit that they signed under penalty of perjury,because such actions are similar to discretionary decisions about whether to prosecute.at.we analogized the social worker to a prosecutor who does have absolute immunity if he fabricates evidence during a preliminary investigation,before he could properly claim to be acting as an advocate,or makes false statements in a sworn affidavit in support of an application for an arrest warrant.id.citing buckley fitzsimmons,kalina,at.a s prosecutors and others investigating criminal matters have no absolute immunity for their investigatory conduct,a fortiori,social workers conducting investigations have no such immunity.beltran,at.duron argument that in filing the declaration,she acted as a witness,and therefore deserves absolute immunity under burns county of king,cir,is unpersuasive in light of beltran clearly controlling conclusion to the contrary.thus,duron is not entitled to absolute immunity from the claims that she deliberately fabricated evidence in her investigation and made false statements in the sworn declaration submitted in support of the guardianship termination proceedings.
qualified immunity 
in determining whether duron is entitled to qualified immunity for the investigation and declaration,we apply the the analysis set forth in saucier katz,under which we inquire,in sequence,whether the facts alleged show the official conduct violated a constitutional right,and whether the right was clearly established.id at the district court concluded that costanich failed to establish that her constitutional rights were violated or that any of the rights she asserted was well established.we disagree with the district court conclusion that costanich failed to establish that duron violated costanich constitutional rights however,we agree with the district court that no such constitutional rights were clearly established.
whether duron violated costanich constitutional rights 
t o establish a substantive due process claim a plaintiff must show a government deprivation of life,liberty,or property.nunez city of los angeles,cir.therefore,before turning to the question of whether costanich due process rights were violated,we must first determine whether there has been a deprivation of life,liberty,or property.costanich asserts that by deliberately fabricating evidence during the investigation and making false statements in the declaration supporting the guardianship termination proceedings,duron deprived her of property and liberty interests in her foster care license and in the care of and as their dependency guardian.the district court found that defendants do not dispute that plaintiff has property and liberty interests in her foster case license or that she has a liberty interest in the care of and on appeal,dshs officials argue that the district court merely assumed the above finding,but they admit in a footnote that defendants did not address this issue in their summary judgment brief due to page constraints.having failed to dispute this issue below,the dshs officials waive the argument on appeal that costanich lacks a liberty or property interest in her foster care license and guardianship of and 
as a general rule,we do not consider an issue not passed upon below.dodd hood river county,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.it is immaterial whether the issue was not tried in the district court because it was not raised or because it was raised but conceded by the party seeking to revive it on appeal.united states patrin,cir.the dshs officials page constraints argument is unpersuasive,as they filed three merits briefs on summary judgment totaling sixty pages.they certainly could have devoted space to this issue if they seriously contested it.in any case,following our decision in joshua newell,cir,where we assume d without deciding that the foster parents had a protected property interest in their license,and the supreme court decision in smith organization of foster families for equality reform offer,which was decided on the assumption that foster parents have a protected liberty interest,id.at,we may proceed to consider whether duron violated costanich due process rights.
substantive due process protects individuals from arbitrary deprivation of their liberty by government.brittain hansen,cir.the court has repeatedly spoken of the cognizable level of executive abuse of power as that which shocks the conscience.id.quoting county of sacramento lewis.costanich claim is that duron falsified evidence in her investigation and used that false evidence as support for her declaration,which led to the termination proceedings and the revocation of costanich foster care license.to sustain a deliberate fabrication of evidence claim,we have held that a plaintiff must,
at a minimum,point to evidence that supports at least one of the following two propositions defendants continued their investigation of plaintiff despite the fact that they knew or should have known that he was innocent or defendants used investigative techniques that were so coercive and abusive that they knew or should have known that those techniques would yield false information.
devereaux abbey,cir en banc.we noted that mere allegations that defendants used interviewing techniques that were in some sense improper,or that violated state regulations,without more,can not serve as the basis for a claim under.id.at.
the district court concluded that,under devereaux,costanich has not demonstrated that duron deliberately fabricated evidence.it held that costanich failed to show that duron or any other dshs official continued the investigation despite knowing of costanich innocence or used coercive techniques that were known to produce false information.concluding that the recognized problems with duron investigation were just recording errors and misstatements,it held that a careless or inaccurate investigation that does not ensure an result does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.citing devereaux,at see also gausvik perez,cir inaccuracy claims do not show the state employee continued the investigation despite knowing the subject of a child abuse investigation was innocent or that he used investigative techniques that he knew would yield false information while the state employee affidavit may have been careless or inaccurate,it does not satisfy devereaux stringent test.
the district court read the devereaux standard too narrowly.costanich alleges,and has produced evidence supporting her claim,that duron deliberately misquoted and misrepresented witness statements,deliberately falsified statements in her investigative report and declaration.the devereaux test envisions an investigator whose unlawful motivation is illustrated by her state of mind regarding the alleged perpetrator innocence,or one who surreptitiously fabricates evidence by using coercive investigative methods.these are circumstantial methods of proving deliberate falsification.here,costanich argues that the record directly reflects duron false statements.if,under devereaux,an interviewer who uses coercive interviewing techniques that are known to yield false evidence commits a constitutional violation,then an interviewer who deliberately mischaracterizes witness statements in her investigative report also commits a constitutional violation.similarly,an investigator who purposefully reports that she has interviewed witnesses,when she has actually only attempted to make contact with them,deliberately fabricates evidence.
we have previously held that when genuine issues of material fact arise regarding fabrication of evidence in a child abuse investigative report,a police officer is not entitled to qualified immunity because c redibility is an issue for the trier of fact.mcsherry city of long beach,cir.summary judgment on this issue was inappropriate here because costanich introduced sufficient evidence to demonstrate genuine issues of material fact.for example,duron report indicated that she had interviewed people.she later admitted that she had made only brief contact with eighteen of the individuals listed.the misrepresentations about interviewing the children doctors were especially significant.the suggestion that she interviewed three of the therapists and received reports from a fourth lent credibility to her report,but,as duron testified at the alj hearing,she did not actually speak to m edical professionals.in addition,the investigative report suggests that duron interviewed and describes a conversation with crabbe,the therapist whose referral was the catalyst for duron investigation.upon examination by the alj,however,duron admitted that during the interview with she was holding a copy of crabbe referral and only told her that e verything that on the referral is true,even though she never showed the referral to further,she conceded that would say much but that she still just kind of summarized what he was saying.duron admitted that she never actually interviewed crabbe,despite the fact that crabbe made the initial referral and sent dshs a letter on december,strongly recommend ing that remain with the costaniches as he has made a very positive adjustment to the costanich home.
other witnesses pointed out that the report contained evidence or statements they never made.for example,according to duron report of her interview with diane isley,the guardian ad litem for,isley stated that costanich,in reference to a child that might try to run away,said she would chain the little shit to the bed.isley declared in a sworn letter,however,that she never made this statement and that she never talked to duron about such a child.duron also reported that another aide,crystal hill,said that costanich was always calling a fucking cunt,and bitch.in a sworn letter,however,hill stated i have never seen her directly swear face to face at one of the children.further,that duron purposefully used quotation marks around many of the purported witness statements in her investigative the isley and hill support a trier of fact conclusion that duron deliberately fabricated evidence.in the defamation context,the supreme court has said 
q uotation marks around a passage indicate to the reader that the passage reproduces the speaker words verbatim.they inform the reader that he or she is reading the statement of the speaker,not a paraphrase or other indirect interpretation by an author.by providing this information,quotations add authority to the statement and credibility to the author work.quotations allow the reader to form his or her own conclusions and to assess the conclusions of the author,instead of relying entirely upon the author characterization of her subject.
masson new yorker magazine,holding that a jury may find knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity when a publication attributes to the plaintiff quoted statements that the plaintiff never actually made.moreover,contrary to duron report,all of the witnesses sworn letters express positive descriptions of the costanich foster home.finally,the alj,who had the benefit of live witness testimony,found that a number of the witnesses specifically dispute the reported evidence in the form of the service episode reports sers which duron utilized in memorializing the information she received.
the district court description of the errors in the investigation as recording errors and misstatements is untenable in light of the principle that,on summary judgment,we must draw all factual inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.see olsen idaho state bd.of,cir.it is true that,despite costanich claims to the contrary,duron never admitted to falsifying the record.an admission by a defendant,however,is not required to survive summary judgment.resolution of disputed material facts is the special province of the factfinder.see balint carson city,cir.the errors in duron report are not questions of tone or characterization but actual misrepresentations.in concluding otherwise,the district court relied on gausvik,where a police officer stated in a probable cause affidavit that the defendant children tested positive for child abuse,though the tests were only consistent with child abuse.at.the substitution of consistent for positive,however,reasonably may be characterized as a misstatement.reporting that a witness said something she did not can not be so characterized.
it is also true that,in the course of her investigation,duron could have believed that costanich was guilty of emotional abuse.under washington law,foster parents are prohibited from the use of cruel,unusual,frightening,unsafe or humiliating discipline practices,which include n ame calling,using derogatory comments t hreatening the child with physical harm and t hreatening or intimidating the child.admin.code f h.at the time of duron investigation,washington law defined abuse as acts which are cruel or inhumane regardless of observable injury.admin.code.d repealed,and the court of appeals of washington had held that a foster mother use of profanity to address the children constitutes humiliating discipline,leading to the conclusion that the combined use of corporal punishment and profanity justified the revocation of her foster care license,morgan dep t of soc.health.if the only evidence of deliberate fabrication were inferences from duron investigative methods,under devereaux,duron subjective and personal belief of costanich guilt might have explained why duron continued the investigation.at.that belief,however,does not permit or excuse deliberate falsification of evidence.
for the same reasons,genuine issues of material fact also exist as to whether duron statements in the declaration in support of the termination proceedings violated costanich due process rights.in the declaration,duron repeats substantially the same facts as recited in her report and that are contested on she interviewed the children therapists,that an aide said costanich called a fucking cunt,and bitch,and that a casa,presumably isley,said that costanich used profanity toward the children.record evidence in the form of sworn letters from these individuals creates a material dispute as to these facts and as to the deliberateness of duron inclusion of these facts in her declaration.
we therefore conclude that costanich had a fourteenth amendment due process right to be free from deliberately fabricated evidence in a civil child abuse proceeding,and that,because genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether duron deliberately fabricated evidence,which led to the termination proceedings and license revocation,the district court erroneously concluded that plaintiff has not provided evidence showing that defendants deliberately made false statements and fabricated evidence to make a false finding of abuse.
whether the right is clearly established 
the district court held that costanich failed to identify a clearly established right that defendants violated because her right to due process is too nebulous to be clearly established.it reasoned that the constitutional right not to be subjected to criminal charges on the basis of false evidence that was deliberately fabricated by the government,based on devereaux,was inapplicable here because costanich was not subjected to criminal charges,but only to civil license revocation and guardianship termination proceedings.according to the district court,the distinction between the alleged deprivation of liberty here and the deprivation in deveraux is critical the former involves the government deliberate fabrication of evidence in civil child abuse proceedings while the latter involves the government deliberate fabrication of evidence in criminal child abuse proceedings.we agree with the district court conclusion that duron did not violate costanich clearly established rights.although we conclude that,going forward,officials who deliberately fabricate evidence in civil child abuse proceedings which result in the deprivation of a protected liberty or property interest are not entitled to qualified immunity,this right had not previously been clearly established in the civil context 
a right is clearly established when the contours of the right were already delineated with sufficient clarity to make a reasonable offic ial in the defendant circumstances aware that what he was doing violated the right.devereaux,at see also saucier,at if the law did not put the officer on notice that his conduct would be clearly unlawful,summary judgment based on qualified immunity is appropriate.in pyle kansas,the supreme court held that the prosecution knowing use of perjured testimony to obtain a criminal conviction violates the constitution.in devereaux,we considered a claim by a foster parent against police officers and dshs offici
