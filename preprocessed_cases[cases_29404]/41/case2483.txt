this matter is before the court on appellant petition for panel rehearing.in her petition,barbara hennagir seeks rehearing on several different grounds.we deny the petition as it relates to her claim for disability discrimination.with respect to her request that we reconsider our analysis of her retaliation claim,however,we have determined an amendment of our original opinion is warranted.therefore,the petition is granted in part with respect to appellant argument that the court misconstrued the facts when reviewing her retaliation claim.the new amended opinion is attached.the mandate shall issue forthwith.
this case requires us to determine whether a job function that is rarely required in the normal course of an employee duties may nonetheless be an essential job function under the americans with disabilities act,et ada.we conclude that when the potential consequences of employing an individual who is unable to perform the function are sufficiently severe,such a function may be deemed essential.we further conclude that it is unreasonable for an employee to demand identical job duties less the disputed essential job requirement,regardless of the label given to the proposed accommodation.
plaintiff barbara hennagir was employed as a physician assistant pa by the utah department of corrections doc.following several years of successful work by hennagir,doc added a physical safety training requirement to medical and clinical positions that required inmate contact,including hennagir position.unable to complete the training because of a number of physical impairments,hennagir complained of disability discrimination and requested that she be able to continue in her position without fulfilling the new requirement.doc refused,leading to this lawsuit.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants on all of hennagir claims.
from april until august,hennagir was employed as a pa at doc central utah correctional facility in gunnison,utah gunnison.when she was hired,doc did not require peace officer standards and training post certification for medical and clinical staff at gunnison.in,however,doc sought to enter such staff into utah public safety retirement system psr.to enroll in psr,all covered positions in the agency must be post certified.post certification includes an assessment of physical strength,flexibility,and endurance.
doc considered the post certification requirement for medical staff for several years.as early as september,a doc division director recommended post certification to the executive director.in,a medical technician was attacked by a gunnison inmate,and the victim sued doc and a number of its employees,leading the state risk management division to echo the post certification recommendation.the following year,doc clinical services administrators met to discuss post certification.at that meeting,questions were raised as to whether incumbent employees could be grandfathered is,exempted from the post requirement based on their status as current employees.
in,doc contacted utah retirement systems urs regarding its plan to enroll medical and clinical personnel in psr.urs advised that workers could be eligible for psr only if every employee in a given position was post certified.in,doc applied for psr for all its clinical personnel whose job duties required contact with inmates.because hennagir pa position at gunnison included inmate contact,it was approved for psr,and thus post certification was mandated.
gunnison medical staff began attending a post academy in october of.hennagir attended,but was given permission not to participate in the physical activities because of her medical conditions.hennagir complains of a number of impairments,including lupus,osteoarthritis,rheumatism,avascular necrosis,sj√∂gren syndrome,and fibromyalgia.she has had both hips replaced and undergone surgery on her left shoulder.as a result of these maladies,hennagir is limited in activities such as sitting,bathing,sleeping,lifting,bending and flexing,climbing stairs,running,and biking.
doc eventually opted to require post certification for incumbent employees.in october,hennagir was notified that she would be unable to continue working as a pa at gunnison because she was unable to meet the post certification requirement.
in response,hennagir filed an administrative grievance in november,asserting that the threat of termination constituted harassment on the basis of disability and that she should be grandfathered through the new post requirement.david worthington,then doc director of the division of institutional operations,responded that he did not have the power to exempt hennagir from post certification.instead,doc offered her a pa position at doc olympus facility in draper,utah olympus that did not require post certification.hennagir internally appealed worthington treatment of her grievance,arguing that post certification was not a pa job requirement and that,because olympus was over miles from her home,it was not an acceptable substitute for her position at gunnison.director scott carver met with hennagir in january,but determined that doc could not alter the post requirement and that hennagir no longer met the minimum requirements for her position.he notified hennagir that she would have to decide whether to accept the proposed transfer.however,doc placed hennagir grievance on hold to allow time to review the classification issues regarding clinical positions and the gunnison facility needs.
on april,this administrative filed a charge of disability discrimination in violation of the ada with the utah and labor division,which forwarded the charge to the united states equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.the eeoc notified the human resources director of doc of hennagir complaint on april.
in july,doc issued a final determination regarding hennagir grievance.it determined that all gunnison pas were required to be post certified and that hennagir had to choose between the olympus pa position or termination.rather than choosing from doc proffered options,hennagir took medical leave under the family and medical leave act.when this leave was exhausted,she went on disability.due to surgery on her hip and shoulder,this leave lasted close to a year,during which doc retained her position at gunnison.
while on leave,hennagir filed a second eeoc charge,alleging retaliation by doc medical director richard garden and other unnamed individuals.hennagir claimed that garden improperly altered her performance evaluation in retaliation for her prior complaints.on april,hennagir direct supervisor issued an evaluation giving her exceptional results in each category and as an overall rating.according to that supervisor,garden pressured her to lower hennagir evaluation because hennagir had treated an inmate who sued doc for inadequate care.on april,hennagir supervisor signed a new performance evaluation that rated hennagir unsuccessful in the application of job knowledge,judgment,category and provided an overall rating of successful.hennagir signed the document,but checked the box i disagree with the evaluation,writing,i acknowledge the incident but feel the judgment here is not warranted shortly thereafter,a third evaluation was filed in which hennagir application of job knowledge,judgment,evaluation was revised to successful.her overall evaluation remained successful.hennagir signed this evaluation,checking the box labeled i agree with the evaluation.her second eeoc charge also alleged that garden unjustifiably called into question her treatment of a patient and that the proposed transfer to olympus constituted retaliation for her complaints of disability discrimination.
in march,before hennagir returned from medical leave,the eeoc found reasonable cause to believe that hennagir had been the victim of disability discrimination and that doc offer to transfer hennagir to olympus was not a reasonable accommodation.accordingly,the eeoc initiated conciliation.by july,however,it notified doc that conciliation had apparently failed.doc then informed the eeoc that it would make hennagir one additional offer a medical position at gunnison auditing,reviewing,coordinating,and monitoring the contract care of inmates at the same salary.on august,carver,now doc executive director,wrote to hennagir stating that because she had declined each of doc offers,including the auditing position described above,doc was terminating her employment.
on august,the eeoc referred the matter to the department of justice for possible litigation.doj issued hennagir a notice of right to sue,and hennagir exercised that right on december.as amended,hennagir complaint alleges discrimination,denial of reasonable accommodation,and retaliation in violation of the ada,and the same in violation of the rehabilitation act.
doc successfully moved for summary judgment on all claims.the district court concluded that hennagir could not make out a discrimination claim because she is neither disabled nor qualified for the pa position at gunnison.it then determined that hennagir proposed accommodations were not reasonable.finally,it rejected her retaliation claim,holding that neither the olympus transfer nor the performance evaluations were materially adverse actions and that doc had taken these actions for legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.mason avaya commc ns,cir.summary judgment is only appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.applying this standard,we address in turn each of hennagir challenges on appeal.
hennagir first argues that doc discriminated against her in violation of the ada.to succeed on an ada claim a plaintiff must show she is disabled as defined by the ada she is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation and she suffered discrimination on the basis of her disability.kellogg energy safety servs,cir.because each of these elements is essential to an ada claim,and we conclude that hennagir can not satisfy the qualified individual prong,we need not address remaining elements.see albertson,kirkingburg,d.
hennagir bears the burden of showing that she is able to perform the essential functions of her job,with or without reasonable accommodation.mason,at citing us airways,barnett,d.to determine whether post certification is an essential job function,we begin by deciding whether doc actually requires all employees in the particular position to satisfy the alleged requirement.davidson am.online,cir.if it does,we look to whether post certification is fundamental to the gunnison pa position.see also n.among the factors we consider in this inquiry are 
i the employer judgment as to which functions are essential 
ii written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job 
iii the amount of time spent on the job performing the function 
iv the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function 
v the terms of a collective bargaining agreement 
vi the work experience of past incumbents in the job 
vii the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.
n see also mason,at.however,this analysis is not intended to second guess the employer or to require him to lower company standards provided that any necessary job specification is,uniformly enforced,and consistent with business necessity,the employer has a right to establish what a job is and what is required to perform it.davidson,at citation omitted.
the undisputed evidence shows that all pas at gunnison must become post certified.under urs rules,all employees in a position must achieve post certification once that position is approved for psr enrollment.further,medical director garden testified that every medical doctor,registered nurse,and pa at gunnison had become post certified.hennagir does not attempt to controvert this evidence.instead,she argues that post certification was not required when she was hired,that she successfully performed her job duties for years without being post certified,and that the post certification requirement was added to the pa position in order to qualify for psr,not because it is essential.
we begin by noting that the essential function inquiry is not conducted as of an individual hire date.the ada does not limit an employer ability to establish or change the content,nature,or functions of a job.see milton scrivner,cir.we must look instead to whether a job function was essential at the time it was imposed on hennagir.see id.we conclude it was.
we weigh heavily the employer judgment regarding whether a job function is essential.see mason,at n i listing t he employer judgment as to which functions are essential as a factor to be considered.doc are unanimous regarding the importance of post certification.as early as,a doc division director sought to implement post certification for medical staff because t he institutional setting requires,first and foremost,that all employees have a security mission,and the lack of certification tends to create a conflict amongst our staff as to who sic responsibility it is to ensure safety and control.michael chabries,doc executive director when the post certification requirement was implemented,explained that,like certified corrections officers,the medical staff often had daily,direct inmate contact and thus daily exposure to the myriad risks of working with an inmate population.by enrolling these employees in psr,chabries stated,the department could require these employees to become fully trained and certified as peace officers and thus better able to handle,directly,the risks and dangers found at the prison facilities.garden opined that post certification is important in terms of training,insuring that the staff are not injured,and that the staff understand the danger of working in that environment.
further,the risks involved in direct inmate contact strike at the heart of another factor used to determine whether a job function is essential the consequences of not requiring an employee to perform the function.see n iv.sadly,doc fears regarding the physical safety of its medical and clinical staff were realized in,when a medical technician was attacked by an inmate during the course of her duties.that incident led the state risk management division to recommend a post certification requirement.the common sense nature of this recommendation is patent because the potential consequences of an inmate attack are severe,it is reasonable to require employees who have direct contact with inmates to undergo training on responding to these dangerous scenarios.martinez uphoff,cir describing the murder of a corrections officer by inmates attempting to escape liebson corr.dep t,cir describing the kidnaping and sexual assault of a prison librarian by an inmate.
hennagir acknowledges that she spent much of her time meeting with prison inmates,taking their medical histories,and physically examining them.she contends,however,that she never had to employ emergency training during her eight years at gunnison,and that other employees have had similar experiences.this argument goes to a number of properly weighed factors the amount of time spent on the job performing the function,the work experience of past incumbents,and the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.see n iii,vi,vii.in light of the undisputed evidence described in the preceding paragraphs,however,we find this argument insufficient to create a material issue of fact.
the sixth circuit faced a similar set of circumstances when it addressed whether the ability to restrain an inmate was an essential job function of a sheriff deputy.hoskins oakland county sheriff dep t,cir.as our sibling circuit explained,although a deputy sheriff may be required physically to restrain inmates only infrequently,the potential for physical confrontation with inmates exists on a daily basis,and the consequence of failing to require a deputy to perform this function when the occasion arises could be a serious threat to security.id.citation omitted see also frazier simmons,cir even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff and assuming that an investigator may be required to perform these physical activities infrequently,the potential for physical confrontation with a suspect exists any time plaintiff conducts a crime scene investigation.pt,app.a lthough a firefighter may not regularly have to carry an unconscious adult out of a burning building,the consequence of failing to require the firefighter to be able to perform this function would be serious.like the sheriff deputy in hoskins,hennagir came face to face with inmates on a daily basis.we agree with the sixth circuit that,in such circumstances,completion of emergency response training is an essential job function.
having concluded that post certification is an essential job function,we must determine whether any reasonable accommodation would enable h er to perform th at function.wells shalala,cir citation omitted.at the summary judgment stage,the relevant inquiry in determining whether plaintiff is qualified is whether s he has provided evidence that s he can be reasonably includes reasonable to require submission to a jury.id.quotation and alteration omitted.
hennagir second claim is that doc failed to reasonably accommodate her inability to become post certified.specifically,she argues that she proposed a number of reasonable accommodations and that doc offers in response were unreasonable.when alleging a failure to accommodate,a plaintiff carries the burden of demonstrating the existence of a facially reasonable accommodation.mason,at.if a plaintiff clears that initial hurdle,the burden shifts to her employer to show its inability to provide the requested accommodation.id.according to hennagir,she proposed three reasonable accommodations a waiver of the post certification requirement,being grandfathered into her gunnison pa position,and an alteration in her job title.we conclude that these proposals are not facially reasonable.
as hennagir acknowledges,she insisted on an accommodation that would permit her to remain in her position as a pa at gunnison.we have already held that post certification is an essential job function of that position,yet none of the accommodations described by hennagir enables such training.rather,each proposed accommodation,although labeled differently,demands an identical modification waiver of the post certification requirement.according to hennagir,she should be permitted to retain the same job duties perhaps with a different title without completing post certification.
reasonable accommodations may include job restructuring,or modified work schedules,reassignment to a vacant position,acquisition or modification of equipment or devices,appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations,training materials or policies,the provision of qualified readers or interpreters,and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.b.the idea of accommodation is to enable an employee to perform the essential functions of h er job an employer is not required to accommodate a disabled worker by modifying or eliminating an essential function of the job.mathews denver post,cir.under this standard,hennagir proposals must fail.see allmond akal,cir plaintiff only suggestion is to remove the essential job function entirely.that proposal is not reasonable it destroys the very standard we have just upheld as a legitimate business necessity.whether one calls it waiver,grandfathering,or a superficial change in title,hennagir is requesting that doc eliminate an essential job function 
hennagir also argues that doc refused to engage in an interactive process to develop a reasonable accommodation.however,we need not determine whether doc upheld this obligation.even if an employer fail s to fulfill its interactive obligations to help secure a reasonable accommodation,the plaintiff will not be entitled to recovery unless s he can also show that a reasonable accommodation was possible smith,at.as explained above,hennagir has not shown that a reasonable accommodation was possible.thus,doc is entitled to summary judgment on hennagir reasonable accommodation claim notwithstanding its alleged failure to fulfill its interactive obligation.
hennagir final claim is that doc retaliated against her for complaining of discrimination.to establish a prima facie case of retaliation,a plaintiff must show that s he engaged in protected opposition to discrimination,that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,and that a causal connection existed between the protected activity and the materially adverse action.proctor united parcel,cir quotation omitted.if a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case,the defendant has the burden of coming forth with a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for adverse action.butler city of prairie village,cir.if the defendant can do so,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the reason given by the employer is mere pretext for the real,discriminatory reason for the adverse action.id.
doc does not contest that hennagir engaged in protected activities before filing her retaliation charge with the eeoc both her internal grievance and her first eeoc charge constitute protected opposition.thus only the latter two elements are at issue.
hennagir contends that doc retaliated against her in three ways threatening to transfer her to olympus,lowering her performance evaluation,and s eeking to blame her for improper medical care.we hold that none of these actions constituted retaliation on these facts.
the provision of the ada,like that of title vii,
protects an individual not from all retaliation,but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.
burlington santa fe ry.white,d quotation omitted see also proctor,at adopting white retaliation standard in the ada context.
according to hennagir,doc retaliated in response to her first internal grievance by inform ing her that she must either transfer to the olympus facility or lose her employment.in the grievance,hennagir alleged that o n october i was informed my job may be in jeopardy due to a disability that prevents me from being post certified.on december,the doc human resources director notified hennagir that she would have the option of transferring to olympus or being terminated.this time line can not support a retaliation claim.as described by hennagir,her position as a pa was already threatened at the time she filed the grievance.thus,the purportedly adverse action taken in retaliation was to supplement this threat of termination with an option for reassignment.it defies logic to conclude that a reasonable worker facing termination might be dissuaded from complaining about that threatened termination because her employer might offer alternative employment.accordingly,doc proposed transfer was not a materially adverse action.see white,at.
hennagir also argues that a change to her performance evaluation and garden blam ing her for improper medical care constituted retaliation even if we assume these actions were materially adverse,hennagir fails to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding a causal connection between her internal grievance and these actions and whether doc proffered reason for changing her evaluation on the heels of learning of her eeoc claim was mere pretext.
hennagir offers no evidence other than temporal proximity to establish the necessary causal connection.although c lose temporal proximity between the employee complaint and the adverse employment action may be considered in the retaliation inquiry,pastran,cir,it is clear that,regarding her internal grievance,temporal proximity alone is not sufficient.
hennagir filed her first internal grievance in november the retaliation occurred on april.we agree with the seventh circuit,which has explained 
although there may be an exception to this general rule that temporal proximity alone is insufficient when the adverse action occurs on the heels of protected acti
