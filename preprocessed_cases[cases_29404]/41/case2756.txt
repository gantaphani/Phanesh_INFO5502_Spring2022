petitioner fluor daniel,an engineering and construction company,appeals an occupational safety and health review commission oshrc or the commission decision affirming a safety citation and penalty relating to the company failure to provide emergency respirators at one of its facilities in burkville,alabama.specifically,fluor daniel argues that the oshrc reached an unreasonable conclusion and abused its discretion when it found that fluor daniel violated the occupational safety and health administration osha standard governing respiratory protection,and that fluor daniel committed this violation willfully.after thorough review,we conclude that the findings of the oshrc are supported by substantial evidence and do not constitute an abuse of discretion.accordingly,we affirm.
the relevant facts are reasonably straightforward.fluor daniel is an engineering and construction company with approximately employees worldwide.between and,fluor daniel was responsible for the construction of a general electric ge manufacturing facility in burkville,alabama.under a contract with ge,fluor daniel has kept employees at the facility since it opened.these employees are responsible for maintenance services and certain additions and modifications to the plant,but they are not directly involved in ge production.
the burkville facility contains one waste handling plant and five manufacturing plants,including one that produces resin and one that produces phosgene.as described in a ge material safety data sheet,phosgene is a poisonous gas that has an irritant effect on the eyes,skin,respiratory tract and especially the lungs.in addition to irritation,this potentially fatal,gas can cause burns,chest pains,breathing difficulties,lung congestion,dizziness,shock,numbness,vomiting,bluish skin color,chills,and headaches.the resin plant at burkville is contained in a,structure located approximately fifty feet east of the phosgene plant.though separated by a street,the two plants are connected by a pipe rack that holds pipes.
on may,fluor daniel employees were performing installation work to add a heat exchanger to a caustic scrubbing system on the second floor mezzanine of the resin plant.while they were performing this job,low levels of phosgene vented through the caustic line into the air of the resin plant.when the phosgene was detected,the resin plant was evacuated.because neither ge nor fluor daniel provided emergency escape respirators to the fluor daniel employees performing the installation work,none of the fluor daniel workers had such respirators during the evacuation.once they got out of the building,eleven of these employees received examinations from ge physician,who referred them to a hospital in montgomery.the employees received prophylactic treatment at the hospital,and eight stayed for overnight observation.
the following day,may,osha compliance officers began health inspections of the burkville facility.as a result of these inspections,the secretary of labor the secretary charged fluor daniel with five counts,or items,of violating osha standards by failing to provide adequate respiratory protection to employees during an emergency,create proper alternative emergency action plans,ensure or document that the resin plant employees were trained about the hazards of phosgene,develop safe work practices to control hazards during lockout and tagout procedures,and maintain adequate hot work permits.
of relevance to this appeal,the emergency respirator regulation in place at the time provided that,i n emergencies,or when controls required by subpart d of this part either fail or are inadequate to prevent harmful exposures to employees,appropriate respiratory protective devices shall be provided by the employer and shall be used.a subpart d,codified at,listed various substances,including phosgene,which should be avoided above certain levels.the regulation also provided that,for gas and vapor contaminants immediately dangerous to life and health,such as phosgene,the protective devices should include a breathing apparatus,hose masks with a blower,an,full facepiece respirator with a chemical canister,and,for escape only,mouthpiece respirators.see,table.
an administrative law judge alj affirmed the item alleging violations of the respiratory protection and emergency action plan standards,but vacated the remaining three items,assessing a total penalty of.notably,with regard to the respiratory protection regulation,the alj found that fluor daniel willfully violated section a by voluntarily disregarding the osha requirement that respirators be provided during evacuation and instead relying solely on evacuation to protect its employees.
fluor daniel appealed the alj decision to the oshrc,which affirmed the respiratory protection item and vacated the remaining items in upholding the respiratory protection count,the oshrc specifically rejected fluor daniel arguments that it lacked fair notice of the requirements of section,that the secretary was estopped from charging a respiratory protection violation,and that there was insufficient evidence to support the finding of a willful violation.after finding that the language of the regulation provided clear notice and that the secretary was not barred from bringing a respiration protection count merely because it had never brought one against fluor daniel before,the commission explained that the evidence presented to the alj showed that fluor daniel willfully violated the regulation.specifically,the commission held that fluor daniel knew about the need to provide respirators during emergencies but instead disregarded the osha respirator requirement and decided to rely solely on its policy of evacuating employees in emergency situations.as a result of the willful violation of section a,the oshrc assessed fluor daniel a penalty of.the company appealed the commission decision to this court pursuant to.
oshrc decisions are entitled to considerable deference on appellate review.indeed,the statutory command makes this clear t he findings of the commission with respect to questions of fact,if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole,shall be conclusive.a.we have held that s ubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.builders,herman,cir quoting lewis callahan,cir.moreover,the legal determinations of an agency like the oshrc are to be overturned only if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.a see also reich trinity,cir this court reviews the commission order to determine whether it is in accordance with the law.we add that in interpreting osha regulations,a reviewing court should defer to the reasonable interpretations of the secretary of labor.see martin oshrc,d.finally,an oshrc finding of willfulness is a finding of fact,see builders,at,but the commission definition or application of the term is a matter of law.see reich,at.
on appeal,fluor daniel makes two arguments.first,the company contends the commission erred in determining that it had fair notice that its respiratory protection program could be found to violate section a.second,fluor daniel argues that,even if there was a violation,the oshrc acted unreasonably in concluding that the violation was willful.in light of the highly deferential standard for reviewing oshrc decisions,and based on our review of the entire record,fluor daniel arguments can not succeed.
fluor daniel argues that it lacked notice section a required it to provide emergency respirators because the language of the regulation was vague and because past inspections of the plant by government officials lulled the company into believing that its respiratory protection program was adequate.we are not persuaded.
as an initial matter,fluor daniel offers no reason for this court to conclude that the oshrc acted contrary to the law when it held that section a was not vague.the regulation states,in clear terms,that i n emergencies,or when controls required by subpart d of this part either fail or are inadequate to prevent harmful exposures to employees,appropriate respiratory protective devices shall be provided by the employer and shall be used.a.as the commission held,this standard provide d clear notice that the respiratory protection standard applied to fluor daniel facility and plainly required the availability and use of respirators in emergencies or when engineering controls failed.the conduct for which fluor daniel was sanctioned was a precise violation of this unambiguous regulation.although fluor daniel stresses that the incident in the resin plant did not involve a failure of engineering controls,the company acknowledges,as it must,that the incident was in fact an emergency and that it did not provide respirators to its employees.fluor daniel also does not deny that phosgene is a hazardous gas under subpart d of the regulation,codified at.quite simply,we agree with the oshrc that there was nothing vague or ambiguous about the regulation as applied to fluor daniel in this situation.
because the regulation itself was not vague,fluor daniel can prevail only if it succeeds on the claim that the past inspections somehow led the company to believe that it could not be found in violation of the respiratory protection regulation.this argument fails,however,because we can not disturb the oshrc findings of fact unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence.see builders,at.and,in this case,substantial evidence supports the commission determination that the prior inspections of the burkville facility did not address the issue of emergency respirators in the resin plant.
the three past inspections on which fluor daniel relies are a osha compliance inspection and two subsequent reviews conducted between and pursuant to ge participation in osha voluntary protection program vpp the evidence strongly supports the commission determination that nothing in any of these inspections conveyed to fluor daniel the government approval of the lack of emergency respirators in the resin plant.first,the visit addressed only complaints about the lack of adequate emergency respirators in the facility chlorine plant,where mouthpiece respirators were provided to fluor daniel employees,not in the resin plant.dennis bowden,fluor daniel construction and site manager at burkville from to,testified before the alj he could not recall any discussion of the resin plant with the investigators conducting the inspection.the only contrary testimony came from david herrington of fluor daniel corporate safety group.although herrington expressed an understanding that the inspection covered the resin plant,the value of his understanding was limited since he had no knowledge indeed,he was not working at burkville at the time.moreover,even herrington never said that emergency respirators were discussed as part of any inspection of the resin plant in.
the osha inspector notes did indicate that respirators were available and used as needed in,but we see no reason to disagree with the commission factual determination that these notes referred only to the chlorine plant,which was the subject of the complaint that led to the investigation in the first place.the same report that noted the use of respirators expressly stated that the investigation was limited in scope.as the inspector explained in his report,a complete inspection of all chemical units was not conducted r eview of the brine operation and bpa bisphenol a facility was adequate at this time since the chlorine leak occurred in the brine operation,the main portion of the investigation concentrated around this operation.for the same reason,we can not fault the commission for failing to place any stock in bowden general recollection that the osha compliance officer reviewed fluor daniel entire respiratory protection program and found no deficiencies.simply put,there is substantial evidence to support the commission decision that the inspection did not address emergency respirators in the resin plant,and fluor daniel suggestions to the contrary do not compel us to conclude that the commission findings were in error.
similarly,we can not disturb the commission finding that the subsequent vpp inspections did not address fluor respiratory equipment.absolutely nothing in the record shows that resin plant emergency respirators were discussed at either visit,and fluor daniel itself points only to bowden broad testimony that he told the inspectors that fluor daniel had a respiratory protection program in place.as with the inspection,fluor daniel identifies no evidence indicating that osha inspectors said or did anything at any time that would have induced the company to believe that it did not need to provide emergency respirators to the resin plant employees.without such evidence,we can not disturb the commission determination that fluor daniel was not misled by past inspections.therefore,the company can not prevail on its claim that it lacked notice of the requirements of section a.
moreover,even if fluor daniel could show that osha inspectors considered and failed to issue a citation for the lack of respirators in the resin plant during the inspection or the vpp visits,the company would still not be able to prevail in the absence of any affirmative approval of the lack of respirators.fluor daniel makes no claim that any osha officials expressly said that respirators were unnecessary,and mere silence by osha inspectors is not enough to support a company claim that it was lulled into violating a regulation.as the commission recognized,it is well established by both the commission and the courts that osha failure to cite an employer during a past inspection does not,standing alone,constitute a lack of fair notice.see,donovan daniel marr son,cir an employer can not rely on the secretary failure to issue citations.cedar constr.oshrc,explaining that allowing companies to rely on lack of citations in prior investigations would discourage of the act by businessmen who have far greater knowledge about conditions at the workplaces than do osha inspectors.sec y of labor peterson.steel erection,cas.bna,oshrc i t is well established that an employer can not rely on the secretary failure to issue a citation.
the one case that fluor daniel cites in support of its position that the absence of citations in prior inspections constitutes a lack of fair notice for future violations is inapposite.in trinity marine nashville,oshrc,cir,osha inspectors cited a company for violating a regulation by using electrical boxes in a shipyard.osha withdrew the citation,but then cited the company again for the same violation eight years later.because osha officials at least implicitly approved the use of the boxes by filing,considering,and then withdrawing the earlier citation,id.at,the fifth circuit determined that the company had a valid claim that it lacked fair notice that it could be cited for an identical violation years later.in this case,unlike in trinity marine,there is no evidence that osha inspectors ever addressed,let alone approved,the unavailability of respirators in the resin plant.all that exists here,if anything,is past silence by osha officials,which can not be construed as a sign of approval 
in short,there is no basis for us to conclude that the commission erred in finding that fluor daniel had proper notice that it could be held in violation of section a.the language of the governing regulation was clear,and nothing in either the inspection or the vpp visits misled fluor into believing that it was in compliance.
fluor daniel also argues that,even if we uphold the finding of a violation,this court should vacate the portion of the commission decision finding that the violation was willful.section of title of the united states code provides,in relevant part,that an employer who willfully or repeatedly violates any osha standard,rule,or order,may be assessed a penalty of no more than but no less than for each willful violation.a.the statute provides lesser penalties for serious violations,which occur if an employer knew about and failed to prevent a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a condition which exists in the workplac
