this case involves a labor dispute between two west virginia hospitals,bluefield regional medical center and greenbrier valley medical center collectively,the hospitals,and a group of their employees.after registered nurses employed at the hospitals elected the national nurses organizing committee the union as their bargaining representative,the hospitals challenged the election results and refused the union requests to bargain.the national labor relations board the board issued a final decision concluding the hospitals violated the national labor relations act the act,et,by refusing to bargain with the union.the board then brought an application for enforcement before this court,which the hospitals oppose.for the reasons set forth below,we grant the board application for enforcement.
to place the issues in context,we briefly explain some of the board functions and the authority the act grants the board.as a body,the board is responsible for determining whether certain conduct constitutes an unfair labor practice in violation of the act.in addition,the board has principal authority to conduct representation proceedings,in which employees may select a collective bargaining representative.id.b,c.the act expressly permits the board to delegate to its regional directors authority to oversee representation elections and to certify election results.id.b.the board delegated that general authority to its regional directors in,and they have been administering and certifying results of representation elections since that time.may.
although the regional directors have delegated authority to oversee representation elections,the board retains plenary authority to review any action of a regional director at the objection of an interested person.b.however,the parties may waive that right and agree to give the regional director decision finality.see in the absence of such an agreement,a regional director actions only become final if the parties decline to seek board review or if the board,upon review,does not alter the regional director decision.b 
section a of the act requires that the board be composed of five members appointed by the president upon advice and consent of the senate.id.a.t hree members of the board shall,at all times,constitute a quorum of the board.id.b.
the act permits the board to delegate any or all of the powers which it may itself exercise to panels made up of three or more of its members,with two panel members constituting a panel quorum.id.b.this delegation of cases across various panels is intended to allow the board to process labor disputes more efficiently.the panel delegation survives the expiration of up to two of the five board members terms,such that the board may continue to adjudicate unfair labor practice disputes pending appointment of new members so long as the board quorum requirement is met.id.b.
as of january,the terms of three of the board five members had expired.asserting authority under the recess appointments clause,const.art.ii,cl,the president appointed three persons to the board to fill these vacancies on january,during a brief recess between the senate pro forma sessions.in nlrb noel canning,d,the supreme court held those appointments unconstitutional as not within the president powers.id.at.these board seats remained vacant until august,when the senate confirmed new board members for the seats.by reason of the three vacancies,the board was composed of only two members from january,through august,and thus lacked a quorum as required by the act.during this period,regional directors continued to oversee representation elections and certify election results pursuant to the delegation of authority from the board.
the hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient care in bluefield and ronceverte,west virginia.in august,while the board lacked a quorum,the union filed two petitions with the board seeking to become the bargaining entity for registered nurses at the hospitals the hospitals and the union entered into consent election agreements the agreements that,among other things,identified the proposed bargaining unit and provided that the regional director,claude harrell,would oversee elections in accordance with the board regulations under the agreements and corresponding regulations,the parties were required to file objections to the results of the elections with the regional director no later than seven days after the ballots were tallied.the agreements specified that t he method of investigation of objections and challenge s,including whether to hold a hearing,shall be determined by the regional director,whose decision shall be final.the regional director also retained the authority to certify the union as the representative of the hospitals registered nurses,pending the outcome of the elections.
the regional director held a representation election at each hospital on august and,and the union prevailed in both elections.in response,the hospitals filed several objections to the election results.the regional director issued notices of hearings for the objections and gave written notification to the hospitals that the board rules and regulations required the hospitals to submit evidence in support of their objections within specific time limits.see.the hospitals did not produce any evidence in support of their objections,nor did they seek an extension of time to do so.on september,the regional director overruled the hospitals objections and withdrew the hearing notices,actions that amounted to final rulings on the objections under the agreements.the regional director certified the union as the registered nurses collective bargaining representative the next day.see.
the union then made several requests to bargain with the hospitals on behalf of the registered nurses.the hospitals refused to bargain,and the union filed unfair labor practice charges with the board.on november,the regional director issued a consolidated complaint on behalf of the acting general counsel of the board,lafe solomon,which alleged that the hospitals refusal to bargain with the union violated sections a and of the act.see a,a.the hospitals answered by admitting their refusal to bargain,but claiming an oral agreement between the union and the hospitals required arbitration of election disputes and precluded the regional director from overruling their election objections 
while the unfair labor practice proceedings were ongoing,the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued its decision in nlrb noel canning,aff on other grounds,d,holding that the president recess appointment of the three board members on january,was unlawful and that the board as then constituted lacked a quorum.on february,the hospitals filed an amended answer citing the noel canning decision and arguing under that case the actions of the regional director in certifying the union were invalid because the certifications issued during the time in which the board lacked a quorum.the board acting general counsel moved for summary judgment.
upon confirmation of new members by the senate,the board regained a quorum on august.almost a year later,the supreme court issued its decision in nlrb noel canning,d,affirming,albeit on different grounds,the district of columbia circuit holding that the president recess appointments were unconstitutional.the hospitals then raised the supreme court noel canning decision,along with various other affirmative defenses,in a third amended answer to the consolidated complaint,arguing specifically that the regional director lacked authority to approve the agreements or issue the election certifications when the board lacked a quorum.tangentially,the hospitals contended that the regional director appointment was invalid because the board acting general counsel was not validly holding his position at the time he appointed the regional director.
on december,the board granted summary judgment to the acting general counsel,finding that the hospitals refusal to bargain with the union violated sections a and of the act.the board found that the hospitals waived board review of the regional director actions with respect to the election objections because the defense could have been raised during the representation phase and the agreements stated that the regional director actions would be final.alternatively,the board concluded the regional director had validly exercised authority over the representation proceedings under the longstanding delegation of such authority by the board to its regional directors in.the board also concluded the regional director appointment by the acting general counsel was valid.accordingly,the board ordered the hospitals to bargain with the union,to implement any resulting understanding in a signed agreement,and to post a remedial notice.
the board now brings an application for enforcement pursuant to e.we have jurisdiction in this appeal under that statute.
the hospitals raise several arguments in opposition to the application for enforcement,which they contend require vacating the certificates of elections and remanding for new elections.primarily,the hospitals argue the regional director lacked authority to act during the period when the board did not have a quorum thereby rendering his decisions on the elections invalid.the hospitals also contend the regional director appointment to that position occurred after the board lost a quorum and is void,thus rendering invalid any actions he took including conducting and certifying the elections.relatedly,the hospitals argue the regional director appointment was invalid because the acting general counsel had also lost authority to act at the time of his appointment.the hospitals lastly posit that the regional director erred in requiring them to present evidence in support of their election objections because a separate contract with the union precluded such a requirement.for the reasons discussed below,we resolve each of these arguments in favor of the board.
as an initial matter,the board contends that we need not reach any issue regarding the board lack of a quorum because the hospitals waived that argument by failing to raise it during the representation proceedings and by entering into the agreements.the district of columbia circuit recently rejected nearly identical waiver arguments from the board in uc health nlrb.it held that uc health had not waived its challenge premised on noel canning because challenges to the composition of an agency can be raised on review by a circuit court even when they are not raised before the agency.id.at.in addition,it observed that holding that an election agreement foreclosed the challenge would present a fairness problem 
uc health did not expressly give up the challenge it brings now when it executed the agreement it merely signed a form agreement providing that the board regulations would govern the election.indeed,when uc health entered the stipulated election agreement,no one knew whether congress might confirm the president appointments and obviate the quorum issue by the time the representation election in this case took place.and for that matter,uc health could not have known with any certainty that the board had no quorum even without senate approval for the president appointments until the supreme court handed down its decision in noel canning fourteen months after the election.we will not hold uc health responsible for failing to see the future.
the reasoning in uc health applies with equal force here,as the hospitals raised a argument before the board and long before the enforcement application in this court.this is not the circumstance where a party failed to pursue diligently a viable defense.the hospitals promptly raised before the board the supreme court noel canning decision,handed down approximately months after the representation elections took place,and we thus find no waiver.
the hospitals main argument is that the authority of the regional director lapsed during any period in which the board lacked a quorum.citing to the restatement third of agency,am.law inst,the hospitals contend that once the principal the board lost its authority,then its agent the regional director lost all delegated authority that derived from the principal an agent may carry out a delegated authority only so long as the entity that delegated the authority continues to hold the necessary authority of its own.opening br.as a consequence,the hospitals conclude the agreements and certifications of elections issued by the regional director were void ab initio because they occurred when the board lacked a quorum.opening br.
the board responds that the supreme court has implicitly rejected the hospitals underlying argument in new process steel,nlrb,d.further,the board contends even if new process steel is not controlling,the board interpretation of the act verifying the ongoing authority of regional directors is entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d.
we find the hospitals argument wanting in view of the chevron deference owed the board interpretation of the act regarding the authority of regional directors during the absence of a board quorum the board has construed the act as authorizing regional directors to exercise delegated authority during a period in which the board lacks a quorum.bluefield hosp.
the validity of an agency interpretation of a congressional act the agency is charged to administer is reviewed by a court under the familiar test set out in chevron.see montgomery,wl,at cir,here,a chevron analysis is appropriate because the issue before us involves the fcc interpretation of a statute it is charged with administering.at step one,the court determines whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.here,that would mean if congress has plainly addressed whether regional directors may continue to act in the absence of a board quorum,that is the end of the matter,for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.however,if the statute is silent or ambiguous,the court will proceed to chevron second step,which asks whether the board interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.if it is,then we must defer.id.at see also city of arlington fcc,d.
beginning with the first step of the chevron analysis,whether the statute speaks directly and unambiguously to the regional director authority during the absence of a board quorum,we examine the relevant statutory text 
the board is authorized to delegate to any group of three or more members any or all of the powers which it may itself exercise.the board is also authorized to delegate to its regional directors its powers under section of this title to determine the unit appropriate for the purpose of collective bargaining,to investigate and provide for hearings,and determine whether a question of representation exists,and to direct an election or take a secret ballot under subsection c or e of section of this title and certify the results thereof,except that upon the filing of a request therefor with the board by any interested person,the board may review any action of a regional director delegated to him under this paragraph,but such a review shall not,unless specifically ordered by the board,operate as a stay of any action taken by the regional director.a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board,and three members of the board shall,at all times,constitute a quorum of the board,except that two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to the first sentence hereof 
b.nothing in the statute addresses the effect of the board loss of quorum on a prior delegation of authority to regional directors.see id.as congress has not plainly addressed the issue,we must engage in the second part of the chevron analysis whether the board interpretation that the delegation of authority to regional directors survives despite the absence of a board quorum is a reasonable one to which we owe deference.
relying on the express statutory authorization in section b of the act,the board delegated decisional authority in representation proceedings to regional directors in.may.at the time of
