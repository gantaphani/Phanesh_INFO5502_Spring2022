dupont de nemours and company dupont appeals the partial grant of summary judgment to the eeoc and its refusal to alter the judgment following a jury verdict awarding laura barrios backpay,frontpay,and punitive damages for violations of the americans with disabilities act of ada,et.dupont argues that barrios was not disabled under the ada,that it did not regard her as disabled,that she could not perform an essential function of her job,and that the awards of punitive damages and front and backpay were inappropriate.finding only the frontpay award to be infirm,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
laura barrios began working in as a lab operator in dupont laplace,louisiana,chemical plant.in,she was diagnosed with a number of medical conditions that made it increasingly difficult for her to walk and for which she received continuing medical treatment.
barrios position required her to obtain annual physical examinations by dupont plant physicians.in,the company physicians restricted barrios from,inter alia,standing for more than ten minutes,walking more than one hundred feet without resting,working in a stooped position,or working more than eight hours.a year later,dupont transferred her to the position of lab clerk,a sedentary job that involved copying and filing.
dupont examinations culminated in a functional capacity evaluation fce because of concerns about barrios ability to safely walk at the plant.the fce was intended to evaluate barrios ability to perform the basic functions of her job and to meet certain qualification standards,including the ability to evacuate in the event of an emergency.because of the hazardous nature of the chemical manufacturing process at the plant,dupont was concerned about barrios ability to evacuate safely.dupont contends that the ability to evacuate during an emergency is required of all employees,and dupont routinely conducts emergency response drills.
after the fce confirmed barrios walking impairment,dupont physicians concluded that she should be medically restricted from walking anywhere at the plant.dupont believed this restriction left her unable to evacuate in event of an emergency.the company placed barrios on temporary disability for six months and total and permanent disability thereafter.barrios attempt to get her job back was rebuffed by dupont,even though she demonstrated in that she could walk an evacuation route without assistance.
the eeoc filed suit against dupont in june,alleging that dupont violated the ada by forcing barrios to undergo the fce and by discharging her.dupont responded that barrios was terminated because the fce showed she could not safely evacuate the plant on her own during an emergency.after both parties filed for summary judgment,the district court granted the eeoc motion in part and denied dupont motion.the court found that dupont regarded barrios as disabled under the ada,but it found other material issues of fact.
the parties proceeded to trial,and a jury found that barrios was discharged in violation of the ada and awarded her in backpay,in frontpay,and in punitive damages,which the district court reduced to the court denied dupont motions.dupont now appeals.
ii.discussion 
dupont argues that the district court erred in granting partial summary judgment to the eeoc and in denying its motions for judgment as a matter of law,new trial,and to amend or alter the judgment because barrios was not disabled or regarded as disabled under the ada the awards of back and frontpay are improper and the punitive damages award was unsupported.we address each issue in turn.
disability 
dupont appeals both the district court grant of partial summary judgment to the eeoc on the issue whether dupont regarded barrios as substantially limited in the major life activity of walking and the court failure to determine as a matter of law that barrios was not disabled.because the eeoc does not defend the jury finding that barrios was actually disabled for ada purposes,this appellate review must consider whether to sustain the judgment solely on the basis that dupont regarded barrios as disabled.
this court reviews de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,utilizing the same criteria as the district court.cutrera bd.of supervisors of.state,cir.dupont will prevail if the evidence demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact.
the ada definition of disability includes individuals who are regarded as having such an impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities.c see also rodriguez conagra grocery prods,cir.a plaintiff is regarded as being disabled if he has an impairment that is not substantially limiting but which the employer perceives as substantially limiting,has an impairment that is substantially limiting only because of the attitudes of others,or has no impairment but is perceived by the employer as having a substantially limiting impairment.waldrip,cir citing gowesky singing river hosp,cir see also sutton united air lines,d.
in holding that dupont regarded barrios as disabled,the district court relied upon the broad restrictions placed on her by dupont physicians,the total and permanent disability benefits provided to her with dupont assistance,and dupont pleadings and discovery responses.dupont admitted in its discovery responses that barrios was incapable of walking and permanently disabled from walking.dupont plant physicians placed restrictions on her walking anywhere at the plant site,including on level and paved surfaces,because they considered her substantially impaired in walking and because she could not dependably be counted on to walk safely.the district court cited a large quantity of evidence consistent with its conclusion.
in response,dupont argues that,rather than having regarded barrios as entirely disabled from the major life activity of walking,it regarded her as having a medical restriction that prevented her from walking at the plant.two of this court decisions,ray glidden,cir,and pryor trane,cir,are representative of a long line of cases holding that an employer may regard an employee as impaired or restricted from one position or a narrow range of jobs without regarding him as disabled.ray held that restrictions on heavy lifting did not establish a record of disability or a regarded as disability because the inability to perform heavy lifting did not render the employee substantially limited in the major activities of lifting or working.at.similarly,in pryor,the employee could not be regarded as disabled because her work restrictions were limited only to a particular job and not an entire class of jobs.at.
dupont reliance upon ray and pryor is misplaced.the evidence demonstrates that dupont did not regard barrios as restricted from a narrow range of jobs rather,dupont regarded barrios as restricted from all jobs at the plant,because every employment position requires walking on the plant site.moreover,dupont perception of barrios walking impairment was not limited to the physicians believed her impairment extended to home,at work,wherever.if company experts believed barrios could not walk safely even in her own work area,which consisted of level,flat surfaces,then dupont must also have believed she could not safely walk anywhere.see rodriguez,at.dupont was unable to offer evidence that created a genuine issue of material fact that its experts perceptions of the work restrictions might have been limited to barrios ability to walk in her particular position as a lab clerk or only at the dupont plant.
therefore,for ada purposes,dupont regarded barrios as substantially limited in the major life activity of walking.see j i stating that substantially limits means u nable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform talk delta airlines,cir per curiam noting that walking is a major life activity see also eeoc sears,roebuck,cir holding that a severe difficulty in walking the equivalent of one city block was a substantial limitation compared to the walking most people do daily.the district court properly granted summary judgment that barrios was regarded as disabled.
