at stake in this interlocutory appeal are the claims of one subclass of plaintiffs in an ongoing lawsuit against caterpillar for allegedly breaching its promise to provide lifetime retiree health care.the district court preliminarily enjoined caterpillar to provide the plaintiffs who retired from a caterpillar subsidiary between and this benefit.because the statute of limitations bars the claims of this subclass,we reverse.
in,caterpillar formed a subsidiary,caterpillar logistics services cls,to market its warehousing and product distribution services to third parties.caterpillar warehousing and distribution services are located in facilities,and,when cls was formed,cls employees were subject to the collective bargaining agreement the cba between uaw and caterpillar.among other benefits,the cba purported to provide lifetime,healthcare to retirees and their surviving spouses.to bolster the marketability of cls services,caterpillar and the uaw agreed that cls services to third parties would not be interrupted during any uaw strikes at caterpillar facilities.caterpillar and the uaw also agreed that,in the event of a strike,the cba would govern cls employees during negotiation of a new cba,and that any new cba would apply to cls employees.the possibility of applying a new cba to cls who retired between and the ratification of a new not discussed.
the cba expired in,and in,during negotiations over a new cba,the uaw instituted several strikes.one aspect of the dispute turned on caterpillar proposal to cap retiree medical benefits in return for increased pension benefits.consistent with their agreement,cls employees did not participate in the strikes,and they continued to receive benefits under the cba.on march,a new cba between uaw and caterpillar the cba was ratified.between january,and the ratification of the cba on march,a few hundred cls employees retired,known here as the cls retirees or subclass.
in march,caterpillar gave the cls subclass notice of benefits changes brought about by the new cba,including increases in the basic pension benefit rate,an additional early retirement allowance,and payments to retirees,as well as an increase in prescription drug and a limit on adding new dependents.the cba also established a managed care network,under which caterpillar would reimburse of expenses for medical services by a preferred provider in the managed care network but only of such expenses for services by a provider.while the cba purported to provide free lifetime healthcare benefits for retirees,the cba limited c ompany contributions for medical benefits as of the year for those employees retired after january.
on april,caterpillar told the uaw that cls employees who retired during the labor dispute would prospectively be eligible for the same pension and benefit provisions as other employees who retired under the terms and conditions in the cba.by may,the cls subclass thus received the cba increased basic pension rates,plus additional early retirement allowance and pension payments,and was subject to the cba cap on retiree healthcare costs.and by june,the subclass was subject to the cba managed care network.
in november,caterpillar mailed the members of the cls subclass a summary plan description spd that outlined the benefits changes in the cba.the spd noted the increases in basic pension rates,additional early retirement allowance,and pension payments,as well as the increase in prescription drug,the limit on adding new dependents,and the imposition of a managed care network.as to the cap on retiree healthcare benefits,the spd said 
company contributions for health care benefits for employees who retired on or after january,are capped at the average annual cost per individual in projected to.thereafter,the company will continue to pay up to that amount each year for retiree health care benefits.if costs rise above that amount,beginning january,retirees will be required to contribute towards the cost of health care benefits in the form of a monthly premium.
note the veba voluntary employee benefit association trust fund assets will be used to cover retiree premiums after the year until trust assets are depleted.once that fund is depleted,monthly premium contributions from retirees will be required.
in,when the veba fund was nearly depleted,caterpillar began deducting a monthly healthcare premium from the pensions of cls subclass members.in june,caterpillar began charging the cls subclass deductibles,charges and coinsurance charges up to certain maximums.
on march,the cls subclass and other caterpillar retirees filed this lawsuit against caterpillar under of the relations act,and of the employee retirement income security act of.as amended,the complaint alleges that caterpillar breached the cba commitment to provide free,unalterable,lifetime healthcare benefits for retirees when it charged retirees and their surviving spouses a premium for healthcare benefits,increased charges for drug prescription,deductibles,and other expenses,and made reductions in retiree healthcare.caterpillar moved to dismiss the lawsuit,contending that the statute of limitations barred it because the plaintiffs claims accrued in when caterpillar applied the new cba to them.the district court denied the motion because 
the wording of caterpillar communications regarding retiree benefits was so indefinite and contingent on future events,it could hardly have been clear to the plaintiffs that,years before the defendant actually began to make the challenged deductions,the plaintiffs had suffered an injury and that the statute of limitations on their claims had begun to run.
winnett caterpillar,d.
the cls subclass moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent caterpillar from charging cls retirees and their surviving spouses premiums,deductibles,and other medical care payments.caterpillar opposed the motion,reiterating its argument that the claims were and contending that caterpillar never made a promise of lifetime,unalterable,free healthcare benefits to the cls employees.in,the court granted the preliminary injunction.d.the court held that the cls subclass had shown a likelihood of success on the merits because the evidence indicated that they had a vested right to lifetime medical care.id.at.the court held that the cls subclass would suffer irreparable harm without injunctive relief because class members testified that they had delayed medical treatment due to the costs of obtaining it.id.at.the court held that an injunction would not substantially harm caterpillar due to the company financial stability.id.at.and the court held that an injunction would advance the public interest.id.at.
the court also held that new evidence introduced in connection with the preliminary injunction motion did not change,and,in fact bolster ed its earlier decision that the cls subclass claims were not.id.at.in the court words 
from until late,retirees had every reason to believe that future negotiations between the uaw and caterpillar would prevent caterpillar from implementing the caps on retiree healthcare costs.from the very beginning,caterpillar described the caps as a possibility dependent and contingent on future events.this indefinite and uncertain language continued until october,when caterpillar began deducting retiree health care premium charges from the cls retirees pensions.
id.caterpillar imposition of the network and other changes from the cba,the court reasoned,together with the cls subclass acceptance of these changes,did not trigger the accrual of the claims because the changes were minor and did not put the cls subclass on notice that caterpillar was repudiating a vested right to lifetime health care.id.at.essentially,the court explained,no cost retiree health care to which the plaintiffs were entitled under the agreement was still available if the retiree stayed in network until,when caterpillar began charging the cls subclass deductibles,charges,and charges up to certain maximums.id.caterpillar appeals,challenging the district court decision to grant injunctive relief and its decision that the claims were timely filed.
courts weigh four factors in deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction whether the plaintiff has established a substantial likelihood or probability of success on the merits whether there is a threat of irreparable harm to the plaintiff whether issuance of the injunction would cause substantial harm to others and whether the public interest would be served by granting injunctive relief.entm t,shelby county,cir.but most of this is largely beside the point here.a preliminary injunction issued where there is simply no likelihood of success on the merits must be reversed.state miller,cir,and claims necessarily have no chance of success.

the cls retirees filed this lawsuit on march.that means that,if they discovered or reasonably should have discovered caterpillar no longer was willing to provide free,unalterable,lifetime healthcare benefits under the cba at least six years earlier,namely before march,the claim must be dismissed as.see noble,at t he asserted actual knowledge of plaintiffs is not determinative if they did not act as reasonable persons and,in effect,closed their eyes to evident and objective facts concerning the accrual of their right to sue.
the retirees filed the claim too late because it accrued at least by,when the uaw and caterpillar reached a new labor agreement that altered the healthcare benefits available to retirees and for the first time announced new costs for obtaining them,and caterpillar applied the new agreement to the cls retirees.first,the contractual theory of the subclass is that caterpillar was obligated to provide the healthcare benefits associated with the cba to retirees for life.if there is one thing that became clear in,it was that the cba no longer governed their healthcare benefits.starting on may,with the implementation of the new cba,caterpillar placed the subclass on equal footing with retirees who also retired between and,by applying the healthcare benefits associated with the cba to all of them,namely to all caterpillar retirees who retired after the end of the cba in late.
second,not only did caterpillar no longer apply the cba to the retirees in,but that year it also no longer honored the alleged promise of free,lifetime,unalterable healthcare benefits associated with the cba.in connection with the cba,caterpillar immediately altered the benefits package and increased the costs of it by increasing prescription drug,placing a limit on new dependents that could be added to a plan,establishing a managed care network,which reimbursed of expenses for medical services by a preferred provider in the managed care network and of such expenses for services by a provider,and adding new limits to vision and dental care.
in,caterpillar announced two other significant changes it capped the amount it would contribute to each retiree healthcare plan,and it added a broader clause,giving the company an unfettered right to terminate the plan.making the right to terminate benefits under the plan s ubject to applicable collective bargaining agreements.as to the capping of premium contributions,a notice dated march and distributed to the subclass explained that the company contributions are limited as of the year for those employees retired after january.the spd distributed in november added that company contributions for health care benefits for employees who retired on or after january,are capped at the average annual cost per individual in projected to,and informed the subclass that,i f costs rise above that amount,beginning january,retirees will be required to contribute towards the cost of health care benefits in the form of a monthly premium.
all of these notices of the various the notice provided by the spd,which plan sponsors must distribute to advise participants of their benefits,a provided the clear repudiation necessary for the subclass claims to accrue.see hirt equitable retirement plan for employees,managers and agents,app x,cir distribution of spd constituted a clear repudiation of plaintiffs benefits and triggered the statute of limitations bergt retirement plan for pilots employed by markair,cir spd is the statutorily established means of informing participants of the terms of the plan and its benefits and the employees primary source of information regarding employment benefits.while the cba allegedly had provided free,unalterable,lifetime healthcare benefits for retirees,the notices explained that this would no longer be true given the application of the cba to the cls retirees,who now faced managed care,increased prescription,a limit on the number of dependents eligible to be in a plan,new limits on vision and dental care,and a limit on c ompany contributions for medical benefits for those employees retired after january.
nor did the notices leave any doubt about the effects of these changes on the costs of the retirees healthcare plan.as of march,the subclass knew that the veba,not caterpillar,would cover the difference in monthly premiums after the year and would only do so until trust assets are depleted.the spd explained that,while the veba could delay premiums,it could not prevent them.once the veba is depleted,the spd confirmed,monthly premium contributions from retirees will be required.emphasis added.caterpillar repudiation of the plan guarantee was clear and unequivocal.
third,the accrual of a cause of action turns on when subclass members knew of caterpillar change in benefits,not when they felt its effects.see morrison,at claim accrues when claimant receives notice that benefits were denied see also carey int l bhd of workers local pension plan,cir cause of action accrues upon clear repudiation,not when application for benefits is denied union pac.beckham,cir same daill sheet metal workers local pension fund,cir same.as these cases show,a litigant can not postpone the accrual of a cause of action by claiming that,even though the company gave notice of a change in benefits in year one,the change did not affect the litigant health or pocketbook until year four.if a company announces the removal of,say,a benefit,the claim accrues on the date of the company announcement and notice,not the first day the affected individual needs dental work.were it otherwise,the limitations period would start at a different point for every employee or retiree,even though they all work or worked for the same company and even though they all face the same change in benefits.all of this means that the cls retirees claim for breach of contract accrued in when caterpillar announced the changes,not when the retirees first felt the changes,whether in when the announced cap on the company contributions to retirees healthcare premiums first had an impact on the retirees pocketbooks or at some other date when the initiation of managed care,dependent limitations or increased for prescription drugs first affected the healthcare choices of individual retirees or the costs borne by them.
fourth,while notice is the touchstone of accrual,this case is easier than most in one respect it involves claims that affected the plaintiffs soon after they were not in,then certainly before march.in addition to challe
