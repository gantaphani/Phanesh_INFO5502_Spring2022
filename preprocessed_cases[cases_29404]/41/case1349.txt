golden years homestead,operates a licensed nursing facility in fort wayne,indiana,and participates in the federal medicaid program.as such,it is subject to periodic inspections,or surveys,by the indiana state department of health.golden years underwent a series of surveys in and was cited for numerous and violations.all but one of the citations,however,were dismissed after administrative and judicial review.golden years then brought this suit against the inspectors alleging violations of its fourth and fourteenth amendment rights and also asserting claims for malicious prosecution and abuse of process.the district court concluded that golden years evidence was insufficient as a matter of law on all claims and entered summary judgment for the inspectors.
on appeal,golden years challenges only the dismissal of its claims,raising both procedural and substantive arguments.as to procedure,golden years argues that because the inspectors never asked for a merits dismissal of the and claims,the district court order amounted to an improper sua sponte entry of summary judgment on these claims.as to substance,golden years contends that its evidence of unprofessional and abusive conduct by the inspectors,considered together with the fact that only one of the original citations survived administrative and judicial review,raised a material issue of fact on the claims.
we reject both arguments and affirm.the inspectors sought summary judgment on all claims,and although they focused most of their argument on certain affirmative defenses and the sufficiency of the proof on the federal claims,they did assert that golden years evidence raised no material issues of fact as a general matter.as importantly,golden years responded on the substance of the claims in its brief in opposition.the deficiency that led the court to dismiss the federal of sufficient evidence that the inspectors behaved unreasonably or harbored any improper required dismissal of the claims.accordingly,the district court order was not an improper sua sponte summary judgment on the claims.summary judgment was also appropriate on the merits the claims require proof of malice or ulterior motive,and there was insufficient evidence of that here.
background 
in the spring of,the indiana state department of health sent a team of inspectors to conduct an annual recertification survey of golden years nursing facility in fort wayne.the agency had also received a complaint about the facility,so the annual survey doubled as a complaint inspection.the survey was conducted over a period of ten days in late april and early may.at some point,a disagreement arose between golden years director of nursing and one of the inspectors over the requirements of a particular federal regulation.when the director of nursing challenged the inspector interpretation,the inspector became very upset at being.the director testified that the inspectors as a group gave me the impression that they felt i should be doing that,that i should be standing up for what i believed was right and know the regulations and be able to quote back to them.they did like it at all.
for the remainder of the inspection,the inspectors subjected golden years and its staff to verbal and other abuse.among other things,the inspectors loudly criticized golden years staff in front of patients and visitors repeatedly slammed the door to the facility alzheimer wing in an effort to obtain a failure to lock and omitted favorable information from their report.in golden years view,the inspectors were too quick to dismiss exculpatory information identified by its staff,in one instance calling it crap or crud.the inspectors also failed to consider benign explanations for some of their negative findings.as proof of this,golden years cites two examples in their report the inspectors recorded that a patient was seen with excrement on her hand when it was really a bit of dried sweet potato the inspectors also documented that another patient had experienced a significant weight loss,but failed to note that this patient had been pounds overweight when admitted.golden years maintains that the inspection was so hostile and accusatory that it caused to of its nurses to quit.
surveys were conducted over the summer,and golden years was ultimately cited for violations of and rules.golden years brought an administrative appeal and a hearing ensued.the inspectors admitted as a general matter that they had omitted information favorable to golden years from their report but explained that they had been trained to include only the information related to the cited deficiencies.
an administrative law judge reversed all but one of the citations.after further administrative appeals and judicial review in state court,the original administrative determination was affirmed,leaving only one substantiated regulatory violation.golden years then filed this lawsuit against the inspectors and certain of their supervisors collectively,the inspectors asserting claims pursuant to for violation of its fourth and fourteenth amendment rights,along with claims under indiana law for abuse of process and malicious prosecution 
the inspectors moved for summary judgment on all claims.they focused their arguments,however,on certain affirmative defenses most notably collateral estoppel and qualified immunity and the sufficiency of the evidence on the federal claims.they argued that the instances of incivility were insufficient to support a violation of either fourth or fourteenth amendment rights and that the inspectors had conducted a reasonable survey in accordance with their training.for support they submitted training materials from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms that instruct inspectors to include in their reports only the information relevant to potential violations.they also argued that because golden years had successfully defeated most of the citations through administrative and judicial review,its claims were barred.although they did not explicitly address the substantive merits of the claims,they asserted as a general matter that t here are no genuine issues of material fact with respect to this matter and asked for dismissal of all claims.in its response to the motion,golden years at length addressed the substance of both its federal and state claims.
the district court granted summary judgment for the inspectors and dismissed all claims on the merits.golden years homestead,buckland,d.noting that nursing homes are heavily regulated and expectations of privacy in this context are thus attenuated,the court held that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the surveys had been conducted or citations issued in an unreasonable manner,for any improper motive,or shocked the conscience for purposes of the fourth and fourteenth amendment claims.id.at.the court also held that because both of the claims required an element of improper motive,the evidence was insufficient on these claims as well.id.at.as the judge saw it,the incidents of incivility and excessive investigatory zeal and the omission of some favorable information from the inspectors report was simply not enough to establish a constitutional violation or the torts of malicious prosecution or abuse of process.
