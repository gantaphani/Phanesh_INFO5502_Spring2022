randolph koch sued his employer,the securities and exchange commission,under the civil rights act of,the americans with disabilities act,the rehabilitation act,and the age discrimination in employment act.when the sec then attempted to serve a subpoena for confidential records relating to communications between koch and his psychotherapist,koch moved to quash the subpoena.the district court denied the motion on the ground that koch,by placing his mental state in issue,had impliedly waived the privilege.the court ordered koch psychotherapist to produce confidential records and ordered koch to make her available for a deposition.koch appeals,arguing he did not waive the privilege and therefore his communications with his therapist are privileged and not discoverable.we agree and hence reverse the order of the district court.
background 
koch sued the sec in the district court alleging discrimination,retaliation,and failure to accommodate his medical conditions.he alleged that he had serious medical disease,hypertension,gout,and obstructive sleep accommodation in the form of a lightened or gliding work schedule,and that the sec refusal to accommodate him prevented koch from participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program prescribed by his cardiologist.koch also alleged the sec actions exacerbated his hypertension and other problems.he sought a permanent injunction prohibiting the sec discriminatory and retaliatory practices,affirmative relief including a promotion and the withdrawal of adverse performance appraisals,and compensatory and punitive damages.he did not seek damages for emotional distress.
koch executed releases authorizing the sec to seek and obtain medical information from various health care providers,including,as relevant here,his psychopharmacologist,steven polakoff,and his psychoanalyst,margo aron,a licensed social worker.each release provided that koch may revoke this authorization at any time,in writing except to the extent that action has already been taken in reliance upon this authorization.these clauses appear to be based upon regulations issued by the department of health and human services pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa,which permit revocation except to the extent that i the covered entity has taken action in reliance thereon,b i,and define a covered entity as,among others,a health care provider,id.a.
before aron was served with the subpoena for information about koch psychotherapy,but after the sec had attempted service at an office the address of which koch had provided but which aron did not frequently use,koch revoked his authorization for aron to release information about him.koch then moved to quash the sec subpoena,in opposition to which the sec maintained that koch had put his mental state in issue and thereby waived the privilege.a magistrate judge denied the motion in a memorandum order stating 
koch seeks thousands of dollars in compensatory damages for,inter alia,emotional distress.while he has not alleged a separate claim for infliction of emotional distress,he has alleged that the sec actions caused him to develop serious hypertension,ha ve damaged his health,made it harder for him to control his weight,and resulted in stress,humiliation and loss of enjoyment of life.
the judge cited,as the source of these allegations,koch answers and supplemental answers to interrogatories.he went on to conclude that koch has placed his mental state at issue in this case through his acknowledgment that he suffers from depression and takes medication for this condition,and thus had impliedly waived the privilege,citing kalinoski evans,d.the judge added that koch initial authorization of release of medical records from aron and the references to aron that exist in medical records that are in the sec possession also weigh in favor of finding an express waiver.
the district court agreed with the reasoning of the magistrate judge and noted its agreement also with the sec that once a release for polakoff,a psychiatrist,was provided and he produced records mentioning aron,koch can not retract his waiver with respect to aron koch surely is not entitled to his waiver of privilege.accepting without modification the recommended decision of the magistrate judge,the court denied koch motion to quash.koch filed motions respectively to withdraw any claim for emotional distress damages and for reconsideration.the district court denied reconsideration without indicating whether it was also denying koch motion to withdraw the claim.the court granted the sec motion to compel aron testimony and ordered aron to produce all records requested by the sec.koch appeals both this order and the order accepting the magistrate judge recommended decision.
ii.analysis 
under the collateral order doctrine of cohen beneficial indus.loan,we have jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal of an order denying a motion to quash based upon a privilege.in re sealed case medical records,orders compelling production of allegedly privileged information satisf y the three criteria for collateral review citation omitted.we review the district court discovery ruling for abuse of discretion.id.at.because a district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law,the standard includes review to determine that the discretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions.id.quoting koon united states,d.
koch argues he neither impliedly nor expressly waived the privilege,and the district court erred by ordering aron to testify and produce records after koch withdrew any claim to damages for emotional distress.we agree in both respects.
implied waiver 
koch first argues the district court erred by finding that he placed his mental state at issue because he never alleged that the sec conduct caused a psychological or mental injury.further,koch did not claim the sec conduct caused him to seek professional treatment from a psychotherapist and his complaint does not even contain a claim of emotional distress.
a review of koch complaint confirms this position.although koch did acknowledge in a deposition that he suffers from depression and he referred to stress and humiliation in his answers and supplemental answers to interrogatories,upon which the district court based its conclusion that koch had placed his mental condition in issue,those answers do not clearly make an allegation of,much less a claim to recovery for,emotional distress.
in its order denying koch motion for reconsideration,the district court did not indicate whether it was denying koch motion to withdraw any claim for emotional distress damages.the district court had,however,approved without modification the magistrate judge conclusion that koch mental state was in issue because he acknowledged suffering from depression.
before this court it is perfectly clear,even if it was not before the district court,that koch has abandoned any claim the district court may have thought he made for damages due to emotional stress.that does not,however,moot the district court decision and the sec argument that koch put his mental state in issue by acknowledging he suffers from depression.we therefore must decide whether a plaintiff puts his mental state in issue in such a way as to waive the privilege by acknowledging he suffers from depression.
