background 
roi is a private,regional community development and human services organization.its mission is to provide services to farm workers,families and depressed communities.roi principal office is located in rochester,new york,and it has an office in adjuntas,puerto rico.
in,roi was looking for a director of its puerto rico operations,and gómez was assisting roi in finding a candidate.during the process,lee beaulac,senior of housing and economic development for roi,approached gómez and asked her to take the position gómez was then years old.
at the time gómez was hired as director of roi puerto rico operations,she had a preexisting back problem.to accommodate her condition,roi allowed gómez,at her discretion,to work from home a few days per week and to work out of the adjuntas office a few days per week.when working in adjuntas,she stayed at a hotel at company expense.
in,gómez knew that the housing development program was demanding a great deal of her time and detracting from her ability to focus on other programs.she requested an additional person to staff the puerto rico division and to work as a housing developer.gómez had the task of reviewing applicants and interviewing candidates for the housing development position.this interview process began in december.in january,roger hernandez applied for the position.gómez interviewed hernandez and believed that he was qualified for the position.gómez identified four finalists for the position of those,she ranked hernandez highest and recommended that he be offered the position at a higher salary level than that which was initially posted.
around the time that hernandez applied for the position at roi,roi executive committee traveled to puerto rico to inspect the development sites under gómez authority.later in january,stuart mitchell,chief executive officer of roi,issued a memo to gómez and others that gave notice of a meeting scheduled for early february in rochester the purpose of the meeting was to conduct an internal audit of the puerto rico projects and programs.in preparation for this meeting,mitchell asked gómez,as well as each member of the staff responsible for administering,supervising and providing technical assistance to gómez or to the puerto rico programs,to compile a comprehensive list of all the issues that they had encountered with respect to the puerto rico operations.
the day before the meeting in rochester,mitchell provided gómez with a memorandum of issues raised by the staff concerning gómez performance.at the meeting,budget and project issues were discussed,as were issues related to gómez performance.the following areas of concern were articulated gómez and her staff did not communicate adequately with the rochester office gómez was making decisions without consulting rochester program managers there had been complaints about verbal abuse by gómez gómez instilled fear and anxiety in her staff roi puerto rico operations were not attaining program goals there were serious difficulties with three real estate development projects in puerto rico and there had been an overall failure of management.gómez disagreed with this assessment however,because she was embarrassed and did not wish to cause a scene,she decided not to contest the items during the meeting.
the following day,gómez was given a notice of disciplinary probation,which provided that she was being placed on probation in part because of n ot meeting expectations of the director for real estate development and other technical supervisors in regard to timely communication,effective and establishing meaningful levels of trust and confidence needed to insure that our programs and projects are managed properly.app.the notice also advised that management expected improvement in several areas,including 
immediate communication with jay golden telephone preferred,second choice or keith when any issue arises that could pose a problem for the is the essence of accountability and trust building.jay is the developer of record for all of the puerto rico projects and must be consulted whenever problems if you think you can resolve it you must communicate it to him immediately.if he is unavailable you call keith or stuart.if the issue is related to homeownership you would call jean lipani.
id.the notice also informed gómez that her job description would be changed to more accurately reflect her key areas of responsibility,and her job title would be changed to director of community development,puerto rico.id.gómez salary was not affected by either change.
on march,roi hired hernandez as director of housing development for puerto rico.in this position,hernandez assumed much of the responsibility for real estate projects that previously had been handled by gómez hernandez also reported directly to jay golden,roi senior director for real estate development.gómez was upset that hernandez was not going to report to her.
shortly after hernandez was hired,gómez visited a psychiatrist,jose nunez,because she felt desperate and harassed by roi.she attributed her anxiety to the rochester meeting,but did not know if her condition also might be related to a family history of mental illness.the following day,gómez requested a leave of absence for two weeks due to severe depression.mitchell told gómez to do whatever she needed to do in order to maintain her health.elizabeth scott,roi benefits administrator,sent gómez paperwork to begin a disability claim related to her depression.
later in march,gómez traveled to new jersey to take care of an emergency situation with her daughter.her daughter condition delayed gómez own recovery.as a result,gómez physician increased her dosage of medication and initially extended her rest period until april,and later to may.
nunez completed the physician section of gómez disability form on april.he indicated that gómez depression was.on the basis of this assessment,guardian life insurance company guardian,roi disability insurance provider,denied gómez disability claim.when scott received the denial from guardian,she informed gómez that,because her disability was,her claim had to be processed through puerto rico state insurance fund sif for worker compensation.
after being notified of the denial of her claim,gómez sent a letter to mary hanson,the senior of human resources for roi.in this letter,gómez articulated,for the first time,that she believed that she has been subjected to sex and age discrimination.specifically,she stated 
i had initiated the recruitment process for a developer a couple of months before and i had a pool of candidates and an agreed job description.i had interviewed the person hired before my visit to rochester,and though he honestly admitted not having substantial development experience in new york and no knowledge of the processes in puerto rico,i recommended him because he had enough background to accomplish what the original intention of that position was under my supervision and responsibility.
as it turns out,the developer was hired by rochester staff in substitution of myself and not as an assistant but as a peer director.his recruitment letter states clearly that i was to transition out of development and assist in administrative matters while he retains all responsibilities and duties related to development,including searching for new opportunities.
relieving me of the most important of the responsibilities that i had,and not allowing me to supervise this staff person is humiliating.due to the fact that this person accepts not having the development expertise or the knowledge of the puerto rico market and its housing development industry,the only conclusion that i can reach for being substituted is that i am being discriminated due to gender and age.
in addition to filing her internal complaint of discrimination,gómez pursued the disability claim,related to her depression,with the sif.in her claim,she identified the rochester meeting as the source of her depression.
on may,gómez sent an email to hanson and others at roi stating that she had visited the sif,which had notified her that she could not return to work until it had concluded the investigation of her claim.gómez informed roi that she could not afford to continue without her regular income and had decided to withdraw her claim.she indicated that she would return to work on may.hanson responded that the sif is now in control of the claim and informed gómez that she needed to obtain and submit a medical release prior to returning to work.app.on may,hanson reminded gómez that,prior to returning to work,she would need a release from her doctor and the sif clearance stating that her case was withdrawn 
on may,while gómez was on medical leave related to her depression,she suffered a setback related to her back condition.gómez informed scott that,as a result of this condition,she would not be able to return to work until june.gómez also completed a claim for disability benefits through guardian,and,on may,roi sent a letter to guardian submitting gómez new claim.on may,roi updated gómez on her new disability claim and informed her that guardian would not approve the new claim because she was currently on worker compensation leave.
on june,while gómez worker compensation claim still was pending,she informed mitchell that,although the crisis with her back condition had been stabilized,
i still can not conduct long drives within a period of three months specially sic,in the types of roads that comprise our service area.as per the agreements made upon my recruitment with roi,i request reasonable accommodation during such period.i can work the first weeks from home,and then i can travel one way and stay in adjuntas as before,then i can travel back another day.i can attend project meetings with roger.
app.hanson responded to gómez request accordingly 
regarding your request included in a letter to stuart mitchell dated june,you are requesting that you be allowed to work out of your home for three weeks and then to drive to the service area one day per week.at this time i am advised by housing management that this is not programmatically justifiable.if your neurologist is stating you can not drive long distances for three months then we must follow that advice.however,we are willing to discuss with you and consider other possibilities of reasonable accommodation.with this in mind,please let us know any other ideas,requests,suggestions you may have along the lines of reasonable accommodation which you feel will make it possible for you to perform the essential elements of your job in spite of the conditions which you are telling us that you have.we will consider them and respond to you.
while gómez was on leave,various projects had to be taken over by other staff members.at this time,roi discovered that,contrary to roi policy and specific directions given to gómez,gómez had established an unauthorized checking bank account apparently for the purpose of avoiding use of the roi financial system for receipt of donations to the corporation and processing payments.id.hanson sent a letter to gómez informing her that,i f true,this would be a serious breach of authority and that roi intend ed to investigate fully.id.in the same letter,roi asked gómez to explain in writing the purpose for this account at banco popular and if there exist any other accounts unknown to our chief financial officer that you established.id.
roi investigation of this situation revealed that an affiliate of roi,rural opportunities of puerto rico,ropri,with gómez knowledge and participation,had opened an bank account.prior to this action,gómez had received instructions that ropri could not have an bank account because roi financial processes were regulated strictly by federal and state law.gómez did not deny her involvement in the opening of the bank account or in the depositing of funds into that account.consequently,gómez was informed on august,that her employment was terminated.specifically,the termination letter stated 
it is evident to roi management that you established this account,and failed to disclose it,to avoid the roi financial accounting system.both of your supervisors,lee beaulac and keith scholes,state that on more than one occasion,when you would raise the subject with them,they specifically instructed you not to establish an island based checking account.once again,you refused to follow specific directions.
given this serious breach of procedure and your failure to in any way respond to our request for an explanation or to disclose any rationale for your actions,we have no option but to assume that you have no valid or acceptable explanation for creating the account and diverting funds made payable to roi.in combination with the numerous other performance issues we have previously detailed,i find you r performance unacceptable,in violation of several policies and warranting immediate termination.accordingly,we have no alternative but to terminate you effective the date of this letter.
district court proceedings 
gómez then brought this action,alleging that roi had discriminated against her on the basis of her gender,age and disability,had terminated her employment on these bases,and had violated erisa by denying her benefits.she and her husband also brought wrongful termination and damages claims.
roi moved for summary judgment with respect to the discrimination claims on the ground that gómez was not meeting roi legitimate expectations,and,therefore,she could not establish a prima facie case of discrimination.in the alternative,roi maintained that gómez could not show that the nondiscriminatory reason for her termination was pretextual.turning to the erisa claim,roi argued that gómez had not established that roi was a plan fiduciary and,therefore,had not established that roi could be held liable for failure to provide benefits under erisa.
the district court was persuaded by roi arguments and entered summary judgment on its behalf with respect to all of the federal claims it then dismissed,without prejudice,the plaintiffs pendent state claims.
discussion 
discriminatory discharge claims 
gómez first claims that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of roi on her discriminatory discharge claim.to set forth a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge under title vii,the plaintiff must show that she was within a protected class,she possessed the necessary qualifications and adequately performed her job,but was nevertheless dismissed and her employer sought someone of roughly equivalent qualifications to perform substantially the same work.caribbean forms,cir.the formulation for establishing a prima facie case of termination under the adea is only slightly different the plaintiff must establish that she was at least forty years old she was qualified for the position she had held she was fired and the employer subsequently filled the position,demonstrating a continuing need for the plaintiff services.vélez thermo king de,cir.if a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination based on sex or age,the burden of production shifts to the employer to come forward with a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its action.id.if the employer does so,the focus shifts back to the plaintiff,who must then show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the employer articulated reason for the adverse employment action is pretextual and that the true reason for the adverse action is discriminatory.lockridge of me,cir.
although the parties dispute whether gómez can establish a prima facie case of age or sex discrimination,their primary focus is on whether roi grounds for terminating gómez opening and use of the local ropri bank pretextual.we believe it both expeditious and appropriate under these circumstances to assume that gómez has made out a prima facie case in order to move on to the real issues in the case.garcía squibb,cir.indeed,we have observed that,o n summary judgment,the need to order the presentation of proof is largely obviated,and a court may often dispense with strict attention to the framework,focusing instead on whether the evidence as a whole is sufficient to make out a jury question as to pretext and discriminatory animus.fennell first step designs,cir.we turn,therefore,to gómez evidence that roi reason for terminating her employment was pretextual.
pretext can be shown by such weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted reasons.morgan hilti,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.gómez argues that it is implausible that the real reason roi terminated her employment was the opening of the island account because she had no power over the ropri board and,therefore,could not prevent this action.however,this fact is largely irrelevant.gómez was roi liaison to the ropri board and was responsible for providing them with assistance.she failed to advise the ropri board that its action in opening the island bank account was contrary to roi policies.after the ropri board voted to open the account,she failed to apprise roi headquarters that such a measure had been passed.finally,gómez participated in the opening of the account and directed that donations made to roi be deposited in that account.she did so knowing that,as an employee of roi,she was required to adhere to roi fiscal policies and procedures 
gómez further maintains that roi has offered differing or shifting justifications for its actions against her,which is sufficient evidence of pretext.see billings town of grafton,cir holding that a n employer different and arguably inconsistent explanations for its challenged employment action can serve as evidence of pretext quoting suttle caribe,cir.specifically,gómez argues that the reasons for terminating her employment set forth in the termination letter,signed by mitchell,differ from the reasons that mitchell articulated in his deposition.after reviewing the letter and the testimony,however,we conclude that they are entirely consistent with one another.the termination letter is two pages long and discusses,in depth,that gómez opened an island account for ropri,that she deposited roi donations into the ropri account,that she had been told previously not to open island accounts and that the opening of the account was in serious breach of roi fiscal policies.the letter concludes 
given this serious breach of procedure and your failure to in any way respond to our request for an explanation or to disclose any rationale for your actions,we have no option but to assume that you have no valid or acceptable explanation for creating the account and diverting funds made payable to roi.in combination with the numerous other performance issues we have previously detailed,i find you r performance unacceptable,in violation of several policies and warranting immediate termination.
app.this letter does not conflict in any way with mitchell deposition testimony that the reason that gómez was fired was the opening of the ropri bank account.app 
gómez also points to a number of other pieces of evidence that,she claims,establish that she was performing her job responsibilities to roi satisfaction.because roi was satisfied with her performance,she concludes that roi decision to terminate her employment must be pretextual.for instance,she points to evidence that roi initially was supportive of her hiring a real estate development project manager to work directly under her supervision,that she was making progress with some of her real estate projects and that she had a wealth of real estate experience from which hernandez could benefit,app.
gómez evidence misses the mark.roi terminated her employment because she committed a serious breach of policy in opening the ropri account and depositing roi funds into that account.evidence that,prior to this discovery,roi believed that gómez capably could supervise and train an additional employee or that gómez was making progress on some projects within the scope of her responsibility,is not inconsistent with,and does not undermine in any way,roi stated reason for terminating gómez employment.
because the evidence proffered by gómez does not raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to pretext,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on gómez discriminatory termination claims.
reasonable accommodation 
gómez next argues that roi violated the ada by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for her back condition.we have outlined the following elements of a prima facie case of failure to accommodate 
to survive a motion for summary judgment on a claim,a plaintiff ordinarily must furnish significantly probative evidence that he is a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the applicable statute that he works or worked for an employer whom the ada covers that the employer,despite knowing of the employee physical or mental limitations,did not reasonably accommodate those limitations and that the employer failure to do so affected the terms,conditions,or privileges of the plaintiff employment.
higgins new balance athletic shoe,cir.
the parties do not discuss these elements in detail.rather,they focus on whether gómez requested accommodation,following the aggravation of her back condition,was reasonable.gómez maintains that her request must be considered reasonable because it is identical to the accommodation request that she had made to roi when she first was hired,and roi had agreed to the accommodation at that time.appellants br.not only did appellee renege on the,initially,reasonable accommodation afforded to appellant,but he ignored and gave a halfhearted excuse that to do so,again,would not be programmatically justifiable an unexplained concept.
as a factual matter,however,gómez is incorrect.originally,roi agreed to allow gómez to work from her home a few days per week and to work out of the adjuntas office a few days per week.however,the new accommodation contemplated gómez spending only one day per week in adjuntas and traveling home the following day the original accommodation also did not permit gómez to work from home for weeks at a time without any travel however,this was an aspect of gómez later request.
gómez bears the burden of proof with respect to the elements of her claim.kvorjak maine,cir we recently have confirmed that the plaintiff bears the burden of proposing an accommodation that would enable him to perform his job effectively and is,at least on the face of things,reasonable.this necessarily entails a showing that the accommodation would effectively enable him to perform his job.internal quotation marks and citations omitted modifications in original higgins,at to survive a motion for summary judgment on a claim,a plaintiff ordinarily must furnish significantly probative evidence that the employer did not reasonably accommodate his limitations.because gómez has offered no other argument or evidence as to how the proposed accommodation,which involved her spending significantly less time at the adjuntas office,was reasonable,she has failed to meet her burden with respect to her ada claim.we therefore affirm the district court entry of summary judgment for roi on this claim.
erisa claim 
finally,gómez claims that roi is liable under a b because it wrongfully denied her disability claim.t he proper party defendant in an action concerning erisa benefits is the party that controls administration of the plan.terry bayer,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.there is an exception to this general rule if an entity or person other than the named plan administrator takes on the responsibilities of the administrator,that entity may also be liable for benefits.law ernst young,cir.however,the mere exercise of physical control or the performance of mechanical administrative tasks generally is insufficient to confer fiduciary status.beddall state bank trust,cir see also terry,at quoting a department of labor interpretive bulletin for the proposition that an entity which merely processes claims is not a fiduciary because such person does not have discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of the plan quoting.
in this case,roi established,through the deposition testimony of its benefits administrator,that it received gómez claims for disability benefits,completed the employer portion of the forms and passed on the forms to guardian,the plan administrator,to determine whether benefits would be paid.gómez did not come forward with any evidence that roi performed anything except ministerial functions in the processing of her disability claims.consequently,roi can not be held liable under erisa for the denial of gómez disability claims.
gómez claims that there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to her erisa claim.according to gómez,scott,the roi benefits administrator,lied under oath when she testified that she had filed the disability claim with guardian.app.as support for this assertion,gómez points to an email,which she included in the materials filed in opposition to roi motion for summary judgment.the email is dated,purportedly from marysol sanquiche,a customer service representative at guardian.the email reads as follows 
dear erick morales perez,

noviello city of boston,cir.the email submitted by gómez is not only hearsay,see,but also it is not,on its face,relevant,see,or based on the personal knowledge of the author,see.the email,therefore,can not be used to defeat roi motion for summary judgment.noviello,at.
conclusion 
gómez has failed to come forward with evidence establishing that her termination was pretextual.similarly,she has not come forward with evidence establishing that roi failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation or that roi was liable for any denial of disability benefits.we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment with respect to gómez federal claims 
more specific complaints included that gómez did not communicate voluntarily with the rochester staff unless she was under pressure or urgently needed something,that she missed conference calls with roi central staff and that gómez was difficult to get in touch with and,at times,unreachable.more specific complaints included that gómez did not communicate voluntarily with the rochester staff unless she was under pressure or urgently needed something,that she missed conference calls with roi central staff and that gómez was difficult to get in touch with and,at times,unreachable.
