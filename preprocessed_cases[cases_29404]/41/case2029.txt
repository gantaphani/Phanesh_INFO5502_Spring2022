background 
before,most abortions were surgical,performed by a procedure commonly known as vacuum aspiration or suction curettage.planned parenthood sw.ohio region dewine,cir.in,the federal drug administration fda first approved the use of medications to perform abortions.id.
medication abortion regimens 
the most common method of medication abortion employs a combination of two prescription drugs,mifepristone sometimes known as ru and misoprostol.mifepristone ends pregnancy by blocking the hormone progesterone,thereby causing the fertilized egg to detach from the uterine wall.misoprostol causes the uterus to contract and expel its contents.in,the fda approved mifepristone for use in medication abortions under the brand name mifeprex.the approved drug label for mifeprex described an regimen requiring a woman to take milligrams of mifepristone orally at a clinic,return to the clinic two days later to take micrograms of misoprostol orally,and return again for a visit.these three clinic visits are in addition to the visit arizona law requires for a woman to receive an consultation with her doctor at least hours before an abortion.see.clinical evidence submitted by mifeprex manufacturer established this regimen to be safe and effective through seven weeks of pregnancy,or days from the woman last menstrual period lmp.the fda has approved misoprostol only for the treatment of stomach ulcers.
when the fda approved mifepristone for use in abortions,it imposed restrictions on mifepristone marketing and distribution but not on its use under the fda subpart h regulations.see.these restrictions require the manufacturer to distribute mifepristone only to doctors who sign an agreement stating that he or she possesses the necessary qualifications and will adhere to the other requirements.one subpart h restriction requires doctors to agree to provide each patient a copy of the medication guide and patient agreement and obtain the patient signature on the patient agreement.in the patient agreement,the patient attests that she understand s the steps involved in the regimen.the patient agrees to follow my provider advice about when to take each drug.the subpart h restrictions,medication guide,and patient agreement do not require doctors to administer mifepristone according to the regimen.cline.coal.for reprod.justice,per curiam.
by the time the fda approved mifeprex label,studies already showed that a different regimen for medication abortion was safe and effective through nine weeks of pregnancy,or days lmp instead of days lmp.this regimen requires taking milligrams instead of milligrams of mifepristone orally at the clinic,taking micrograms of misoprostol two days later at home instead of at the clinic by dissolving the drug between the cheek and gum,and then returning to the clinic for a visit.consistent with common terminology,we call this regimen the regimen.richardson states in a sworn declaration that virtually all abortion providers now use the regimen.he further states,few if any providers use the method.the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists strongly favors the regimen over the regimen.brief for american college of obstetricians gynecologists and the american medical ass as amici curiae at.notably,the district court found that the regimen is 
considered the best practices by practicing doctors t here is a clear advantage to the current protocol because it may be used through the week of pregnancy,not just through the week,which is significant because many women do not discover their pregnancies until approximately days,which is the end of the week also,risk factors from medical abortions have been reduced or eliminated by the current regimen medication abortion now has a lower rate of ongoing pregnancies and fewer surgical interventions are necessary to complete the abortion procedure.
medication abortions now account for percent of all abortions performed at planned parenthood clinics nationwide.in in arizona,percent of all abortions performed during the first nine weeks of pregnancy were medication abortions.plaintiffs presented uncontroverted evidence in the district court that many women who choose medication abortion strongly prefer it over surgical abortion.medication abortion is less invasive than surgical abortion,which is a particularly important consideration for survivors of rape or sexual abuse.further,some women have medical conditions that make medication abortion significantly safer than surgical abortion.the district court found that medication abortion is extremely safe and safer than the alternative surgical procedure,which is also a very safe procedure.
since the fda approved mifepristone in,there have been eight known deaths from infection in women using earlier regimens a fatality rate of less than percent.the fda investigated these eight cases and found no causal connection between the infections and the use of mifepristone or misoprostol.a study conducted in surveyed the most recent six years of data and found no deaths out of medication abortions performed under the current regimen.james trussell et,reduction in infection related mortality since modifications in the regimen of medical abortion,contraception.
the regimen fails to terminate the pregnancy in about percent of cases,and as many as percent of women following the regimen require procedures to stop heavy bleeding caused by the medications.the regimen fails in about percent of cases,and fewer than percent of women require subsequent procedures.because of the larger dose of mifepristone required by the regimen,the drugs for the regimen cost more than for the evidencebased regimen.the regimen also increases costs by requiring an additional clinic visit.finally,the evidencebased regimen allows women to take misoprostol in their homes,eliminating the risk that they will pass their pregnancies,a process involving heavy bleeding and cramping,during their trip home from the second clinic visit.
fda approval 
when the fda approves a drug,it does so on the basis of evidence of clinical trials submitted by the drug manufacturer.the fda generally does not conduct its own trials.according to plaintiffs expert lisa rarick,who participated as an fda official in the approval process for mifepristone,the fda does not authorize protocols for drugs rather,approval of a drug allows the drug sponsor to advertise and promote the drug for a particular use.the drug manufacturer also submits a proposed label for approval.the label provides physicians with guidance about how to use a drug in accordance with how the drug sponsor requested and received fda approval for its use.the label does not impose binding obligations on physicians.the fda does not require a manufacturer to update a drug label for new uses or protocols,and there rarely are sufficient economic incentives for the manufacturer to do so.
according to rarick,the fda neither prohibit s nor discourage s use of drugs.in fact,the fda has repeatedly acknowledged that use is common and is sometimes required by good medical practice.in a fda drug bulletin,the fda stated 
the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act does not limit the manner in which a physician may use an approved drug.once a product has been approved for marketing,a physician may prescribe it for uses or in treatment regimens or patient populations that are not included in approved labeling.such unapproved or,more precisely,unlabeled uses may be appropriate and rational in certain circumstances,and may,in fact,reflect approaches to drug therapy that have been extensively reported in medical literature.
valid new uses for drugs already on the market are often confirmed by wellplanned and executed clinical investigations.before such advances can be added to the approved labeling,however,data substantiating the effectiveness of a new use or regimen must be submitted by the manufacturer to the fda for evaluation.this may take time and,without the initiative of the drug manufacturer whose product is involved,may never occur.for that reason,accepted medical practice often includes drug use that is not reflected in approved drug labeling.
fda drug bulletin.the fda has consistently maintained that position.see food drug,off label and investigational use of marketed drugs,biologics,and medical devices information sheet,regulatoryinformation.use of drugs is especially common in pediatrics,oncology,and gynecology and obstetrics.
arizona legislation 
in,the arizona legislature passed house bill,a collection of statutory amendments regulating abortion.the amendment at issue in this case regulates medication abortion.it provides 
the director of the arizona department of health services shall adopt rules relating to the abortion procedure.at a minimum these rules shall require t hat any medication,drug or other substance used to induce an abortion is administered in compliance with the protocol that is authorized by the united states f ood and d rug a dministration and that is outlined in the final printing labeling instructions for that medication,drug or substance.
e.defendant william humble,director of arizona department of health services,adopted an implementing regulation as required by the amendment.admin.code g.the regulation had an effective date of april.we refer to the amendment and regulation collectively as the arizona law.
the legislature described its purpose in passing the arizona law as p rotect ing women from the dangerous and potentially deadly use of drugs,such as,for example,mifepristone and e nsur ing that physicians abide by the protocol tested sic and approved by the united states food and drug administration for such drugs.the legislative findings describe various health risks from the use of mifepristone,including risks of infection and hemorrhage.the district court found that the arizona legislature provided no supporting evidence for any asserted legislative fact.the court observed that the risks associated with medication abortions,relied on by the state as the reason for adopting the protocol,have been substantially reduced or eliminated by the regimen.
challenge to the arizona law 
there are currently ten abortion providers in arizona,located in three of the state fifteen counties.planned parenthood arizona,ppaz,provides abortions at its clinics in glendale,tempe,tucson,and flagstaff.ppaz performs medication abortions according to the evidencebased regimen.the glendale,tempe,and tucson clinics provide both surgical and medication abortions.the flagstaff clinic provides only medication abortions.ppaz flagstaff clinic is the only abortion provider in northern arizona.the next closest provider is in glendale,which is located,on average,miles from locations in northern arizona it is miles away from some locations.in,ppaz provided abortions for women through days lmp.percent were medication abortions.percent of these medication abortions occurred after days lmp.because they occurred after days lmp,such abortions would not have been available if ppaz had been required to follow the regimen.
ppaz flagstaff clinic used to provide medication abortions through an advanced practice clinician instead of a doctor,but arizona banned that practice in.the flagstaff clinic could not provide abortions of any kind until february,when it found a doctor to perform medication abortions.during the period when the flagstaff clinic could not perform abortions,significantly fewer women in northern arizona obtained abortions than before.
richardson owns and operates tucson women center,where he provides surgical and medication abortions.richardson performs medication abortions according to the regimen.in,he provided abortions to women,of whom were nine weeks pregnant days lmp or less.of those women,percent chose medication abortion.
ppaz,richardson,and tucson women center sued director humble in his official capacity,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the arizona law.for convenience,we refer to the defendant as arizona.plaintiffs brought their claims on behalf of themselves,their patients,and the physicians they employ.see isaacson horne,cir,cert.denied.plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction,asserting that the arizona law is unconstitutionally vague,violates women fundamental rights to abortion and bodily integrity,and violates equal protection.the district court denied the motion.it found that the regimen is considered the best practices,and that arizona had not presented any evidence to support its legislative findings or to show that the law actually advances women health.it treated these findings as legally irrelevant.it held that the arizona law is not vague and does not violate equal protection or a woman right to bodily integrity.it held further that the law rationally advances arizona interest in women health and does not impose an undue burden on arizona women right to abortion.
plaintiffs timely appealed and filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal.a motions panel of this court enjoined enforcement of the arizona law pending appeal and expedited the appeal.see planned parenthood of,humble,cir,order granting emergency injunction.

success on the merits 
interpretation of the arizona law 
the parties disagree about the correct interpretation of the arizona law.plaintiffs argue that,under a proper reading of its text,the law flatly prohibits all medication abortions.arizona disagrees.it argues that the law allows medication abortions,but only if they are performed in accordance with the regimen.we need not resolve this dispute.we assume for the purposes of our analysis that arizona interpretation of the law is correct.
undue burden 
plaintiffs argue that the arizona law is unconstitutional because it imposes an undue burden on a woman right to abortion.see planned parenthood of se.casey.in casey,a plurality of the supreme court rejected both strict scrutiny and review of abortion regulations,holding instead that laws regulating abortions are unconstitutional if they impose an undue burden on a woman right to abortion.id.at.casey recognized that states have legitimate interests in maternal health and protecting fetal life that can,in some circumstances,justify regulations of abortion.tucson woman clinic eden,cir.the undue burden test seeks to balance those interests with a woman fundamental right to abortion.see id.the only interest arizona asserts in this case is its interest in women health.
our undue burden analysis starts with casey plurality opinion.see isaacson,at.the plurality explained,a finding of an undue burden is a shorthand for the conclusion that a state regulation has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.casey,at.of the four supreme court cases addressing abortion since casey,only gonzales carhart,provides meaningful guidance on how to apply casey undue burden test.ayotte planned parenthood of new england,addressing only the scope of equitable relief stenberg carhart,interpreting a statute in a way that the state conceded imposed an undue burden mazurek armstrong,per curiam addressing the evidence required to support a finding of improper legislative purpose.gonzales emphasized the balance struck by casey,holding that a state may regulat e the medical profession in order to promote respect for life,so long as the state does not act irrationally or impose an undue burden on a woman right to abortion.at.it held that a court reviewing an abortion regulation must determine whether the regulation furthers the legitimate interest of the government in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child.id.at.
the analysis in both casey and gonzales focused on state laws purporting to advance the state interest in fetal life.here,however,the arizona law purports to advance arizona interest in women health.we wrote in eden,
casey application of the undue burden standard is often not extendable in obvious ways to the context of a law purporting to promote maternal health.
in the context of a law purporting to promote fetal life,whatever obstacles that law places in the way of women seeking abortions logically serve the interest the law purports to promote fetal life because they will prevent some women from obtaining abortions.by contrast,in the context of a law purporting to promote maternal health,a law that is poorly drafted or which is a pretext for regulation can both place obstacles in the way of women seeking abortions and fail to serve the purported interest very closely,or at all.
at citations omitted.
in eden,we described our approach to applying casey undue burden test.under eden,we compare the extent of the burden a law imposes on a woman right to abortion with the strength of the state justification for the law.see id.at.the more substantial the burden,the stronger the state justification for the law must be to satisfy the undue burden test conversely,the stronger the state justification,the greater the burden may be before it becomes undue.on one extreme,eden described cases where a purported health regulation fails to rationally promote an interest in maternal health on its face.id.at.in such a case,the regulation fails even review,and the undue burden standard is not triggered at all.id.on the other extreme,laws that are harmless or that have only an incidental effect on abortion require little justification.mazurek,at casey,at.in cases between those two extremes,we must weigh the burdens against the state justification,asking whether and to what extent the challenged regulation actually advances the state interests.if a burden significantly exceeds what is necessary to advance the state interests,it is undue.see webster third new int l dictionary defining undue as excessive or unwarranted.
our approach in eden follows from casey,in which the plurality wrote that u nnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right.at emphasis added see eden,at relying on evidence that a regulation was unnecessary as a matter of public health.whether a regulation is necessary depends on whether and how well it serves the state interest.t he means chosen by the state to further the interest in potential life must be calculated to inform the woman free choice,not hinder it.casey,at.the same is true for laws purporting to protect women health they must be calculated to advance women health,not hinder it.id.
under this approach,the plurality in casey upheld a law requiring,with some exceptions,minors to get consent from their parents before obtaining an abortion.id.at.the plurality did so based on the state quite reasonable assumption that minors will benefit from consultation with their parents and that children will often not realize that their parents have their best interests at heart.id.at.at the same time,a majority of the court struck down a law requiring married women to get consent from their husbands.id.at.the court distinguished parental consent from spousal consent based on the state comparatively weaker justification in the second instance.while the state could assume that minors might not realize their own best interests,it could not adopt a parallel assumption about adult women.id.at.
similarly,the court in gonzales upheld the federal partial birth abortion ban act of only after finding that the act would advance the state interest in fetal life by encourag ing some women to carry the ir infant to full term,thus reducing the absolute number of abortions.at.importantly for this case,gonzales held that a court applying the undue burden test should not place dispositive weight on legislative findings.the court retains an independent constitutional duty to review factual findings where constitutional rights are at stake uncritical deference to the legislature factual findings in these cases is inappropriate.id.at.
in planned parenthood of wisconsin,van hollen,f d cir,the seventh circuit adopted an approach much like ours in eden.the court affirmed a preliminary injunction against a wisconsin law that required abortion providers doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital within thirty miles of the provider clinic.see id.at.the state only justification for the law was protection of women health.id.at.as in eden,the seventh circuit analyzed whether the wisconsin law actually advanced that interest and found,on the record before it,that the law did not.see id.at.the court wrote,the cases that deal with statutes sought to be justified on medical grounds require not only evidence that the medical grounds are legitimate but also that the statute not impose an undue burden on women seeking abortions.the feebler the medical grounds,the likelier the burden,even if slight,is to be undue in the sense of disproportionate or gratuitous.id.at citations omitted.
the district court in this case did not cite or discuss our decision in eden.it relied instead on decisions of the fifth and sixth circuits.see planned parenthood of greater.surgical health servs.abbott,wl,at cir,dewine,at opinion of mckeague.in applying the undue burden test,the fifth and sixth circuits consider the state justification only for the very limited purpose of applying review.once an abortion regulation survives review,these circuits pay no attention to whether the regulation has been shown actually to advance the state legitimate interests.in abbott,the fifth circuit held that courts may not consider the strength of the state justification,stating that an abortion regulation need only be supported by rational speculation.wl,at internal quotation marks omitted.in dewine,the sixth circuit analyzed whether an ohio abortion regulation was an undue burden without considering the strength of the state justification for the regulation.at.
we conclude that abbott and dewine are inconsistent with the undue burden test as articulated and applied in casey and gonzales.the fifth and sixth circuits approach fails to recognize that the undue burden test is,and that both the severity of a burden and the strength of the state justification can vary depending on the circumstances.see eden,at citing casey,at.we adhere to the approach in eden and van hollen,which requires us to weigh the extent of the burden against the strength of the state justification in the context of each individual statute or regulation.
we assume without deciding that the arizona law passes review and move directly to the application of the undue burden test.see eden,at.in order to show an undue burden,plaintiffs must show that,in a large fraction of the cases in which the law is relevant,it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman choice to undergo an abortion.id.at quoting casey,at alteration in eden.we limit our in
