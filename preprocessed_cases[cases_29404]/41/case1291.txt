this diversity jurisdiction case presents issues concerning federal preemption and sufficient pleading of a claim that she has been injured by a medical hip manufactured in violation of federal bausch appeals the district court dismissal of her case against defendants stryker corporation,hoc,and stryker ireland,collectively stryker,who have manufactured,distributed,and sold the hip replacement system the trident in the united states since.the trident is a class iii medical device under federal law,the class of devices that are most critical to human health and subject to the most extensive federal regulation.
bausch alleged that the defendants violated federal law in manufacturing the trident.the device was implanted in her body six days after the united states food and drug administration informed the defendants that a component of the trident hip system was adulterated and that the companies manufacturing processes failed to comply with federal standards.the trident implanted in bausch failed,requiring surgical removal and replacement of the product and leading to a host of serious and painful medical problems.the defendants later recalled a component of the trident bearing the same catalogue number as the one that had been implanted in bausch body.bausch brought this suit under illinois common law for negligence and strict liability for a defective product.
the district court granted motion to dismiss under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,holding that bausch common law claims were preempted by federal law.in an unusual step,the district court did not allow plaintiff a requested opportunity to amend her complaint,but immediately entered final judgment dismissing the action with prejudice.the district court then denied bausch motion to vacate the judgment and for leave to file an amended complaint.
we conclude that the district court erred.bausch claims that she was injured by defendants alleged violations of federal law are not preempted.her original complaint should not have been dismissed.even if the original complaint had been defective,the district court abused its discretion by dismissing the action with prejudice and denying bausch leave to file an amended complaint.we address first the preemption issue and then the pleading issues.
i.the scope of federal preemption for class iii medical devices 
the central issue in this appeal is whether federal law preempts product liability claims against manufacturers of class iii medical devices where a patient claims that she was harmed by the manufacturer violation of federal law.that statement of the issue may be a little startling.the idea that congress would have granted civil immunity to medical device manufacturers for their violations of federal law that hurt patients is,to say the least.nevertheless,manufacturers in this case and in others have asserted this theory of defense.as we explain below,the manufacturer theory tries to stretch the supreme court decisions in this field beyond the boundaries that were made clear in those decisions.medical device manufacturers who subject their class iii devices to the rigorous premarket approval process are protected by federal law from civil liability so long as they comply with federal law.that protection does not apply where the patient can prove that she was hurt by the manufacturer violation of federal law.we begin by analyzing defendants asserted defense of express preemption and then their defense of implied preemption.
express limited scope of 
defendants hip implants are so important to patients health that they are treated as class iii medical devices under the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act.class iii medical devices are those used in supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health and those that present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.a c.under the federal act,the food and drug administration fda subjects new class iii medical devices to a rigorous process of federal review for safety and effectiveness called premarket approval.see riegel medtronic,describing process and requirements.
the medical device amendments of to the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act include an express,but limited,preemption provision for product liability claims against manufacturers of class iii medical devices 
n o state or political subdivision of a state may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement which is different from,or in addition to,any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device,and which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.
the supreme court has twice addressed the limited scope of this preemption provision.its decisions show that plaintiff bausch has stated a legally viable claim based on alleged violations of federal law.first,in,the supreme court held that lawsuits brought under state law against medical device manufacturers who submit premarket notification to the process described not preempted by a when liability is premised on theories that the device was defective and unreasonably dangerous and that the manufacturer failed to use reasonable care in the device design,manufacture,assembly,and sale.medtronic,lohr.in,the supreme court held that lawsuits brought under state law against medical device manufacturers who obtain the full federal premarket approval are preempted by section a when liability is premised on violations of state law requirements that are in addition to or different from federal requirements regulating the devices.riegel,at.neither case held that state lawsuits premised on violations of federal law are preempted under section a.in fact,the court opinions in lohr and riegel expressly left the door open for state law claims based on violations of federal law.
in lohr,the court rejected a preemption defense as applied to another medical device pacemaker leads where the plaintiff based her claims on allegations that the manufacturer had violated federal regulations.the court explained that the federal preemption provision allows claims under a state common law based on the defendant violation of federal law 
nothing in denies florida the right to provide a traditional damages remedy for violations of duties when those duties parallel federal requirements.even if it may be necessary as a matter of florida law to prove that those violations were the result of negligent conduct,or that they created an unreasonable hazard for users of the product,such additional elements of the cause of action would make the state requirements narrower,not broader,than the federal requirement.while such a narrower requirement might be different from the federal rules in a literal sense,such a difference would surely provide a strange reason for finding of a state rule insofar as it duplicates the federal rule.the presence of a damages remedy does not amount to the additional or different requirement that is necessary under the statute rather,it merely provides another reason for manufacturers to comply with identical existing requirements under federal law.
lohr,at reversing dismissal of complaint.
the pacemaker leads at issue in lohr had not been approved through the fda premarket approval process.instead,the fda confirmed that the leads were substantially equivalent to a device that was already on the market through what is known as a premarket notification or k process.id.at.the section k process is less rigorous than the approval process,so much so that lohr held that such generally applicable standards are not requirements sufficient even to trigger preemption under section a.id.at.the court went on to explain that section a does not preempt state rules that merely duplicate federal requirements.id.at.thus,the above quoted language in lohr discussing parallel claims also applies to products that have gone through premarket approval.
nothing in the more recent riegel case calls into question the ability of a patient to sue a class iii device manufacturer under state law for violations of federal law.in fact,the riegel court went out of its way to explain that such claims are not preempted.because the case is so central,we consider it in some detail.
in riegel,the plaintiffs alleged that a medical device that failed was designed,labeled,and manufactured in breach of duties imposed by state common law,and that the defects caused the plaintiffs to suffer severe and permanent injury.riegel,u.at.the district court held that section preempted the plaintiffs claims of strict liability,breach of implied warranty,and negligence in the design,testing,inspection,distribution,labeling,marketing and sale of the device.id.at.the district court also held that section preempted the riegels negligent manufacturing claim,but only to the extent that the claim was not premised on the theory that medtronic had violated federal law.id.at.
but the district court had allowed the riegels to go forward on claims that medtronic was negligent in manufacturing by failing to comply with federal standards and had breached an express warranty.those claims were not preempted by section.the district court later granted summary judgment on those claims,apparently on the merits,and those claims,which were essentially identical to plaintiff bausch claims for these purposes,were not before the supreme court.see id.at.
on review,the supreme court held that the premarket approval process imposed federal requirements that triggered the preemption clause of section.id.at.the court further held that the tort duties implicit in a finding of liability under the common law claims brought by the riegels would also constitute requirements under section.id.at.ultimately,the court concluded that,to the extent the state tort law underlying the riegels claims would require a manufacturer device to be safer but perhaps less effective than the model device approved by the fda,those requirements would disrupt the federal scheme no less than state regulatory law to the same effect.id.at.thus,the court found that the state requirements implicit in the riegels common law claims were different from or in addition to the federal requirements and were preempted under section.
the riegel court took care,however,to limit its holding to claims that the device at issue violated state tort law notwithstanding compliance with the relevant federal requirements.at emphasis added.the court gave lower courts clear instructions to allow claims to proceed when they are based on claimed violations of federal law does not prevent a state from providing a damages remedy for claims premised on a violation of fda regulations the state duties in such a case parallel,rather than add to,federal requirements.id.that passage in riegel quoted the portion of lohr that we quoted above.see at.
the supreme court thus has made clear that section protects a medical device manufacturer from liability to the extent that it has complied with federal law,but it does not extend protection from liability where the claim is based on a violation of federal law.in other words,where state law is parallel to federal law,section does not preempt the claim.
consistent with lohr,we held in mcmullen medtronic,inc,cir,quoting bates dow agrosciences llc,that state requirements are not expressly preempted under where the plaintiff can show that the requirements are genuinely equivalent.we said that where there are both state and federal requirements to the same effect,then the state requirements will not be different from,or in addition to,the federal requirements.id.at see also chambers osteonics,cir medical device amendments did not preempt state law claim based on manufacturing defect resulting from violation of fda requirements mitchell collagen,cir negligence claims not preempted if based on claims that manufacturer did not adhere to fda standards in the premarket approval process.nothing in riegel changes our view that state law claims based on violations of federal law are not expressly preempted by section.
in this case,the district court erred by dismissing as preempted plaintiff common law claims based upon alleged violations of federal law.the district court thought riegel and lohr would leave room for a claim based on a state regulatory enactment,but that common law claims would be different from or in addition to federal law and thus would be preempted.bausch stryker,wl,at.that analysis overlooked the supreme court rejection in lohr and riegel of precisely that argument against common law claims.as the passage quoted above begins nothing in denies florida the right to provide a traditional damages remedy for violations of duties when those duties parallel federal requirements.at.
illinois treats a violation of a statute or ordinance designed to protect human life or property as prima facie evidence of negligence,though the violation may not always be conclusive on the issue of negligence.see,kalata companies,violation of public safety ordinance regulating handrails is prima facie evidence of negligence batteast wyeth laboratories,violation of safety statute is prima facie evidence of negligence if law designed to protect class to which plaintiff belongs and injury has direct,proximate connection with regulation barthel illinois central gulf railroad,citing davis marathon oil,a defendant violation of a statute designed to protect human life or property is ordinarily prima facie evidence of negligence first national bank in dekalb city of aurora,citing violation of ordinances regulating street and sidewalk safety was sufficient to state a cause of action hartje moxley,driving at prohibited rate of speed is prima facie evidence of negligence.
section provides immunity for manufacturers of new class iii medical devices to the extent that they comply with federal law,but it does not protect them if they have violated federal law.just as a plaintiff in an auto accident may use the other driver speeding violation as evidence of negligence,plaintiff bausch claims that she was injured by stryker violations of federal law in manufacturing the device implanted in her hip.it remains to be seen whether she can prove those allegations,including causation and damages.but if she can prove those allegations of harm caused by violations of federal law,her claims under state law would not impose on defendants any requirement different from,or in addition to,any requirement imposed by federal law.her claims are not preempted.
our conclusion that plaintiff bausch claims for defective manufacture in violation of federal law are not expressly preempted by section is consistent with the supreme court decisions in lohr and riegel,and also with numerous circuit and district court decisions that have considered similar claims based on alleged violations of federal law.see mcmullen,at chambers,at mitchell,at howard sulzer orthopedics,fed.appx.cir unpublished opinion hofts howmedica osteonics,d,prudhel endologix,wl,horowitz stryker,d purcel advanced bionics,wl,rollins jude medical,d walker medtronic,wl.we have not been directed to any federal decisions,other than the district court in this case,that adopted the broad view of section preemption argued by the defendants.
a few days before oral argument in this case,the eighth circuit decided in re medtronic,sprint fidelis leads products liability litigation,cir medtronic leads,one of only two circuit court cases to have applied riegel to medical device preemption the other is howard sulzer orthopedics.a divided panel of the eighth circuit affirmed dismissal of the plaintiffs manufacturing defect claims on the basis of express preemption.the majority properly left open some possibility for parallel claims not preempted by section.the court noted,for instance,that there is a narrow gap through which a plaintiff claim must fit if it is to escape express or implied preemption.medtronic leads,at,quoting riley cordis,d,d.the majority affirmed dismissal of the manufacturing defect claims,however,because as pleaded and argued to the district court,plaintiffs had failed to identify specific violations of federal law but had mounted instead a frontal assault on the fda decision to approve the device.id.at.while the case might well be distinguishable from our case based on the medtronic leads plaintiffs deliberate decision not to seek discovery and to assert claims for patients whose devices had not failed,we essentially agree with judge melloy dissent in medtronic leads.judge melloy argued that the plaintiffs could not be expected to plead their claims with greater specificity without discovery to obtain access to confidential government and company documents.at melloy,dissenting.
defendants argue in the alternative that if a common law claim can survive their preemption defense,the plaintiff must allege and prove a violation of a concrete,federal regulation.the issue is important because manufacturers of class iii medical devices are required by federal law to comply with quality system regulations established by the fda.the quality system regulations also set forth current good manufacturing practices.a.many writers refer to these as qsrs and cgmps.in this already environment,we prefer not to use the short versions.
defendants contend that the quality system regulations and current good manufacturing practices are too general to allow juries to enforce them.some federal courts have adopted this approach in the wake of riegel.see,horowitz,d at,quoting in re medtronic.sprint fidelis leads products liability,d,plaintiff claims were simply too generic,standing alone to serve as basis for claim,aff,cir ilarraza medtronic,d,the intentionally vague and nature of the regulations relied upon is the precise reason why they can not serve as the basis for a parallel claim.the sixth circuit has rejected this approach.see howard,fed.appx.at reversing summary judgment on preemption grounds,concluding that the current good manufacturing practices are not so vague as to be incapable of enforcement.
like the sixth circuit in howard,we do not see a sound legal basis for defendants proposal to distinguish between general requirements and concrete,requirements.section makes preemption a defense if a state seeks to impose on a manufacturer any requirement which is different from,or in addition to,any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device,and which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.a.we emphasize the phrase any requirement.and federal law is clear for manufacturers of class iii medical devices,the quality system regulations and current good manufacturing practices adopted by the fda under its delegated regulatory authority are legally binding requirements under this chapter.the failure to comply with any applicable provision in this part of the regulations renders a device adulterated under section h of the act.such a device,as well as any person responsible for the failure to comply,is subject to regulatory action.c.
defendants proposed distinction between concrete,requirements and more general requirements would also leave injured patients without any remedy for a wide range of harmful violations of federal law.the fda regulations contain many requirements that are not concrete or,yet which are obviously vital to producing safe and effective medical devices.for example,the regulations require each manufacturer to establish and maintain procedures to prevent contamination of equipment or product by substances that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on product quality,e,and to establish and maintain procedures for the use and removal of manufacturing material such as lubricants or abrasives,or cleaning and disinfectant agents to ensure that it is removed or limited to an amount that does not adversely affect the device quality.h.if a patient were harmed by an implanted hip replacement system that was contaminated,for example,by a production worker blood or mucus or by a lubricant or abrasive that caused an infection after implantation,that contamination would present a substantial claim for violating requirements that are not concrete and,yet which surely are essential for the manufacture of safe and effective medical devices for implantation in the human body.see howard,fed.appx.at reversing summary judgment for manufacturer when lubricant used in manufacturing had been left on knee replacement implanted in plaintiff.
we also assume that manufacturing processes are not perfect,despite what may be the best human efforts to achieve perfection.perhaps more to the point,the fda makes the same assumption,as is evident from its quality system regulations and current good manufacturing process requirements.the fda regulations require each manufacturer to put in place processes to test products for compliance with product specifications,to check and document compliance with product specifications before products are accepted for sale and use,and to identify and control nonconforming products.to.plaintiff bausch amended complaint alleges that the fda found that the defendants had failed to comply with section regarding nonconforming products,and that the product implanted in plaintiff bausch failed to comply with product specifications as approved by the fda through the premarket approval process.
we recognize the possibility that there may be some room for interpretation of the applicable federal requirements,and it is at least conceivable that a jury deciding a common law claim might apply those requirements more stringently than the fda intended.that danger is defendants best argument in favor of their distinction between general requirements and concrete,requirements.we are not persuaded.first,the meaning of the fda requirements will present questions of law for the court to decide,not questions of fact for a jury to decide.second,those questions of law will be questions of federal law,subject to the usual processes for reconciling conflicting views.third,the proposed distinction between general requirements and concrete,requirements seems to us more slippery and less workable than its proponents acknowledge.and fourth,for the reasons we have explained above,we believe the proposed distinction can not be derived from the language of the statutory preemption provision or from its purpose,to provide preemption for medical device manufacturers to the extent they actually comply with stringent requirements of federal law.plaintiff bausch claims are not expressly preempted by federal law to the extent they are based on defendants violations of federal law.
implied preemption 
we turn now to the defendants argument on appeal that bausch amended complaint is not only expressly preempted but impliedly preempted under buckman plaintiffs legal committee.the defendants argue specifically that implied preemption is necessary to maintain the statutory and regulatory framework under which the fda pursues difficult and often competing objectives for medical devices,such as ensuring the safety and efficacy of the devices while ensuring that the devices are available to those who need them,and that bausch claims are impliedly preempted because they conflict with the fda regulatory regime.id.at.they extract language from buckman to conclude that congress clearly provided that the food,drug,and cosmetic act and the medical device amendments should be enforced exclusively by the federal government and that only the fda can enforce the regulations on which bausch claims are based.see id.at.this argument is not convincing.
in buckman,patients claimed to have suffered injuries from implantation of orthopedic bone screws into their spines.the patients brought suit alleging that a regulatory consultant to the manufacturer made fraudulent representations to the fda in the course of obtaining approval to market the screws.the supreme court held that the food,drug,and cosmetic act as amended by the medical devices amendments impliedly preempted the patients state law fraud claims because the claims conflicted with federal law.the court concluded that the federal statute empowers the fda to deter and punish fraud and that the balance sought by the administration can be skewed by allowing claims under state tort law.id.at.but the buckman court specifically distinguished such claims,claims not related to a field of law that states had traditionally occupied,from claims based on state law tort principles such as in silkwood,and lohr itself.in contrast to situations implicating federalism concerns and the historic primacy of state regulation of matters of health and safety,as in lohr,at,no presumption against obtains in this case.id.
bausch claims,like those in lohr,and unlike those in buckman,are tort law claims based on manufacturing defects,not fraud on a federal agency.for these claims,as both buckman and lohr make clear,we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.lohr,at,quoting rice santa fe elevator.here we look to the express preemption provision,and we find no indication that congress intended preemption of state claims based on violations of federal law,beyond the limitations set forth in the express preemption clause as discussed above.an express preemption provision does not bar the ordinary working of conflict preemption principles,geier american honda motor,but we see no way in which bausch claims conflict with the federal regulations,and thus no reason for them to be impliedly preempted.
the defendants argue that bausch claim that the medical device was adulterated must be impliedly preempted because there is simply no state tort duty to manufacture a product that is not adulterated.we disagree.the mda defines an adulterated device as a device not in conformity with applicable requirements or conditions.h.while there may not be a traditional state tort law claim for an adulterated product in so many words,the federal definition of adulterated medical devices is tied directly to the duty of manufacturers to avoid foreseeable dangers with their products by complying with federal law.the evidence showing a violation of federal law shows that the device is adulterated and goes a long way toward showing that the manufacturer breached a duty under state law toward the patient.
finally,the defendants point to the eighth circuit opinion in medtronic leads,one of two cases from other circuits that address the application of riegel to claims that medical device manufacturers violated federal law.there the court upheld the district court dismissal of all claims related to a class iii medical device on the basis of express and implied preemption.the court concluded that there is only a narrow gap through which a plaintiff state law claim may fit to escape express or implied preemption.medtronic leads,at,quoting riley,d at.the plaintiff must be suing for conduct that violates the food,drug,and cosmetic act or else his claim is expressly preempted by a,but the plaintiff must not be suing because the conduct violates the food,drug,and cosmetic act such a claim would be impliedly preempted under buckman.id.regardless of how wide or narrow the gap may seem,the eighth circuit comment was reflecting the limits of both buckman and lohr.the plaintiffs in buckman who claimed that the manufacturer had defrauded the federal agency did not have an implied right of action under federal law,and they were not claiming the breach of a recognized duty for their benefit.here,as in lohr and as recognized in riegel,the plaintiff claims breach of a duty owed to her under state duty of a manufacturer to use due care in manufacturing a medical device.she may do so as long as she can show that she was harmed by a violation of applicable federal law.her claim is not impliedly preempted by federal law.
ii.pleading parallel medical device claims 
beginning from the premise that federal law does not preempt parallel claims under state law based on a medical device manufacturer violation of federal law,we turn to the problem of how difficult it is to plead such a claim sufficiently to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.there are no special pleading requirements for product liability claims in general,or for class iii medical device claims in particular.the federal standard of notice pleading applies,so long as the plaintiff alleges facts sufficient to meet the new plausibility standard applied in iqbal and twombly.see ashcroft iqbal,to survive a motion to dismiss,the complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged,quoting bell atlantic twombly.
in applying that standard to claims for defective manufacture of a medical device in violation of federal law,moreover,district courts must keep in mind that much of the information about manufacturing needed to investigate such a claim fully is kept confidential by federal law.formal discovery is necessary before a plaintiff can fairly be expected to provide a detailed statement of the specific bases for her claim.accordingly,the district court erred in this case by dismissing plaintiff original complaint and by denying her leave to amend her complaint.
a.the original complaint 
bausch original complaint asserted claims under illinois law for strict product liability and negligence.because the appeal is from the grant of a motion to dismiss under rule b,we must accept as true bausch allegations.see,bonte bank,cir.
according to the original complaint,the defendants manufacture the trident brand hip replacement system.it is a class iii medical device subject to the authority of the fda.plaintiff had right total hip replacement surgery on march,in which a trident device was implanted.the original complaint alleged that the trident product was unreasonably dangerous,causing plaintiff to suffer an unstable right hip,pain,suffering,disability,and what is euphemistically called revision bausch case a second major operation in which the trident product was removed and replaced with a different product.
the original complaint also alleged facts indicating that defendants knew,or at least should have known,before plaintiff original surgery that the trident implanted in her was defective.according to the original complaint,by early,the defendants received complaints that the trident was failing after it was implanted.defendants recalled a batch of trident components in march because of dimensional anomalies.the fda conducted an inspection at the defendants ireland manufacturing facility from october to november,and,following the inspection,informed the defendants of numerous deficiencies in the trident manufacturing and inspection processes.six days before plaintiff bausch surgery,after several months of inadequate response to the fda findings by the defendants,the fda issued a letter to defendants on march,warning that the trident was adulterated due to manufacturing methods not in conformity with industry and regulatory standards.a device,bearing the same catalogue number as the device allegedly not in compliance with regulations,was then implanted in bausch body the next week.the device in bausch body failed and the same device was later recalled.
the original complaint served the purposes of rule of giving the defendants fair notice of the nature of the claim against them and of stating a claim for relief that was plausible on its face as required by iqbal and twombly.in deciding whether a complaint can survive a motion to dismiss,we have consistently said as a general rule notice pleading remains the standard.windy city metal fabricators supply,cit tech.financial services,cir.pursuant to rule,pleading is meant to focus litigation on the merits of a claim rather than on technicalities that might keep plaintiffs out of court.brooks ross,cir,quoting swierkiewicz sorema.we give the plaintiff the benefit of imagination,so long as the hypotheses are consistent with the complaint.bissessur indiana.bd.of,cir,quoting sanjuan american bd.of psychiatry and neurology,cir.together
