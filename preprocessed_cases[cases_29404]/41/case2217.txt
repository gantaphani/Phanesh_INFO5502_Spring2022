we must decide whether the district court properly affirmed the commissioner denial of social security disability insurance benefits in this case.
carmickle alleges disability and seeks benefits under the social security act,due primarily to a back injury caused by a july accident.in his fifties,carmickle has an education with some college classes,and his past work experience includes construction worker,auto salesperson,construction supervisor,and counter salesperson.a few weeks before his accident,carmickle was examined by ganjanan nilaver and reported a history of neck and back injuries and chronic back pain.nilaver concluded that carmickle would benefit from physical therapy,but that he could perform sedentary activities.
after his work injury,carmickle went to the emergency room complaining of lower back pain.he did not mention his accident.carmickle was diagnosed with left sciatica and mild lumbar degenerative joint disease,but lumbar disc disease was ruled out.a few months later,he was examined by kevin kane,an osteopath.carmickle told kane that he believed his onset of pain was caused by the accident.kane diagnosed moderate to severe degenerative disc disease in the lumbar region,but he did not believe it was related to the injury.kane noted degenerative lumbar spondylosis and disc disease,and he recommended physical therapy and provided a work excuse for two weeks.kane noted carmickle does have significant low back disability,and it is clear he did not tolerate return to sedentary or light work.
a few weeks after kane examination,carmickle was examined by victoria carvalho.carmickle again reported the injury and complained of pain despite chiropractic treatment and physical therapy.although he stated that he was unable to sit or stand for more than five to ten minutes,carvalho noted that carmickle sat in her office for at least half an hour.she diagnosed lumbosacral sprain secondary to the reported work injury and she prescribed relafen and a moist heating pad.she also recommended neck and back exercises and gave carmickle a work excuse.
carmickle filed a workers compensation claim with the state of oregon based on the july accident.in november,two physicians performed a joint independent medical evaluation in connection with this claim.both doctors diagnosed multilevel lumbar degenerative disease and concluded that the lumbar strain was medically stationary and created no permanent impairment.the physicians also noted that,despite his claims of pain,carmickle s at comfortably during the interview portion of the examination and d id not appear to have any difficulty sitting or with any change of position.
in december,michael horowitz,an osteopath,recommended that carmickle use a reclinable desk chair while working.
mark patton,also an osteopath,treated carmickle between december and november.in december,patton diagnosed an disc bulge with the possibility of spinal stenosis.he recommended walking or stretching every minutes and no prolonged sitting.shortly thereafter,patton noted carmickle decreased sensation in the left foot and diagnosed peripheral neuropathy.patton opined that carmickle would be better off in a job where he is up moving rather than a sit down job.
in january,carmickle had an mri which showed no spinal stenosis or significant nerve root impairment.patton summarized carmickle condition,stating that the only major functional limitation currently is the inability to sit for prolonged periods without developing numbness of his foot.several months later,he observed localized tenderness and swelling consistent with chronic muscle strain and recommended that carmickle have a relafen injection.carmickle declined.
a few months later,patton again recommended an injection after noticing carmickle peripheral extremities showed signs of chronic peripheral vascular disease and that carmickle was still experiencing tenderness.again,carmickle declined.patton reported that although relafen typically has not been covered by carmickle insurance,it has been the only thing that has provided significant relief without addiction potential or intolerable side effects.patton further opined that carmickle likely is incapable of returning to construction work due to his health problems,but a retraining program is certainly a viable alternative.patton agreed with horowitz recommendation that carmickle use a reclinable chair for work.
in addition to his back impairments,carmickle also alleges that he suffers from mental impairments.in september,he complained of worsening memory loss,lethargy,and possible depression.patton reported that carmickle zung profile was normal,but that he displayed a flat affect.at this same time,patton diagnosed tendonitis after an of carmickle elbows showed bilateral bone spurs.
carmickle filed his application for disability insurance benefits in may.in november,carmickle had a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.carmickle was represented by counsel and he testified on his own behalf.medical expert me william debolt,and vocational expert ve patricia ayerza also testified at the hearing.lay witness tom tucker submitted a statement on carmickle behalf.after the hearing,the alj concluded that carmickle does have severe impairments,but that he is not entitled to disability benefits because he retains the residual functional capacity rfc to perform his past relevant work as a construction supervisor and counter salesperson.the appeals council denied review and adopted the alj decision as the final decision of the commissioner on august.carmickle sought review in the district court pursuant to g,and the district court affirmed the alj.this appeal followed.
the district court properly affirms the commissioner decision denying benefits if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on the application of correct legal standards.sandgathe chater,cir per curiam.substantial evidence means more than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.andrews shalala,cir.
a claimant is entitled to social security disability benefits only if he suffers from a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that prevents him from performing his prior work activities and any other substantial gainful employment that exists in the national economy.tackett apfel,cir citing d a.the social security administration employs a sequential analysis to determine disability.id.here,carmickle contends the agency erred in finding him not disabled because the alj erroneously a rejected his testimony and the lay witness testimony as not fully credible,b rejected some of the medical evidence,and c classified his prior relevant work as a construction supervisor and counter salesperson.we address each issue in turn.
the alj found carmickle testimony not entirely credible in light of the treatment record and his daily activities.carmickle had testified that he is in constant pain due to his back condition and that he can not sit or stand for more than minutes at a time.he stated that when sitting,he has to change positions constantly.he also stated that his lifting ability is significantly limited and that he can lift only between and pounds occasionally.the alj concluded carmickle allegations regarding his condition are inconsistent with his college attendance,his receipt of unemployment benefits,his minimal pain treatment regime,and patton opinion that carmickle can lift pounds frequently and pounds occasionally.the district court,addressing only the first and fourth inconsistencies,affirmed the alj adverse credibility assessment.in doing so,however,the district court concluded the clear and convincing reasons standard we established in lester chater,cir,did not apply,but rather,that the alj need only identify what testimony is not credible and what evidence undermines carmickle complaints.
we have consistently held that where the record includes objective medical evidence establishing that the claimant suffers from an impairment that could reasonably produce the symptoms of which he complains,an adverse credibility finding must be based on clear and convincing reasons.lingenfelter astrue,cir quoting smolen chater,cir.the only time this standard does not apply is when there is affirmative evidence that the claimant is malingering.greger barnhart,cir morgan comm r of soc.sec,cir 
here,the alj did not find that carmickle is malingering and we see no affirmative evidence of such.rather,the district court,relying on swenson sullivan,cir,concluded that carmickle alleged symptoms are not medically related because he is not alleging that his symptoms are somehow more disabling to him than to others.as just stated,the standard applies only where objective medical evidence establishes that the claimant suffers from an impairment that could reasonably be expected to cause the symptoms of which he complains.smolen,at.once such an impairment is established,however,the claimant reasonably expected symptoms are deemed medically related.in smolen,we explained 
the claimant need not produce objective medical evidence of the symptom itself,or the severity thereof.nor must the claimant produce objective medical evidence of the causal relationship between the medically determinable impairment and the symptom.by requiring that the medical impairment could reasonably be expected to produce pain or another symptom,the cotton bowen,cir test requires only that the causal relationship be a reasonable inference,not a medically proven phenomenon.
id.at citations omitted.
in support of its decision that specific testimony from carmickle was required before the standard would apply,the district court relied on our statement in swenson that i f a claimant submits objective medical findings of an impairment that would normally produce a given symptom,but testifies that he experiences the symptom to a greater degree than would normally be expected,the secretary may disbelieve that but must make specific findings justifying his decision.at.this principle remains good law,but it does not apply here.swenson addresses only how the alj must treat a claimant excess symptom testimony.id.it does not establish a standard for assessing the claimant testimony generally.and it does not establish the standard for determining whether a claimant alleged symptoms are medically related.on that point,our smolen line of cases controls.
here,carmickle has shown that he suffers from a back impairment that could reasonably be expected to produce back pain and reduced mobility.thus,his subjective testimony about his back pain can be rejected only for clear and convincing reasons.
accordingly,our next task is to determine whether the alj adverse credibility finding of carmickle testimony is supported by substantial evidence under the standard.the alj rejected carmickle assertion that he has to change positions constantly when sitting,finding it inconsistent with carmickle college attendance.when discussing his school attendance,carmickle stated that he has trouble sitting through the classes that are a little bit longer.he also indicated that propping his feet up or leaning forward helps relieve his discomfort.he did not state,however,that he constantly adjusts his position while sitting in class.rather,when pressed by counsel,he admitted that he can sit for a bout minutes in one particular position.the alj included this limitation in his rfc assessment,and on this record,we conclude this interpretation of the evidence is reasonable and we will not it.rollins massanari,cir 
the alj also rejected carmickle testimony that he can lift only pounds occasionally in favor of patton contradictory opinion that he can lift up to pounds frequently.contradiction with the medical record is a sufficient basis for rejecting the claimant subjective testimony.johnson shalala,cir.thus,we conclude that both of these reasons relied on by the alj are supported by substantial evidence in the record.
the alj also gave less weight to carmickle testimony because he received unemployment benefits during the time he alleges disability and because he took only ibuprofen to treat his pain.first,while receipt of unemployment benefits can undermine a claimant alleged inability to work fulltime,see copeland bowen,cir accord schmidt barnhart,cir recognizing receipt of unemployment benefits could impact a claimant disability claim,the record here does not establish whether carmickle held himself out as available for or work.only the former is inconsistent with his disability allegations.thus,such basis for the alj credibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence.
second,although a conservative course of treatment can undermine allegations of debilitating pain,such fact is not a proper basis for rejecting the claimant credibility where the claimant has a good reason for not seeking more aggressive treatment.orn astrue,cir.carmickle testified that he does not take other pain medication because of adverse side effects.in,he also indicated that he would prefer to take relafen,which was prescribed by patton,but his insurance does not cover this medication.both of these assertions are supported by patton treatment notes,which state prior auth sic is filled out for his relafen which typically has not been covered,but,unfortunately,has been the only thing that has provided significant relief without addiction potential or intolerable side effects.on this record,carmickle minimal treatment regime is not a proper basis for finding him.
because we conclude that two of the alj reasons supporting his adverse credibility finding are invalid,we must determine whether the alj reliance on such reasons was harmless error.see batson comm r of soc.sec,cir applying harmless error standard where one of the alj several reasons supporting an adverse credibility finding was held invalid.our decision in batson makes clear that reviewing the alj credibility determination where the alj provides specific reasons supporting such is a substantive analysis.so long as there remains substantial evidence supporting the alj conclusions on credibility and the error does not negate the validity of the alj ultimate credibility conclusion,such is deemed harmless and does not warrant reversal.id.at see also stout,at defining harmless error as such error that is inconsequential to the ultimate nondisability determination.
contrary to the dissent assertion,the relevant inquiry in this context is not whether the alj would have made a different decision absent any error,see dissent at,it is whether the alj decision remains legally valid,despite such error.in batson,we concluded that the alj erred in relying on one of several reasons in support of an adverse credibility determination,but that such error did not affect the alj decision,and therefore was harmless,because the alj remaining reasoning and ultimate credibility determination were adequately supported by substantial evidence in the record.at.we never considered what the alj would do if directed to reassess credibility on focused on whether the error impacted the validity of the alj decision.id.likewise,in stout,after surveying our precedent applying harmless error in social security cases,we concluded that in each case,the alj error was inconsequential to the ultimate nondisability determination.at emphasis added.
our specific holding in stout does require the court to consider whether the alj would have made a different decision,but significantly,in that case the alj failed to provide any reasons for rejecting the evidence at issue.see id.at see also robbins,at citing stout and concluding alj failure to consider lay testimony was not harmless error.there was simply nothing in the record for the court to review to determine whether the alj decision was adequately supported.here,however,as in batson,the alj considered carmickle testimony and provided specific reasons for finding him less than fully credible.thus,there is a basis for the court to review the alj decision,and the analysis set forth in batson,rather than stout,controls and as just discussed,in batson we focused on the validity of the alj underlying decision,and not necessarily on whether the alj would come out differently if the case were remanded after error was identified by the court 
here,the alj decision finding carmickle less than fully credible is valid,despite the errors identified above.the alj did not wholly reject carmickle allegations indeed,the rfc assessment is largely consistent with his testimony.and,as discussed above,to the extent the alj rejected carmickle allegations that he needs to change positions constantly when sitting and that he can lift only pounds occasionally,such findings were based on substantial evidence in the record.these findings also support the alj conclusion that carmickle daily activities are inconsistent with his allegations of disability.on this record,the alj error in relying on carmickle receipt of unemployment benefits and on his relatively conservative pain treatment regime does not negate the validity of the alj adverse credibility finding.batson,at.contrary to the dissent assertion,the remaining valid reasons supporting the alj determination are not relatively minor.see dissent at.they are specific findings related to carmickle ability to perform vocational functions,and they clearly demonstrate that to the extent the alj found carmickle testimony incredible,the alj did not do so arbitrarily.rollins,at.
carmickle also argues that the alj erred in finding lay witness tucker testimony not entirely credible.the alj must consider competent lay testimony but in rejecting such evidence,he need only provide reasons for doing so that are germane to the witness.greger barnhart,cir internal quotation marks omitted.tucker,one of carmickle classmates,testified that carmickle often appears uncomfortable in class and has to lean back in his chair with his feet propped up on his wheeled book carrier.tucker also stated carmickle has trouble understanding at times and sometimes appears confused.the alj rejected this evidence finding it inconsistent with carmickle successful completion of continuous coursework.this reason is germane to tucker.therefore,we conclude that the alj had a proper basis on which to reject tucker testimony.
the alj is responsible for resolving conflicts in the medical record.benton barnhart,cir.those physicians with the most significant clinical relationship with the claimant are generally entitled to more weight than those physicians with lesser relationships.lester,at d,d.as such,the alj may only reject a treating or examining physician uncontradicted medical opinion based on clear and convincing reasons.lester,at.where such an opinion is contradicted,however,it may be rejected for specific and legitimate reasons that are supported by substantial evidence in the record.id.here,carmickle asserts the alj erred in rejecting medical evidence from patton,kane,horowitz,and nilaver.
carmickle argues the alj erred by failing to include all of the limitations identified by patton,a treating physician,in assessing carmickle rfc.patton submitted three rfc reports.though largely consistent,there are some variations among the reports.the record also includes contradictory opinions from reviewing physicians.in resolving these conflicts,the alj gave carmickle the benefit of the doubt and assigned great weight to patton second report,dated november,because the me who testified at the hearing stated that this report included generous limitations.the alj also rejected some of the new limitations identified in patton third report,dated november,because they were based on a recent tendonitis diagnosis that is not expected to result in any significant functional limitation for any period.
the alj is required to consider all of the limitations imposed by the claimant impairments,even those that are not severe.social security ruling ssr.even though a impairment standing alone may not significantly limit an individual ability to do basic work activities,it considered with limitations or restrictions due to other critical to the outcome of a claim.id.patton opined that carmickle tendonitis significantly limits his ability to perform rotary movement.the alj erred in not including this limitation in his assessment of carmickle rfc.
carmickle also argues that the alj erred by not classifying his carpal tunnel syndrome as a severe impairment at step two of the analysis.however,the only medical evidence addressing such impairment is a letter dated in well before carmickle alleged onset of disability stating that the physician identified a probably unrelated carpal tunnel syndrome and peripheral neuropathy and notes from a visit indicating that over the past couple of weeks carmickle has had further improvement in his arm symptoms such that he states that over the past several days he has few,if any,arm complaints.furthermore,the medical record does not establish any limitations as a result of this impairment.see burch barnhart,cir holding that a medical impairment is deemed severe when alone or in combination with other medically determinable physical or mental impairment s,it significantly limits an individual physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,we conclude that the alj did not err in his assessment of carmickle carpal tunnel syndrome.
carmickle next argues the alj erred in rejecting treating physician kane statement that carmickle can not tolerate sedentary or light work.a few months after carmickle accident,kane diagnosed moderate to severe degenerative disc disease in the lumbar spine and gave carmickle a excuse from work.at that time,he stated i think it is clear that carmickle did not tolerate return to sedentary or light work.two months later,however,kane released carmickle to return to work.the alj gave kane opinion little weight in assessing the claimant functioning.we conclude the alj assessment is supported by substantial evidence.
carmickle also contends the alj erred in rejecting horowitz recommendation that carmickle use a reclinable desk chair while working.based on patton reports,the alj concluded a reclining chair is not necessary if carmickle has a option.in his first rfc report,patton indicated that carmickle can sit for two hours in a reclining chair and minutes in a standard chair,but rotation between sitting,standing,walking works best.in his later reports,patton makes no distinction between the type of chair,simply indicating that carmickle can sit for only short amounts of time and that he needs the option to alternate positions frequently.the difficulty is that patton also stated that he agreed with horowitz recommendation.horowitz proposal was offered as a recommendation,not an imperative.thus,the alj decision primarily to rely on patton specific statements regarding carmickle limitations,rather than his summary agreement with horowitz,was rational,and we will not disturb it.see allen heckler,cir if the evidence admits of more than one rational interpretation,we must uphold the decision of the alj.
carmickle lastly points to the medical evidence from nilaver,an examining physician.the alj gave little weight to nilaver opinion because it was provided before carmickle alleged onset of disability at a time when carmickle was working two jobs that he never indicated having trouble performing before his injury.medical opinions that predate the alleged onset of disability are of limited relevance.see fair bowen,cir.this is especially true in cases such as this where disability is allegedly caused by a discrete event.see ssr.as such,we conclude the alj did not err in his treatment of nilaver evidence.
the final issue on appeal is whether the alj erred at step four in finding that carmickle can perform his past relevant work as a construction supervisor and counter salesperson.true,because the alj erred in excluding some of carmickle limitations from the rfc assessment,see supra part,and thus from the ve hypothetical,the ve testimony has no evidentiary value.russell sullivan,cir order,abrogated on other grounds in sorenson mink,cir.however,because carmickle also asserts the ve misclassified his past relevant work and erroneously conflated the and analyses,we must address this issue.
at step four of the sequential analysis,the claimant has the burden to prove that he can not perform his prior rel
