renae ekstrand sued her former employer,the somerset school district,claiming that the school district failed to accommodate her seasonal affective disorder and constructively discharged her in violation of the americans with disabilities act ada.the district court granted summary judgment to the school district on both counts.we have reviewed the district court decision de novo finding error,we reverse in part.
background 
renae ekstrand taught successfully at somerset elementary school from to.for the school year,she requested a move from kindergarten to the first grade,and the school reassigned her to a classroom lacking exterior windows.ekstrand told the principal that she had seasonal affective disorder,a form of depression,and would have difficulty functioning in a room with artificial light rather than natural light.she repeatedly requested an alternate room with natural light before the school year began,throughout the first five or six weeks of the school year as her health declined,and during the following month while she was on disability leave.during this time there were two alternate rooms available the room of ann jacquet,a teacher willing to switch with ekstrand and an empty room being held open for a possible additional section pending the school board approval.
ekstrand began by identifying the lack of natural light as an issue that would impair her ability to function,and soon identified other issues that exacerbated her symptoms of seasonal depression,including noise distractions from the adjacent commons area,inadequate ventilation,and the untimely manner in which the school district installed various educational necessities such as appropriate light bulbs,bulletin boards,a map,a desk,an overhead projector screen,a locking cabinet,and a nameplate.
the school district worked with ekstrand to remedy these issues but did not reassign her to a room with natural light despite ekstrand repeated requests.after the school year began,esktrand began experiencing fatigue,anxiety,hypervigilance,tearfulness,racing thoughts,and trouble organizing tasks.her anxiety and depression worsened and she began experiencing new symptoms about which she informed the school district.by late september and through the time she began her medical leave on october,ekstrand suffered from significant inability to concentrate,organize her thoughts,retrieve words,make decisions,and focus on the needs of her students.she also experienced hypersomnia,racing thoughts,panic attacks,uncontrollable crying,inability to eat,and thoughts of suicide.
on october,ekstrand sought medical attention.her doctors placed her on medication and advised her to take a leave of absence for the remainder of the semester,about three months.twice during her leave she repeated her requests for a room switch,once in an october letter to the superintendent and again on november when she met with the superintendent in person.
ekstrand depression continued to worsen and she began suffering stress symptomology.she became unable to return to somerset elementary school for the remainder of the and school years,but she began teaching at south dakota state university in,finding it significantly less stressful.
on february,ekstrand initiated this case against the school district in state court under the ada,claiming failure to accommodate and unlawful discharge.the school district removed the case to federal court,engaged in discovery with ekstrand,and moved for summary judgment.
the district court granted the school district motion for summary judgment,holding that the school district did not fail to accommodate ekstrand disability because it engaged in the interactive process and addressed plaintiff complaints by making changes aimed at reducing her stress and that the school district conduct was not severe enough to create the type of abusive environment that has been found to amount to a constructive discharge.d.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the school district on march,and ekstrand timely filed this appeal.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing all facts and reasonable inferences in ekstrand favor.winsley cook county,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,discovery materials,disclosures,and affidavits demonstrate no genuine issue of material fact such that the school district is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed civ.c.
failure to accommodate 
to survive the school district motion for summary judgment on her claim,ekstrand needed to present evidence that,if believed by a trier of fact,would show that she is a qualified individual with a disability the school district was aware of her disability and the school district failed to reasonably accommodate that disability.see,king city of madison,cir.ekstrand satisfies all three elements.
first,ekstrand presented evidence that she was disabled and qualified under the ada from late september to at least somewhere between november,and january.evidence from ekstrand doctors potek and erickson and other witnesses and documents show that ekstrand was disabled beginning late september,when her mental health condition became sufficiently serious to substantially limit her teaching ability.the district court also found that ekstrand adduced evidence that she was qualified in that she otherwise could have performed her essential job functions as late as november,had she been provided a room lacking the various stressors that exacerbated her seasonal affective disorder.d at.but since ekstrand may have been well enough to return on november,as the district court found,the record also suggests her ability to return at least as late as november,because two notes by her doctor indicate that her condition improved during that time.see potek outpatient clinic notes of november,and november.not until january,does the record indicate ekstrand absolute inability to return to work.see potek letter of january.the record also indicates ekstrand willingness to return to work during all times she was able.thus,ekstrand presented evidence that she ceased being a qualified individual with a disability no earlier than between november,and january,not on november,as the district court found.moreover,ekstrand may have remained a qualified individual later still because ekstrand presented evidence that the school district was responsible for aggravating her disability.but we need not decide whether a person whose disability is aggravated by an employer ceases to be qualified under the ada once the disability has grown sufficiently severe.nor must we decide whether ekstrand disorder precluded her from being qualified under the ada given her unique role as a teacher of impressionable first graders.see judge evans concurring opinion below.it is enough in this appeal from summary judgment to conclude that ekstrand demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether she remained qualified through the end of november.
second,ekstrand presented evidence that the school district was aware of her disability from late september onward.indeed,this evidence was so compelling that the district court found no real dispute.id.whereas the school district was aware of ekstrand disability,however,it was unaware of any evidence that natural light is a necessary treatment for seasonal affective disorder until november,as discussed more fully below.
third,the critical issue on this appeal is whether ekstrand presented evidence that the school district failed to reasonably accommodate her.to establish this element,ekstrand must have presented evidence showing not only her attempt to engage in an interactive communication process with the school district to determine a reasonable accommodation,but also that the school district was responsible for any breakdown that occurred in that process.sears,cir.when there is a communication breakdown,we are required to isolate the cause of the breakdown and then assign responsibility.bultemeyer fort wayne cmty,cir quoting beck of.bd.of regents,cir.
an employee request for reasonable accommodation requires a great deal of communication between the
