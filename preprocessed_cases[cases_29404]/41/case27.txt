together,the developmental disabilities assistance and bill of rights act of dd act and the protection and advocacy for individuals with mental illness act paimi act offer states federal money to improve,inter alia,medical care for persons with developmental disabilities or mental illness.as a condition of funding,a state must establish a protection and advocacy system to protect and advocate those individuals rights.a.a participating state may appoint either a state agency or a private nonprofit entity as its system,but if a state agency it must have authority to litigate and freedom from the control of other state agencies or officers.virginia has appointed an independent state agency,petitioner virginia office for protection and advocacy vopa,authorizing it to litigate to secure disabled individuals rights,free of oversight to operate independently of virginia attorney general and to employ its own lawyers to sue on its behalf.
while investigating patient deaths and injuries at state mental hospitals,vopa asked respondents state officials in charge of those hospitals to produce relevant patient records.respondents refused,asserting that a privilege shielded the records from disclosure.vopa then filed suit in federal district court,seeking a declaration that respondents refusal to produce the records violated the dd and paimi acts and an injunction requiring respondents to produce the records and refrain in the future from interfering with vopa right of access.respondents moved to dismiss on the ground that they are immune from suit under the eleventh amendment,but the court held that the suit was permitted by the doctrine of ex parte young,which normally allows federal courts to award prospective relief against state officials for violations of federal law.the fourth circuit reversed,finding that ex parte young did not apply because the suit was brought by a state agency.

verizon.public serv.comm of,held that,in determining the ex parte young doctrine applicability,a court need only conduct a straightforward inquiry into whether the complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.at.vopa suit satisfies that inquiry.respondents concede that the action would be proper were vopa a private organization rather than a state agency.the general criterion for determining when a suit is in fact against the sovereign is the effect of the relief sought,pennhurst,supra,at,not who is bringing the lawsuit.this court applied that criterion in idaho coeur tribe of idaho,which held that an indian tribe could not invoke ex parte young to bring what was essentially a quiet title suit that would extinguish idaho control over lands and waters long deemed an integral part of its territory.at.respondents have advanced no argument that the relief sought here threatens a similar invasion of virginia sovereignty.
respondents claim that a state dignity is diminished when a federal court adjudicates a dispute between its components.but a state stature is not diminished to any greater degree when its own agency sues to enforce its officers compliance with federal law than when a private person does so.moreover,vopa power to sue state officials is a consequence of virginia own decision to establish a public system.not every offense to a state dignity constitutes a denial of sovereign immunity.the specific indignity against which sovereign immunity protects is the insult to a state of being haled into court without its consent that does not occur just because a suit happens to be brought by another state agency.
the apparent novelty of this suit is not likely a consequence of past constitutional doubts.in order to invoke the ex parte young exception,a state agency needs both a federal right that it possesses against its parent state and authority to sue state officials to enforce that right,free from any internal veto such conditions rarely coincide.in any event,the principles undergirding the ex parte young doctrine support its extension to actions of this kind.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
we consider whether ex parte young,allows a federal court to hear a lawsuit for prospective relief against state officials brought by another agency of the same state.
the developmental disabilities assistance and bill of rights act of dd act,stat,et,offers states federal money to improve community services,such as medical care and job training,for individuals with developmental disabilities.see a.as a condition of that funding,a state must establish a protection and advocacy system to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities.a.the system receives separate federal funds,paid to it directly.a and b.a second federal law,the protection and advocacy for individuals with mental illness act paimi act,stat,et,increases that separate funding and extends the mission of systems to include the mentally ill.at present,every state accepts funds under these statutes.
under the dd and paimi acts,a system must have certain powers.the system shall have the authority to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect if the incidents are reported to the system or if there is probable cause to believe that the incidents occurred.a b a a.subject to certain statutory requirements,it must be given access to all records of individuals who may have been abused,see a i iii ii a b iii,as well as other records that are relevant to conducting an investigation,a j i.the acts also require that a system have authority to pursue legal,administrative,and other appropriate remedies or approaches to ensure the protection of its charges.a a i see a b.and in addition to pressing its own rights,a system may pursue administrative,legal,and other remedies on behalf of those it protects.a c see b.
a participating state is free to appoint either a state agency or a private nonprofit entity as its system.a c b.but in either case,the designated entity must have certain structural features that ensure its independence from the state government.the dd act prohibits the governor from appointing more than of the members of the system governing board,a,and restricts the state ability to impose hiring freezes or other measures that would impair the system ability to carry out its mission,a k.once a state designates an entity as its system,it may not change its selection without good cause.a a.
virginia is one of just eight states that have designated a government entity as their system.the virginia office for protection and advocacy vopa is an independent state agency.code ann.a lexis.its board consists of eleven nonlegislative citizen members,of whom only three are appointed by the governor.b.the remaining eight are appointed by components of the legislature five by the speaker of the house of delegates,and three by the senate committee on rules.ibid.vopa itself nominates candidates for consideration,and the statute instructs the appointing officials that they shall seriously consider the persons nominated and appoint such persons whenever feasible.ibid.board members serve for fixed terms and are removable only by a court and only for specified reasons.see c and f and lexis.
vopa enjoys authority to litigate free of oversight.it operates independently of the attorney general of virginia and employs its own lawyers,who are statutorily authorized to sue on vopa behalf.a lexis.and virginia law specifically empowers vopa to initiate any proceedings to secure the rights of disabled individuals.a.
in,vopa opened an investigation into the deaths of two patients and injuries to a third at mental hospitals.it asked respondents state officials in charge of those institutions to produce any records related to or mortality reviews conducted by the hospitals with respect to those patients.respondents refused,asserting that the records were protected by a privilege shielding medical materials from disclosure.
vopa then brought this action in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia,alleging that the dd and paimi acts entitled it to the records,notwithstanding any privilege that might apply.it sought a declaration that respondents refusal to produce the records violated the dd and paimi acts,along with an injunction requiring respondents to provide access to the records and refrain in the future from interfering with vopa right of access to them.respondents moved to dismiss the action on the grounds that they are immune from suit under the eleventh amendment.the district court denied the motion.in its view,the suit was permitted by the doctrine of ex parte young,which normally allows federal courts to award prospective relief against state officials for violations of federal law.virginia reinhard,wl,ed,july.
the court of appeals reversed.virginia reinhard.believing vopa lawsuit to be an intramural contest that encroaches more severely on the dignity and sovereignty of the states than an ex parte young action brought by a private plaintiff,the court of appeals concluded it was not authorized by that case,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we granted certiorari.
sovereign immunity is the privilege of the sovereign not to be sued without its consent.the language of the eleventh only eliminates the basis for our judgment in the famous case of chisholm georgia,dall,which involved a suit against a state by a noncitizen of the state.since hans louisiana,however,we have understood the eleventh amendment to confirm the structural understanding that states entered the union with their sovereign immunity intact,unlimited by article iii jurisdictional grant.blatchford native village of noatak,see pennhurst state school and hospital halderman.our cases hold that the states have retained their traditional immunity from suit,except as altered by the plan of the convention or certain constitutional amendments.alden maine.a state may waive its sovereign immunity at its pleasure,college savings bank florida prepaid postsecondary ed.expense,and in some circumstances congress may abrogate it by appropriate legislation but absent waiver or valid abrogation,federal courts may not entertain a private person suit against a state.
in ex parte young,we established an important limit on the principle.that case involved a challenge to a minnesota law reducing the freight rates that railroads could charge.a railroad shareholder claimed that the new rates were confiscatory,and obtained a federal injunction against edward young,the attorney general of minnesota,forbidding him in his official capacity to enforce the state law.perkins northern pacific,cc.when young violated the injunction by initiating an enforcement action in state court,the circuit court held him in contempt and committed him to federal custody.in his habeas corpus application in this court,young challenged his confinement by arguing that minnesota sovereign immunity deprived the federal court of jurisdiction to enjoin him from performing his official duties.
we disagreed.we explained that because an unconstitutional legislative enactment is void,a state official who enforces that law comes into conflict with the superior authority of the constitution,and therefore is stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct.the state has no power to impart to him any immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the united states.at.
this doctrine has existed alongside our jurisprudence for more than a century,accepted as necessary to permit the federal courts to vindicate federal rights.pennhurst,at.it rests on the premise less delicately called a fiction,at,that when a federal court commands a state official to do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law,he is not the state for purposes.the doctrine is limited to that precise situation,and does not apply when the state is the real,substantial party in interest,at quoting ford motor department of treasury of,as when the judgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain,or interfere with public administration,at,quoting dugan rank.
this case requires us to decide how to apply the ex parte young doctrine to a suit brought by an independent state agency claiming to possess federal rights.although we have never encountered such a suit before,we are satisfied that entertaining vopa action is consistent with our precedents and does not offend the distinctive interests protected by sovereign immunity.
in verizon.public serv.comm of,we held that i n determining whether the doctrine of ex parte young avoids an eleventh amendment bar to suit,a court need only conduct a straightforward inquiry into whether the complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.at quoting idaho coeur tribe of idaho,concurring in part and concurring in judgment.there is no doubt vopa suit satisfies that straightforward inquiry.it alleges that respondents refusal to produce the requested medical records violates federal law and it seeks an injunction requiring the production of the records,which would prospectively abate the alleged violation.respondents concede that were vopa a private organization rather than a state agency,the doctrine would permit this action to proceed 
we see no reason for a different result here.although respondents argue that vopa status as a state agency changes the calculus,there is no warrant in our cases for making the validity of an ex parte young action turn on the identity of the plaintiff.to be sure,we have been willing to police abuses of the doctrine that threaten to evade sovereign immunity.to do otherwise would be to adhere to an empty formalism.coeur tribe,supra,at.but as the dissent concedes,post,at opinion of roberts,the limits we have recognized reflect the principle that the general criterion for determining when a suit is in fact against the sovereign is the effect of the relief sought,pennhurst,supra,at,not who is bringing the lawsuit.thus,ex parte young can not be used to obtain an injunction requiring the payment of funds from the state treasury,see edelman jordan,or an order for specific performance of a state contract,see,at in re ayers.
coeur tribe,on which respondents heavily rely,is an application of this principle.there we refused to allow an indian tribe to use ex parte young to obtain injunctive and declaratory relief establishing its exclusive right to the use and enjoyment of certain submerged lands in idaho and the invalidity of all state statutes and regulations governing that land,at.we determined that the suit was the functional equivalent of a quiet title suit against idaho,would extinguish the state control over a vast reach of lands and waters long deemed by the state to be an integral part of its territory,and thus was barred by sovereign immunity,at.
respondents have advanced no argument that the relief sought in this case threatens any similar invasion of virginia sovereignty.indeed,they concede that the very injunction vopa requests could properly be awarded by a federal court at the instance of a private system.
respondents and the dissent argue that entertaining vopa lawsuit in a federal forum would nevertheless infringe virginia sovereign interests because it diminishes the dignity of a state for a federal court to adjudicate a dispute between its components.see brief for respondents post,at arguing that special sovereignty interests bar vopa lawsuit quoting coeur tribe,supra,at.we disagree.as an initial matter,we do not understand how a state stature could be diminished to any greater degree when its own agency polices its officers compliance with their federal obligations,than when a private person hales those officers into federal court for that same purpose something everyone agrees is proper and in this case,of course,vopa power to sue state officials is a consequence of virginia own decision to establish a public,rather than a private,system.we fail to perceive what eleventh amendment indignity is visited on the commonwealth when,by operation of its own laws,vopa is admitted to federal court as a plaintiff 
but even if it were true that the state dignity were offended in some way by the maintenance of this action in federal court,that would not prove respondents case.denial of sovereign immunity,to be sure,offends the dignity of a state but not every offense to the dignity of a state constitutes a denial of sovereign immunity.the specific indignity against which sovereign immunity protects is the insult to a state of being haled into court without its consent.that effectively occurs,our cases reasonably conclude,when for example the object of the suit against a state officer is to reach funds in the state treasury or acquire state lands it does not occur just because the suit happens to be brought by another state agency.respondents asserted dignitary harm is simply unconnected to the interest.
the dissent complains that applying ex parte young to this lawsuit divides virginia against itself,since the opposing parties are both creatures of the commonwealth.post,at.even if that were a distinctive consequence of letting this suit proceed in federal court,it would have nothing to do with the concern of whether the suit is against an unconsenting state,rather than against its officers.but it is not a consequence of the federal nature of the forum.the same result will follow if the federal claim is sued upon in state court,as the dissent would require.there also,w hatever the decision in the litigation,t he commonwealth will win,a nd the commonwealth will lose.ibid.nor would sending the matter to state court even avoid the prospect that a federal judge will resolve which part of the commonwealth will prevail,since the loser could always ask this court to review the matter by certiorari.or is that appeal also to be disallowed on grounds of sovereign immunity but see cohens virginia,wheat.and of course precisely the same thing would happen if respondents specifically waived their objections in this very case.yet no one would contend that despite the waiver,sovereign immunity forbade the suit.so also here if,by reason of ex parte young,there has been no violation of sovereign immunity,the prospect of a federal judge resolving vopa dispute with respondents does not make it so.
we do not doubt,of course,that there are limits on the federal government power to affect the internal operations of a state.see,printz united states,congress may not commandeer state officers coyle smith,congress may not dictate a state capital.but those limits must be found in some textual provision or structural premise of the constitution.additional limits can not be smuggled in under the eleventh amendment by barring a suit in federal court that does not violate the state sovereign immunity.
a weightier objection,perhaps,is the relative novelty of this lawsuit.respondents rightly observe that federal courts have not often encountered lawsuits brought by state agencies against other state officials.that does give us pause.lack of historical precedent can indicate a constitutional infirmity,see,free enterprise fund public company accounting oversight,slip,at,and our decisions have traditionally warned against anomalous and proceedings or suits,alden,at quoting hans,at.
novelty,however,is often the consequence of past constitutional doubts,but we have no reason to believe that is the case here.in order to invoke the ex parte young exception to sovereign immunity,a state agency needs two things first,a federal right that it possesses against its parent state and second,authority to sue other state officials to enforce that right,free from any internal veto wielded by the state government.these conditions will rarely coincide and at least the latter of them can not exist without the consent of the state that created the agency and defined its powers.see post,at kennedy,concurring.we are unaware that the necessary conditions have ever presented themselves except in connection with the dd and paimi acts,and the parties have referred us to no examples thus,the apparent novelty of this sort of suit does not at all suggest its unconstitutionality.in any event,we are satisfied,for the reasons we have explained,that novelty notwithstanding the principles undergirding the ex parte young support its application to actions of this kind.
like the court of appeals,we are mindful of the central role autonomous states play in our federal system,and wary of approving new encroachments on their sovereignty.but we conclude no such encroachment is occasioned by straightforwardly applying ex parte young to allow this suit.it was virginia law that created vopa and gave it the power to sue state officials.in that circumstance,the eleventh amendment presents no obstacle to vopa ability to invoke federal jurisdiction on the same terms as any other litigant.
we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit 
justice kennedy,with whom justice thomas joins,concurring.
ex parte young,recognized a narrow limitation on state sovereign immunity,permitting railroad stockholders to enjoin enforcement of rate regulations.that negative injunction was nothing more than the assertion in equity of a defense that would otherwise have been available in the state enforcement proceedings at law,at see also harrison,ex parte young,stan.
the court has expanded the young exception far beyond its original office in order to vindicate the federal interest in assuring the supremacy of federal law,green mansour,but not without careful attention in each case to the sovereign interests of the state.see verizon.public serv.comm of,kennedy,concurring.in edelman jordan,for example,the court applied the exception to an affirmative prospective order but not to equitable restitution,for the latter was too similar to an award of damages against the state,at see pennhurst state school and hospital halderman,under the theory of young,such a suit for restitution would not be one against the state since the allegation would strip the state officer of his official authority.nevertheless,retroactive relief was barred by the eleventh amendment and pennhurst declined to extend young to suits alleging a violation,for without the need to ensure the supremacy of federal law there was no justification for restricting state sovereignty,at.
the straightforward inquiry of verizon derives from edelman and pennhurst,both of which defined important limits on young in order to respect state sovereignty while still adhering to principles necessary to implement the supremacy clause.as a result,verizon incorporates the very balancing it might at first seem to reject.verizon itself was an easy case,for it involved the same kind of preenforcement assertion of a defense that was at issue in young.but when young application is explored in novel contexts,as in idaho coeur tribe of idaho,and also in this case,the inquiry proves more complex,verizon,supra,at kennedy,concurring.
in this case,in my view,the virginia office for protection and advocacy may rely on young,despite the somewhat striking novelty of permitting a state agency to sue officials of the same state in federal court.in the posture of the case as it comes before the court,it must be assumed that vopa has a federal right to the records it seeks,and so the extension of young would vindicate the supremacy clause.to be balanced against this important interest is the need to preserve the dignity and respect afforded a state,which the immunity is designed to protect.coeur,supra,at.permitting a state agency like vopa to sue officials of the same state does implicate the state important sovereign interest in using its own courts to control the distribution of power among its own agents.but the affront to the state dignity is diminished to some extent when it is noted that if the state had elected the alternate course of designating a private protection and advocacy system it then would have avoided any risk of internal conflict while still participating in the federal program.the availability of that alternate course does not,in my view,weigh much in favor of the validity of the underlying federal scheme,but the only question here is the reach of the young exception.
virginia concern that the holding here upsets the federal balance is further mitigated by the various protections built into the structure of federal litigation to ensure that state officials do not too often call upon the federal courts to resolve their intramural disputes.
first,and most important,state law must authorize an agency or official to sue another arm of the state.if states do not wish to see their internal conflicts aired in federal court,they need not empower their officers or agencies to sue one another in a federal forum.and if state officers are not by state law empowered to sue,they may invoke federal jurisdiction only in their personal capacities.
second,to the extent there is some doubt under state law as to an officer or agency power to sue,or any other issue that may be dispositive,federal courts should abstain under railroad comm of pullman.pullman recognizes the importance of state sovereignty by limiting federal judicial intervention in state affairs to cases where intervention is necessary.if an open question of would resolve a dispute,then federal courts may wait for the resolution of the issue before adjudicating the merits.likewise,certification of questions of state law to the state courts may pretermit an otherwise sensitive federal controversy.lehman brothers schein,certification helps build a cooperative judicial federalism 
finally,federal law does not often create rights for state officials or agencies to assert against other arms of the state.true,officials may assert that their personal federal rights are violated by unlawful state action,for example where the state engages in discriminatory employment practices.but the statutory framework in the case now before the court is unusual in that it vests a state agency itself with federal rights against the state.statutes tend to protect the rights of individuals,not officers or agencies,and the constitution clauses protect persons rather than officers.because the young exception is available only to those who assert federal violations,the paucity of federal rights vested in government officials makes the scope of the holding here a narrow one.
all this is simply to underscore that the program at issue may present constitutional questions but that the parties do not raise them in this litigation.virginia does not argue,for example,that congress exceeded its spending power under article i,by forcing a state that wishes to designate a public agency as its advocacy system to allow intramural suits like the instant one or by requiring that the agency be structured as congress directs,a g system must be independent of any agency that provides treatment,services,or habilitation to individuals with developmental disabilities a n ot more than of the members of the governing board may be appointed by the chief executive officer of the state young a doctrine based on convenience,fiction,or both neither implicates nor subsumes these more fundamental concerns regarding the excessive exercise of federal power.the court should be most cautious before deciding cases that might later lead to a general principle that the national government can condition receipt of funds on the state agreement to make changes with respect to its governmental structure or its basic policies of governance in matters within its special competence.assuming,as the court must,that the statutes here are constitutional,the narrow question is whether vopa may rely on young to avoid the sovereign immunity bar.
one might doubt whether the constitutional question may be so severed from the young analysis.the court wields young in the name of the supremacy clause only to vindicate important federal rights.perhaps this court should not extend the fiction in the name of claims that may rest on unconstitutional foundations.this concern is misplaced.the canon of constitutional avoidance directs courts to prefer the interpretation of a statute that preserves its validity,but the specter of a statute unconstitutionality can not be permitted to distort the antecedent question of jurisdiction.courts interpret and evaluate a statute only after confirming their authority to adjudicate the case before them.to decline to adjudicate a federal right for fear of its potential unconstitutionality is in effect to invalidate the right in the quest to save it.the court should not permit the commission of acts that violate a federal right on the mere suspicion that congress acted beyond its authority.because the suit must be assumed to vindicate the supremacy clause and poses no serious affront to state sovereignty in light of the options available to the state under the program,it may proceed.
with these observations,i join the court opinion.

today the court holds that a state agency may sue officials acting on behalf of the state in federal court.this has never happened before.in order to reach this unsettling result,the court extends the fiction of ex parte young what we have called an empty formalism well beyond the circumstances of that case.because i can not subscribe to such a substantial and novel expansion of what we have also called a narrow exception to a state sovereign immunity,i respectfully dissent.
the federal system established by our constitution preserves the sovereign status of the states.alden maine.as confirmed by the eleventh amendment,a n integral component of that residuary and inviolable sovereignty is the states immunity from private suits.federal maritime comm south carolina ports authority,internal quotation marks omitted hans louisiana,it is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent quoting the federalist hamilton.the preeminent purpose of state sovereign immunity is to accord states the dignity that is consistent with their status as sovereign entities.federal maritime comm n,supra,at.accordingly,any time a state is haled into federal court against its will,the dignity and respect afforded that state,which sovereign immunity is designed to protect,are placed in jeopardy.idaho coeur tribe of idaho.the immunity does not turn on whether relief will be awarded t he eleventh amendment is concerned not only with the states ability to withstand suit,but with their privilege not to be sued.puerto rico aqueduct and sewer authority metcalf eddy.see federal maritime comm n,supra,at the primary function of sovereign immunity is not to protect state treasuries,but to afford the states the dignity and respect due sovereign entities citation omitted.
because of the key role state sovereign immunity plays in our federal system,the court has recognized only a few exceptions to that immunity.the sole one relevant here is the narrow exception,seminole tribe of florida,established by our decision in ex parte young.in ex parte young,the court held that private litigants could seek an injunction in federal court against a state official,prohibiting him from enforcing a state law claimed to violate the federal constitution.see,at.as we have often observed,ex parte young rests on the obvious fiction,couer tribe,supra,at,that such a suit is not really against the state,but rather against an individual who has been stripped of his official or representative character because of his unlawful conduct,ex parte young,supra,at 
while we have consistently acknowledged the important role ex parte young plays in promot ing the vindication of federal rights,we have been cautious not to give that decision an expansive interpretation.pennhurst state school and hospital halderman.indeed,the history of our ex parte young jurisprudence has largely been focused on ensuring that this narrow exception is narrowly construed,at.we have,for example,held that the fiction of ex parte young does not extend to suits where the plaintiff seeks retroactive relief,edelman jordan,where the claimed violations are based on state law,pennhurst,supra,at where the federal law violation is no longer ongoing,green mansour,where congress has prescribed a detailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against a state of the claimed federal right,seminole tribe,supra,at and where special sovereignty interests are implicated,couer tribe,supra,at.
we recently stated that when determining whether the doctrine of ex parte young avoids an eleventh amendment bar to suit,a court need only conduct a straightforward inquiry into whether the complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.verizon.public serv.comm of,internal quotation marks omitted.but not every plaintiff who complies with these prerequisites will be able to bring suit under ex parte young.indeed,in verizon itself the court went beyond its straightforward inquiry in considering whether ex parte young applied.after deciding the plaintiffs clearly satisfie d the straightforward inquiry,the court went on to examine whether congress had created a detailed remedial scheme like the one in seminole tribe,at,internal quotation marks omitted.only after determining that congress had not done so did the court conclude that the suit could go forward under ex parte young.
if verizon formulation set forth the only requirements for bringing an action under ex parte young,two of our recent precedents were wrongly decided.in seminole tribe,the court acknowledged that it had often found federal jurisdiction over a suit against a state official when that suit seeks only prospective injunctive relief in order to end a continuing violation of federal law.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court held,however,that the situation presented there was sufficiently different from that giving rise to the traditional ex parte young action so as to preclude the availability of that doctrine.ibid 
in couer tribe,the court recognized that an allegation of an ongoing violation of federal law where the requested relief is prospective is ordinarily sufficient to invoke the young fiction.at emphasis added.the court held,however,that the action could not proceed under ex parte young because it implicated special sovereignty interests in that case,the state property rights in certain submerged lands,at.
as we explained in papasan allain,there are certain types of cases that formally meet the young requirements of a state official acting inconsistently with federal law but that stretch that case too far and would upset the balance of federal and state interests that it embodies.at.this is one of those cases.
in refusing to extend ex parte young to claims that involve special sovereignty interests,the court in coeur tribe warned against a rote application of the ex parte young fiction 
to interpret young to permit a action to proceed in every case where prospective declaratory and injunctive relief is sought against an officer,named in his individual capacity,would be to adhere to an empty formalism and to undermine the principle that eleventh amendment immunity represents a real limitation on a federal court jurisdiction.the real interests served by the eleventh amendment are not to be sacrificed to elementary mechanics of captions and pleading.application of the young exception must reflect a proper understanding of its role in our federal system and respect for state courts instead of a reflexive reliance on an obvious fiction.at.
it is undisputed that petitioner complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law by a state official and seeks only prospective relief.if this were a traditional ex parte young action,seminole tribe,supra,at,petitioner might very well be able to pursue its claims under that case.this,however,is anything but a traditional case and petitioner is anything but a typical ex parte young plaintiff.
unlike the plaintiffs in ex parte young and,for that matter,unlike any other plaintiff that has ever sought to invoke ex parte young before this court petitioner is a state agency seeking to sue officials of the same state in federal court.the court is troubled by this novelty,ante at,but not enough.see free enterprise fund public company accounting oversight,slip,at perhaps the most telling indication of a severe constitutional problem is the lack of historical precedent internal quotation marks omitted alden,at printz united states.this is especially true in light of the presumption we articulated more than years ago in hans louisiana,that states are immune from suits that would have been anomalous and unheard of when the constitution was adopted.hans,at see also alden,supra,at invoking presumption.
accordingly,when determining whether to lift the bar of sovereign immunity,we have attribute d great significance to the absence of analogous suits at the time of the founding or for many years thereafter.federal maritime comm n,at.this sort of suit was not only anomalous and unheard of at the time of the founding it was anomalous and unheard of yesterday.the hans presumption applies here with full force.
the court speculates that these suits have not previously arisen because the necessary conditions state agencies pursuing a federal right free of internal state veto are themselves novel.see ante,at see also ante,at kennedy,concurring.even if true,that simply highlights the fact that this case is not suitable for mere rote application of ex parte young.
in addition to its novel character,petitioner complaint conflicts directly with the principles of federalism that underlie the eleventh amendment.pennhurst,at.in alden,we held that state sovereign immunity prohibited congress from authorizing private suits against nonconsenting states in their own courts.at.we explained that such power would permit one branch of state government,the state own courts,to coerce the other branches of the state and to turn the state against itself.ibid.
here the court goes further this suit features a state agency on one side,and state executive officials on the other.the objection in alden was that the federal government could force the state to defend itself before itself.here extending young forces the state to defend itself against itself in federal court.
both sides in this case exercise the sovereign power of the commonwealth of virginia.petitioner claims the title of the commonwealth of virginia in its complaint,app.respondents are state officials acting in an official
