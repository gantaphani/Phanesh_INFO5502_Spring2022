a pennsylvania hospital that treats patients with renal disease asked the secretary of health and human services to increase the rate at which the medicare program would reimburse it for each treatment.after discovering an error in the hospital supporting documentation,the secretary denied the request,and the district court rejected the hospital challenge to that ruling.finding the secretary conclusion that the error left the hospital unable to carry its burden of justifying a rate increase neither arbitrary nor capricious,we affirm.
each year,the secretary of health and human services establishes a prospective composite rate for various outpatient treatments of renal disease esrd.see.may,see also b requiring such action by the secretary.the composite rate,which represents the approximate cost that the secretary expects providers to incur for various esrd treatments,encourages efficiency,for if a provider cost falls below the composite rate,then the difference represents a profit to the provider.at the same time,the composite rate does not establish an absolute ceiling providers that experience costs above the composite rate may ask the secretary for an exception.b.a provider seeking an exception must demonstrate with convincing objective evidence that its total per treatment costs are reasonable and allowable,and that its per treatment costs in excess of its payment rate are directly attributable to any of the listed criteria.g.atypical service intensity patient mix tops the list of criteria.id.
pursuant to hhs provider reimbursement manual prm a compilation of interpretive rules published by hhs,appellee br.at must submit exception requests during periods that the secretary designates from time to time or within days of other events not relevant here.prm.providers submit requests to their fiscal intermediaries,private organizations such as insurance companies.id.intermediaries have fifteen working days to review requests and forward them to hhs with their recommendations.id.the hhs division responsible for initially reviewing exception requests,the centers for medicare medicaid services cms,has sixty working days in which to deny requests,or they are automatically approved.b.because this period includes the fifteen days that intermediaries have to review applications,cms actually has only working days in which to complete its review.
located in bethlehem,pennsylvania,appellant luke hospital applied for an exception to the prevailing esrd composite rate,seeking reimbursement at a rate of per treatment above the composite rate of.luke based its request on its asserted atypical service intensity,claiming that it had to spend an abnormally high amount of money on staff salaries because the population it served was both atypically old and unusually likely to suffer from acute conditions requiring intensive treatment.luke submitted its request on the last day of the relevant period.
after reviewing the hospital request,the fiscal intermediary forwarded it to cms with a recommendation that it be approved.cms denied the request,however,citing two problems luke failed to explain why its cost for hemodialysis maintenance increased nineteen percent between and,and it provided no explanation for why the number of hours that its nurses and technicians worked tripled between and.because of these deficiencies,cms concluded that luke failed to present,as hhs regulations require,convincing objective evidence showing not only that it met the listed criterion atypical patient mix,but also that this atypical mix caused the hospital unusually high costs.see g.
luke appealed cms denial to the provider reimbursement review board prrb,the hhs division responsible for reviewing cms decisions.see a.reversing cms denial and granting the hospital requested exception,the prrb ruled first that cms had improperly cited prm section e,which applies only when a facility seeks an exception based on its status as an isolated essential facility.luke made no claim to be such a facility.as to the tripling of nurse and technician hours,the prrb stated that the hospital request contained an obvious error for each of three categories of nurses,licensed practical nurses,and.luke reported the combined number of hours for all three categories.although the three groups of workers actually worked a combined total of hours during the relevant year,luke gave that number for each category,making the total for the three categories appear three times the actual figure and roughly three times what it had been in other years.the prrb concluded that because the correct data appeared elsewhere in the hospital request and were thus available to cms,the agency erred in failing to conduct further review of the obvious error.luke hosp.blue cross blue shield ass n,prrb hearing,transfer binder medicare medicaid guide cch,at,reprinted in.cms must,the prrb stated,properly review all information submitted.observance of an obvious error and not responding to it is patently wrong and unfair to this provider.id.
the cms administrator,pursuant to statutory authority,see f,decided on his own motion to review the prrb decision,which he reversed.according to the administrator,even if cms had conducted further review of the hospital obvious error,it would have been unable to resolve the problem because contrary to the prrb contention,the hospital exception request nowhere contained the correct number of total hours.the request contained only the total number of nurses and technicians.although luke suggested that cms could have obtained the hourly figures by multiplying the employee totals by number of hours that hhs regulations assume employees work per administrator pointed out that even if cms had done this extra work,there would have been an unexplained discrepancy of approximately hours between the figures and the projected figures.in any event,the administrator ruled,cms has no duty to perfect exception requests.hhs regulations make unequivocally clear that the provider bears the burden of proving to cms satisfaction that it deserves an exception.luke hosp.blue cross blue shield ass n,hcfa adm r,transfer binder medicare medicaid guide cch,at june,reprinted in.the administrator also pointed out that although cms normally would have given luke a chance to submit additional information,it did not do so because the hospital submitted its exception request on the last day of the window,meaning that it could not have provided additional data before the window closed.see also prm a stating that a request for supplemental information does not extend the original window.
luke challenged the administrator decision,which represented the secretary final determination,in the united states district court for the district of columbia.see f providing for such review.granting summary judgment for the secretary,the district court analyzed the case much as the cms administrator had,although unlike the administrator the court addressed cms improper reliance on the prm section that applies only to isolated facility exceptions.deeming the citation to this section a typographical error,the court concluded that it did not transform the plaintiff s deficient request into something else.luke hosp.thompson,d.
luke now appeals.because the district court entered a summary judgment,we review its decision de novo and therefore,in effect,review directly the decision of the secretary.lozowski mineta.employing familiar apa standards,we will set aside the secretary decision only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see also f providing that the apa standard applies in cases involving denials of exception requests.
we begin with the error in the hospital exception request.as noted above,the request incorrectly stated that each of three hospital registered nurses,licensed practical nurses,and hours,for a total of hours.in fact,the three groups worked a combined hours luke accidentally listed the total for each group.cms rejected the hospital request because,among other things,the error left it unable to properly evaluate the provider request for the additional salary costs.
