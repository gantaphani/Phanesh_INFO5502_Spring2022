archbishop edward,brigid roman catholic congregation,and the greater baltimore center for pregnancy concerns,the pregnancy center commenced this action against the mayor and city council of baltimore,challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance,which requires that pregnancy centers,such as the pregnancy center,post signs disclaiming that they do not provide or make referral for abortion or birth control services.the complaint alleges that the ordinance,both facially and as applied to the plaintiffs,violates the plaintiffs free speech,free exercise,and equal protection rights under the first and fourteenth amendments to the constitution,as well as the plaintiffs rights under the conscience clause of maryland health law.
the district court granted summary judgment to the pregnancy center on its freedom of speech count,dismissed the archbishop and brigid as plaintiffs for lack of standing,and dismissed the remaining counts without prejudice,in view of its free speech ruling.the court held that the disclaimer required by ordinance is a form of compelled speech that alters the course of a pregnancy center communication with a client or prospective client about abortion and and is based,at least in part,on disagreement with the viewpoint of the speaker.the court entered a permanent injunction barring enforcement of the ordinance.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
in december,the city of baltimore enacted ordinance.the ordinance applies to pregnancy centers,which are defined as any person 
whose primary purpose is to provide services and 
i for a fee or as a free service,provides information about services but 
ii does not provide or refer for 
a abortions or 
b nondirective and comprehensive services.
baltimore city health code.under the ordinance,a pregnancy center must provide its clients and potential clients with a disclaimer substantially to the effect that the center does not provide or make referral for abortion or services.id.a.this disclaimer must be made through one or more easily readable signs that are conspicuously posted in the center waiting room and written in english and spanish.id.b.the failure to comply with the terms of the ordinance is punishable by a citation carrying a maximum civil penalty of.id.
the legislative record indicates that the president of the baltimore city council introduced bill later to become ordinance,after the city council president had met with abortion rights advocacy groups,which complained that some pregnancy clinics provide inaccurate information to women about abortions.a spokesperson for the city council president explained in a public statement the bill deals with whether women are told up front what the facts are.women need to know up front what to expect when they go into these centers.the bill synopsis presented to the city council stated that the bill was introduced because of the importance of choice.
at the hearings on the bill,representatives of planned parenthood of maryland,naral pro choice maryland,and other groups spoke in favor of the bill,and representatives of the archbishop,the maryland right to life committee,and other groups spoke in opposition.the bill was enacted in november and became law on december.
the pregnancy center is a pregnancy center,as defined in ordinance,operating in baltimore city from two locations and providing services to pregnant women,such as pregnancy testing classes in prenatal development,parenting,and life skills bible studies and material support for women through its hannah cupboard program,including diapers,formula,baby and maternity clothes,toys,and books.it also provides women with information on abstinence and natural family planning,a form of birth control,but does not provide referrals for abortions or other methods of birth control.the pregnancy center does not charge its clients for any of its services,which it provides through paid employees and volunteers,each of whom must sign a statement affirming his or her christian faith and belief that abortion is immoral.
archbishop edward,the archbishop of baltimore,is a corporate entity that owns the property on which the pregnancy center operates one of its locations and on which brigid roman catholic church operates.neither the archbishop nor brigid charges the pregnancy center for the use of its space on the property.
in march,before any enforcement of ordinance,the archbishop,brigid,and the pregnancy center commenced this action against the mayor and city council of baltimore alleging violations of the free speech and free assembly clauses of the first amendment,the free exercise clause of the first amendment,the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,and the conscience clause in maryland code,health general,a providing that a person may not be required to refer for any medical procedure that results in termination of pregnancy and that the refusal to provide abortion referrals may not be a basis for c ivil liability to another person or d isciplinary or other recriminatory action.the complaint alleges that the pregnancy center does not provide or refer for abortions,based on moral and religious beliefs,and that ordinance specifically targets pregnancy centers such as the pregnancy center and thus regulates communications at the pregnancy center that are personal,moral,political,and religious.it also states that by requiring a disclaimer that the pregnancy center does not provide or refer for abortions,the ordinance compels plaintiffs to deliver the implied message that these services are available elsewhere and should be considered,thus appearing to legitimize such services,in violation of the plaintiffs beliefs.the complaint also objects to the ordinance requirement that the pregnancy center post a sign saying that it does not provide birth control services,when in fact it does in the form of education about abstinence and natural family planning,which,the complaint asserts,are medically recognized means of birth control.the plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face as applied to plaintiffs and an injunction prohibiting the ordinance enforcement.some two months after they filed their complaint but before the city filed its answer,the plaintiffs also filed a motion for partial summary judgment on their free speech and equal protection claims.
the city filed a motion to dismiss under federal rules of civil procedure b and b,alleging that the archbishop and brigid lacked standing to sue and that the complaint otherwise failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted.in response to the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,the city submitted an affidavit of an expert witness,along with a motion under rule f,requesting further discovery to amplify its response.
following a hearing on the motions,the district court entered an order dated january,granting the city motion to dismiss the archbishop and brigid for lack of standing denying the city motion to dismiss,which it converted to a motion for summary judgment in view of the additional materials submitted by the parties denying the city request for further discovery as not necessary to the issue being decided granting the pregnancy center motion for summary judgment on its free speech claim,as set forth in count dismissing without prejudice the plaintiffs remaining claims in view of its ruling on the free speech claim and entering a judgment permanently enjoining the enforcement of the ordinance.in granting summary judgment to the pregnancy center on its free speech claim,the court applied strict scrutiny as the result of its conclusion that the ordinance compelled speech and was not viewpoint neutral and concluded that the ordinance violated the pregnancy center free speech rights.
from the district court judgment,the city appealed,challenging all of the court rulings except the dismissal of the archbishop and brigid.and the archbishop and brigid filed a,challenging their dismissal for lack of standing.
we address first the plaintiffs challenging the district court dismissal of the archbishop and brigid for lack of standing to challenge ordinance.the district court reasoned that because the archbishop and brigid are not,and do not operate,pregnancy centers subject to the ordinance,the ordinance does not require the archbishop and brigid to take any action and does not subject them to liability under the law.the court concluded,therefore,that the archbishop and brigid did not suffer a concrete and particularized injury,as required under lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
the archbishop and brigid argue that the district court ignored the injury that they suffer as a result of the ordinance infringement of their right to freedom of speech.they maintain that because they own the building in which the pregnancy center is located,they suffer a constitutional harm when they are forced to use their private property as a billboard for the state ideological message quoting wooley maynard,d.they also argue that the baltimore city health code leaves open the possibility that the city might seek to enforce the ordinance against the owner of the property used by the pregnancy center,citing baltimore city health code.
although ordinance does require speech to be posted on property owned by the archbishop and brigid,its mandate only applies to the space operated by the pregnancy center.the archbishop and brigid do not qualify as a pregnancy center and they do not operate the pregnancy center.indeed,the space where the disclosure would be located is separate from the portions of the building,and a regular visitor to the church would not see the disclaimer sign unless visiting the pregnancy center itself.in these circumstances it would be most doubtful that anyone would attribute the government message to the archbishop or brigid,rather than to the pregnancy center or the city.
the archbishop and brigid suggestion that they do not charge for the use of their space and thus are not ordinary landlords does not change the analysis.if anything,this fact might cut against them because,by their own admission,their interest in the ordinance is related primarily to a desire to promote life over abortion.ideological injuries of this sort,without more,have routinely been held insufficient to support standing,see,sierra club morton,d,even when those ideologies are intertwined with religious beliefs,see,harris mcrae.
we also conclude that there is little likelihood that the archbishop or brigid could face liability if the pregnancy center violated ordinance.by its terms,the ordinance only authorizes the issuance of environmental or civil citations to pregnancy centers themselves,and contains no provisions for liability of landlords.see baltimore city health code.and the portion of the city health code that the archbishop and brigid cite as a potential basis for liability,relates only to nuisance abatement it has no connection to ordinance and does not indicate that a failure to comply with the other,regulations can be penalized.see baltimore city health code defining nuisances id.enforcement provisions.
accordingly,we affirm the district court ruling that the archbishop and brigid lack standing to challenge the ordinance.
in its appeal,the city contends first that the district court erred in applying strict scrutiny to the ordinance.it argues that the ordinance,even though compelling speech,compels commercial speech,which is subject to a lower level of scrutiny,involving the determination of whether the disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the state interest in preventing deception of customers.alternatively,the city urges us to draw on the disclosure requirements of election law and abortion regulation,with respect to which cases have applied an exacting scrutiny standard or other intermediate scrutiny standard.
the pregnancy center contends that compelling someone to speak a message that the speaker would not otherwise make is a regulation that is subject to strict scrutiny.responding to the city argument that ordinance compels commercial speech,the pregnancy center maintains that,to the contrary,the ordinance targets its free provision of information about pregnancy and not any proposal for a commercial transaction.indeed,it notes that it does not sell any goods or services.at bottom,it asserts that no case supports the city claim that government can require private speakers to post a message in their waiting room to all visitors,at all times unrelated to any commercial transaction being proposed by the speaker.
we begin by noting that the ordinance does indeed compel the pregnancy center to speak,mandating it to post a sign that it does not provide or make referral for abortion or services.moreover,in compelling that speech,the pregnancy center is,in this case,required to participate in the city effort to tell pregnant women that abortions are available elsewhere as a morally acceptable alternative,contrary to the moral and religious beliefs of the pregnancy center.a representative of the pregnancy center stated that absent the ordinance mandate,the pregnancy center would not speak to clients and potential clients in the manner required by the ordinance.
it is that a regulation compelling noncommercial speech is subject to strict scrutiny and must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.united states playboy entm t group,d riley fed of the blind of,d.the first amendment protects not only the right to speak freely,but also the right to refrain from speaking at all.wooley maynard,d see also hurley irish american gay,lesbian,bisexual group of boston,d o ne important manifestation of the principle of free speech is that one who chooses to speak may also decide what not to say internal quotation marks omitted.because m andating speech that a speaker would not otherwise make necessarily alters the content of the speech,laws that compel speech are normally considered regulation s of speech and therefore are subject to strict scrutiny.riley,at.indeed,strict scrutiny applies even in cases where the compelled disclosure is limited to factually accurate or statements.id.at invalidating a requirement that professional disclose to potential donors the percentage of charitable contributions collected during the previous months that were actually turned over to the charity see also hurley,at the general rule that the speaker has the right to tailor the speech applies not only to expressions of value,opinion,or endorsement,but equally to statements of fact.
the city does not take issue with these first amendment principles,generally.rather,it argues that the speech mandated here is commercial speech and therefore is subject to the lower standard of judicial scrutiny applicable to commercial speech.alternatively,it argues that the speech mandated here is analogous to disclosures or disclosures,both of which have been evaluated under a lower level of scrutiny than strict scrutiny.we address each of these arguments in order.
in making the argument that ordinance regulates commercial speech,the city contends that when a pregnancy center offers to provide commercially valuable,goods or services to a consumer,the pregnancy center is proposing a commercial transaction.specifically,the city asserts that although many pregnancy centers operate as,they effectively engage in commerce by offering pregnancy testing,sonograms,and options counseling,all of which have commercial value,garnering payments and fees in the marketplace.appellants br.at citing camps,town of harrison,d holding that a nonprofit summer camp was engaged in commerce for purposes of the dormant commerce clause.the city formulation of the commercial speech doctrine,however,is not supported by the law.
the supreme court has defined commercial speech as expression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.cent.hudson gas pub.serv.comm of,d.stated in another way,the hallmark of commercial speech is that it does no more than propose a commercial transaction.bolger youngs drug prods,d internal quotation marks omitted see also martin redish,commercial speech,first amendment intuitionism and the twilight zone of viewpoint discrimination,loy,t he supreme court has unambiguously adopted the view that commercial speech is confined to expression advocating purchase.in some circumstances,such as when expression clearly promotes a speaker economic interests,speech may be classified as commercial even when it can not be characterized merely as proposals to engage in commercial transactions.bolger,at holding that advertisements discussing the health benefits of contraceptives were commercial speech see also wag more dogs.liab.cozart,wl cir.may,holding that business outdoor mural was commercial speech where business conceded mural was advertising and had an economic motivation for displaying the painting.but speech does not retain its commercial character when it is inextricably intertwined with otherwise fully protected speech.riley,at.
rather than regulating traditional commercial advertising,ordinance targets speech regarding the provision of free services.while this fact alone might not be dispositive,it becomes so in this case because there is no indication that the pregnancy center is motivated by any economic interest or that it is proposing any commercial transaction.the pregnancy center seeks to provide free information about pregnancy,abortion,and birth control as informed by a religious and political belief.this kind of ideologically driven speech has routinely been afforded the highest levels of first amendment protection,even when accompanied by offers of commercially valuable services.see,in re primus,d holding that a lawyer solicitation of client was protected by the first amendment because the lawyer actions were undertaken to express personal political beliefs and to advance objectives rather than to derive financial gain.
the city argument does not address what commercial transaction is proposed by the pregnancy center speech or what economic interest motivates the pregnancy center speech.instead,the city would define commercial speech to include any speech that offers services which have commercial value,garnering payments and fees in the marketplace generally.adopting this definition of commercial speech would effect an unprecedented expansion of the commercial speech doctrine and is unsupported by citation to any applicable supreme court precedent.as the district court explained,the city position would mean that any house of worship offering their congregants sacramental wine,communion wafers,prayer beads,or other objects with commercial value,would find their accompanying speech subject to diminished constitutional protection.indeed,it is difficult to imagine any charitable organization whose speech would not be considered commercial under the city proposed broad definition.
in short,we agree with the district court that the pregnancy centers are not engaged in commercial speech and that their speech can not be denied the full protection of strict scrutiny on that basis.
the city argues alternatively that if the pregnancy center speech is not considered commercial speech,it should still be accorded reduced protection because the disclaimer required by ordinance is analogous to the disclosure requirements imposed on abortion providers and in campaign finance laws,both of which are subject to a lower level of scrutiny than strict scrutiny.see planned parenthood of southeastern casey,d plurality opinion applying intermediate scrutiny to disclosure requirements under pennsylvania abortion law citizens united fed.election comm n,d applying exacting scrutiny to campaign finance disclosure requirements.
the differing contexts of the speech restrictions in those cases,however,render the cases inapplicable to the compelled speech before us.in casey,the mandatory disclosures focused on the speech of licensed medical professionals,and the regulations were upheld because,even though they implicated a physician right not to speak,they did so only as part of the practice of medicine,subject to reasonable licensing and regulation by the state.casey,at.more particularly,the regulations there were permissible because they facilitated the process of obtaining a patient informed consent prior to performing a medical procedure.thus the regulation of such professional speech was imposed incidental to the broader governmental regulation of a profession and was justified by this larger context.in contrast,the pregnancy centers that are subject to ordinance do not practice medicine,are not staffed by licensed professionals,and need not satisfy the informed consent requirement 
similarly,the exacting scrutiny standard applied to finance disclosure laws in the campaign finance cases is justified by circumstances that are also not applicable here.in the supreme court cases of citizens united and buckley valeo,d,the court drew a distinction between regulations that limit campaign contributions and restrict campaign activities and regulations that merely require the disclosure of objective financial information.the supreme court has never suggested that buckley holding that disclosure requirements do not substantially burden speech applies to speech regulations more generally.see doe reed,d we have a series of precedents considering first amendment challenges to disclosure requirements in the electoral context emphasis added.while disclosure of campaign contributions or expenditures will always be limited to factual information,the line between fact and opinion in most compelled speech cases will be much harder to draw.thus,campaign finance disclosure laws are less likely to be impermissibly content or and pose a lower risk of altering the speaker message.the regulation imposed by ordinance,however,burdens the content of speech generally,requiring pregnancy centers to speak in a manner that they might otherwise wish to avoid.this type of regulation is significantly more analogous to the restrictions on campaign speech that the court held were subject to strict scrutiny.see citizens united.at buckley,at.
accordingly,we affirm the district court conclusion that ordinance regulates the pregnancy center fully protected,speech and therefore is subject to strict scrutiny 
speech regulations are presumptively invalid.city of paul,d.the city thus bears the burden of rebutting the presumption of invalidity.playboy entm t group,at.indeed,i t is rare that a regulation restricting speech because of its content will ever be permissible.id.at.the city can,nonetheless,rebut the presumption if it is able to show that the ordinance is narrowly tailored to promote a compelling government interest,such that the ordinance is the least restrictive alternative to serve the government purpose.id.at ashcroft aclu,d.
the city claims it can satisfy this strict scrutiny standard,arguing that it has at least two compelling interests served by the ordinance and that the ordinance is narrowly tailored to promote those interests.first,the city claims that it has an interest in countering what it maintains are the deceptive business practices of certain pregnancy centers.according to the city,these practices include deceptive advertising,delaying tactics intended to prevent women from obtaining abortions,and misleading statements about the medical and psychological impact of abortion.to support this argument,the city cites two reports that purport to document the deceptive practices of pregnancy centers a report prepared for representative henry waxman,and a report compiled by the naral pro choice maryland fund detailing the results of its investigation of pregnancy centers in maryland.
second,the city argues that it has an interest in protecting the health of pregnant women and in ensuring that pregnant women who seek abortions have prompt access to medical services.the city notes that the risks and costs associated with abortion increase as a woman advances through her pregnancy.similarly,the city contends that delays in access to the method of an individual choice can leave the individual and his or her partner vulnerable to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease.thus,the city argues,delays in obtaining abortion services pose a clear threat to public health.
to be sure,the city has a considerable interest in promoting the general health and of its citizens.but as the supreme court recently reiterated,to demonstrate the existence of a compelling interest,a government must specifically identify an actual problem in need of solving.brown entm t merchants ass n,d quoting playboy entm t group,at.although the existence of such a problem need not be exhaustively documented,the government must present more than anecdote and supposition to support a speech restriction.playboy entm t group,at.with respect to ordinance,and the pregnancy center,the city failed to carry its burden to show a compelling interest.
here,the record establishes,at most,only isolated instances of misconduct by pregnancy centers generally,and,as the city concedes,none by the pregnancy center itself.indeed,the record contains no evidence that any woman has been misled into believing that any pregnancy center subject to ordinance was a medical clinic or that a woman in baltimore delayed seeking medical services because of such a misconception.the city instead cites allegations of deceptive practices occurring in other locations or reports of stories about harassment.the city failure to provide more than speculative evidence of problems at baltimore pregnancy centers strongly suggests that the need for regulation of those centers is not as pressing as the city asserts.
the city claim of a compelling interest is also called into question by its selective pursuit of its interest.while the city asserts that it is primarily concerned with ensuring that women receive accurate information about their pregnancies,ordinance does not focus on or reach the vast majority of sources that pregnant women would likely consult.bookstores,websites,religious leaders,and pregnant women friends and family all of whom might potentially provide a woman with incorrect information about her pregnancy are unaffected by the ordinance.this kind of underinclusiveness raises serious doubts about whether the government is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes,rather than disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint.brown.at see also church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d where government restricts only conduct protected by the first amendment and fails to enact feasible measures to restrict other conduct producing substantial harm or alleged harm of the same sort,the interest given in justification of the restriction is not compelling.
moreover,the city claim to be promoting a compelling interest is seriously undermined by its failure to pursue any other course to promote its interest other than to restrict the pregnancy center speech.this fact is particularly salient based on the city admission that the record reflects that it has done nothing other than enact ordinance to combat the perceived danger of misleading information from the pregnancy center and like facilities.the need was thus not so compelling as to cause the city to post a single notice in any city building or facility,to place a warning on its own,or to give any public service information in furtherance of its interest.the city also conceded that it has referred and continues to refer women to the pregnancy center without any forewarning as to the danger of misinformation the city believes the women will encounter there.to find,with these facts,that the city has shown a compelling interest would be dubious at best.
we need not,however,rely entirely on the weakness of the city demonstration that in enacting the ordinance,it was promoting a compelling government interest,because the more significant problem for the city the one that we find fatal is that the ordinance is not narrowly tailored to serve the city interest.a statute is narrowly tailored if it targets and eliminates no more than the exact source of the evil it seeks to remedy.frisby schultz,d.broad prophylactic rules in the area of free expression are suspect.precision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms.naacp button,d citations omitted.courts may find that a statute is not narrowly tailored when,among other things,the statute does not advance the purported compelling interests,meyer grant,d or when the statute is overinclusive,simon schuster,members of the state crime victims,d or when the government has other,less alternatives available,playboy entm t group,at.we conclude that ordinance is an example of all three of these indicators.
first,the ordinance purports to target false advertising,yet it fails actually to regulate deceptive practices or false advertising.further,the ordinance applies to all pregnancy centers regardless of whether they advertise at all.
second,the ordinance is overinclusive in that it applies equally to pregnancy centers that engage in deceptive practices and those whose speech is entirely truthful.see fed.election comm.citizens for life,d stating that for a law to be narrowly tailored government must curtail speech only to the degree necessary to meet the particular problem at hand and must avoid infringing on speech that does not pose the danger that has prompted regulation.
finally,there are also several alternatives that would address the problems targeted by the ordinance while imposing a lesser burden on speech.most obviously,the city could speak with its own voice.it might,for example,use its own resources to undertake public education campaigns addressing the alleged dangers of pregnancy centers,or more generally,promoting consultation with physicians for pregnant women.liquormart,rhode island,d it is perfectly obvious that alternative forms of regulation that would not involve any restriction on speech would be more likely to achieve the state goal of promoting temperance e ducational campaigns focused on the problems of excessive,or even moderate,drinking might prove to be more effective.the city could also produce a document or website listing local pregnancy centers and noting what services are available at each.see riley,at t he state may itself publish the detailed financial disclosure forms it requires professional fundraisers to file.this procedure would communicate the desired information to the public without burdening a speaker with unwanted speech.and the city always retains the option of prosecuting violations of its criminal and civil laws that proscribe deceptive advertising and deceptive statements made by pregnancy centers.see riley,at see also nefedro montgomery,holding that fraud laws were a less restrictive alternative to a law prohibiting remuneration for fortunetelling.
that the city resorted to speech restrictions before trying these or other similar options is more than enough to doom the ordinance.see thompson western states med,d if the first amendment means anything,it means that regulating speech must be a last not first resort.
the city seeks to salvage the ordinance by arguing that it imposes on pregnancy centers a burden that is de minimis,and that the signage requirement is less restrictive than other methods of communicating the disclaimer.the city suggests,for example,that it could have required the disclaimer to be included on every page of a pregnancy center website,as well as text in all paid advertisements,brochures,and other written materials.but this argument does not save the law.first,the impact is not minimal.as the district court found below,the ordinance inevitably alters the course of a center communications with a client or potential client by requiring that the pregnancy center initial communication occur in the presence of a stark and immediate statement about abortion and.second,even a de minimis restriction on speech would not make the ordinance the least restrictive option,as required to survive strict scrutiny.see playboy entm t group,at.
in sum,while the city has not demonstrated a compelling government interest rather than simply its disfavor with a particular speaker speech,we do not rest on that failure because ordinance is not narrowly tailored to promote the city interest so as to justify its intrusion on the pregnancy center speech.accordingly,we hold that ordinance is invalid,in violation of the first amendment presumption that speakers,not the government,know best both what they want to say and how to say it.riley,at.
finally,the city contends that the district court abused its discretion in converting its motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment,without giving it prior notice and without allowing it discovery before deciding the motion,and in dismissing the plaintiffs remaining counts other than the free speech count without prejudice,rather than with prejudice.we find no error in these rulings and also see no prejudice to the city.
by converting the city rule b motion into a summary judgment motion,the district court did not deny the city its opportunity to press its claim that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.this procedural ruling,in the context of the plaintiffs pending motion for summary judgment,simply gave recognition to the fact that the court would be looking at the case more broadly on plaintiffs summary judgment motion.because of that motion,the city was on notice that the court would be considering matters beyond the complaint to resolve the plaintiffs free speech claim and that the city should,if it wished,file a response to that motion for summary judgment.the procedural conversion in this context had the effect simply of allowing the court to consider the parties dispositive motions as for summary judgment and take into account any evidence that the parties might wish to submit.and indeed,the city did submit matters outside of the complaint and its motion to dismiss for consideration by the court.
the city argues that additional discovery would have given it the opportunity to gather additional support for key factual propositions,including that pregnancy centers engage in deceptive advertising,such deception threatens public health,and the provision of services by pregnancy centers is a form commerce.the dissent adopts the same position.but as the district court explained,additional discovery was unnecessary.the district court assumed for purposes of its analysis that the ordinance served the compelling interests that the city claimed.instead of exploring any factual context that might be relevant to that proposition,the court struck down ordinance because it was not narrowly tailored,a problem that was apparent on the face of the ordinance.whether a regulation meets the narrowly tailored requirement is of course a question of law.united states doe,see also vill.of schaumburg citizens for a better env t,d overbreadth is a question of law that involved no dispute about the characteristics of the law being challenged.because additional discovery could not eliminate the narrow tailoring problems,as we have discussed above,the court was well within its rights to decide the first amendment issues on the record before it.sable commc ns of,d affirming district court grant of preliminary injunction where the record contained no legislative findings that would justify us in concluding that there is no constitutionally acceptable less restrictive means,short of a total ban,to achieve the government interest solantic,llc city of neptune beach,cir invalidating sign regulation without discovery because t he first amendment questions were purely legal and only minimally intertwined with the facts.
the city remaining justification for discovery that it was necessary to show that pregnancy centers engage in commercial speech is also unavailing.the district court found that the law on its face regulated protected,speech.the individual characteristics of any particular pregnancy center would thus be irrelevant to this determination,a fact the city itself acknowledged during a hearing on the parties motions 
the court t he city council was concerned about this individual center.there the legislative history.they were concerned about the generalities of it.so i do see where we would advance the ball one way or the other on the facial challenge by knowing what these particular people the plaintiffs did.
counsel for the city i agree with you.
moreover,as the district court recognized,even if some speech of regulated pregnancy centers included commercial elements,strict scrutiny would still apply because those elements would be inextricably intertwined with otherwise fully protected speech.thus,for example,an advertisement offering a pregnant woman the opportunity to see a picture of your baby is both an offer to provide a service a sonogram and a political statement regarding the status of fetal life.contrary to the dissent claims,the commercial and political aspects of a statement of this kind can not be easily separated,as the dissent suggests.indeed,the supreme court rejected precisely this argument in riley in the course of holding that solicitations by professional fundraisers were not commercial speech.see riley,at w e can not parcel out the speech,applying one test to one phrase and another test to another phrase.such an endeavor would be both artificial and impractical.therefore,we apply our test for fully protected expression.thus,even if additional discovery could somehow uncover facts suggesting that the pregnancy center itself or other pregnancy centers engaged in some amount of commercial speech because,for instance,they may have charged money for some of their services,the district court reasoning would still have led to the application of strict scrutiny.
in sum,the city has been unable to point to any item of discovery or fact that would have assisted the district court in addressing the issues that have been appealed.
finally,the city contention that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the pregnancy center remaining counts without prejudice,rather than with prejudice,lacks merit.the district court did not reach the merits of the pregnancy center other claims,which on their face were not frivolous.it simply dismissed those counts because it awarded the pregnancy center all the relief that it had requested,based on its ruling on the free speech count.
for the reasons given,the judgment of the district court is 
i lament that,in its haste to wholly and permanently enjoin the city of baltimore enforcement of its duly enacted ordinance,the district court has flouted foundational legal principles.rushing to summary judgment,the court subverted the federal rules of civil procedure rules designed to further the venerable constitutional principle of due process,see nelson adams usa,d by,inter alia,denying the city essential discovery,refusing to view in the city favor what evidence there is,and making untoward findings of fact,often premised on nothing more than the court own supposition.meanwhile,thinly disguising its first amendment analysis of the ordinance as a facial review,the court prematurely and unfairly discounted the real possibility that the ordinance targets only commercial speech,condemned the ordinance as viewpoint discriminatory,and,applying strict scrutiny,nullified the ordinance for lack of narrow tailoring.the court decision is,in a word,indefensible.
nevertheless,the panel majority not only endorses the district court unseemly approach,but engages in further imprudence.as but one example,while the district court was at least willing to assume that the ordinance is undergirded by a compelling interest,the majority opines at length on the insufficiency and insincerity of the interests and positions advanced by the city.because these proceedings have thus followed a course more fitting a kangaroo court than a court of the united states,i write separately in dissent 
in order to properly explain the defective rulings of the district court and the panel majority,i briefly retrace the genesis of the ordinance and the fleeting procedural history of this case.
in response to congressional and statewide reports that women were being deceived by pregnancy centers,baltimore city council conducted hearings on the issue in.as the majority acknowledges,the city council,prior to its adoption of the ordinance,specifically considered the waxman and naral reports documenting a pattern of deceptive practices by pregnancy centers nationwide.the waxman report found that several such centers throughout the county were using deceptive advertising techniques to attract women seeking abortions and comprehensive services.those techniques included placing ads in the telephone book yellow pages under abortion services and on the internet generated by keyword searches of abortion and abortion clinics.see the naral report found that similar deceptive practices were being used by pregnancy centers in maryland,including in the city of baltimore.during its hearings,the city council heard evidence from a number of women complaining about being deceived by pregnancy center advertising.see id.at.one witness related her experience as a teenager,being subjected to advocacy when she visited a pregnancy center because it advertised in the telephone book under abortion counseling.id.at.a college professor referenced countless stories from female students who had similar experiences when they visited pregnancy centers.id.at.
the evidence relied on by the city council revealed that pregnancy centers were using questionable tactics to delay women from accessing abortions.such tactics included counseling women to undergo pregnancy tests and sonograms that were scheduled weeks after their initial pregnancy center visit,and misinforming women about abortion services,including when abortions could be lawfully obtained.such delays placed the health of women who decided to have abortions at risk,as n umerous studies have shown that it is safest to have an abortion within the first trimester.see.
importantly,the city health department studied the matter and supported the council adoption of the proposed ordinance,agreeing that it was imperative that all baltimore city women have the ability to obtain factual and timely advice on all available health care options.before taking action,the city council prudently sought the views of the city solicitor,who concluded that the proposed ordinance did not contravene the first amendment.by letter opinion of october,the solicitor advised the council that 
the ordinance requires disclosure of factual,truthful,information namely,whether or not abortion or birth control services are provided at a given facility.the ordinance serves the purpose of preventing misleading advertising practices of pregnancy services centers and furthers the city interest in ensuring a woman seeking these services in the city is fully informed of what services are available at any given location and can find the services that she needs in a timely manner whether they be abortion or birth control services or any of the many other pregnancy related services that a woman may be seeking the ordinance,therefore,does not violate the st amendment right to freedom of speech.
id.at.during a public hearing on the proposed ordinance,its sponsor in the council clarified that the bill is not about an abortion debate,but a simple sign to make sure no one is misled and pregnancy center clients know what to expect.id.at.
thus,after considering the matter thoroughly,the council concluded that the various deceptive practices of pregnancy centers posed a danger to public health.as a result,on december,the city council enacted the ordinance,which took effect on january.
on march,the plaintiffs in this case including the greater baltimore center for pregnancy concerns,incorporated the center challenged the ordinance in federal court,asserting various constitutional defects,including free speech,free assembly,free exercise,and equal protection,plus related state law claims.on june,barely two months after service of the complaint and four days before the city responsive pleading was due the center moved for summary judgment on its free speech and equal protection challenges.no party had by then either initiated or conducted discovery consistent with the lack of discovery,the city,on june,filed a rule b motion seeking dismissal of the complaint.then,on july,in response to the center summary judgment motion,the city filed a declaration pursuant to rule f,averring that it could not adequately oppose summary judgment without first conducting discovery the declaration 
the declaration specified that the city needed the opportunity to develop expert testimony to provide factual support for the propositions that deceptive advertising by pregnancy centers threatens public health in a variety of ways.the declaration also explained that the city desired and required the opportunity to conduct discovery concerning the advertising that the center and other pregnancy centers employ,so it may demonstrate the advertising deceptive character.id.at.the city requested discovery to develop factual support for its argument that the services offered by the center are a form of commerce,and,therefore,the disclaimer required by the ordinance is commercial speech.id.
additionally,the city filed the declaration of an expert,robert blum,the blum declaration,seeking to substantiate the city compelling interests advanced by the ordinance.more specifically,blum explained that,because family planning improves the health and of women and their children,public health is promoted by providing complete and accurate information to women about their health care options.women who can plan the number and timing of their births,blum observed,experience fewer unwanted pregnancies and births and have lower rates of abortion.id.young and poor women,however,are particularly vulnerable to being deceived by pregnancy centers that fail to disclose the scope of services that they provide.id.at.
on august,the district court heard argument on the city motion to dismiss and the center summary judgment motion.the court advised the parties,however,that if it intended to award summary judgment to the center on its challenge,discovery would be necessary.by its january,decision,the court denied the city discovery requests and converted the city pending rule b motion to dismiss into a rule motion for summary judgment.see mayor of,d.the court then treated the parties respective submissions as for summary judgment,ruling for the center on its free speech claim and dismissing without prejudice and as moot each of the center remaining claims.on january,the court fully and permanently enjoined enforcement of the ordinance 
as a general proposition,summary judgment is appropriate only after adequate time for discovery.evans tech.applications serv,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in the main,discovery is essential in a contested proceeding prior to summary judgment because a party can show that the relevant facts are undisputed only by 
a citing to particular parts of materials in the record,including depositions,documents,electronically stored information,affidavits or declarations,stipulations,admissions,interrogatory answers,or other materials or 
b showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute,or that an adverse party can not produce admissible evidence to support the fact.
c.hence,by its very nature,the summary judgment process presupposes the existence of an adequate record.doe abington friends,cir.at minimum,a court must refuse summary judgment where the nonmoving party has not had the opportunity to discover information that is essential to its opposition.see nader blair,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the city took the proper course when it filed the declaration,stating that it could not properly oppose summary judgment without a chance to conduct discovery.see harrods sixty internet domain names,cir internal quotation marks omitted deeming summary judgment award premature where,inter alia,court made its award only six weeks after complaint was filed,before significant discovery.such a declaration is broadly favored and should be liberally granted because the rule is designed to safeguard parties from summary judgment motions that they can not adequately oppose.raby livingston,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord harrods,at.nevertheless,the district court decided that the city discovery requests were merely an attempt to generate justifications for the ordinance following its enactment,d at.the court explained that discovery was unnecessary in examining whether the ordinance,on its face,is subject to,and satisfies,the applicable level of scrutiny.id.indeed,the court considered itself constrained to base its decision on the evidence relied on by the city at the time the ordinance was passed.id.
we review for abuse of discretion a district court denial of discovery before ruling on a summary judgment motion.nader,at.a court abuses its discretion,however,when its conclusion is guided by erroneous legal principles or rests upon a clearly erroneous factual finding.belk,meyer,cir internal quotation marks omitted.as explained below,the district court rationale for denying the city its right to discovery was patently erroneous.
as an initial matter,the district court legally erred in denying discovery prior to converting the city motion to dismiss into a request for summary judgment.the majority states that the city was on notice that the court would be considering matters beyond the complaint to resolve the plaintiffs free speech claim.ante at.as we have previously explained,however,notification that a rule b motion may be converted is only one of the requirements for a proper conversion o nce notified,a party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity for discovery before a rule b motion may be converted and summary judgment granted.gay wall,cir internal quotation marks omitted see du pont de nemours kolon,cir concluding that the court erred in converting a motion to dismiss to a summary judgment motion where the record indicates that the parties had not yet had the opportunity to conduct reasonable discovery.the explicit authorization of discovery articulated by judge ervin in the gay decision is applicable precedent here,and is also prescribed by rule d.that rule provides that,when a rule b motion is treated as one for summary judgment under rule,the parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.d emphasis added.this controlling authority has been ignored entirely by the district court and by the majority.
the district court justification for refusing to authorize or permit the city to conduct discovery rested on an erroneous perception that further factual development was not germane to the center facial free speech challenge to the ordinance.i acknowledge that a court may,in the proper circumstances,rule on a summary judgment motion without allowing further discovery,where a facial challenge to an ordinance may be resolved as a question of law.penn adver.of,mayor of,cir,vacated on other grounds,d.in such limited circumstances,discovery is unnecessary because the court inquiry is limited to consideration of the ordinance on its face against the background of the government objective and the prospect of the ordinance general effect,id.at,without regard to an ordinance impact on the plaintiff asserting the facial challenge,educ.media at.tech,swecker,cir.in this situation,however,the court neither undertook nor properly conducted a facial analysis of the constitutionality of the ordinance.
in the first amendment context,there are two ways for a plaintiff to mount a facial challenge to a statute.first,the plaintiff may demonstrate that no set of circumstances exists under which the law would be valid,that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications.state grange.state republican party,d internal quotation marks omitted.or,second,the plaintiff may show that the law is overbroad because a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional,judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.united states stevens,d internal quotation marks omitted.here,the district court did not conclude that the ordinance is invalid in all its applications.for example,it never assessed the potential application of the ordinance to pregnancy centers that charge a fee for their services.indeed,the majority emphasizes instead the ordinance application to the provision of free services.ante at 
the district court also failed to address a substantial number of the ordinance other applications.put succinctly,its analysis was an one,focusing almost exclusively on the ordinance application to the center.for example,on the question of whether the ordinance regulates commercial or noncommercial speech,the court conducted an free speech analysis,amply demonstrated by its repeated and inappropriate findings on the specific characteristics of the center 
the overall purpose of the advertisements,services,and information offered by the center is not to propose a commercial transaction,nor is it related to the center economic interest,d at emphasis added 
the center engages in speech relating to abortion and based on strongly held religious and political beliefs rather than commercial interests or profit motives.id.emphasis added 
the notion that human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception is a central tenet of the center belief system.id.emphasis added 
t he disclaimer mandated by the ordinance introduces the topics of abortion and.this has an immediate effect on any speech and information offered by the center on these subjects.id.at emphasis added and 
at the very least,a disclaimer conspicuous to anyone visiting the center regarding the lack of abortion and services,mandates the inclusion of a government message concurrent,and intertwined with,plaintiffs delivery of fully protected speech.id.at emphasis added.
similarly,in assessing whether the ordinance is viewpoint neutral,the opinion made what can only be deemed to be findings.more specifically,it related that 
the center viewpoint,formed on the basis of sensitive religious,moral,and political beliefs,is the overarching reason for its stark refusal to perform or refer for abortions and certain types of.id.at emphasis added and 
it is revealing that defendants refer to the ordinance as a means of mitigating the harm caused by plaintiffs underlying propaganda speech relating to abortion and contraception.such descriptions can only support the conclusion that defendants enacted the ordinance out of disagreement with plaintiffs viewpoints on abortion and.id.at emphasis added.
the panel majority elaborates on several of these same factual points.see ante at.
in dissenting,i cast no aspersions on the use of the approach in the proper setting.indeed,it is clear that a challenges,with specific factual records,are the basic building blocks of constitutional adjudication.gonzales carhart,d internal quotation marks omitted.for a variety of reasons,a court should entertain an constitutional challenge prior to assessing a facial one and,if the challenge succeeds,neither reach nor rule on the facial one.see brockett spokane arcades,d.as the supreme court has explained,f acial challenges are disfavored because they often rest on speculation and thus raise the risk of premature interpretation of laws on the basis of factually barebones records.state grange,at internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,a facial challenge may contravene the principle of judicial restraint that courts should not formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.id.internal quotation marks omitted.as my friend judge niemeyer has emphasized,a facial challenge must be treated cautiously because slipping into the embrace of a facial challenge can tend to leave behind the limitations imposed by article iii and thus trample on legislative prerogatives,in violation of separation of powers principles.preston leake,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
because an analysis was employed by the district court in this case,the city was unquestionably entitled to conduct discovery proceedings.see anheuser busch,schmoke,cir niemeyer,explaining that,when confronted with an challenge,a court is given the task of finding the facts defining that circumstance and determining how the circumstance is impacted by the enactment,vacated on other grounds,d.the district court acknowledged as much during its august,hearing on the parties respective motions,when it recognized that discovery proceedings would be necessary to properly evaluate an challenge to the ordinance.see,observing that the center ca prevail on summary judgment if i concerned about its individual status,and assuring that if what the center did is relevant in this case,the city will have the discovery.
alternatively,discovery would be warranted if we were to treat this as a true facial challenge,rather than an challenge in the guise of a facial attack.martin stewart,cir wilkinson,dissenting.as the city points out,a facial challenge would weigh in favor of discovery,not against it.reply br.of appellants.for example,even if the center did not engage in commercial transactions,it would not necessarily prevail on a facial challenge even if other pregnancy centers in baltimore did,including those within the ordinance scope that charge fees.id.at.thus,regardless of the type of analysis utilized facial or the district court abused its discretion by denying the city its right to conduct discovery.
in declining to approve the city discovery requests concerning the potential commercial nature of speech targeted by the ordinance,the district court the analysis that was essential to properly deciding the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny.that analysis should have been,due to the inherent difficulty of drawing bright lines that clearly cabin commercial speech in a distinct category.see city of cincinnati discovery network,d.the supreme court has long grappled with the concept of commercial speech,describing it at various times as speech confined to the promotion of specific goods or services,metromedia,city of san diego,d,or related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience,in re,d internal quotation marks omitted.more recently,the court has explained that it usually define s commercial speech as speech that does no more than propose a commercial transaction.united states united foods,d the proposition of a commercial transaction i will sell you the x at the y price,see.state bd.of pharmacy.citizens consumer council,d is the core notion of commercial speech.see bolger youngs drug prods,d.
on the periphery,the distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech presents a closer question.bolger,at.the supreme court has identified three factors to consider in deciding whether speech is commercial is the speech an advertisement does the speech refer to a specific product or service and does the speaker have an economic motivation for the speech.facenda nfl films,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord adventure commc ns.registry of election,cir.we have recognized that,although none of the factors is dispositive,the confluence of these considerations may permit the conclusion that the speech at issue is commercial in nature.adventure commc ns,at.
the speech targeted by the ordinance indubitably satisfies the first two of the bolger factors,advertisements referring to a service.the majority surmises,however,that the third factor is absent,because there is no indication that the pregnancy center is motivated by any economic interest.ante at.ironically,my good colleagues fault the city for not addressing what economic interest motivates the pregnancy center speech,while ratifying the district court denial of the city discovery requests that were aimed at,inter alia,obtaining such information.the majority simply accepts as did the district court the center assertion by counsel only that its motives are entirely religious or political.but that assertion although quite material was not at all undisputed.the city discovery proceedings should have substantiated,inter alia,whether the center possesses economic interests apart from its ideological motivations such discovery is especially important when the relevant facts are exclusively in the control of the movant or when a case involves complex factual questions about intent and motive.see harrods,at.
in any event,the potential commercial nature of its speech does not hinge solely on whether the center has an economic motive.not all of the bolger factors must necessarily be present for speech to be commercial.bolger,at.because the ordinance compels a disclaimer,a court lodestars in distinguishing commercial from noncommercial speech are the nature of the speech regulated by the ordinance taken as a whole and the effect of the compelled disclaimer thereon.see riley fed of the blind of,d.in other words,context matters.from a first amendment free speech perspective,that context includes the viewpoint of the listener,for c ommercial expression not only serves the economic interest of the speaker,but also assists consumers and furthers the societal interest in the fullest possible dissemination of information.see cent.hudson gas pub.serv.comm of,d evaluating commercial nature of regulated speech based in part on impact to consumers of electricity robert post,the constitutional status of commercial speech,ucla,observing that t he court has focused its analysis on the need to receive information,rather than on the rights of the speakers.
the supreme court of north dakota decision in fargo women health,larson,cert.denied,d,illustrates the proper contextual analysis.the larson case involved false and deceptive advertising by the help clinic,which,like the center,provided pregnancy tests and counseling services to its clients at no cost.in determining that the help clinic advertising constituted commercial speech,the larson court concluded that the provision of free services was not dispositive.at.rather,the court emphasized that 
the help clinic advertisements are placed in a commercial context and are directed at the providing of services rather than toward an exchange of ideas in effect,the help clinic advertisements constitute promotional advertising of services through which patronage of the clinic is solicited,and in that respect constitute classic examples of commercial speech.
we are unable to properly assess the context of any speech regulated by the ordinance because no record evidence of the center advertisements exists to guide our review,thus we can only speculate about the ways in which the ordinance might be applied to the center speech.see milavetz,gallop milavetz,united states,d thomas,concurring in part observing that neither nor facial challenges could be reviewed properly where there was no evidence of subject advertisements.nor is there any evidence concerning the ordinance impact on consumers of such information.in ruling as it did,the district court was unconcerned with the full context,because it decided that,even if the center speech includes some commercial elements,strict scrutiny would nonetheless apply,since any commercial element was inextricably intertwined with otherwise fully protected speech,d at quoting riley,at.
in my view,it was legally erroneous for the district court to conclude,without the benefit of discovery,that the speech at issue blends commercial and noncommercial elements.the court necessarily premised that conclusion on its own finding that the dialogue between a pregnancy center and an expectant mother begins when the client or prospective client enters the waiting room of the center,d at.but such a dialogue may actually begin much earlier,when a prospective client views a pregnancy center advertisements.indeed,the purpose of the ordinance was to curb any deceptive advertising.even if the disclaimer in the waiting room were the initial communication,however,the court mischaracterized the disclaimer as a stark and immediate statement about abortion and.id.the disclaimer does not,as the majority suggests,convey a message that abortion and birth control are morally acceptable alternative s.ante at.the disclaimer simply does not speak to what is or may be morally acceptable.it merely discloses that a particular pregnancy center does not provide or refer for abortions or nondirective and comprehensive services.that is,the disclaimer relates to the services offered,not to the religious or ideological beliefs of a pregnancy center.
moreover,where the two components of speech can be easily separated,they are not inextricably intertwined.hunt city of,cir citing bd.of trustees of state of fox,d.because the ordinance merely requires a disclosure that the center does not provide or make referrals for abortion or services but does not otherwise prescribe the language or terminology to be used a pregnancy center could disassociate itself completely from the required disclaimer.indeed,a pregnancy center would be free to express its disapproval alongside the disclaimer,or otherwise qualify its viewpoint the disclaimer more to the point,however,n othing in the ordinance prevents a pregnancy center from conveying,or the audience from hearing,noncommercial messages,and nothing in the nature of things requires them to be combined with commercial messages.see fox,at see also fargo,at concluding it was unnecessary to extend first amendment protections to the clinic commercial solicitation of clientele because the clinic could advocat e outside the commercial context and receive full first amendment protection.put simply,the ordinance does not prohibit or restrict a pregnancy center speech about abortion and.
in sum,the district court finding that the ordinance targeted noncommercial speech or,at most,intertwined commercial and noncommercial speech as echoed by the majority was premature and inappropriate.under the applicable rules of procedure and our precedent,it was essential to the city opposition to the center summary judgment motion and to a fair and proper exercise of judicial scrutiny for the court to have the benefit of discovery.see,gay,at.d providing reasonable opportunity for discovery after conversion of rule b motion to summary judgment motion.those discovery proceedings should have yielded,inter alia,any economic motivations of the center,the context of the center advertisements in relation to the disclaimer,and the degree of entanglement,if any,of the commercial and noncommercial elements of the regulated speech 
in rejecting the city right to conduct discovery proceedings regarding the compelling interests advanced by the ordinance,the district court improperly characterized the city request as solely an attempt to generate justifications for the ordinance following its enactment,d at.the court relied on the supreme court decision in united states virginia,d,for the proposition that the city justification should not be invented in response to litigation.the city,however,sought only to augment the record with evidence to support its existing justification not to invent a new one.as we have previously observed,courts have routinely admitted evidence to supplement a legislative record or explain the stated interests behind challenged regulations.balt.prince george,cir,vacated on other grounds,d.although supplemental materials can not sustain regulations where there is no evidence in the preenactment legislative record,that is not the case here.id.
the majority does not deny that there was a substantial record supporting adoption of the ordinance rather,my colleagues simply deem that record insufficient to establish a compelling interest.see ante at observing that the record establishes,at most,only isolated instances of misconduct by pregnancy centers generally and the record contains no evidence that any woman has been misled into believing that any pregnancy center was a medical clinic or that a woman in baltimore delayed seeking medical services because of such a misconception.but criticizing the record as somehow lacking merely begs the real question underlying the errors of the district court why was the city denied a full and fair opportunity to conduct discovery and present a proper record 
as judge niemeyer recently explained,the constitution does not mandate a specific method by which the government must satisfy its burden under heightened judicial scrutiny i t may resort to a wide range of sources,such as legislative text and history,empirical evidence,case law,and common sense,as circumstances and context require.united states carter,cir remanding to allow the government to develop a record sufficient to justify its argument concerning interests advanced by statute.and,when the court record is deficient,the government has been permitted to marshal the relevant evidence.see,turner broad,fcc,d remanding to permit the parties to develop a more thorough factual record because government had failed to demonstrate that the recited harms are real,not merely conjectural,and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way see also hayes state law enforcement officers ass n,cir indicating that remand for discovery would be warranted had the city asked the district court for additional discovery to respond to summary judgment,or for additional time to develop the factual record in support of its alleged compelling state interest.we have no discernible reason to stray from such precedent.
apart from abusing its discretion by denying the city of baltimore its right to conduct discovery,the district court also erred in concluding that the ordinance is not viewpoint neutral its alternative basis for applying strict scrutiny.see,d at.the majority endorses that conclusion by way of footnote only,agreeing that,because the ordinance applies solely to persons who do not provide or refer for abortions or nondirective and comprehensive services,it burdens only speakers,whose moral or religious codes lead them to oppose abortion and birth control.ante at.it requires no lengthy deliberation to specify examples that entirely undermine the majority supposition 
a lamaze instructor,who teaches pregnant women and their partners strategies for having a natural,healthy pregnancy and childbirth,may not provide referrals for abortion or services simply because that is not the objective of her job 
a doula,who gives advice and emotional assistance to pregnant women during childbirth,would have no cause to even discuss abortion or,much less make referrals 
a pregnancy shelter,supplying material assistance and information about products,may not make referrals for abortion or nondirective and comprehensive services so as to avoid liability because it has no licensed or trained professionals to address those subjects and 
a center,encouraging or facilitating adoption services or surrogate pregnancies,may be neither qualified nor disposed to make referrals for abortion or services 
absent the premise that the ordinance burdens only speakers,the majority fallback position is legislative history,which,it asserts,demonstrates that the ordinance was enacted because of an improper animus of the city council against the center viewpoint on abortion and.as the majority points out,however,the city has referred and continues to refer women to the pregnancy center.ante at.if the city disfavors the center viewpoint,or possesses an improper animus against the center,its continual referrals of women to the center constitutes an unexplained oddity.in any event,the record validates the city uncontradicted contention that the ordinance was enacted to curtail deceptive advertising,not because the city disagreed with or wanted to suppress the center speech and the majority has failed to identify any aspects of the record that show otherwise.if there were some ambiguity,however,that would be more reason to conduct full discovery 
even if all i have said to this point misses the mark,the district court award of summary judgment to the center must nevertheless be vacated.put simply,there are genuine disputes of material fact regarding the issues of compelling interests and narrow tailoring that must be assessed.
although the district court assumed that the ordinance serves a compelling interest,the majority disparages the two such interests espoused by the city an interest in protecting the public from ongoing deceptive business practices and a public health interest in ensuring that individuals who seek abortion or comprehensive services have prompt access to those services.br.of appellants.in addition to criticizing the incompleteness of the record which,as previously explained,would be readily remedied with discovery the majority question s the city selective pursuit of its interest.ante at.my fine colleagues protest in their majority opinion that the city is not actually interested in combating inaccurate inform
