the claimant in this benefits case,danny bentley,received an award of benefits against his employer,b g mining,and the company insurer,old republic insurance company collectively,b g or the company.at each level of review in the department of labor,the adjudicators awarded fees to bentley attorney under the provision of the black lung benefits act,a.on petition for review before this court,b g argues that the adjudicators abused their discretion in the rates they used and the hours they approved.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the fee awards.
bentley filed a claim for federal benefits with the department of labor in august.in may,the administrative law judge the alj awarded him benefits.although b g initially appealed the award to the benefits review board the brb,the company voluntarily dismissed the appeal and accepted liability for the award of benefits.neither party raises any issue regarding the benefits award.
bentley attorney filed three petitions for fees totaling.this amount included work he performed before the district director,the alj,and the brb.in each petition,he asked for a rate of.he submitted a statement in support of each petition.the statements were identical and listed his years of experience in representing claimants with occupational diseases his expertise in the field his average fee of for workers compensation and social security disability benefits cases the relatively high risk of loss in benefits cases and the relatively low number of attorneys who practice in the field in the eastern district of kentucky.
the district director reduced the fee to for work performed before his office.he explained that the work was routine and that the rate was comparable to rates charged by other highly qualified,experienced attorneys within the same geographical location.the district director also subtracted hours for work performed outside the time the claim was pending and for work spent on a prior claim.
on a separate petition,the alj approved a rate of after noting that rates of and had been used in prior cases and citing the attorney experience and expertise in benefits cases.as to the hours billed,the alj reduced the requested amount by seven hours for time spent on matters not before the alj and for time involving some routine correspondence.
on appeal,the brb found no abuse of discretion and affirmed the district director and alj awards.the brb also considered the petition for fees for work performed before the board.it reduced the rate to due to the nature and complexity of the case.it also subtracted six hours from the claimed hours for duplicative work and work unrelated to the appeal before the board.
in total,claimant attorney was awarded fees of for hours of work.
on appeal,b g contends that the district director,the alj,and the brb failed to apply the correct legal standard in determining the appropriate hourly rate.the company also argues that some of the hours awarded were excessive and duplicative.the company arguments are considered in turn.

attorneys fees under the black lung benefits act 
section of the longshore and harbor workers compensation act the longshore act,incorporated into the black lung benefits act,a,provides for the award of fees and costs to a successful claimant attorney.the department of labor promulgated regulations covering,among other things,the factors to be considered in fixing the amount of award in benefits cases.specifically,provides in relevant part 
b any fee shall be reasonably commensurate with the necessary work done and shall take into account the quality of the representation,the qualifications of the representative,the complexity of the legal issues involved,the level of proceedings to which the claim was raised,the level at which the representative entered the proceedings,and any other information which may be relevant to the amount of fee requested.
the parties do not dispute that claimant attorney was eligible to receive a fee award.rather,they disagree on what constitutes a reasonable fee rate and reasonable time expended on claimant behalf.
c.the lodestar method of calculating fees 
the first issue to resolve is whether the lodestar method of calculating fees should apply to benefits cases.the lodestar method is deceptively simple the fee amount equals the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.hensley eckerhart,d.claimant attorney argues that b provides the necessary guidance for adjudicators to fashion appropriate awards and that applying the lodestar method would be an unwarranted deviation from the regulation that would provide little in terms of specific criteria to consider.
this court has not directly addressed whether the lodestar method is applicable to benefits cases.although there is no binding precedent,reason and the weight of authority confirms that the lodestar method is the appropriate starting point in these cases.
in general,similar statutory language should beget similar judicial treatment.section of the longshore act provides that a reasonable attorney fee will be paid to a prevailing claimant attorney.a.that phrase is comparable to those found in other federal statutes,including the solid waste disposal act and the clean water act both of which were at issue in city of burlington dague,d.the supreme court directed in dague that its case law construing what is a reasonable fee applies uniformly to all of the similar statutes.it went on to explain 
the lodestar figure has,as its name suggests,become the guiding light of our jurisprudence.we have established a strong presumption that the lodestar represents the reasonable fee,pennsylvania delaware valley citizens council for clean air,d delaware valley i,and have placed upon the fee applicant who seeks more than that the burden of showing that such an adjustment is necessary to the determination of a reasonable fee.blum stenson,d emphasis added.
id.at.in line with dague and an earlier decision,hensley eckerhart,a panel of this court explained that b ecause the same standards are generally applicable in all cases in which congress has authorized an award of fees to a prevailing party,this c ourt relies on precedents involving attorneys fees without regard to whether they involved title vi or some other federal statute.johnson city of clarksville,cir unpublished internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
recent decisions of this and other circuit courts,while not binding precedent,do weigh in favor of using the lodestar method in benefits cases.in harmon mcginnis,wl,at cir,unpublished,a panel of this court relied on the lodestar method as the starting point in determining a reasonable attorneys fee in a longshore act case.similarly,the ninth circuit has approved of a district court application of the lodestar method in a longshore act case.tahara matson terminals,cir use of the lodestar method to calculate attorney fees under a federal statute is proper.citations omitted.in trying to distinguish these and other similar decisions involving the longshore act,claimant attorney argues that the department of labor specifically modified the methodology applicable to benefits cases when it promulgated a.yet,the circuit rejected that very argument in national mining ass department of labor.the appellants in that case argued that the criteria listed in the regulation overlapped with the criteria used in calculatin
