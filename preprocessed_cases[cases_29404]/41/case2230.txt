this appeal,which involves medicare reimbursement of indirect medical education expenses ime incurred by a public teaching hospital with an approved intern and resident program,presents two questions first,whether it was arbitrary and capricious for the secretary of health and human services to interpret the medicare statute and regulations providing for ime payment on the basis of available beds as presumptively meaning physical beds,when the hospital fiscal intermediary had previously accepted a calculation based on budgeted beds and second,whether the secretary findings in this case were supported by substantial evidence.
los angeles of southern california medical center or med center appeals the district court judgment upholding a final determination by the provider reimbursement review board prrb that intermediary,blue cross and blue shield association blue cross,properly used a physical bed count in the formula for calculating the hospital ime adjustment for fiscal year ending fye june.we conclude that the secretary had discretion to presume that available beds means actual beds,rather than budgeted beds.we owe deference to this interpretation.applying it,we conclude that the prrb could find,based on the record,that failed to carry its burden of proving that beds in excess of the budgeted bed figure should be excluded from the physical count.substantial evidence supports the prrb decision because the actual number of beds at that were physically ready to be occupied was not in dispute,and there was evidence that all beds at the budgeted or maintained and could be used at any time for patient care.accordingly,the secretary determination was not arbitrary and capricious.
all hospitals with a provider agreement receive predetermined payments for discharged patients under the prospective payment system pps as a teaching hospital subject to pps,is entitled to an additional payment to cover the added,indirect costs of medical education.d b.the amount of the ime adjustment is based on a hospital ratio of equivalent interns and residents to available beds.
the calculation is complicated,but the bottom line is that the higher the number of beds,the lower the eventual payment and vice versa.see little of mary hosp.health care ctrs.shalala,cir 
the social security act caps this ratio at the ratio of interns and residents to available beds as defined by the secretary during the hospital most recent cost reporting period.d b vi.
the implementing regulation provides,in pertinent part 
for purposes of this section,the number of beds in a hospital is determined by counting the number of available bed days during the cost reporting period,not including beds or bassinets in the healthy newborn nursery,custodial care beds,or beds in distinct part hospital units,and dividing that number by the number of days in the cost reporting period.
the provider reimbursement manual prm issued by the health care financing administration hcfa which administers the medicare program for the secretary,defines available beds for purposes of the ime adjustment 
a bed is defined for this purpose as an adult or pediatric bed exclusive of beds assigned to newborns which are not in intensive care areas,custodial beds,and beds in excluded units maintained for lodging inpatients,including beds in intensive care units,coronary care units,neonatal intensive care units,and other special care inpatient hospital units.beds in the following locations are excluded from the definition skilled nursing facilities or in any inpatient area s of the facility not certified as an acute care hospital,labor rooms,pps excluded units such as psychiatric or rehabilitation units,post anaesthesia or postoperative recovery rooms,outpatient areas,emergency rooms,ancillary departments,nurses and other staff residences,and other such areas as are regularly maintained and utilized for only a portion of the stay of patients or for purposes other than inpatient lodging.
to be considered an available bed,a bed must be permanently maintained for lodging inpatients.it must be available for use and housed in patient rooms or wards,not in corridors or temporary beds.thus,beds in a completely or partially closed wing of the facility are considered available only if the hospital put sic the beds into use when they are needed.the term available beds as used for the purpose of counting beds is not intended to capture the fluctuations in patient rooms and wards being used.rather,the count is intended to capture changes in the size of a facility as beds are added to or taken out of service.

blue cross also published an administrative bulletin which pertains to the ime adjustment.it indicates how to treat areas of a hospital that are temporarily or permanently closed 
in a situation where rooms or floors are temporarily unoccupied,the beds in these areas must be counted,provided the area in which the beds are contained is included in the hospital depreciable plant assets,and the beds can be adequately covered by either employed nurses or nurses from a nurse registry.in this situation,the beds are considered available and must be counted even though it may take hours to get nurses on duty from the registry.

against this backdrop,a provider of covered care such as submits a cost report to its fiscal intermediary each year.an this case,blue a private entity with whom the secretary contracts to determine the amount of medicare payments to be made to a provider based on the cost report.the report shows the costs incurred during the fiscal year and what proportion is to be allocated to medicare.a provider that is dissatisfied with the intermediary determination may request a hearing before the prrb.a.

the prrb concluded that blue cross properly used the number of physical beds located within facility as a measure of the available beds.it found that the number of budgeted beds was not an absolute cap on bed utility because on any given day the budgeted cap of may have been exceeded.finally,the board found no evidence that closed floors or areas of the hospital 
appealed to the secretary,who declined review.the prrb decision thus became the final administrative action for purposes of federal jurisdiction.f.the med center sought review in the district court,which granted summary judgment in favor of the secretary.this timely appeal followed.

principal argument is that it was arbitrary and capricious for the secretary to move from using budgeted beds to using physical beds without an explanation.an agency is not precluded from changing its mind,good samaritan hosp.shalala,d,but an agency changing its course must supply a reasoned analysis indicating that prior policies and standards are being deliberately changed,not casually ignored nw.envtl.def.ctr.bonneville power,cir citations omitted.this rule has no application here,however,because it was blue cross that had approved claims for ime reimbursement based on budgeted beds points to no decision by the prrb or the secretary that embraces a approach,nor does it suggest that the secretary has taken inconsistent litigation or positions on this issue.while a fiscal intermediary is the secretary agent for purposes of reviewing cost reports and making final determinations with respect to the total reimbursement due to a provider absent an appeal to the prrb,see kaiser blue cross of,cir,intermediary interpretations are not binding on the secretary,who alone makes policy.see loma linda.med.ctr.leavitt,cir.
recognizing that the secretary has never explicitly taken a position that available beds may be measured by budgeted beds instead of physical beds,posits that he implicitly acceded to use of budgeted beds by virtue of blue cross bulletin.it reasons that since the secretary knew that blue cross deemed beds to be available only when they could adequately be covered by nurses,it must have been a change in position to count the beds at issue for fye because nurses could not be hired over budget.no such inference arises,however,because the bulletin discussion about staffing pertains only to beds that are in rooms or floors that are temporarily unoccupied.
consequently,prior blue cross approvals based on a budgeted beds calculation did not make the secretary determination that the intermediary properly used a physical bed count for fye arbitrary and capricious.therefore,the secretary interpretation is entitled to no less deference on this account 
alternatively argues that,even if it were not arbitrary and capricious to change course,still it is arbitrary and capricious for the secretary to reject budgeted beds in favor of a physical bed count.med center emphasizes that it is a hospital and submits that physical beds for which there is no budget for staffing,linen,dietary,pharmaceutical,and other resources should not be part of the measure of a hospital routine inpatient operations for ime reimbursement purposes because such beds do not affect the teaching intensity.in addition,it contends that the provider reimbursement manual contemplates fluctuations in usage,and that the legislative history and commentary to different medicare adjustments that also depend on available beds disproportionate share hospital dsh payments,and payments for rural referral indicate that beds must be staffed in order to qualify the prrb considered each of these arguments,but concluded that while budgeted beds may be an appropriate vehicle to establish staffing levels and related ancillary and administrative activity,the number of budgeted beds can not identify which beds were or were not available.
the parties disagreement boils down to whether the ime calculation must be or may be.said differently,the dispute turns on whether beds are a proxy for the number of patients as would have it,or may for the number of physicians.the secretary judgment is that a facility size is what relates to teaching load and that the best measure of this is the number of beds maintained for patient use.his rationale is that hospitals generally do not maintain beds they are unable to use.see little of mary,at citing medicare program fiscal year changes to the inpatient hospital prospective payment system,may.the med center counters that budgeted resources,particularly for nursing support,are the appropriate measure for hospitals,and that beds should be a proxy for the patients served.
no doubt the secretary could have decided to measure available beds by counting nurses or patients had he thought this was sounder policy.however,if both his and views are plausible,the secretary will prevail.thomas jefferson,at.his view is reasonably grounded in the statutory scheme.all hospitals are subject to the pps,and all teaching hospitals are eligible for the ime adjustment that congress provides to hospitals with a graduate medical education program to account for greater costs per case.the assumption is that,across the universe of teaching hospitals public as well as private,additional tests will be ordered to train residents and more nursing and medical teaching staff will be necessary to support the program.congress chose to gauge the extra cost of the teaching load by reference to available beds rather than available staffing,so we can not say that the secretary unreasonably pegged the formula to an actual bed count rather than a budgeted bed count that turns on staffing 
the secretary approach is consistent with the purpose of the ime adjustment,and with the manual.congress recognized that increased patient care costs associated with graduate medical education programs include the additional tests and procedures ordered by residents as well as the extra demands placed on other staff as they participate in the education process,pt,at,reprinted in,but left the task of defining available beds in the ratio of the number of interns and residents to the hospital available beds to the secretary.the regulation promulgated by the secretary opted to count the number of available bed days excluding certain types of beds and divide that number by for most years.the prm added the refinement that,to be considered available,a bed must be permanently maintained for lodging inpatients,and that all such beds,all beds that are physically present in the hospital and permanently maintained for use in treating patients at any time during the year,are treated as presumptively available for the entire period for purposes of calculating the ime payment.hospitals may show that some of their beds are not in fact available and should be excluded.with the presumption that a bed available once is available always,the number of available bed days is equal to times the number of physical beds.dividing this product by the number of days in the accounting period gets back to the number of physical beds.in this way,the manual links the count of available bed days specified in the regulation and the physical count that the secretary condoned in this case.
relies on one statement in the prm t he term available beds as used for the purpose of counting beds is not intended to capture the fluctuations in patient rooms and wards to argue that it was irrational for the secretary to reject the use of budgeted beds on the basis that the cap could be exceeded on any given day,because a single day fluctuation is not what the regulation is intended to do.but the statement upon which it relies in isolation carries no such weight,for the manual goes on to explain that the count is intended to capture changes in the size of a facility as beds are added to or taken out of service.this squares with the secretary interpretation.
nor are we persuaded that the secretary reasoning is undermined by references to staffing in the legislative history.for one thing,congress explicitly delegated a definition of available beds to the secretary which,presumably,it would not have done had it intended the concept to turn on available staffing.beyond this,the secretary could sensibly conclude that staffing concerns are effectively accounted for within the adjustment itself.that teaching hospitals incur more indirect costs than for staff the reason for additional reimbursement by way of the ime payment it is not conversely a requirement that the reimbursement be further increased when some of these costs are not in the budget of a particular hospital.
finally,neither congressional direction in establishing dsh payments nor commentary to the rural referral regulation casts doubt on the reasonableness of the secretary decision to count physical beds for purposes of the ime payment.both the dsh regulation and the rural referral regulation incorporate the ime definition of available beds,not the other way around.see clark reg l med,at indicating that the definition of beds for purposes of the ime adjustment in prm g applies to the dsh payment.
given that the secretary interpretation of available beds for purposes of the ime payment is reasonable,the remaining question is whether the prrb application to is arbitrary and capricious.the prrb found that budgeted beds calculus was a proxy for services,not size and that the budget did not establish a ceiling on bed availability,but was instead a proxy for the average number of beds available on a daily census that does not identify which beds were or were not available.submits that,to the contrary,the budgeted beds figure is a static figure representing the maximum amount of hospital resources allocated to inpatient care.we conclude that substantial evidence supports the prrb finding.
med center does not dispute that the beds at issue were used for patient care from time to time and could be so used whenever needed.these beds were plugged in and ready to go.they were not taken out of service,or located in an area that was closed,temporarily or permanently.they were,in short,maintained for lodging inpatients.
testimony by county administrators indicates that the figure is used to monitor the hospital performance against the budget during the year it is a proxy for the nursing care and the dietary and linen contract that we have to spend out money on,or put otherwise,the number of inpatient days that we can provide.there was testimony,as well,that can not provide care beyond its figure,that its emergency rooms are frequently saturated,and that if the hospital operates over budget during one time period it must reduce spending later.however,the evidence shows that budgeted beds does not mean that beds are not available for patient care on any given day.as one administrator testified,the budgeted bed total has nothing to do with the physical capacity number of mattresses at med center that can be pressed into service when needed.this being so,the prrb was not compelled to find that the nature of med center budget limitations or its status as a public hospital excluded any physical beds from being available at any time during the cost reporting period.
as neither the secretary interpretation of available beds nor his application to proffered exclusion of beds in excess of those budgeted is arbitrary or capricious,we affirm.
i agree with the majority that the secretary did not act arbitrarily and capriciously when he switched from using the number of budgeted beds to using the number of physical beds for calculating the medicare ime adjustment.i also agree that the secretary interpretation of available beds as presumptively meaning physical beds is entitled to deference from this court and is reasonable as a general matter.however,because i believe that met its burden of rebutting the presumption and showing that certain beds should have been excluded from med center available bed count in the fiscal year ending june,namely the beds that made up the difference between the number of physical beds and the number of budgeted would hold that the provider reimbursement review board board decision was arbitrary and capricious.
as the majority explains,the relevant interpretive regulation directs that beds available at any time during the cost reporting period are presumed to be available during the entire cost reporting period.op.at.however the majority relegates to a parenthetical a crucial caveat hospitals may provide evidence to the contrary in order to exclude beds from the count.id.in other words,hospitals have the opportunity to prove that certain beds should not be considered available and thus should be excluded from the count.at a hearing before the board,presented evidence that the physical beds that were not included in the budget should be excluded from the ime calculation because those beds were not actually available for patient use during the year.disregarding the substantial evidence presented by,the board concluded that all physical beds should be considered available beds and denied request to adjust the figure.thus,the issue in this case is not whether the secretary interpretation of the term available beds as presumptively meaning physical beds instead of budgeted beds is arbitrary and capricious,but rather whether the board ruling that did not meet its burden of showing that the physical beds that were not budgeted for were not actually available and thus should be excluded from the count.
at the hearing before the board,presented substantial evidence that in,med center did not actually use any of the extra physical beds that were not included in the budgeted beds figure.according to the chief financial officer of med center,there was not a single day that the hospital had the resources to staff all of the budgeted beds to say nothing of the physical beds.he testified that the average number of beds that were actually available in the relevant year was,and that that number could vary on any given day by.therefore,on the busiest days of the year,med center had only beds available for patient care.if anything,the budgeted beds that seeks to use as the available bed figure is too high,not too low.if the budgeted beds figure is too high,then the physical bed figure that the secretary proposes is certainly too high.with this testimony alone,more than met its burden of proving that the budgeted beds was a more accurate count of available beds in than the physical beds.
even counsel for the secretary admitted during the hearing that in the relevant year there a fair cushion between the amount that the hospital calls budgeted beds and what its census was.he stated that the question of whether the hospital could actually use the physical beds that were not included in the budgeted bed count was hypothetical and abstract because actual data indicates that the hospital did not even use all of the budgeted beds that year.
the board decision did not discuss or acknowledge the strong testimony offered.instead,it found that t he provider had beds available,and on any given day its budgeted cap of may have been exceeded.in light of the cfo undisputed testimony and the admission of the secretary own lawyer that the budgeted cap was never actually exceeded,it is apparent that the explanation for the board decision runs counter to the evidence before the agency.ranchers cattlemen action legal fund united stockgrowers of america united states of,cir quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mutual auto.ins,d.on that basis,i would hold that the board decision was arbitrary and capricious under that apa.
in addition to holding that met its burden of showing that the budgeted beds figure more accurately reflected the actual number of available beds at med center in than the physical beds figure,i would also hold that offered sufficient proof that budgeted beds is the appropriate figure to use to measure available beds at med center as a general rule.
the board findings and decision to use the physical bed count to calculate med center ime adjustment ran counter to the evidence presented by at the hearing.first,the board found that stipulated that med center had beds available for patient care and that this was the strongest argument that this number is appropriate for the ime calculation.the stipulation does not support the board finding.the stipulation states for the fiscal year ended june,the intermediary agrees to revise the provider indirect medical education ime payment amount using beds in the ratio of interns and.emphasis added.the reason that it was the intermediary blue cross that stipulated to this of,as the board that blue cross originally sought to use the full count of licensed beds at med center,which was,but later agreed to lower that number to after demonstrated that some of those licensed beds could not be considered for the purposes of the ime calculation.the stipulation binds blue cross to a lower bed count number than it originally proposed.it does not represent,as the board suggests,a concession on the part of that is the appropriate number of beds to use for the ime calculation.in fact,the stipulation clarifies that it only partially settles the ime bed count issue that is still pending at the prrb that is,the discrepancy between physical beds and actual beds that is now before us.additionally,there is nothing in the stipulation that discusses whether the beds were available for patient care and certainly did not stipulate that they were,as the board found.
the majority does not discuss the board finding on this issue despite the fact that the board considered it the strongest argument for using the number of physical beds instead of the number of budgeted beds.because the board finding clearly runs counter to the evidence before it,i would hold that it was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the apa.see ranchers cattlemen action legal fund united stockgrowers of america,at.
next,the board found that the budgeted beds count was an appropriate figure to use for planning staffing numbers and other administrative purposes,but that it did not constitute an absolute cap on bed utility.however,the evidence before the board proved that the budgeted beds figure did serve as a limit to the number of beds available for use at med center.
according to testimony presented by,the term budgeted beds connotes how much staff,materials and supplies,pharmaceuticals,support is available to provide care and sets a ceiling for the operational capacity of the organization.plainly stated,the budgeted beds figure sets a cap on the capability of the organization to deliver safe,appropriate patient care.because the budgeted beds figure is a proxy for the nursing care and the dietary and linen contracts,the number of budgeted beds represents the number of inpatient days med center can provide.in fact,monitors the bed count every single day and any deviations are immediately corrected.
also presented testimony that,unlike a private hospital in which the budget functions as a floor for planning purposes and can be expanded to accommodate increased demand or emergencies,the budget for med center is really a ceiling.med center budget is determined by the los angeles county board of supervisors and can not be altered during the year.the section head of the controller division responsible for the hospital budget team testified that in his ten to fifteen years of experience,he did not recall a hospital ever getting the number of budged beds adjusted during the year.
ignoring the extensive testimony to the contrary,the majority nevertheless argues that the physical beds that were not budgeted were available because they were plugged in and ready to go.op.at.this is not so.they not even fired up and ready to go.med center cfo testified that a bed is only available when there a physical bed that meets the needs of the patient and there is staff to operate them.a bed that does not have staff,linens,or food is no more available for use by a patient than the painting on the wall.if there is an empty bed,plugged in or not,but no nurses to staff it,a patient would have to wait in the emergency room until such time as the bed became available to transfer him or her.once the emergency room is saturated,patients are turned away rather than put in the empty beds that fall outside of the budgeted number.in other words,the physical beds are not necessarily available.only those beds that are budgeted for can reasonably be considered available.thus,the budget serves as a fixed cap on bed utility.
although one hospital official testified that from a budgetary perspective,it was marginally possible to provide inpatient hospital care in more beds than the budget provides,such a scenario would be almost impossible.if the hospital could save money in another area,or if every patient who came to the hospital required only a low cost service,or if there were a sudden increase in paying patients,it might be possible to bump up the number of beds by the end of the year to operate a few more.there are so many fixed variables in the budgeted beds figure,however,that it would be very difficult to increase the number of beds that med center operate s on the basis of those changes.additionally,on any given day the number of available beds could theoretically exceed the number of budgeted beds,but that increase would have to be balanced out by a proportional decrease later in the year.as discussed above,this did not actually happen on any day in the figure for budgeted beds has never been altered in the ten to fifteen years that the head of the responsible controller division has been at.
the majority characterizes the parties disagreement as being whether the ime calculation should be based on the staffing level of the hospital or the size of the hospital.op.at.according to the majority,the secretary reasonably chose to base the calculation on the size of the hospital,not,as advocated,on a budgeted bed count that turns on staffing.op at.this analysis misses the point.the budgeted bed count does not turn on staffing.op.at.just the level of staffing turns on the number of budgeted beds.similarly,the number of beds available for patient care the size or capacity of the hospital is at most the number of budgeted beds.
this is not true of all hospitals.the staffing levels of private hospitals are not limited by the number of budgeted beds.when a private hospital experiences an unexpectedly busy year,its revenues increase along with its patient census because private hospitals treat many more paying and insured patients.the hospital then uses those unanticipated revenues to hire additional staff and provide the services necessary to transform a physical bed into an available bed,thereby increasing the capacity of the hospital.thus,the number of budgeted beds does not provide a limit on the staffing levels or the number of available beds because both can be increased during the year.the physical bed count is the only accurate measure of a private hospital size.at med center,however,the budget limits the staffing level and the size of the hospital the number of available beds.consequently,at med center,there is no meaningful distinction between the size or capacity and the level of staffing because both are fixed by the same number of budgeted beds.distinguishing between the size and the level of staffing or the number of budgeted beds at med center was arbitrary and capricious 
furthermore,the board found that there was no evidence that the provider closed off various floors or areas of the hospital.the majority asserts the same.op.at.this is true as a factual matter,but it should not have any effect on the outcome of the case.the interpretive regulation refers to closed wings as an example of one situation in which a bed would not be considered available for use and housed in patient rooms or wards.prm,g.the regulation never directs that a bed will be considered available unless it is kept in a closed wing.although some hospitals may well have to place unused beds in a closed ward in order to prove that they are not available,med center presented substantial evidence that the physical beds that were not included in the budget were not available for patient care.requiring the hospital to move those beds to a closed ward would be unreasonable as there are physical beds that will necessarily remain unused for the entire year,it is immaterial whether the area in which they are placed is closed off physically.the interpretive regulation does not mandate that the only way to exclude physical beds from the count is to move them to a closed ward and the board determination that such a requirement applied in all cases was arbitrary and capricious.
the board and the majority also argue that the budgeted be
