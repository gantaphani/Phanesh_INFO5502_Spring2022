in unusual and tragic circumstances,this case requires us to apply a discovery rule to the issue of claim accrual under the federal tort claims act ftca,b.
on february,edward skwira,a decorated world war ii veteran,entered the veterans affairs medical center vamc near northampton,massachusetts,for the treatment of chronic alcoholism.three days later,skwira unexpectedly died,apparently of natural causes.five years later,on march,a federal jury convicted kristin gilbert,a former nurse at the vamc,of murdering skwira and three other vamc patients.prosecutors claimed that gilbert killed her victims by injecting them with lethal doses of the stimulant epinephrine to simulate a natural death.investigators believe that gilbert may be responsible for several other deaths at the vamc,apart from the four for which she was convicted.
as a result of the deaths at the vamc,skwira wife and children,along with the survivors of five other alleged victims of gilbert,sued the united states under the ftca seeking compensation for the loss of their loved ones the district court consolidated the six cases for the purposes of pretrial management and the government eventually moved to dismiss the lawsuits on statute of limitations grounds.the district court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to five of the cases,including the skwira family,holding that these five sets of plaintiffs had failed to file compulsory administrative claims within two years after their claims had accrued.see b.the skwira family now appeals the dismissal of their complaint after a careful review of the record and controlling case law,we conclude,as did the district court,that the skwira family claim is.
in early february,skwira was admitted to an inpatient substance abuse treatment facility in worcester,massachusetts,for the treatment of chronic alcoholism.on february,he was transferred to the vamc and placed in the hospital ward c,where gilbert was working.later that day skwira took a drastic turn for the worse,suffering from an apparent catastrophic cardiac event.he was transferred for further tests to the baystate medical center in springfield,massachusetts.doctors at baystate told the skwira family that he was dying of natural a heart attack and dissecting that no medical or surgical intervention could save him.skwira was returned to the vamc where he died on february.the immediate causes of death were listed on his death certificate as dissecting aneurysm,inferior wall myocardial infarction,and arrythmia sic.no autopsy was performed.
later that spring,the department of veterans affairs office of the inspector general,assisted by the attorney office and the massachusetts state police,began a criminal investigation into the unusually high number of deaths on ward c during late through early.by summer,articles had started to appear in local newspapers describing an ongoing inquiry into suspicious deaths at the vamc.in its opening sentence,one article identified a federal probe into a higher than usual number of deaths from cardiac arrest on one ward.the article quoted the hospital acting director as refusing to rule out foul play or malpractice.another published account mentioned an investigation into the untimely death of a patient in ward c.that same article indicated that a nurse was a focus of the government probe.in early august,the attorney office issued a short press release confirming that,in fact,there was a grand jury investigation underway.the local press reported that the grand jury had been taking testimony for about a month,and that the investigation was focusing on all deaths that occurred at the vamc between fall and winter.
beginning in september or october,investigators started to approach the families of individuals who had unexpectedly died in ward c and asked permission to exhume the bodies of the deceased and to perform autopsies.skwira family was the first to be approached.assistant united states attorney william welch and massachusetts state trooper kevin murphy met with them.we advised them,according to murphy,that we were looking into deaths at the veterans hospital.we advised them that we had some suspicions that we would like to clear up by exhuming edward skwira.welch and murphy sought and obtained permission from statia,skwira widow,to exhume skwira body and perform an autopsy.welch explained that his office was looking at a number of deaths at the va medical center,and that there had been an increase in the number of deaths and there was some question as to why that increase had occurred.skwira family responded that they were familiar with the press reports concerning an investigation into suspicious deaths at the vamc,but that this was their first actual indication that skwira death was one that the government was investigating.
the family gave consent to exhume skwira body on november.the body was disinterred and immediately autopsied,with the heart and other internal organs removed for safekeeping and further testing.the day after the autopsy,welch attended skwira reinterment with statia and yarrows.when statia asked welch about the results of the autopsy,he informed them that the death certificate as printed was incorrect.he told them that skwira did die of a heart attack,although he then added that this did not mean that he did die of unnatural causes.welch promised to keep the family informed about the progress of the investigation.
over the next two years,the government continued its investigation and built its criminal case against gilbert who had already been arrested in october,before skwira autopsy,and charged with phoning bomb threats to the vamc statia would call welch and other investigators every four to six check on the status of the investigation into skwira death.in response to these calls,welch would tell her that he could really tell her other than what he had already told her in the past.
in july welch scheduled a meeting with the family to inform them that the chemical ketamine had been inexplicably found in skwira body.skwira medical records contained no indication that powerful ever been ordered for him.welch asked the family about any medical history not reflected in the hospital records.he explained that further investigation was necessary to determine whether ketamine had been lawfully administered,or if it had been administered out of error,oversight,or negligence.at this meeting,statia brought up the november autopsy.welch explained once again that the death certificate was not correct as stated.he again added,however,that simply because the death certificate was not correct did not mean that skwira had died of unnatural causes.he told them that the investigation would continue.
during the months that followed,the government continued to test the heart and tissue samples removed during the autopsy.investigators suspected that gilbert had used epinephrine to kill her victims,but the forensic technology and protocols necessary to measure epinephrine toxicity in dated tissue samples had yet to be perfected.as the district court noted in its opinion,e pinephrine occurs naturally in the body as adrenaline,and investigators found it difficult to isolate toxicological evidence that a particular patient had been killed with a lethal injection by examining tissue samples exhumed months or years after the patient death.cutting,d at.hence the government was obliged to invest significant resources to develop adequate epinephrine testing protocols and research methodologies which,if used at trial,would ultimately have to withstand daubert scrutiny 
the government investment was eventually fruitful.on june,welch and murphy met with the family and informed them for the first time that skwira had not died of natural causes.toxicological tests had conclusively determined that skwira had died of epinephrine poisoning.welch and murphy also expressed their belief that gilbert had murdered skwira,and they indicated that they would present evidence of skwira murder to a grand jury in seeking an indictment for first degree murder.finally,welch told the skwira family that investigators had excluded the possibility of a legitimate administration of ketamine and that the drug presence was further confirmation that skwira had been poisoned while at the vamc.
in november gilbert was indicted and charged with several counts of murder and assault with intent to murder.the indictment was sealed for seven days so that the families of the victims could be informed.following a lengthy jury trial,gilbert was convicted of three counts of first degree murder including skwira,one count of second degree murder,and other lesser charges.she is currently serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.
the federal tort claims act statute of limitations provides,in pertinent part,that a tort claim against the united states shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate federal agency within two years after such claim accrues.b.to facilitate the filing of administrative claims against government agencies,the department of justice has developed a standardized form,which satisfies the statute notice of claim requirement.a potential claimant has two years after her claim accrues to complete and submit this form.see a united states,cir.we have previously noted that the burden of preparing this form is minimal.see sec y of of,cir this circuit approaches the notice requirement leniently.the claimant need only indicate on the sufficient information for the agency to investigate the claims,and the amount of damages sought.id.
the skwira family filed its form and supporting materials on october.the veterans administration notified the family in correspondence dated may,and july,that the family administrative claims had been denied the skwira family subsequently filed the instant action in the district court on october.listed as plaintiffs were statia skwira as administratrix of skwira estate and in her own right,and skwira three adult skwira,edward skwira,and marsha yarrows.the complaint sounded in negligence and sought damages for wrongful death,conscious pain and suffering,personal injury,loss of consortium,and negligent infliction of emotional distress.
soon after the complaint was filed,the litigation was stayed pending the outcome of gilbert criminal trial.once gilbert was convicted in march,the parties conducted limited discovery on the issue of the plaintiffs compliance with filing requirement.after the completion of this limited period of discovery,the united states moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the plaintiffs administrative claim had not been timely filed.the government argued that the skwira family claim accrued at the time of skwira death.in the alternative,the government argued that the claim accrued in october,when the investigators first approached the family and asked permission to exhume and autopsy skwira body as part of an ongoing investigation into suspicious deaths at the vamc.in response,the skwira family contended that their claim did not accrue until june,when they were told for the first time that skwira had died as a result of an illegally administered dose of epinephrine.
on june,the district court,in a thorough and opinion,granted the government motion to dismiss.after canvassing the background law,the court framed the issue before it 
the pivotal question in each case will be when,as a factual matter,sufficient information was available to the plaintiffs to reveal a connection between the vamc and the deaths.
cutting,d at.the court determined that for the skwira family,that date was november,day after the the family first learned that skwira did not die of a heart attack,as the death certificate and the vamc had maintained.thus,the court reasoned,the skwira family had two years from that november file an administrative claim with the veterans administration.since the family had failed to file a claim before that deadline,the court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and dismissed the complaint.this appeal ensued.
as the language of unequivocally indicates,the failure to file an administrative claim with the appropriate government agency within two years of a claim accrual results in that claim being forever barred.b.it is well settled in this circuit that the timely filing of an administrative claim pursuant to is a jurisdictional prerequisite to filing suit under the ftca.see,gonzalez united states,cir attallah united states,cir united states,cir.thus,failure to comply with the ftca statute of limitations means that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the suit and must dismiss it.coska united states,cir.the skwira family,as the party invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court,carries the burden of proving its existence.murphy united states,cir 
in this case,the district court dismissed the skwira family complaint on the government rule b motion.see.b providing for dismissal of claim for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter we use different standards of review in evaluating a district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under.b depending on the circumstances.gonzalez,at.in a situation where the parties dispute the predicate facts allegedly giving rise to the court jurisdiction,the district court will often need to engage in some preliminary.in that situation,the district court enjoys broad authority to order discovery,consider extrinsic evidence,and hold evidentiary hearings in order to determine its own jurisdiction.valentín hosp.bella vista,cir in such a case,the district court findings of fact will be set aside only if clearly erroneous.id.at.the court ultimate conclusion regarding the existence vel non of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law subject to de novo review.id.
in this appeal we are only reviewing the district court ultimate legal conclusion that the skwira family action is.indeed,the government and the skwira family both maintain,without elaboration,that we should review de novo the district court dismissal.we take this position as a concession that the parties do not dispute the district court factual findings as recited in its written opinion and that they only disagree over the legal significance of those,the district court determination that,as a matter of law,the plaintiffs complaint was.hence,since the parties dispute focuses on pure or nearly pure questions of law,it engenders de novo review.gonzalez,at see valentín,at because the facts are not in issue,the court determination engenders de novo review.id.at noting that jurisdictional challenges grounded in considerations of sovereign immunity normally present what amount to pure or nearly pure questions of law.
preliminary considerations 
it is elementary that the united states,as sovereign,is immune from suit unless it has consented to be sued.united states mitchell,d.while the concept of sovereign immunity has its origins in the english common law,see cabrero,cir the king can do no wrong,the supreme court has recognized that sovereign immunity is also grounded in important public policy considerations.see larson domestic foreign commerce.t he interference of the courts with the performance of the ordinary duties of the executive departments of the government,would be productive of nothing but mischief.quoting decatur paulding,pet.united states fid.guar.public policy forbids the suit unless consent is given,as clearly as public policy makes jurisdiction exclusive by declaration of the legislative body.hence,any waiver of sovereign immunity can not be implied but must be unequivocally expressed.united states king,d see soriano united states,d t his court has long decided that limitations and conditions upon which the government consents to be sued must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied.
the ftca expressly waives the government sovereign immunity,permitting individuals to sue the government for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.b.the ftca,however,carefully circumscribes that waiver.one of the many constraints placed on it is a statute of limitations a tort claim against the united states shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate federal agency within two years after such claim accrues.id.b.as with all waivers of sovereign immunity,the supreme court has warned that this limitation,which requires a timely presentation of tort claims against the government,must be strictly construed.see united states kubrick,d i n construing the statute of limitations,which is a condition of that waiver,we should not take it upon ourselves to extend the waiver beyond that which congress intended.
at issue in this case is the date on which the plaintiffs tort claims accrued.if the plaintiffs filed their administrative claim more than two years after their claim accrued,their cause of action is.the general rule,within the meaning of the ftca,is that a tort claim accrues at the time of the plaintiff injury.attallah,at see kubrick,at.gonzalez,at.therefore,under this traditional rule,the skwira family claim would have accrued at the time of skwira injury,his february.see restatement second of torts cmt.c a cause of action for death is complete when death occurs.
in kubrick,however,the supreme court recognized that a discovery rule applies in the context of medical malpractice claims.see part,infra.under this rule,a claim accrues when an injured party knows both the existence and the cause of his injury.kubrick,at.quoting extensively from the restatement second of torts,the court in kubrick identified the two rationales for a discovery rule in medical malpractice actions 
one is the fact that in most instances the statutory period within which the action must be initiated is year,or at most two,being the common time limit but since many of the consequences of medical malpractice often do not become apparent for a period longer than that of the statute,the injured plaintiff is left without a remedy.the second reason is that the nature of the tort itself and the character of the injury will frequently prevent knowledge of what is wrong,so that the plaintiff is forced to rely on what he is told by the physician or surgeon 
kubrick,at.quoting restatement second of torts cmt.e see ware united states,cir courts created the medical malpractice discovery rule to protect those who suffered damage arising out of both a specialized area,medicine,and a unique relationship.
the courts of appeals have applied versions of kubrick discovery rule in settings other than medical malpractice and latent disease.see,lhotka united states,cir trespass and nuisance stoleson united states,cir occupational safety.the majority of courts that have considered the issue since kubrick have concluded that a discovery rule can apply in wrongful death actions,even if that action is not premised on a claim of classic medical malpractice.see,garza bureau of prisons,cir diaz united states,cir gould of health human,cir in re swine flu prods.liab,cir drazan united states,cir barrett united states,cir.but see garrett united states,cir declining to extend discovery rule to wrongful death action.
we have already extended the reasoning of kubrick far beyond the medical malpractice realm.see attallah,at theft.noting this fact,the government argues that two recent supreme court cases,trw andrews,d,and rotella wood,d,mandate that we retreat from our application of a discovery rule outside the medical malpractice and latent disease contexts.according to the government,a strict rule should apply in this wrongful death case.we disagree.
although the supreme court held in trw that under the fair credit reporting act fcra,et,a claim accrues at the time of injury,not when the injury is discovered,the court noted that the fcra,a complex statutory scheme,had a statute of limitations which already contained a discovery exception for willful misrepresentation.trw,at.see.thus,according to the court,since the fcra explicitly delineates the exceptional case in which discovery triggers the statute of limitation,any further extension of the fcra discovery rule should come from congress,not the court.trw,at.by comparison,the ftca statute of limitations contains no such exception.see b.moreover,liability under the ftca is premised on general principles of the common law of torts,and not on a statutorily created right.
in rotella,the court actually applied a discovery rule outside the medical malpractice context,holding that a claim under civil rico does not accrue when the plaintiff learns of the conspiracy,but,rather,when he learns of his injury.see rotella,at.indeed,the rotella court noted that lower federal courts generally apply a discovery rule when a statute is silent on the issue.id.at.but,the court continued,we have been at pains to explain that discovery of the injury,not discovery of the other elements of a claim,is what starts the clock.id.
thus,we reject the government position that a strict rule should apply outside the medical malpractice and latent disease contexts,and we have no reservations about applying a discovery rule to this wrongful death action.the more difficult questions are the nature of that discovery rule and its applicability to the facts of this case.we now turn to those questions.
united states kubrick 
given the importance of the supreme court reasoning in kubrick to the application of a discovery rule,we must discuss that decision in some detail.william kubrick sought treatment in a veterans administration hospital in april for an infection of his leg.his treating physician prescribed large doses of the antibiotic neomycin.approximately six weeks after the treatment,kubrick began to suffer from tinnitus and loss of hearing.he saw other doctors about the new condition,and they diagnosed it as bilateral nerve deafness.in january another physician,upon reviewing kubrick previous medical records,informed kubrick that it was highly possible that the hearing loss resulted from the neomycin treatment.in june another physician told kubrick that the neomycin had,in fact,caused the hearing problem and that its administration was medical negligence.
in kubrick filed his administrative claim.the issue before the supreme court was whether the plaintiff claim accrued when he first began in to suffer from hearing loss,when he learned in that the treatment probably caused his hearing loss,or when he was told in that the treatment definitively caused his hearing loss and that the treatment was negligent.the district court had held that kubrick claim accrued only when he had reason to suspect that a legal duty to him had been breached,in,and that his claim filed in was timely.the court of appeals affirmed,ruling that even though kubrick knew of his injury and the government probable responsibility for it as early as,his claim did not accrue until he had adduced facts which would have alerted a reasonable person to the possibility that the treatment was improper.kubrick,at.quoting kubrick united states,cir.
although the supreme court accepted the appropriateness of a discovery rule for medical malpractice cases,it nevertheless reversed,holding that kubrick claim did not accrue in when he learned that his injury was the result of negligence.instead,the court held that his claim accrued in when he first learned of his injury and its probable cause.the court explained 
we thus can not hold that congress intended that accrual of a claim must await awareness by the plaintiff that his injury was negligently inflicted.a plaintiff such as kubrick,armed with the facts about the harm done to him,can protect himself by seeking advice in the medical and legal community.to excuse him from promptly doing so by postponing the accrual of his claim would undermine the purpose of the limitations statute,which is to require the reasonably diligent presentation of tort claims against the government.
kubrick,at.
kubrick therefore answered one important question that had divided the courts whether the accrual of a claim depended on a victim actual knowledge of negligence.see kubrick,at.overruling cases cited therein.the court answered that question in the negative.however,the court recognition in kubrick of a discovery rule raised new questions,such as does a discovery rule apply beyond the medical malpractice context,and what knowledge short of actual knowledge of negligence provides a sufficient factual basis to trigger accrual under a discovery rule.as indicated above,the former question has been answered in the affirmative by several circuits,including our own.the latter question,however,has dogged federal courts ever since kubrick.see kent sinclair charles szypszak,limitations of action under the ftca a synthesis and proposal,harv.on legis,t he court left unclear whether the statute commences only when a plaintiff has actual knowledge of an injury and its cause and the court did not address other situations where application of the diligence discovery rule may be difficult due to unique factual considerations.see also cutting,d at the issue of precisely how much knowledge is needed to trigger accrual bedevils discovery rule analysis.
c.the accrual standard 
in kubrick,the plaintiff knowledge of his injury deafness and its probable cause the administration of neomycin provided the factual basis for his claim.see kubrick,at.this knowledge alone triggered the statute of limitations because,with knowledge of the injury and its probable cause,the plaintiff need only have made inquiry among doctors with average training and experience in such matters to have discovered that he probably had a good cause of action for medical malpractice.id.at.in the medical malpractice context,where the personal identity of the treating physician is usually known to the patient,knowledge of the legal status of the physician as a federal employee is not required for claim accrual.absent extraordinary circumstances,t he statute of limitations under the ftca does not wait until a plaintiff is aware that an alleged is a federal employee.gould,at see gonzalez,at rejecting argument that the statute of limitations should be tolled on the ground that the plaintiff was unaware of the defendants status as federal employees gould,at nowhere in kubrick is any reference to the legal identity of the.presumably,a reasonably diligent plaintiff,once he is aware of his injury and its probable medical cause,can discover within the statute of limitations period the employment status of his treating physician,as well as the negligence basis for a legal claim.therefore,in the medical malpractice context,where there is often a direct relationship between the patient and doctor,one need not know of a governmental causal connection for a claim to accrue under the ftca.
outside the medical malpractice context,however,the identity of the individual s responsible for an injury may be less evident,and a plaintiff may have less reason to suspect governmental involvement.not surprisingly,courts of appeals have been slightly more forgiving in these cases,deferring the accrual of claims until a reasonably diligent plaintiff has reason to suspect a governmental connection with the injury.for example,gloria garza regalado was murdered by her husband shortly after he had escaped from the city of faith halfway house in monroe,louisiana.the administrator of regalado estate filed suit in state court against the city of faith,alleging negligence in the home failure to notify law enforcement and regalado of her husband escape.over the course of discovery,the administrator learned that the person responsible for notifying law enforcement of the escape was a federal bureau of prisons employee.the administrator subsequently filed suit in federal court against the bureau under the ftca.according to the eighth circuit,the estate claim did not accrue when the administrator knew of the injury,death and its cause,murder.rather,the court indicated that a claim would accrue once the plaintiff has reason to believe he ha s been injured by an act or omission by the government.garza,at emphasis added.
the eleventh circuit has formulated its accrual standard in similar terms,holding that a wrongful death action accrues when the plaintiff knows,or exercising reasonable diligence should know,both of the decedent death and its causal connection with the government.diaz,at emphasis added.we agree with these courts that,outside the medical malpractice context the proper subject of knowledge for accrual purposes under the ftca is the fact of injury and the injury causal connection with the government.as the preceding quote from diaz makes clear,there is,of course,a reasonable diligence component to this knowledge requirement.a plaintiff may not bury her head in the sand.id.at.if she fails to undertake a reasonably diligent investigation into the cause of injury,the law will impute to her an awareness of any knowledge that she would have uncovered if she had undertaken that inquiry.see kubrick,at.
having determined the knowledge content that triggers accrual outside the medical malpractice context knowledge of injury by an act or omission of the government,we must next ask how certain this knowledge must be.the supreme court indicated in kubrick that definitive knowledge of the cause of injury is not required to trigger the accrual of a medical malpractice claim it is undisputed in this case that in january kubrick was aware of his injury and its probable cause,and that knowledge,according to the court,formed the factual predicate for a claim.kubrick,at.emphasis added see also id.at.sataloff in january informed kubrick that it was highly possible that the hearing loss was the result of the neomycin treatment.emphasis added.
following kubrick,we have similarly indicated that something less than definitive knowledge is required.for example,we have also stated that a medical malpractice claim has accrued o nce a plaintiff knows of the injury and its probable cause.gonzalez,at emphasis added see also id.at indicating that claim accrues when plaintiff was on notice of the injury and its potential cause emphasis added.outside the medical malpractice context,courts have similarly indicated that something less than definitive knowledge is required.in garza the court stated that a claim accrues once the plaintiff had reason to believe that the government was responsible for the injury.garza,at.the court in diaz said that in order for the claim to accrue,a plaintiff must have some indication that there may have been a government cause of the injury.diaz,at.in ramming united states,cir per curiam,the fifth circuit said that a claim accrues once a plaintiff has knowledge of facts that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that there was a causal connection.id.at.
in assessing these varying formulations,we are mindful of the emphasis in kubrick that the knowledge which triggers accrual and hence the running of the statute of limitations is the discovery of sufficient facts about the injury and its cause to prompt a reasonable person to inquire and seek advice preliminary to deciding if there is a basis for filing an administrative claim against the government a plaintiff such as kubrick,armed with the facts about the harm done to him,can protect himself by seeking advice in the medical and legal community.kubrick,at.the degree of knowledge of injury and cause that would prompt a reasonable person to take these protective steps will vary with the circumstances of the case,but,in any event,conclusive knowledge is not necessary.hence,in line with the best precedents,we hold that,outside the medical malpractice context,a claim accrues under the ftca once a plaintiff knows,or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should know,of her injury and sufficient facts to permit a reasonable person to believe that there is a causal connection between the government and her injury.
our dissenting colleague claims that this holding contravenes kubrick and its as a clear,unbroken line of authority that has firmly established that the baseline threshold for accrual under the discovery rule is knowledge of an injury and its cause,with cause defined as the immediate physical basis for the injury.respectfully,there is no such unbroken line of authority that supports this formula.courts of appeals have,in fact,struggled to apply the discovery rule of kubrick outside the medical malpractice context,see szypszak,supra,at,and cases cited therein however useful courts may have found kubrick in deciding cases with similar facts,they continue to apply the diligence discovery rule to dissimilar cases in an ad hoc manner,and a rule that may seem forgiving in one scenario can be harsh in another.the case primarily relied upon by the dissent for its formula,dyniewicz united states,cir,illustrates these difficulties well.
the dyniewicz plaintiffs parents were killed during a flash flood on a highway that the plaintiffs claimed should have been closed due to hazardous conditions.despite actively pursuing a claim against the state,the plaintiffs did not learn of possible federal governmental responsibility until over two years after their parents deaths.the ninth circuit,affirming the district court dismissal of the case,imposed a strict rule that once the immediate physical cause of the injury is discovered,an ftca plaintiff claim accrues even if the involvement of the federal government in the injury is unknown.dyniewicz,at.since there was no dispute that the immediate physical cause of the parents injury was drowning,the ninth circuit held that the plaintiffs claim was.id.at.under the rule we articulate today,however,the plaintiffs claim would not necessarily have been.moreover,in a subsequent case,the ninth circuit indicated that the rule we find in the cases is supported by the language of kubrick.see gibson united states,cir quoting kubrick,at.t he prospect is not so bleak for a plaintiff in possession of the critical facts that he has been hurt and who has inflicted the injury.emphasis added.the gibson court,however,rejected the plaintiffs request for such a rule,indicating that dyniewicz,as binding precedent,forced the imposition of the harsher rule.see gibson,at b inding circuit precedent forecloses us from considering such an extension of kubrick.
moreover,the dyniewicz rule proposed by the dissent is inconsistent with our holding in attallah.in that case,a courier transporting currency on behalf of the plaintiffs was abducted,robbed,and murdered in puerto rico in september shortly after arriving at the local international airport.attallah,at.the decomposed body of the courier was found in a nearby rain forest soon thereafter,and the local police advised the plaintiffs that they had no leads as to who was responsible for the criminal acts.almost five years later,in may,a federal grand jury returned an indictment against two former agents of the customs service,alleging that they were responsible for the murder and robbery of the courier.in january the plaintiffs filed an administrative claim for the loss of the currency possessed by the courier at the time of his abduction.
on appeal,the government argued that the plaintiffs claim was since it was filed almost six years after the plaintiffs knew of their injury.the government,advocating for a rule such as that found in dyniewicz,argued that the plaintiffs were aware of their injury and its cause on or about september,when the body of the murdered courier was found hence,the claim accrued at that point.rejecting this argument,we concluded that under the circumstances of that case,the plaintiffs claim accrued at the time of the indictment against the former agents because the plaintiffs did not know,nor in the exercise of reasonable diligence could have known of the customs agents criminal acts until the time of their indictment.id.at by way of contrast,if,as our dissenting colleague posits,knowledge of cause for accrual purposes means knowledge of the immediate physical basis for the injury,then attallah was wrongly decided since the plaintiffs in attallah knew that their employees had been murdered and robbed within days of their disappearance.see attallah,at.we held otherwise,however,since the plaintiffs had no indication that government employees were responsible for their loss until an indictment had been filed.here,unlike the plaintiffs in attallah,the skwira family had indications of government involvement well before investigators told them definitively that gilbert had poisoned skwira.
application of the accrual standard 
in some applications of the discovery rule to the question of accrual,there will be an issue about the reasonable diligence of the plaintiff in investigating the fact and cause of her injury.in the skwira family case,their reasonable diligence is not at issue.rather,we can resolve the question of accrual,as did the district court,on the basis of the information the family received from government officials and the local press,prior to any independent inquiry undertaken by the family.the district court concluded that the skwira family cause of action accrued,at the latest,the day after skwira autopsy in november,when the family first learned that skwira did not die of the causes listed on his death certificate.by that point in time,the family had knowledge of the numerous press reports describing an ongoing investigation into the unusually high number of deaths in the same ward in which skwira died.those reports indicated that the actions of a particular nurse were the focus of the investigation.when government investigators asked the skwira family for permission to exhume skwira body,they informed the family that they had suspicions about the high number of deaths at the vamc during a relatively brief window of time that included the period in which skwira was hospitalized.finally,the autopsy demonstrated conclusively that the cause of death listed on skwira death certificate was incorrect.these accumulated facts provided a sufficient basis in november for a reasonable person to believe that there was a causal connection between the injury skwira death and the acts or omissions of a government employee.therefore,the statute of limitations clock began ticking at that point.
the family subjective beliefs,described in deposition and trial testimony,reinforces the correctness of this conclusion.skwira son philip testified in his deposition that it was a surprise that skwira had died of a cardiac event since he had been admitted only for treatment of his alcoholism.skwira daughter marsha yarrows testified at gilbert criminal trial that she was shocked by the unexpected news of skwira cardiac arrest,and during her deposition she also expressed her belief that his care at the vamc had been inadequate.
yarrows also testified during gilbert trial that she had read the press reports regarding a murder investigation into deaths on ward c.she stated that when she read these accounts,it was like a light bulb went off because i knew that was exactly what had happened to my father.she also testified that after reading the newspaper accounts,
really bothered me,and even though my father name was mentioned as being one of the people who was investigated,i knew right then and there that that was exactly what had happened to him,that he was one of those people that they must be investigating the death of.
despite this realization,and despite the press reports and the information provided by investigators after the autopsy,the skwira family insists that their claim did not accrue in november since t he critical facts regarding the existence and cause of skwira injury were inherently unknowable until june of.the government was in possession of skwira heart and tissue samples until that time,and the technology and testing protocols for detecting epinephrine were,by and large,invented for the gilbert prosecution.hence,the family argues,there was no way they could have known in november the actual cause of skwira death,and the statute of limitations should be tolled until they did.see gonzalez,at indicating that statute of limitations may be tolled if the factual basis for the cause of action is inherently unknowable quoting attallah,at.
the skwira family reads inherently unknowable too broadly.the factual basis of a claim is inherently unknowable when,as in attallah,there are no facts discoverable through the exercise of reasonable diligence which would permit a plaintiff to reasonably believe that her injury is connected with some act of the government.see attallah,at.as explained above,by november the skwira family was aware of press reports concerning the suspicious deaths on ward c they knew that the government had begun a criminal investigation into skwira death and they knew that the cause of death printed on skwira death certificate was incorrect.this information provided sufficient knowledge to start the limitations clock ticking in november.from that point in time,the family had two years to seek out independent legal and medical advice to determine if they should file an administrative claim against the.moreover,as we explained in part iii,supra,to file an administrative claim and preserve ones rights under the ftca,one need only be in possession of sufficient information for the agency to investigate the claims,at.
we realize that considerable enquiry and investigation may be necessary before a plaintiff can make a responsible judgment about the actionability of her claim.rotella,at.the skwira family may have felt that need acutely in the difficult circumstances of this case.however,as the supreme court noted in rotella,identifying professional negligence may also be a matter of real complexity,and its discovery is not required before the statute starts running.id.citing kubrick,at.one does not have to be certain of actionability in order to submit an administrative claim simply put,the skwira family failed to meet the modest burden of filing an administrative claim within two years of the claim accrual the district court therefore properly dismissed the action 
final considerations 
before leaving this matter,we must address two additional arguments ably presented in an amicus brief submitted by the american legion,and not directly addressed in the discussion above.first,amicus argues that we should apply a rule that a cause of action for death caused by the criminal conduct of a government employee accrues only when there is sufficient information to indict.such a rule would be a significant expansion of the discovery rule adopted in kubrick.if anything,as noted earlier,the supreme court has indicated its reluctance to expand the scope of kubrick discovery rule.see trw,at.rotella,at.
amicus also argues that we should liberally construe the discovery rule to protect the rights of veterans and their families.we understand the powerful considerations that underlie that argument.however,we are constrained by supreme court precedent which unequivocally states that limitations and conditions upon which the government consents to be sued must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied.soriano,at.we must therefore reject the liberal construction advocated by amicus.
the district court was faced in this case with the unenviable task of telling five families that,despite the tragic deaths of their loved ones at the hands of a government employee,their claims for compensation under the ftca were.understandably,the court reluctantly reached its decision that as a factual matter,there was sufficient information available to the skwira family and other plaintiffs to reveal a connection between the vamc and the deaths more than two years before they filed their administrative claims.cutting,d at.
in reviewing the district court ruling,we have slightly revised the terms of its inquiry,holding that,outside the medical malpractice context,a claim accrues under the ftca once a plaintiff knows,or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should know,of her injury and sufficient facts to permit a reasonable person to believe that there is a causal connection between the government and her injury.in applying this holding to the facts,we,like the district court,must reluctantly conclude that the skwira family claim accrued more than two years before they filed their administrative claim with the va,and hence their action is.
under the federal tort claims act,b,the skwira family was required as a condition of suing the federal government to file an administrative claim within two years of the accrual of their cause of action.although tort claims customarily accrue at the time of injury,the practice is widespread of providing extra by delaying accrual or tolling the the basis for suit is not apparent when the initial injury occurs.hospital del maestro,cir restatement second of torts,cmt.e.the locus classicus is the sponge left in the patient during surgery.
in united states kubrick,d,the supreme court adopted this discovery rule for a medical malpractice claim against the government under the federal tort claims act.id.at.since then,most circuit courts to consider the question have been willing to apply the same reasoning to other kinds of claims against the government where,in the nature of things,the prospects of any claim against the government were so hidden that a reasonable plaintiff would not have been alerted to their existence,attallah united states,cir osborn united states,cir.
at the same time,kubrick,like many other discovery rule cases,makes clear that a plaintiff is not entitled to wait until all of the facts in support of the claim are known.kubrick,at.rather,once the plaintiff knows enough to provoke a reasonable person to inquire further,the plaintiff has the duty to investigate.see gonzalez united states,cir.in substance,the plaintiff is charged with knowing what he might have found out by actively pursuing his bare suspicions and then filing a claim when there are reasonable prospects of liability.
critically,when the plaintiff knows or should know enough to prompt a claim,he may not yet know enough to win the suit.childers oil exxon,cir.to win a suit may require the development of further facts,perhaps even the conduct of discovery and further study by experts.but the discovery rule is a compromise between competing interests and under the federal tort claims act,the burden on the plaintiff is peculiarly slight all that is needed to comply with the statute is the filing of a simple form with the responsible federal agency.b claim for damage or injury standard form,wl fed.proc.forms.
it is easy,especially in a case where government was actively investigating,to ignore the importance of the principle of early notice to the putative defendant.the longer the delay between the original wrong and the onset of litigation,the more likely that evidence on the defense side may be lost.yes,in this case,nothing like that occurred but statutes of limitation unlike laches are framed to work mechanically indeed,one of their benefits is that arguments about whether there was prejudice from delay are banished from the scene.
the formulas used in the cases for implementing the discovery rule are neither precise nor consistent.ultimately the question,highly dependent on the facts,is whether the plaintiff knew enough as to the potential responsibility of the defendant two years of that should have filed the short form apprizing the government of a potential claim against it.often,in close cases like this one,this is a jury not in a suit against the government.lehman nakshian,d no right of jury trial for tort claims against the federal government.
in this case,the district court carefully analyzed the undisputed raw facts.those confirm that by,the skwira family had learned that other suspicious deaths had occurred at the hospital in addition to the wholly unexpected sudden death of edward skwira,that a government investigation involving the attorney and the state police was underway,that skwira exhumation was necessary,and that based on the autopsy the death certificate had misstated the cause of death.and,of course,it was known that the hospital was run by the federal government.
at this point,a reasonable person would have believed that some kind of negligence or misconduct by government employees at the hospital might well underlie edward skwira death.that some of the plaintiffs actually had such suspicions is not necessary but appears to have been the fact.the skwiras then had two further years to investigate.further,on similar evidence the family of one of the other victims did file a claim within the time period allowed.yet the skwira family waited over three years after the autopsy report before filing their claim.
the problem in this case is primarily one of applying an abstract and rather general notice to trigger the discovery a unique fact pattern among an endless parade of possibilities.the major peculiarity here is that the skwira family could probably not have had definitive proof of their claim before the government completed its investigation.this makes the present case highly unusual normally,as in kubrick itself,one whom suspicions prompt to consult an expert or a lawyer can usually get a good fix on liability within a reasonably brief period.
but under the discovery rule,definitive proof of wrongful conduct and government liability is not required to start the period for filing a claim.kronisch united states,cir,cert.denied,d childers,at.so the question is whether a further delay should be interpolated into the limitations period for cases in which,though substantial suspicions should have been excited,they could not in the nature of things have been fully satisfied within the next two years.at least one circuit court has been willing to delay the statute while science sorted matters out,stoleson united states,cir on the other hand,filing the claim form,thereby tolling the statute,is not a burdensome task.
alternatively,some might think that where the government is actively investigating a matter,private parties should be allowed to await the outcome of the official investigation and that the statute should be tolled in the meantime.but this choice too involves competing policy concerns and the engrafting of a exception upon statutory language that gives no hint of any such reservation.and given the range of government investigations into official and private conduct of all kinds,such an exception could have ramifying consequences that a court can not easily assess.
perhaps the supreme court will move in the direction of stoleson or of an exception for pending government inquiry,but there are some reasons for a lower court to be cautious.where the sovereign has consented to be sued for its agents wrongful acts,the court has construed reasonably strictly the limits on such consent.kubrick,at.kubrick itself reversed a line of circuit precedent that,while adopting the discovery rule,applied it rather too freely.see id.at.collecting cases.recent supreme court decisions have also been quite respectful of limitations periods,trw andrews,d rotella wood,d.
in the end,the risks of prompting persons to file claims too soon seem less weighty than the importance of getting notice to the government at the earliest reasonable opportunity.it is one thing to cut off a claim where no reasonable suspicion existed within the limitations period.but where the claimant thinks or should think that he may well have a claim,then under present law the government should be notified within two years.if the law is to be further,congress may well be better equipped to devise the options and assess the consequences.
i am forced to dissent because the majority contravenes supreme court doctrine established in united states kubrick,d and longstanding circuit precedent interpreting kubrick.see gonzalez united states,cir attallah united states,cir.the majority causal connection approach runs contrary to the doctrine established in those cases because it eliminates the requirement that before a statute of limitations runs on an ftca claim,a plaintiff must be aware both of the existence of his injury and the facts of causation.kubrick,at.
in this case,the appellants could not possibly have discovered the medical cause of edward skwira death before june.as is established by the record,the government itself was unable to discern the cause of skwira death until it invented special techniques and protocols for detecting excess levels of epinephrine in the body.until june,date when the government first informed appellants about the facts of causation the skwira were in no position to know how skwira had died.thus,the appellants were in the position described by the supreme court as one warranting delayed is,where the facts of causation are in the control of the putative defendant,unavailable to the plaintiff or at least very difficult to obtain.id.at.emphasis added.
the standard adopted by the majority improperly allows a claim to accrue before a reasonably diligent plaintiff could possibly have discovered the medical or physical cause of his injury.according to the majority,a discovery rule claim accrues once a plaintiff knows or should,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,know the fact of injury and the injury causal connection with the government.op.at.thus,once injury is known,the statute of limitations begins running as soon as the plaintiff discovers sufficient information to determine that his injury is probabl y connected with some act of the government.op.at.the causal connection approach,in other words,puts a premium on the identity of the defendant so long as a plaintiff might determine who injured him,the statute of limitations starts to run against a plaintiff,even if he could not,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,discover what injured him,or how he was injured.
this case presents no basis for implementing a novel accrual standard.the majority alludes to confusion in the standards articulated by kubrick and its progeny,and the unique nature of malpractice cases as potential justifications for implementing a new accrual standard.however,looking at kubrick and its progeny,i think it is clear that our discovery rule jurisprudence,while less than crystal clear,is well established enough that the majority decision to depart from kubrick accrual standard in favor of the causal connection standard is unwarranted.moreover,there is nothing in the record that distinguishes this case from past malpractice and wrongful death cases which have been considered under our accrual standard.
kubrick and its progeny 
while kubrick left open some questions regarding the parameters of the discovery rule,the core holding of kubrick is clear and has been repeatedly applied by this and other circuits in both medical malpractice and malpractice contexts.
the kubrick court established that accrual does not occur before the plaintiff knows both the existence and the cause of his injury.kubrick,at.emphasis added.the court clearly distinguished between a plaintiff ignorance of his legal rights which will not halt accrual and knowledge about the facts of causation which is required to trigger accrual.id.at.thus while accrual will not wait for a plaintiff to discover that his injury was negligently inflicted,it is clear that a claim can not accrue before a plaintiff is or should be aware of the existence and cause of his injury.under kubrick,knowledge of an injury and its cause constitutes the factual predicate for the claim.id.at.thus,as the fourth circuit has stated,t he clear import of kubrick is that a claim accrues within the meaning of the ftca when the plaintiff knows or,in the exercise of due dilligence,should have known both the existence and the cause of his injury.gould dep t of health and human services,cir.
even if kubrick ultimately left open questions regarding claim accrual,this court has repeatedly construed kubrick as holding that a claimant knowledge of the existence and cause of his injury is the baseline knowledge required to trigger accrual.in gonzalez,we recently clarified that kubrick meant that o nce a plaintiff knows of the injury and its probable cause,bears the responsibility of inquiring among the medical and legal communities about whether was wronged and should take legal action.id.at citing kubrick.our holding in gonzalez is consistent with all of our prior discovery rule cases.see,nicolazzo united states,cir citing kubrick holding that in medical malpractice suits,the claim accrues when a plaintiff discovers,or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the existence and cause of his injury rivera fernandez chardon,cir finding that the kubrick court concluded that the limitations period began to run when the plaintiff knew of the existence and the cause of his injury lazarini united states,wl cir,per curiam citing kubrick for the proposition that claims accrue when the plaintiff knows both the existence and the cause of his injury fisher united states,wl at cir,per curiam the supreme court has determined that a plaintiff must know the critical facts of his injury and its cause in order for his cause of action to accrue under the federal tort claims act.
the majority interpretation of kubrick also departs from the discovery rule standard as articulated by nearly every other circuit court.see,massey united states,cir finding that the kubrick court held that a claim under the ftca accrues when the plaintiff knows both the existence and cause of the injury garza united states bureau of prisons,cir same winter united states,cir same gould,at cir same barren by barren united states,cir same chamness by and through chamness united states,cir arvayo united states,cir same 
the majority is not free to jettison the causation requirement at this stage.although the discovery rule standards applied in the past may differ slightly from one another these nominal differences do not justify wiping the slate clean and imposing a more rigorous accrual standard for plaintiffs to satisfy.in sum,it is firmly established that the baseline threshold for accrual under the discovery rule is knowledge of an injury and its cause.unless the causal connection standard satisfies this threshold,it is an unwarranted departure from circuit precedent.
b.what constitutes the facts of causation 
the majority emphasis on who caused skwira injury,rather than how he was injured or what injured him is seriously misguided.in light of the long line of cases requiring knowledge of the facts of causation to trigger accrual,the only way to sustain the majority approach would be to argue that its causal connection standard actually satisfies this court causation requirement.however,this argument would require us to construe the term cause in a manner inconsistent with legal precedent.
discovery of the cause of one injury does not mean knowing who is responsible for it,or even discovery of the alleged tortfeasor probable connection to the injury rather,an injury cause is known when the immediate physical basis for the injury is discovered.dyniewicz united states,cir.that is,cause means the immediate cause of injury from a medical point of view,and not the legal identity of the alleged tortfeasors.gould,at see also davis united states,cir.this is evident from kubrick itself,where the court determined that the critical causative fact that set the statute of limitations running was that kubrick was aware of the fact that the administration of an antibiotic was the medical cause of his injury.kubrick,at.thus,the majority claim that its causal connection approach is grounded in the logic of kubrick is unfounded as one circuit has noted,n owhere in kubrick is any reference to the legal identity of the.gould,at see also gibson united states,cir knowledge of cause is knowledge of immediate physical cause,not knowledge of involvement and culpability of federal agents.
applying kubrick outside the medical malpractice context 
without a trace of irony,the majority also claims that it is free to implement its novel causal connection standard because skwira injury occurred outside of the medical malpractice context.op.at.that is,because nurse gilbert intentionally injected skwira with epinephrine,the appellants claims against the united states merit consideration under a different standard than that applied to other malpractice cases.since no such standard has been clearly articulated yet by this circuit,the majority allows itself to invent a new one.
even if this distinction were generally appropriate,the facts in this case do not permit us to treat it as a purely case.this case involves a medical professional administering an excessive dose of a toxic substance to a patient undergoing treatment at a government hospital.that the drug was administered with the intent to kill does not itself distinguish this from similar cases involving latent injury or causation,or other cases arising from a breach of the relationship.ware united states,cir courts created the medical malpractice discovery rule to protect those who suffered damage arising out of both a specialized area,medicine,and a unique relationship.accordingly,the district court correctly noted,the facts of this case,charging hospital based negligence or malfeasance,make it functionally identical to a malpractice case.cutting united states,d.
second,the rationale for delaying accrual in medical malpractice cases is entirely appropriate here.as the supreme court has noted,the cry for a discovery rule is loudest in malpractice cases,because the facts about causation may be in the control of the putative defendant,unavailable to the plaintiff or at least very hard to obtain.rotella wood,d quoting kubrick,at.medical malpractice cases enjoy their privileged status not because they are unintentional we have historically treated these cases differently because they often involve hidden,complex,and unknown factors which an injured plaintiff would not ordinarily be expected to grasp.in this case,where the facts about skwira injury were in the control of the government,unavailable until,and impossible to obtain,the rationale for applying the discovery rule is identical to a case of pure medical malpractice.the latent and complex medical causation issues in this case should have led the majority,like the district court below,to treat the appellants claims under the traditional rubric of medical malpractice discovery rule cases.
applying the existing standard to skwira 
i respectfully submit that when the proper standard is applied to these is,when we attempt to ascertain when we could first charge appellants with knowledge of the existence and cause of skwira case is a much closer one than it appears in the majority opinion.
the plaintiffs,like the government agents investigating skwira death,could not possibly have discovered that skwira died from the administration of a drug until.and unlike the plaintiffs in kubrick,it would have been futile for the skwiras to inquire among doctors with average training and experience in such matters to have discovered that they probably had a good cause of action.kubrick,at.this fact is significant because o rdinarily,a plaintiff can not be expected to discover the general medical cause of his injury even before the doctors themselves are able to do so.chamness,at quoting rosales united states,cir.
the only causative facts in the appellants possession were knowledge that skwira death certificate was incorrect and that the hospital and its employees were the subject of an investigation.however,the sum of this information does not constitute any knowledge regarding the physical cause of skwira injury.at most,the plaintiffs knew that everything they thought they knew about skwira death was wrong 
the opinion does not cite a single case in support of its harsh conclusion that a claim may accrue before plaintiffs could possibly obtain information about an injury medical or physical cause.it cites no cases to support treating the appellants claims any differently from other medical malpractice claims.it disregards the standards articulated by this court in attallah at and gonzalez,at.respectfully,it is only by adopting a nebulous causal connection test that the panel can make any headway under kubrick own facts about causation requirement,it would be extremely difficult on this record to show that appellants had sufficient knowledge of the medical cause of skwira death.
knowledge of an injury cause is a critical fact,without which a claim can not accrue.by reducing the causation requirement to mean only a probable connection between the injury and the defendant,the majority puts its thumb on the scale and transforms our accrual standard into one too strict for plaintiffs whose injury involves latent or complex causes.in such cases,considerable enquiry and investigation may be necessary before a plaintiff can make a responsible judgment about the actionability of his claim.rotella wood,at.
the plaintiffs delay in filing their administrative claim was justified by the impossibility of discovering the cause of edward skwira injury.because the appellants filed that claim less than two years after discovering the cause of skwira injury,i do not believe their claim to be barred by the statute of limitations.i respectfully dissent.
there is a time line of the events giving rise to this litigation at the end of this opinion.

in two brief paragraphs on the penultimate page of the appellants page the heading the judge determination was based on unsupportable findings of fact the appellants take issue with the district court recitation of one fact.the district court stated that skwira experienced a severe cardiac event,a dissecting aneurysm.cutting,d at.the family disputes this finding.it is clear,however,from the context of the opinion that the district court meant only that the skwira family was told that a dissecting aneurysm was the cause of death as indicated on the death certificate.later in its opinion,the court makes clear that skwira,in fact,died of epinephrine poisoning.id.at.since the appellants have chosen to challenge only this one fact in the district court opinion,any other objections to the district court factual findings are forfeited.see,cir.
the supreme court had already recognized the former injury justification for applying a discovery rule under the federal employers liability act fela.as the kubrick court explained in urie thompson,the court held that a claim under fela did not accrue until the plaintiff injury manifested itself.in that case,plaintiff urie contracted silicosis from his work as a fireman on a steam locomotive.his condition was diagnosed only in the weeks after he became too ill to work.the court was reluctant to charge urie with the unknown and inherently unknowable and held that because of his blameless ignorance of the fact of his injury,his claim did not accrue under fela until his disease manifested itself.at.kubrick,at.
it would be an extraordinary circumstance if the government or its agents have misled or deceived a plaintiff,or otherwise hidden the legal identity of alleged tortfeasors as federal employees.garza,at.in that case,accrual of the plaintiff medical malpractice claim may be deferred,but the plaintiff must at the very least show that this information could not have been found by a timely diligent inquiry.gonzalez,at original emphasis.
with all due respect to the district court and our dissenting colleague,this case is not functionally identical to a medical malpractice case.this case involves a criminal act by a government employee and the claim,primarily,that this employee was negligently supervised at the vamc.as a matter of proof,the elements of a negligent supervision claim differ significantly from the elements of a medical malpractice claim.see,marpe dolmetsch,zajac mary of nazareth hosp,d,wright.hosp.of cleveland,ohio app d.moreover,in a medical malpractice case,knowledge of the federal status of the malpractitioner is irrelevant for accrual purposes.see gonzalez,at.as explained in the text,however,courts have relaxed this arguably harsh rule outside the medical malpractice context,thereby emphasizing the importance in the ftca context of the distinction between medical malpractice and malpractice cases.
as indicated in part iii,supra,to file an administrative claim under the ftca and thereby preserve one rights,one need only be in possession of sufficient information for the agency to investigate the claims,at.
after the disappearance of the courier,the attallah plaintiffs had conducted their own investigation.they visited the customs service office at the airport where they were told that the courier had been processed and left the premises.we noted that,a side from this information,appellants had no other source of information regarding the whereabouts of their courier,and that the plaintiffs were not privy to the police investigation.attallah,at.
in the skwira family case,if the family had submitted a timely notice of claim,they could have asked the agency to hold the claim in abeyance pending the outcome of the ongoing criminal,upon denial of the claim,filed a lawsuit in good faith,on information and belief,and then ask the court to stay discovery pending the outcome of the ongoing investigation.indeed,the district court stayed the instant litigation until the end of gilbert criminal trial.
the fact that the skwira family decided to place their trust in the attorney office,electing not to seek competent independent legal advice until much later,does not alter that conclusion.see gonzalez,at t he limitations period begins to run regardless of whether plaintiffs make inquiries,and regardless of whether they are correctly advised.
the district court concluded that one of the other plaintiffs below,nancy cutting,successfully filed her administrative claim within two years of its accrual.see cutting,d at nancy cutting conduct provides a template for reasonable promptness under the discovery rule in these cases.the government also concedes that caroline brandt,the wife of another of gilbert victims and not a party to the litigation below,filed a timely administrative claim,thereby preserving any rights she may have.
