plaintiffs,the estate of dorothy martin and mary martin,dorothy daughter,claim that defendants the california department of veterans affairs department and its officers and administrators illegally denied dorothy martin admission to the veterans home of california home because of a disability,specifically,alzheimer disease and alzheimer related dementia.the district court granted judgment as a matter of law to defendants on some of plaintiffs claims,and a jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants on the remainder.we hold that the rejection of dorothy martin applications did not violate the equal protection clause,the rehabilitation act,or the americans with disabilities act and therefore affirm 
factual and procedural history 
plaintiffs claims arise from dorothy unsuccessful applications to reside at the home these facilities provide a home for aged and disabled persons who served in the armed forces of the united states of america,who were discharged or released from active duty under honorable conditions,and who are california residents at the time of application.cal.mil.a.
admission also depends on additional factors.department regulations direct the home to admit eligible applicants,provided that care for their needs can be furnished within the available resources of the veterans home and subject to the levels of care for which direct admission is permitted.regs.tit,a.the regulations further provide that the ability of the veterans home to provide adequately and appropriately for the applicant medical and social needs and the applicant ability and willingness to adapt to the veterans home environment shall be determining factors.id.d emphasis added.the home shall refuse admission to applicants with medical conditions or disabilities requiring specialized care,handling,or treatment or other resources not available at the veterans home.id.emphasis added.in addition,admission is provided only on a first come,first served basis.id.a.
the home is licensed by the state of california department of health services to provide five levels of care independent living or domiciliary assisted living or residential care intermediate care skilled nursing care and acute hospital care id.residents move through the levels of care according to their medical needs.
the evidence at trial showed that dorothy required skilled nursing care the level of care available to residents,at the time of her applications.during the period she sought admission,an applicant could not be admitted directly to skilled nursing care unless the occupancy rate at that care level was below.id.f.in addition,at that time,the barstow and chula vista campuses did not provide skilled nursing care to new applicants and the yountville campus was admitting residents to the domiciliary level of care only.
dorothy was diagnosed with alzheimer and alzheimer related dementia in.over an approximately period beginning in early,dorothy applied to,and was denied admission by,each campus of the home.
mary martin cared for her mother until her mother died in november.during that time,mary used her own money to pay for her mother care.mary also suffered anxiety,frustration,sleeplessness,and despair.
following dorothy death,plaintiffs brought this action,alleging that defendants illegally denied dorothy admission to the home because of her disability and stating claims under numerous theories of recovery.over the next three years,those claims were winnowed down to claims against the department under the rehabilitation act,and the americans with disabilities act ada,and claims against the department officers in their individual capacities under for violations of the equal protection clause and california tort law.plaintiffs sought to recover compensatory,special,and punitive damages.
the case was tried to a jury for a week.before the jury returned its verdict,the parties filed for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure a.the district court granted defendants motion in part,dismissing plaintiffs equal protection and state law tort claims against the department officers,mary martin claims under the ada and the rehabilitation act against the department,and the estate request for compensatory damages under the ada and the rehabilitation act.the jury returned a verdict in favor of the department on plaintiffs remaining ada and rehabilitation act claims.plaintiffs again moved for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,a new trial.defendants moved for costs.the district court denied plaintiffs motion and granted costs to defendants,but only those associated with the rehabilitation act,equal protection,and state law tort claims.plaintiffs timely appeal.

discussion 
a.the estate ada and rehabilitation act claims 
the estate first argues that the department violated the ada and the rehabilitation act.title ii of the ada and section of the rehabilitation act prohibit discrimination because of a disability to establish a violation of either statute,the estate must show that dorothy martin was disabled within the meaning of the statute she was otherwise qualified for the home,that she could meet the essential eligibility requirements of such services,with or without reasonable accommodation she was denied the services because of her disability and the department received federal financial assistance for the rehabilitation act claim or was a public entity for the ada claim zukle regents of of,cir.
the parties agree that dorothy was disabled within the meaning of the ada and the rehabilitation act and that the department is a public entity that receives federal assistance.the parties disagree,however,on whether dorothy was otherwise qualified for services and whether she was denied those services because of her disability.
plaintiffs contend that dorothy was a qualified individual because she satisfied the statutory requirements of california military veterans code section a.we agree.dorothy was an honorably discharged veteran and a california resident,so she met those basic eligibility requirements.
in so holding,we reject defendants argument that the regulatory requirements appearing in california code of regulations sections are eligibility requirements.those regulations prescribe space and resources considerations that must be taken into account when deciding whether an otherwise eligible applicant should be admitted to the home.for example,section a provides that the home shall admit all eligible applicants,provided that care for their needs can be furnished within the available resources of the veterans home and subject to the levels of care for which direct admission is permitted.regs.tit,a.by requiring that the home admit all eligible applicants as long as adequate resources are available,the text of section a implies that the eligibility criteria come from another source,not from section a.
similarly,section b states,in part,that the home shall provide equal opportunity for admission to all eligible applicants.id.b.the reference to eligible applicants in this regulation confirms that it supplies admission criteria,and not eligibility requirements.the other regulations also speak in terms of admission criteria rather than eligibility requirements.see,id.the veterans home shall refuse admission to applicants with medical conditions or disabilities requiring special care emphasis added id.a the veterans home shall admit veterans on a first come,first served basis emphasis added.
moreover,construing the regulations in sections as admission criteria,rather than eligibility requirements,better reflects the common understanding of the concept of eligibility.an individual eligibility for a certain program generally refers to a determination based on that individual own characteristics.by contrast,the requirements in sections restrict admission because of factors that have little to do with an applicant personal eligibility for services,such as the availability of resources to care for the applicant.
for these reasons,we conclude that dorothy was otherwise qualified for the home services.she met the eligibility requirements of section a and did not have to meet the requirements of sections.because dorothy was otherwise qualified,we need not address whether reasonable accommodation was possible.
we next turn to the causation element of plaintiffs claims.although dorothy was otherwise qualified for home services,the estate failed to establish violations of the ada and the rehabilitation act because it could not prove that dorothy was denied those services by reason of for the ada claim or solely because of for the rehabilitation act claim her disability.
with respect to the ada claim,we have held that the phrase by reason of in the statute establishes a motivating factor causal standard for liability when there are two or more possible reasons for the challenged decision and at least one of them may be legitimate.head glacier,cir.that is,if the evidence could support a finding that there is more than one reason for an allegedly discriminatory decision,a plaintiff need show only that discrimination on the basis of disability was a motivating factor for the decision.id.here,however,dorothy never argued that there was more than one reason for denying her admission to the home.she consistently argued that the only reason was her disability 
because dorothy eschewed a theory,it is questionable whether the motivating factor test should apply.but,even if it should,dorothy failed to show that her disability was a motivating factor for denying her admission to the home.the evidence at trial demonstrated that dorothy was denied admission because of the home lack of resources and space to provide the level of care that she required.dorothy required help with at least five activities of daily living,which meant that she qualified only for skilled nursing care.no beds were available in the yountville campus skilled nursing care facility when dorothy applied,and neither the chula vista campus nor the barstow campus had licensed skilled nursing care facilities into which she could have been admitted.in other words,dorothy was denied admission because none of the facilities had adequate resources to be able to care for her properly,not because of her disability.the verdict form reflects that the jury unanimously found that dorothy failed to prove that the defendant california department of veterans affairs discriminated against dorothy martin by reason of her disability emphasis added,and the evidence at trial supports that finding.
the causal standard for the rehabilitation act is even stricter,demanding that dorothy show that she was denied services solely by reason of her disability.a.as we have explained above,dorothy failed to show that she was denied admission solely by reason of her disability.
in sum,we hold that,on this record,the jury reasonably found that the department did not discriminate against dorothy martin on the basis of her disability.the policies that plaintiffs attack,rather than discriminating on the basis of disability,simply reflect the unfortunate fact that a facility with limited resources can not serve every disabled individual who needs care.the department must decide whom to admit and whom to turn away.here,it has made decisions on the permissible basis of the availability of adequate resources to care for an individual applicant,not on the impermissible basis of disability discrimination.
mary martin ada and rehabilitation act claims 
mary martin appeals the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law to the department on her ada and rehabilitation act claims,which allege financial and emotional loss as a result of the department alleged discrimination against her mother.the district court held that mary ada and rehabilitation act claims were procedurally improper because the department did not cause her direct injury.
we need not reach the question whether mary can bring claims under the ada and the rehabilitation act because her derivative claims are premised entirely on the existence of illegal discrimination against dorothy.because the department did not discriminate against dorothy,no derivative claim could succeed on the merits,even if it were procedurally proper.see united states washington,cir we may affirm on any basis supported by the record even if the district court did not rely on that basis.internal quotation marks omitted.
c.the estate claim 
in a claim brought under,the estate alleges that the department officers violated the equal protection clause by treating dorothy and similarly situated with alzheimer related dementia who are not than other applicants.a governmental policy that purposefully treats the disabled differently from the need only be rationally related to legitimate legislative goals to pass constitutional muster.lee city of los angeles,cir quoting does chandler,cir see also city of cleburne cleburne living,d declining to apply heightened scrutiny to a classification based on mental retardation.applying that standard,we have no difficulty concluding that the department admission policies pass constitutional muster.
the government must have substantial latitude to establish classifications that account for limitations on the practical ability to remedy every ill.plyler doe,d see also lipscomb simmons,cir en banc upholding the allocation of finite resources available to the state in foster home funding because it was rationally related to the government interest in maximiz ing the amount of money available for the program.the home does not reject applicants because of dementia rather,the home accepts applicants with dementia if there are resources available at the level of care required for them and sufficient resources remain to meet the anticipated care requirements of all current residents.the department officers method of classifying applicants on the basis of their initial level of is rationally related to the goal of providing care to as large a group as possible,given limited resources and a huge population of potentially eligible california veterans consequently,we affirm the district court grant of judgment to defendants as a matter of law on this claim.
mary martin claim 
mary martin advances a claim for the violation of dorothy martin equal protection rights.as a general rule,a third party does not having standing to bring a claim asserting a violation of someone else rights.see powers ohio,d in the ordinary course,a litigant must assert his or her own legal rights and interests,and can not rest a claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.we recognize an exception to this general rule if,among other things,there exist s some hindrance to the third party ability to protect his or her own interests.voigt savell,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,the estate,which is the other plaintiff in this action,has pursued a procedurally proper albeit substantively unsuccessful equal protection claim directly on behalf of dorothy martin.we therefore hold that mary martin does not have standing to bring a claim under alleging that defendants violated her mother right to equal protection under the laws.
e.the estate state law tort claims for emotional distress 
the estate alleges tort claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress under california law.the district court held that,under california law,the estate tort claims for emotional distress did not survive the death of dorothy martin.we agree.
under california law,
i n an action or proceeding by a decedent personal representative or successor in interest on the decedent cause of action,the damages recoverable are limited to the loss or damage that the decedent sustained or incurred before death,including any penalties or punitive or exemplary damages that decedent would have been entitled to recover had the decedent lived,and do not include damages for pain,suffering,or disfigurement.
emphasis added.notwithstanding the emphasized text,which clearly precludes recovery of emotional distress damages,the estate reasons that the tort claims survive because dorothy could have recovered punitive damages.
the california court of appeal recently considered and rejected this precise argument.berkley dowds,th,d.section does not permit recovery for emotional distress upon the death of the person allegedly harmed and,under california authority,an award of compensatory damages in some amount is a prerequisite to a punitive damage award.berkley,d at.we see no reason to disagree with the analysis of the california court of appeal.see vestar dev.ii,llc dynamics,cir stating that,if the state highest court has not decided the issue and there is no convincing evidence that the state supreme court would decide differently,a federal court is obligated to follow the decisions of the state intermediate appellate courts internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law to defendants on the estate state law tort claims for emotional distress.
mary martin state law tort claims for emotional distress 
mary martin alleges a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress under california law and argues that the alleged violations of the ada,rehabilitation act,and support her claim that defendants conduct was outrageous.in order to establish a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress,mary must prove,among other things,extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing,or reckless disregard of the probability of causing,emotional distress.christensen superior court,cal d,d,internal quotation marks omitted.as discussed above,plaintiffs claims of discrimination under the ada,the rehabilitation act,and fail.consequently,this state law claim fails as well.
mary also alleges a bystander claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress under california law.in order to establish that claim,mary must prove,among other things,that she wa s present at the scene of the injury producing event at the time it occur red and wa s then aware that it wa s causing injury to the victim.thing la chusa,cal d.because we have held that dorothy suffered no legally cognizable injury,mary can not recover on a bystander theory.accordingly,we affirm the district court on mary martin state law tort claims of emotional distress.
costs to defendants 
finally,plaintiffs challenge the district court award of costs to defendants.we are not persuaded by their arguments.
the district court ruled that defendants were not entitled to costs under the ada because such costs are appropriate only if the claim is frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation.see brown lucky stores,cir holding that the standard announced in christiansburg garment eeoc,d permitting the recovery of attorney fees by a prevailing defendant under title vii only when the claim was frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation also applies to the award of costs under the ada.the court held that plaintiffs ada claims did not meet that standard.
the district court awarded costs under the rehabilitation act,however.although there was no direct authority to guide it,the district court observed that the costs provision of the rehabilitation act is more similar to the costs provision in title vii than to the costs provision in the ada.for that reason,the district court concluded that costs under the rehabilitation act are governed by national organization for women bank of,cir per curiam,which held that costs under title vii follow the general rule that costs are awarded as a matter of course absent express statutory provision,unless the court otherwise directs.id.at quoting.d.the district court also ruled that defendants were entitled to costs on plaintiffs state law tort claims.the court apportioned costs and,because the ada claim was the central claim in plaintiffs action,awarded only of defendants request.
plaintiffs argue that the same christiansburg governs costs under the ada should govern costs under the rehabilitation act.to our knowledge,none of our sister circuits has applied the christiansburg standard to costs under the rehabilitation act,and we decline to do so here.
in brown,we examined the text of the ada to determine whether our ruling in summers teichert son,cir,in which we acknowledged that the christiansburg standard applies to a request for attorney fees under the ada,also applied to a request for costs under the ada.brown,at.we looked at the text of the costs provision of the ada t he court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee,including litigation expenses,and costs emphases added.we observed that the ada makes fees and costs parallel and held that,as a result,the christiansburg standard does apply to costs under the ada.brown,at.
that parallel structure in the ada between costs and attorney fees is critically absent from the relevant texts of both the rehabilitation act and title vii.compare b rehabilitation act permitting the prevailing party to recover a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs emphasis added,and k title vii allowing a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs emphasis added,with ada permitting the court to award a reasonable attorney fee,including litigation expenses,and costs emphases added.thus,our rationale in brown for applying christiansburg to the award of costs under the ada does not carry over to costs under the rehabilitation act.
considering the similarity between the costs provisions in title vii and the rehabilitation act,it is appropriate to use our title vii precedent,as the district court did,to establish a standard for the award of costs under the substantively identical text in the rehabilitation act.as is the case with title vii,t here is no express statutory provision for applying christiansburg to cost awards under the rehabilitation act,and we see no reason to impose rigid limitations on the district court discretion.org.for women,at.
moreover,the text of the rehabilitation act supports an inference that costs are to be awarded in the ordinary course.section b of the rehabilitation act provides that,i n any action or proceeding to enforce or charge a violation of the rehabilitation act,the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.that text makes an attorney fee award discretionary if given,it may be made a part of the costs.the text d
