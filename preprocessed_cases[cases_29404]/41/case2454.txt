the california nurses association gave notice to the children hospital of oakland in august,that it intended to conduct a sympathy strike at the hospital to show support for other workers who were planning to engage in a primary strike.the hospital then filed this action,seeking a declaration that sympathy strikes are barred by the provision in the collective bargaining agreement,and seeking damages for the expenses incurred in strike preparation.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the union,and the hospital appeals.the appeal raises the question whether a general clause in a collective bargaining agreement bars sympathy strikes.
background 
the california nurses association cna represents all of the approximately nurses who work at children hospital of oakland cho.in the summer of,local of the international longshore and warehouse union ilwu,which represents the cho technologists,was engaged in contract negotiations with the hospital.local established a strike deadline of august,and soon thereafter,pursuant to section g of the national labor relations act nlra,g,cna gave written notice of its intent to conduct a sympathy strike,should ilwu local in fact call a primary strike in response to the sympathy strike notice,the hospital took a number of precautions,including canceling some types of surgeries,transferring patients with certain needs,and declining to accept new patients.shortly before the deadline,the threatened technologists strike was averted.consequently,the cna sympathy strike did not occur.
contending that the clause of its collective bargaining agreement with the nurses union prohibited sympathy strikes cho filed this action pursuant to the nlra,seeking a declaration that the clause bars sympathy strikes.cho also sought monetary damages for the economic losses resulting from the precautionary measures taken after cna gave its sympathy strike notice after discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment,and the district court granted the defendant motion.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.playboy enter.welles,cir.
ii.discussion 
this case presents the question of whether and under what circumstances a general clause in a collective bargaining agreement waives the employees rights to engage in sympathy strikes.specifically,we determine whether in this case the cna waived the right to call a strike in sympathy with the members of another union.
waiver of sympathy strike rights 
the term sympathy strike ordinarily refers to a strike conducted by workers belonging to one bargaining unit in support of a primary strike that is conducted by workers belonging to another bargaining unit at the same plant or shop 
the two groups of workers are usually represented by different unions.the primary strikers are seeking improved wages,benefits,and working conditions or are protesting unfair labor practices or other grievances.the sympathy strikers do not have a primary objective of their own,but seek to assist the primary strikers to achieve their goals.
the right to honor another labor organization picket lines is established by of the nlra,which provides that 
employees shall have the right to,to form,to join or assist labor organizations,to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing,and to engage in other concerted activity for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection,and shall also have the right to refrain from such activities 
sympathy strikes have long been held to fall within the protections of,and to constitute lawful acts of concerted activity in discussing the importance of the role of sympathy strikes to the efforts of workers to organize collectively,we have previously observed that a n integral part of any strike is persuading other employees to withhold their services and join in making the strike more effective.nlrb southern cal.edison,cir.sympathy strikes are a means by which workers can demonstrate their solidarity with their brothers and sisters who are engaged in a primary strike.r espect for another union picket line leads to a stronger labor movement.id.at.
the right to strike,including the right to strike for the purpose of supporting the cause of workers represented by a different union,may be waived in a collective bargaining agreement.see mastro plastics nlrb.strike waiver generally nlrb rockaway news supply.sympathy strike waiver.any waiver by a union of the right to strike must,however,be clear and unmistakable.metropolitan edison nlrb,d.we have applied that rule specifically to waivers of the right to engage in sympathy strikes.oil,chem.and atomic workers int union,local nlrb,cir hereinafter chevron quoting metropolitan edison,at.international of workers nlrb,cir hereinafter arizona public serv.a general clause that does not specify whether sympathy strikes are included or excluded does not,simply by virtue of its incorporation in a collective bargaining agreement,constitute such a clear and unmistakable waiver.indianapolis power light nlrb,cir the rationale for applying the clear and unmistakable standard to waivers of strike rights is this if a union is negotiating away employees rights that are fundamental to the collective bargaining process,any proposed contract must unambiguously put those employees on notice of the waiver.see interstate brands bakery drivers bakery goods vending machines,local,cir discussing the rationale for the clear and unmistakable standard.
despite our rule,the hospital argues that in this case the clear and unmistakable standard does not apply.cho first contends that when cna threatened a sympathy strike,it exercised its own rights,and not those of the membership.the hospital maintains that,following the supreme court holding in wright universal.serv,d,the clear and unmistakable standard is not applicable to a union waiver of its own rights.in wright,the supreme court stated that the clear and unmistakable standard does not apply to an an individual waiver of his own rights.id.at.the hospital apparently constructs the unusual argument that in this case the union was acting on its own behalf,and not on behalf of the workers it represents,in order to escape wright unequivocal affirmation that the clear and unmistakable standard applies to a union waiver of the rights of represented employees.id.at.
cho relies on the fact that the august,sympathy strike notice was issued by cna without a prior poll of its members although under the nlra,a membership vote is not required.cho contends that because the individual employees were never specifically asked whether they wished to assert their rights,and were free to refrain from participating in the threatened action,the strike threat was an act by the union on its own behalf only.relying on wright,cho then argues that if the union is considered to have exercised its own sympathy strike rights,rather than its members,then the clear and unmistakable standard does not apply,and the general language of the clause must be read to bar the union action 
there are two fundamental errors in the hospital argument.first,neither the language of the nlra,precedent nor logic supports the distinction the hospital seeks to draw between the union rights and those of its members.a member right to strike is derived from of the nlra,that by its very terms,protects employees rights to engage in concerted activities.it is a right,like the other rights protected by of the nlra,that may be implemented collectively through concerted action,principally in the form of or authorized collective economic action.section does not,however,bestow on a union a right to strike that is separate and distinct from the rights of the workers it represents.rather,when a union calls or conducts a strike,it does so in its capacity as the representative or agent of its members,and acts for and on their behalf.such is the function of labor unions to act as the collective bargaining representative of their members as well as of other employees in the bargaining unit.see wright,at.there is no precedent for the hospital suggestion that the right to strike involves two separate bundles of rights,one belonging to the union and the other to the workers.indeed,in southern california edison we dismissed a similar argument,only in that case it was the nlrb general counsel who asserted that a waiver in the collective bargaining agreement applied only to the union and not to its members.we summarily reject ed the suggestion that the language addressed only activity and left individual employees free to engage in strike activity.at.
the second flaw in the hospital argument is that wright does not alter our analysis of waivers of strike rights.to the contrary,it supports cna argument.in wright,the supreme court reasoned that because a union acts as an agent or representative,it remains a third party for waiver purposes.at.the court examined the applicability of the clear and unmistakable standard in the context of a claim that a collective bargaining agreement included a waiver of rights,and concluded that the standard applies to a union waiver of the rights of represented employees.id.at.thus,nothing in wright requires us to depart from our precedent that a union waiver of the right to engage in a sympathy strike must be clear and unmistakable.
all three of our prior sympathy strike cases have applied the clear and unmistakable rule.see chevron,at arizona public,at southern cal.edison,at.cho contends that the three cases are inapplicable here because they all involved union members who refused to cross another union picket lines even though their own union failed to call a sympathy strike.it is true that in none of the three cases did we address the effect of a general clause on a sympathy strike.however,we see no reason why a general clause should apply differently when the individual workers choose to honor another union picket lines on their own,than when those workers act in response to a union call for collective action.nor,if the applicable collective bargaining agreement does not prohibit the workers from exercising collectively the right to engage in a sympathy strike,do we see any basis for concluding that it forbids the union to act in its role as their collective bargaining representative and call a sympathy strike.
we therefore reaffirm our earlier holdings that the waiver of the right to engage in sympathy strikes must be clear and unmistakable.this holds true regardless of whether workers seek to exercise that right in the absence of any union action,or whether the union asserts the right to call a sympathy strike on behalf of those it represents.in both instances,if the union and the employer have negotiated a waiver of the members statutory right to strike,we must carefully examine the scope and circumstances of the particular waiver provision to determine whether the right to engage in sympathy strikes has been clearly and unmistakably waived.
b.the scope of the provision 
we turn now to an analysis of the clause in the collective bargaining agreement between the hospital and cna to determine if it contains a clear and unmistakable waiver of the nurses rights to engage in sympathy strikes.whether a union has clearly and unmistakably waived sympathy strike rights of those it represents is determined by the provisions of the particular collective bargaining agreement at issue and the intent of the parties.arizona public,at quoting mastro plastics,at.we have held that when,as here,the language of a clause is general in scope,we must examine the relevant extrinsic evidence to determine if the parties intended that general language to include sympathy strikes.id.
although the nlrb has held that a general clause gives rise to the presumption that sympathy strikes are included,indianapolis power light local,ibew,wl,rev.on other grounds,it also held on remand that the presumption may be overcome by extrinsic evidence showing that there was no mutual intent to include sympathy strikes within the scope of the clause.indianapolis power light local,ibew,wl.on remand,the board ruled that an agreement to disagree over the scope of a clause does not waive the right to honor other unions picket lines.id.on that basis,it found that there was no clear and unmistakable waiver in the case before it.
in reviewing the board second indianapolis power decision,the seventh circuit commented on the incoherence of the board use of the presumption that a broad clause encompasses sympathy strikes,pointing out that the presumption is of little significance in light of the fact that the union waiver of the employees statutory rights must be clear and unmistakable.indianapolis power light nlrb,cir.although the court did not formally proscribe the board use of the presumption,it concluded that as a practical matter when extrinsic evidence of the parties intent exists,the burden is on the employer to show that the parties intended to include sympathy strikes within the purview of the clause.id.
although after the indianapolis power cases were decided by the nlrb,we explicitly declined to decide whether the presumption is proper under the nlra,see chevron,at,we agree with the observations of the seventh circuit.there is obviously a substantial tension between applying a presumption of waiver and requiring that a waiver be clear and unmistakable.as a practical matter,there is always extrinsic evidence of some sort,if only the contract history.thus,regardless of any presumption,the burden inevitably shifts to the employer to show by clear and unmistakable evidence that a general waiver of the right to strike includes sympathy strikes.accordingly,we adopt the seventh circuit reasoning 
since the union waiver of the employees statutory rights must be clear and unmistakable,the extrinsic evidence must manifest a clear mutual intent to include sympathy strikes within the scope of the clause or else the clause will not be read to waive sympathy strike rights a broad provision by itself is not sufficient to waive the right to engage in sympathy strikes if extrinsic evidence of the parties intent does not demonstrate that the parties sic mutually agreed to include such rights within the breadth of the clause.
indianapolis power,at emphasis added.because the nlrb presumption is of so little practical consequence,we see no greater reason here than we did in chevron to determine its validity.
generally,in reviewing extrinsic evidence as part of our effort to construe a collective bargaining agreement,we look to the bargaining history,the context in which the contract was negotiated,the interpretation of the contract by the parties,and the conduct of the parties bearing upon its meaning.arizona public,at see also john morrell united food workers,cir united states steel nlrb,cir.after examining the extrinsic evidence in this case,the district court granted cna motion for summary judgment,concluding that no question of material fact existed as to whether cna clearly and unmistakably waived its sympathy strike rights.we agree,and address the relevant arizona public service factors 
bargaining history.the history of bargaining between cna and the hospital strongly militates against a conclusion that the union clearly and unmistakably negotiated a waiver of the employees right to engage in a sympathy strike.although cna has represented the nurses employed at children hospital since the early,the collective bargaining agreement did not include a provision at all until.in that year,a clause identical to the current one was added to the collective bargaining agreement between cna and the associated hospitals of san francisco and the east bay,a bargaining association that included cho.the associated hospitals chief negotiator testified that there was no discussion across the table as to whether or not the clause included sympathy strikes.from through,cna and associated hospitals agreed to a series of six collective bargaining agreements,all of which included the same clause.neither party recalls any discussion of the clause whatsoever during the bargaining sessions that yielded those agreements.
beginning in,cna negotiated its contract directly with cho rather than with the associated hospitals the provision has never been changed.cho did,however,attempt to modify the
