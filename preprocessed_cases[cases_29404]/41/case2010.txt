on june,mission hospital medical center mission,a acute care hospital in mission viejo,california,purchased from adventist health systems west adventist the assets of south coast medical center south coast,in laguna beach,california,also a facility.however,mission attempted by an purchase to avoid south coast potential liabilities under south coast medicare provider agreement.these liabilities encompassed potential mandated reimbursement to medicare for any previous overpayments made to south coast.parenthetically,this labyrinthine system is not a street.should medicare determine it has underpaid a hospital,for example with respect to outlier costs for a beneficiary requiring higher treatment costs than anticipated in the prospective payment system pps system,medicare will subsequently compensate the provider accordingly.how complicated is this process,and how long does it take we attach,payment for extraordinarily cases cost outliers as an appendix.this daunting regulation demonstrates why continuity is contemplated by the medicare system.
as a consequence of mission decision to purchase only south coast assets,the secretary of the department of health and human services the secretary duly determined that mission was not entitled to bill medicare for patient services at its new facility until that facility had a provider agreement of its own.this decision blocked mission from collecting million for services rendered between july,and september,at south coast,which was now known as mission laguna beach campus,and roughly million for normally medicare eligible services between july,and march,when the laguna beach campus was finally accredited and properly enrolled as a provider in medicare.
seeking remuneration for services provided,mission appealed the secretary decision,first to the department of heath and human services the department civil remedies division.an administrative law judge alj ruled in favor of the department.mission appealed the alj decision to the departmental appeals board dab,losing once again.the next stop was the district court,where it suffered the same fate.mission now appeals the secretary decision to us.
we have jurisdiction over this timely appeal pursuant to,and we affirm.
first,we explain what this controversy is not about.it is not about general unknown liabilities that might have arisen after the purchase date,for example from malpractice lawsuits,wrongful denial of privileges lawsuits,or construction and real estate disputes.this case deals only with the continuity of provider agreement contractual liability for medicare overpayments,which are not ascertainable until medicare accounting,calculating,and reconciliation,and which might not occur until years after initial billing.see a.nothing in this opinion should be taken to limit or restrict purchases of medical providers,or medicare reimbursements to purchases,so long as the purchase makes an exception for medicare reimbursement of overpayments.we note that,b y encompassing a system of interim payments on an estimated cost basis,subject to accounting,the program ensures medicare providers a steady flow of income sufficient to provide service.united states vernon home health,cir.this complex but routine pps adjustment,reconciliation,and reimbursement accounting process,to which all providers are subject,undoubtedly eliminates serious cash flow problems they would otherwise encounter.
second,this controversy does not involve an attempt by medicare to recover overpayments made to south coast,or for that matter,whether medicare has recovered any such payments from adventist,south coast previous owner.at issue is only whether mission can recover from medicare for services rendered as of the date of its operation of south coast as its laguna beach campus.
in addition,both parties agree that south coast provider agreement terminated as of june,after south coast submitted a standard form cms enrollment application notifying the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms of the impending acquisition and requesting a change in its enrollment.mission admits that 
b ecause mission hospital did not acquire south coast liabilities,including those related to its provider agreement,south coast provider agreement terminated upon south coast acquisition.this is the very reason that the hospitals filed their forms to bring the south coast laguna beach campus under mission hospital provider agreement upon south coast acquisition.
nevertheless,mission asserts that former d i permitted it to avoid south coast medicare liabilities simply by submitting,along with south coast,cms form to cms requesting that mission medicare provider agreement encompass the laguna beach campus effective july.mission argues that its submission of this form complied with d effective until september,and should have made july,the effective date of medicare enrollment for the laguna beach campus under mission existing provider agreement and without a new accreditation survey.mission admits that it deliberately did not take on the liabilities of south coast which was owned by adventist health.we left those liabilities there.those are between medicare and adventist.mission also admits it did not rely on cms when it made the decision to attempt this gambit to circumvent d,but instead on statements made to us by medicare contractors.
in the alternative,mission maintains it is entitled to the benefit of the retroactivity provision in d.this section says that the effective date of a provider like mission may be retroactive for up to one year from unpaid covered services provided to a medicare beneficiary.
not so fast,says the secretary.mission argument is too clever by half.granted,c says that w hen there is a change of ownership,the existing provider agreement will automatically be assigned to the new owner,here,mission.however,d as it read in,provided that a n assigned agreement is subject to all applicable statutes and regulations and to the terms and conditions under which it was originally issued.emphasis added.we note that this language talks about the terms and conditions under which the existing provider agreement was originally issued.the regulation does not say that the provider agreement shall contain new identical terms and conditions that are only.the regulation,which mission tried to circumvent,provides continuity of obligations,continuity which is essential to the functioning of medicare prospective payment system.the regulation talks about an assignment,not a new beginning with a clean slate on new terms.we note there is a statute of limitation on this adjustment arrangement.
one of the substantive and significant conditions in south coast medicare provider agreement was an obligation to reimburse medicare for any overpayments it might have received.see c,f in re tlc,cir.however,mission extinguished south coast provider agreement and voluntarily refused to assume south coast contractual liability to return overpayments to medicare.consequently,mission did not and could not take assignment of south coast provider agreement.accordingly,the laguna beach campus on july,became for medicare purposes a new hospital,without a provider agreement.i i defines a new hospital as an entity that has not accepted assignment of an existing hospital provider agreement in accordance with of this chapter.see also,a iv c,f iii a,d iii a.it follows that the laguna beach campus was not enrolled in medicare after mission acquired it as a new hospital on june.thus,the effective date of the enrollment of the laguna beach campus could not be fixed until it was separately accredited with its own provider agreement.
as it turned out,the joint commission,an independent organization that accredits and certifies more than health care organizations and programs in the united states,conducted an unannounced accreditation survey of the laguna beach campus on march.the joint commission reported finding two material deficiencies under the medical records condition of participation.see.mission complains that these deficiencies were not material,but they were material to the joint commission and cms and that what counts.the joi
