background 
boston scientific scimed,and boston scientific corporation collectively boston scientific own the patent,which relates to a expandable stent with a coating that has a surface.boston scientific sued cordis in march,alleging,inter alia,that cordis cypher stent infringed claim of the patent.claim,the only claim on appeal,depends from claim,which depends from claim.claims,and read as follows 
a medical device having at least a portion which is implantable into the body of a patient,wherein at least a part of the device portion is metallic and at least part of the metallic device portion is covered with a coating for release of at least one biologically active material,wherein said coating comprises an undercoat comprising a hydrophobic elastomeric material incorporating an amount of biologically active material therein for timed release therefrom,and wherein said coating further comprises a topcoat which at least partially covers the undercoat,said topcoat comprising a biostable,material which provides long term nonthromobogenicity to the device portion during and after release of the biologically active material,and wherein said topcoat is substantially free of an elutable material.
the device of claim wherein the medical device is an expandable stent.
the device of claim wherein the stent comprises a tubular body having open ends and an open lattice sidewall structure and wherein the coating conforms to said sidewall structure in a manner that preserves said open lattice.
patent.filed june.
in june,the district court construed certain limitations of claim.the court held that the phrase material which provides long term to the device portion during and after release of the biologically active material in claim means a material that does not promote thrombosis for a period of time that extends both during and after release of the biologically active material.claim construction opinion,dist.lexis,at,wl at.the court relied on medical dictionary definitions for the meaning of thrombogenic causing thrombosis or coagulation of the blood and thrombolytic break ing up or dissolv ing a thrombus,thrombolytic being a term the patentee used in the specification,but not the claims.id.at,wl at.the court rejected cordis proposed definition of,which required a significant reduction in thrombogenicity over that experienced with bare metal stents.id.at,wl,at.the court also construed the phrase substantially free of an elutable material to mean largely or approximately free of an elutable material.id.at,wl.
cordis makes the cypher expandable stent.the cypher stent has two coatings an undercoat containing the drug and a topcoat.early in the manufacturing process,the cypher stent topcoat is.the topcoat is sprayed on as a solution containing no drug but containing a polymer and two solvents,tetrahydrofuran or thf and toluene,both of which are toxic to humans.the solvents dissolve the drug,allowing it to diffuse from the undercoat into the topcoat.thus,when the cypher stent is sterilized,removing any remaining solvent,the drug has moved into the topcoat to such an extent that the topcoat and undercoat contain the same concentration of drug.the topcoat is thinner than the undercoat it contains about of the total amount of the drug in the stent after sterilization.
at trial,the jury found that claim of the patent would not have been obvious based on,among other prior art references,patent wolff and patent domb.the jury also found that the cypher stent infringed claim.after trial,cordis filed a renewed motion for jmol or,in the alternative,a new trial on infringement and validity.the court denied cordis motion.
in doing so,the district court upheld the jury nonobviousness finding over domb,wolff,and several other references.the court reasoned that domb,which discloses esophageal stents,does not suggest the use of metal in a stent,and that there was no evidence of motivation to combine domb with other references.opinion denying jmol,d at.the court reasoned that wolff,according to one expert,does not teach a metallic stent having a coating,and the failure of wolff assignee to create the claimed stent after more than a decade of work evidenced a lack of motivation to combine the features of its various prior art stents with each other.id.finally,as a secondary consideration of nonobviousness,the court found from expert testimony that the praise for and commercial success of the cypher stent were due to the claimed features and that,even after identifying an appropriate drug and stent,it took cordis a great deal of time to develop a stent.id.at.
regarding infringement,the district court reasoned that the jury infringement finding was based on substantial evidence because three experts had testified that cypher was.id.at.as for the substantially free limitation,the court found support for the jury infringement finding in a witness testimony that the topcoat is when applied and has about to drug after manufacturing is completed,finding that to drug may be considered substantially free.id.at.the court also pointed to evidence that a stent need not be sterilized to be implantable and thus that the stent could infringe during manufacture,when the topcoat was first applied and was then.id.the court referred to testimony that concluded,after applying the court claim construction,that the cypher stent was substantially free of elutable material.id.finally,the court found that the patent specifically contemplates that the drug will move into the topcoat prior to implantation,implying that the substantially free limitation does not preclude the topcoat from containing of the drug.id.the court thus held that the jury finding of infringement was based on substantial evidence.
after the district court denied cordis motions,cordis again moved for a new trial,based on newly discovered evidence that the fda had found an increased risk of thrombosis in patients who had been treated with stents.thus,according to cordis,the cypher stent could not provide long term.patent.the court denied cordis second motion for a new trial because the fda had opined that an increased risk of death and heart attack was only possibly due to stent thrombosis,and thus that the new evidence was too speculative to warrant either dismissal or a new trial.opinion denying new trial,wl,at.
cordis timely appealed the district court claim construction,the denial of jmol on both obviousness and noninfringement,and the denial of a new trial.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
claim.construction of 
cordis asserts that the district court erred by declining to construe the limitation to require less thrombogenicity than an uncoated metal stent.cordis argues that,according to the language of claim,the specification,and the prosecution history,the material must have an effect different from the stent natural effect,and that the specification itself compares the invention to metal stents.also,according to cordis,boston scientific admits that is a relative term requiring a comparison,and it waived any argument that the comparison should be to rough,porous coatings as opposed to bare metal stents.cordis also argues that the court should not have relied on dictionary definitions,especially of unclaimed terms.cordis asserts that undisputed evidence showed that cypher stents and stents were equally thrombogenic,such that cypher stents would not infringe under the correct claim construction.although cordis publicly declared that its stents were,seemingly meeting the claim language and thus infringing,cordis argues that its public statements used the term in a different sense from the patent and that its stents do not infringe.
boston scientific responds that nothing in the specification or prosecution history requires a comparison with bare metal stents any comparison is to other coatings that promote thrombosis,so even if the cypher stent were more thrombogenic than a bare metal stent,it would still infringe.indeed,boston scientific points out that the claim language allows some metal to be left uncoated,so that a comparison to bare metal stents would not make sense.according to boston scientific,the court definition conforms with both the ordinary meaning and experts definitions of.boston scientific adds that the cypher stent infringes claim of the patent under either the district court claim construction or cordis proposed claim construction.boston scientific notes that cordis admitted in fda submissions and promotional literature that the cypher coating is.boston scientific also points out that cordis uses toluene to smooth the surface and remove pores,preventing thrombosis,indicating that its stents are.finally,according to boston scientific,a new claim construction would require a remand to allow boston scientific to present a new infringement case.
we review claim construction de novo on appeal.cybor fas,en banc.we agree with boston scientific that the district court reasonably construed the limitation to mean a material that does not promote thrombosis for a period of time that extends both during and after release of the biologically active material.to determine the meaning of,we begin by considering the language of the claims.see phillips awh,en banc.the language of claim requires that the topcoat material provide to the stent,but it does not require a comparison to any other stent,either bare metal or coated.patent.as the claims themselves provide no other insight into the meaning of,we turn to the specification in order to determine if it provides a clearer indication of the scope of.
c laims must be read in view of the specification,of which they are a part.phillips,at quotation marks omitted.the abstract of the invention states that the surface is provided with sites which aid in reduc ing thrombogenic activity.patent abstract see also id.at using heparin to impart a surface to the material.thus,we can discern that the material must reduce thrombogenic activity because of its particular properties.this conclusion accords with the fact that stents are known to promote thrombosis,and the goal of the patent is to have the claimed stent promote thrombosis as little as possible,or not promote thrombosis at all.however,it is clear from the specification that the reduced thrombogenic activity is not necessarily reduced from that of bare metal stents.indeed,the specification discusses various ways of formulating a topcoat and then states that a top coat or surface coating modified to make the surface more presents a distinct advantage.id.at.thus,the reduced thrombogenic activity is clearly reduced from that of other coated stents whose topcoats have not been so modified.
cordis argues that the prosecution history precludes the district court construction of and that the claimed device must have had a reduced risk of thrombosis over that of a bare metal stent.a court should also consider the patent prosecution history,if it is in evidence like the specification,the prosecution history provides evidence of how the patent office and the inventor understood the patent.phillips,at citations and quotation marks omitted.during prosecution,the applicant added the limitation to overcome an anticipation rejection,explaining that the topcoat renders the coated device and arguing that the prior art did not provide the same benefit.however,the prior art device,according to the applicant,was directed to drug containing coatings for metal stents.parties joint app.at prosecution history of patent,amendment dated july.thus,if the amendment required reduced thrombogenicity over anything,it would be reduced over the prior art stent that is coated,not the bare metal prior art stent.the applicant therefore could not have considered to require reduced thrombogenicity over a bare metal stent.
cordis also argues that the district court should not have compared dictionary definitions of thrombogenic and thrombolytic because thrombolytic does not appear in the claim,and because it is treated synonymously with in the specification.we disagree.courts may of course rely on dictionary definitions when construing claim terms,so long as the dictionary definition does not contradict any definition found in or ascertained by a reading of the patent documents,phillips,at,and the court here did not err in relying on dictionary definitions to inform the meaning of the claim terms.the district court here permissibly looked to the definitions of thrombogenic and thrombolytic to inform the meaning of.because the court definition accords with the specification,prosecution history,and the dictionary definition of a related term,we affirm the district court definition of the term.we therefore need not address cordis arguments that,under a different claim construction,the cypher stent does not infringe claim of the patent.
construction of long term 
cordis also argues that the district court erred by construing long term to mean a period of time and abused its discretion in denying cordis motion for a new trial based on newly discovered data.according to cordis,the district court construction improperly erases the claim requirement of long term because the claim requires both long term and that the be provided during and after release of the biologically active material,whereas the court definition only required a period of time that extends both during and after release of the biologically active material.cordis argues that the court claim construction lessened the significance of what the specification describes as an important objective of the invention.moreover,according to cordis,data that became available after the trial but before entry of judgment showed that its cypher stent had thrombosis risks,and boston scientific itself publicly stated that the cypher stent had a higher incidence of late thrombosis than bare metal stents.
boston scientific responds that the long term requirement has not been read out of the claim because the district court construction includes a time limitation.neither the specification nor the prosecution history limits long term to the phenomenon of late stent thrombosis,which occurs more than one year after implantation.moreover,according to boston scientific,cordis has publicly stated that the same data it now relies on is flawed.boston scientific also argues that the data cordis seeks to include is cumulative and existed before trial,so it is not new evidence.
we agree with boston scientific that the district court correctly construed the long term aspect of the limitation.neither the specification nor the prosecution history defines the period of time that is long term,other than to require that it be longer than two weeks,patent,and the claim construction includes two time limitations,like the claim itself.the claim construction requires both a period of time and that the period extends both during and after release of the biologically active material.even assuming,as cordis argues,that the specification describes as an important objective of the invention,it does not further elucidate the meaning of long term or require that those specific words be used in the claim construction.we thus affirm the district court construction of the limitation,including the long term aspect.
we next turn to the issue of the validity of the patent.cordis argues that the district court erred in denying cordis motion for jmol of invalidity of the patent on the ground of obviousness.according to cordis,the wolff patent alone renders the invention of claim obvious.figure of wolff shows a polymer stent made of a polymer with a barrier topcoat,and wolff also refers to the stent and topcoat as separate layers.figure of wolff then shows a metallic stent with a polym
