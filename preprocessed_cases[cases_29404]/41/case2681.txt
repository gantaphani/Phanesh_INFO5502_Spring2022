this case involves the allegedly discriminatory suspension of a physician medical staff privileges.medical staff privileges allow a physician both to treat patients at the hospital and to receive patient referrals from that hospital,administrators,and hospitals associated with wellstar health system wellstar suspended the medical staff privileges of appellant,omar jimenez,an physician with a specialty in neurosurgery.jimenez believed the suspension was racially motivated and brought claims against the appellees,individually and collectively,under state and federal law.the district court dismissed the federal claims pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.the questions before this court are whether jimenez allegations are sufficient to establish claims under for discrimination or retaliation,or under for conspiracy to interfere with his rights on the basis of race.
background 
on january,wellstar surgery department medical care evaluation committee required jimenez to appear before it to address numerous complaints the committee had received regarding jimenez medical performance.three days later,jimenez was informed that the committee decided to suspend his medical staff privileges at wellstar.the complaints considered by the committee included allegations that jimenez failed to promptly respond to calls,failed to timely make rounds to see patients,and performed inappropriate operations.
as a result of the suspension,jimenez was forbidden to interact with patients at wellstar hospitals and told that any attempt to do so would be considered trespassing.the president of wellstar health system then sent jimenez a letter explaining in greater detail the findings on which the committee had based his suspension.the committee found that jimenez had engaged in eighteen instances of inappropriate patient treatment,which included his failure to respond to requests for emergency consultations,failure to maintain adequate neurological for patients,and failure to manage surgical complications in a timely manner.jimenez requested a hearing to appeal his suspension.
five months later,in june,jimenez filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging the committee suspended his medical staff privileges for impermissibly discriminatory reasons.approximately eleven months after jimenez had submitted his request for a hearing and six months after he had filed his charge with the eeoc,the hearing still had not been granted and jimenez withdrew his request.because he had no medical staff privileges at any hospital during the majority of,jimenez was unable to obtain board certification and he lost his eligibility to renew his medical staff privileges with wellstar.
on january,jimenez filed a complaint in federal court,alleging wellstar racially discriminated against him when it suspended his medical staff privileges.jimenez alleged both that wellstar knew the complaints were false and that other,american physicians who had committed more serious infractions were nevertheless not disciplined.jimenez claims wellstar violated by both discriminating against him and by delaying a hearing on his suspension after he had reported the discrimination.lastly,jimenez claims wellstar violated by conspiring to interfere with his property,contract,and rights because of his race

iii.analysis 
jimenez discrimination claim 
title creates a federal right of action for victims of certain types of racial discrimination.to state a claim for discrimination under,a plaintiff must allege he is a member of a racial minority,the defendant intended to racially discriminate against him,and the discrimination concerned one or more of the activities enumerated in the statute.rustein avis,cir.the rights enumerated in the statute include the right to make and enforce contracts,to sue,be parties,give evidence,and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens.a.
the parties agree jimenez has sufficiently alleged facts satisfying the first two prongs of a prima facie claim.the controversy centers on whether 
jimenez adequately pled that wellstar alleged discrimination concerned activities enumerated by the statute.jimenez advances three theories as to why suspension of his medical staff privileges violated rights protected under.he contends the suspension of his privileges violated his contractual relationship with wellstar interfered with his right to contract with patients and payors and deprived him of his property interest in his profession.each of these theories fails.
contractual relationship with wellstar 
to state a claim under for interference with a right to contract,a plaintiff must identify an impaired contractual relationship under which the plaintiff has rights.kinnon acroub,gopman,cir quotations omitted.jimenez contends he had an implicit contract with wellstar,pursuant to which wellstar agreed to grant jimenez medical staff privileges and,in turn,jimenez agreed to treat patients at wellstar hospitals.under such a theory,the staff privileges would serve as the consideration for the contract they would not themselves create the contract.thus,jimenez concludes,wellstar revocation of jimenez privileges amounted to a breach of contract,and,because the revocation was allegedly for discriminatory purposes,the revocation violated.
wellstar policies make clear that medical staff privileges do not confer upon a physician any contractual rights georgia law agrees.under georgia law,medical staff bylaws,which govern medical staff privileges,do not create a contractual right to the continuation of those privileges mary hosp.of athens,radiology prof l,see also stein hosp,explaining hospitals have the power to create rules governing medical practice in their facilities to ensure competent care,so i t naturally follows that a hospital authority has the power to revoke the staff privileges of a physician whom it finds to be incompetent or who fails to comply with its reasonable rules and regulations quotation and emphasis omitted.interpreting the bylaws governing staff privileges as a contract would run counter to georgia policy of allowing the hospital to grant or withhold staff privileges from doctors it believes are unqualified to serve on its staff.robles humana hosp.cartersville,supp.
jimenez theory that his medical staff privileges constituted consideration for a broader contract is ultimately unpersuasive.were that theory accurate,many of the georgia cases holding that medical staff privileges do not create a contractual relationship would be rendered meaningless.in any case involving revocation of staff privileges,a plaintiff could argue that although the staff privileges themselves did not create a contract,the privileges were the consideration for the broader contractual relationship between the parties the plaintiff could thereby circumvent georgia clear rule that medical staff privileges can not create contractual liability.thus,under georgia law,alleging suspension of medical staff privileges does not implicate any contractual relationship,and,as such,can not be the basis of discrimination claim.
right to contract with patients and payors 
jimenez argues wellstar suspension of his medical staff privileges also interfered with his right to contract with patients and payors.the record indicates,however,jimenez had access to the patients he treated at wellstar only because they were admitted to the hospital while he was on call thus,his relationship with them was a benefit of the medical staff privileges to which he was no longer entitled.the same conclusion precludes any claim jimenez makes regarding interference with future contracts he might have formed with patients admitted after his suspension in addition,such contracts are t
