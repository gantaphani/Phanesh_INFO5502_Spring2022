appellant kenneth mauder mauder appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the metropolitan transit authority of harris county,texas metro.mauder states that the district court erred in its grant of summary judgment because he presented sufficient evidence that he suffers from a serious health condition,and,therefore should have been granted temporary leave under the family and medical leave act fmla to take necessary bathroom breaks and metro termination of his employment was done in retaliation to his exercise of his fmla rights.for the following reasons,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
appellant mauder was an employee of metro,the operator of the public transportation system for harris county,texas,from june through october as a senior support center analyst in metro information technology support center support center.the function of the support center is to answer telephone calls from internal metro customers relating to computer problems mauder job duties mainly included providing technical support via telephone,resolving internal customers technology problems,and assisting others in the it department in training support center analysts.in february,a new lead support center analyst supervisor watkins was hired and she determined that the support center needed improvement,as there were no accountability or customer service standards in place.she also determined that mauder was often away from his desk and unavailable to answer customer service calls.therefore,she sent an to him explaining that he needed to be more visible.she later instituted specific procedures,scheduled break times,and established attendance policies to make the support center more productive.
in march,mauder missed two weeks of work he was receiving medical treatment for boils caused by ingrown hairs.through tests administered during his treatment,mauder discovered he had type ii diabetes.mauder returned to work on april,but his return to work notice made no mention of any medical restrictions,though his doctor advised him to change his diet and stop smoking.in,mauder doctor prescribed metaformin,a generic version of the insulin drug glucophage,which has a of temporary uncontrollable bowel movements and diarrhea.metaformin was prescribed to treat mauder diabetes.mauder,however,explained that he did not experience the of metaformin until may or june,at which time mauder told his doctor because he thought his doctor would like to know.in his brief,mauder stated that coping with the medication required approximately minutes in the restroom at a time as a result,mauder was medically required to leave his work station for restroom breaks at unscheduled times.
after the aforementioned procedures,scheduled break periods,attendance policies,were implemented at the support center in may,supervisor watkins noticed that mauder was not adhering to these rules.according to mauder,his break time was from and and he could not always defer his trips to the bathroom until the scheduled break time.supervisor watkins,unaware of mauder medical condition,sent an email to him reminding him of the necessity of following such procedures as logging off his computer when he left his desk.thereafter,she sent another to mauder concerning his tardiness in returning from scheduled breaks and mentioning three specific occasions of tardiness.mauder responded to the first email by sending an email back to supervisor watkins stating sarcastically,n o problem.i log out even if i back up in my chair and he responded to supervisor watkins second email by giving her a handwritten doctor note which stated that a of his diabetes medication was diarrhea,but that his condition should improve.mauder concedes in his brief that he was frequently late,but explains that he told supervisor watkins that his medication made him experience severe diarrhea.
despite the inconvenient of the medication,mauder states that his doctor concluded that he should continue taking metaformin.mauder says that he explained his special circumstances to supervisor watkins and that he requested a flexible break schedule.according to mauder,metro refused the request and instructed him to take his breaks at the scheduled times.
on june,mauder sent supervisor watkins an email with the subject line we losing the tardy.he requested that the three instances of tardiness be removed from his record,based on the aforementioned doctor note.supervisor watkins met with mauder the next day and upon asking mauder to provide more information regarding his medical condition,mauder refused and instead stated in a email that he and his doctor had provided enough information and he would not provide any additional information.supervisor watkins denied mauder demand that the three incidents of tardiness be removed from his record and that he be allowed flexible break times.
after this incident,mauder was warned repeatedly regarding his tardiness,both verbally and in written reprimands.he also received his performance appraisal on june,which noted that on several occasions especially during peak times mauder has been away from the support center.his overall rating of the appraisal was satisfies most therefore,mauder rationalizes that his performance did not suffer even though he took longer breaks.the performance appraisal also noted mauder tardiness and unavailability.less than two weeks later,when his performance did not improve,supervisor watkins issued a documented verbal warning to him for repeated tardiness.in august,she issued a written reprimand to mauder because of his tardiness.mauder argues that because of the written reprimand in august,he had his doctor write supervisor watkins a final note explaining that his diarrhea may indeed be a permanent side effect of taking metaformin.contrary to this assertion,the record reveals that this doctor note did not take such a position.in fact,in it the doctor explains that u sually the side effects are transient,but not always.i will try to manage the side effects on his next office visit.supervisor watkins,according to mauder,again refused his request for flexible restroom breaks.
finally,on september,supervisor watkins issued a memo indicating that mauder,because of his unavailability during the work day,would be placed on a corrective action plan effective the next day.this memo also indicated what areas in mauder work performance needed improvement specifically,the memo noted that mauder needed to increase his work area visibility and improve his negative attitude.mauder asserts that he was placed on probation for issues concerning not ready mode and total available time and metro placed him on probation for this conduct with no previous warning and threatened him with termination,which is contrary to metro own progressive disciplinary policy.the record reflects,however,that supervisor watkins had issued several previous warnings to mauder.furthermore,upon instituting mauder probation,she explained to mauder that the corrective action period would end on october,and that if he did not adhere to the established guidelines during the probationary period,he would be terminated.
on september,supervisor watkins issued a memo concerning mauder progress during the corrective action period,noting that mauder had not improved in any of the areas identified in the corrective action plan.a similar record was logged on october,and october.on october,mauder made his only fmla leave request to metro human resources department hr in response,hr mailed a fmla packet to mauder and explained that mauder was to return the packet by october.just one week later,on october,however,mauder was terminated from his position at metro.mauder asserts that his termination was a direct result of his fmla claim with hr and that he believed,based on his conversation with hr,that his probation would likewise be extended until the packet due date of return passed.
on january,mauder filed this lawsuit against metro,asserting claims for violations of the american with disabilities act ada and the fmla.on june,metro filed a motion for summary judgment and,in his response to the motion,mauder expressly abandoned his ada claims.on march,the district court granted metro motion for summary judgment,stating that mauder repeatedly admitted that he did not meet the hour standards during the corrective action period,and he offers no argument or evidence why this legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for terminating him was a pretext for discrimination.from the grant of the motion,mauder appeals contending that the district court erroneously concluded that he failed to produce sufficient evidence of a serious health condition under the fmla and failed to produce sufficient evidence of retaliation by metro.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the standard of review for a district court grant of summary judgment is de novo.facility ins.employers ins.of wausau,cir citing gowesky singing river hosp,cir.summary judgment is only appropriate if the evidence shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
the fmla provides that an eligible employee shall be entitled to a total of workweeks of leave during any period for one or more of the following d because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.a d.a serious health condition,defined under the fmla at a,is an illness,injury,impairment or physical condition that involves inpatient care or continuing treatment by a health care provider.the regulation refers to diabetes as an example of a chronic serious health condition that may cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity therefore,we consider diabetes a serious health condition.a iii c.
mauder asserts that he suffers from a serious health condition involving continuing treatment by a healthcare provider.according to the fmla,this includes a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive days any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or prenatal care or any period of incapacity or treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition.a.furthermore,under a i,incapacity is an inability to work due to the serious health condition,treatment therefore,or recovery therefrom.a i.
we have previously explained that the fmla contains two distinct provisions.nero indus.molding,cir citing bocalbos life ins,cir hodgens dynamics,cir diaz fort wayne foundry,cir.the first provision of the fmla creates a series of entitlements or substantive rights.an employee right to return to the same position after a qualified absence falls under this category.nero,at citing bocalbos,at.an employer must honor entitlements,and can not defend by arguing that it treated all employees identically.nero,at citing diaz,at.because the issue is the right to an entitlement,the employee is due the benefit if the statutory requirements are satisfied,regardless of the intent of the employer.nero,at citing hodgens,at.
the second provision of the fmla is proscriptive,and protects employees from retaliation or discrimination for exercising their rights under the fmla.nero,at see also c an employer is prohibited from discriminating against employees who have used fmla leave.in order to establish a prima facie case for a fmla retaliatory violation,the employee must show the following elements he is protected under the fmla he sought to return to work before the fmla leave expired and the employer failed to reinstate him to the position,or an equivalent position.a.the first issue in mauder appeal deals with the entitlement provision the second issue in his appeal deals with the proscriptive provision.
mauder first claim the fmla entitlement provision 
in his first issue on appeal,mauder asserts that he should have been given temporary leave under the fmla to go to the restroom because of his persistent diarrhea.unlike other fmla claims we have considered,mauder is not asking for an excused absence he is asking for unfettered permission,while at work,to take necessary restroom breaks.we are unable to locate a case where temporary fmla leave was awarded in such a the leave given does not constitute time away from a place of work,but merely periodic time away from a desk throughout the work day.despite the novelty of mauder fmla claim,a careful review of the entire record allows us to resolve the key issues presented to us on appeal.
the parties disagree as to whether the underlying cause of mauder need for unrestricted bathroom breaks is diabetes or diarrhea.mauder contends that he requests leave because of his diabetes and that the diarrhea was nothing more than a of this disease.metro states that diarrhea is the underlying cause.nonetheless,even though the record reflects that mauder diabetes was under control,that mauder himself stated that metaformin successfully regulated his blood sugar level and that mauder need for frequent bathroom breaks was because of his diarrhea,the resolution of this debate is not essential to our disposition of the fmla claim at issue.based on the facts of this case,even assuming arguendo that mauder has satisfied the requirements for a serious medical condition for either diarrhea or diabetes under the fmla,the record reflects that he has not shown that this serious medical condition left him incapacitated,as required by the statute.
cases granting fmla leave to an employee with severe diarrhea involve situations where the medical condition is so debilitating that the employee can not physically go to work.electrolux home prod.united auto.aerospace agr.implement,cir on a june leave form,a physician described her illness as abd.pah,diarrhea.on each of these occasions she missed more than three consecutive days of work three days of work in,five days in april,and three days in june.banks cbocs west,wl,unpublished on march,banks was suffering from so much pain,diarrhea and weight loss that he could no longer work.myers disability benefits plan,wl unpublished those reports indicated that due to the frequency of plaintiff diarrhea,she was unable to work,that she needed to be near a restroom to accommodate her explosive diarrhea,and that she would need a low stress position if she were to return to work,as stress aggravated her illness.mcclain southwest steel,concluding that summary judgment was inappropriate where plaintiff attributed absenteeism to chronic nausea,diarrhea,vomiting,severe headaches,dizziness lightheadedness as symptoms might constitute a serious health problem.furthermore,as we have previously explained,the fmla recognizes diabetes as an example of a chronic serious health condition that may cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity.a iii c.in mauder case,however,he did not experience either episodic or continuing incapacity.
accordingly,we find that mauder has not shown that he was incapacitated or that his condition prevented him from going to work.a i explaining that the statute applies when one is unable to work due to a serious health condition,treatment therefore,or recovery therefrom.he does not meet the requirements of a the regulation defining a serious health condition involving continuing treatment by a healthcare provider for purposes of fmla leave.first,he was not absent from work for the more than three consecutive days the record reflects that mauder was never absent from work or unable to go to work because of either his diabetes or his diarrhea.second,he obviously was not incapacitated due to pregnancy or prenatal care.finally,he was not incapacitated and did not receive treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition.apparently,because he was not incapacitated or unable to attend work,he did not seek treatment for either his diarrhea or his diabetes beyond the initial diagnosis of his diabetes in april and subsequent routine.nothing in the record suggests to us that either condition was a serious health condition resulting in incapacity of either an episodic or permanent nature,as defined by the fmla or case law,preventing mauder from being physically present at the support center.therefore,because mauder has not proven that his medical condition left him incapacitated even temporarily,we ho
