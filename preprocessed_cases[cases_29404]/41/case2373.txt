this case calls for us to decide whether reynolds tobacco company reynolds,a north corporation that has operated in washington for more than half a century,may be sued in washington for its alleged participation in a worldwide conspiracy to deny the addictive and harmful effects of smoking.nilo tuazon was diagnosed with a chronic lung disorder in in his native philippines.the same year,tuazon established residence in washington state and brought suit against reynolds for its alleged conduct that led to his current illness.reynolds appeals the district court denial of its motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and on grounds of forum non conveniens.
background 
nilo tuazon,who was born and lived in the philippines,started smoking salem cigarettes at age seventeen and smoked continually for more than forty years.ten to fifteen years ago,tuazon began to experience a chronic cough that left him weak and dizzy,a condition he suspected was.drawing on his own background as a lawyer and businessman,tuazon began researching cases brought against tobacco companies in the united states.
tuazon was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder in.later that year,he immigrated to the united states on a petition supported by his daughter,a citizen,and settled with cousins in renton,washington.soon after his arrival,doctors confirmed his diagnosis.tuazon treatment continues under the supervision of doctors in the seattle area.
reynolds,originally incorporated in new jersey in,maintains its headquarters in north carolina.reynolds has been licensed to do business in washington since but has no manufacturing or production facilities in the state.since at least,reynolds has maintained an office and up to forty employees in the state.this presence has allowed reynolds to do substantial business in washington.from,reynolds enjoyed a privileged position in the washington market it sold between and million cigarettes to distributors in washington annually,generating million in net sales each year.also during this period,reynolds market share in washington was,while its national market share was.this dominant sales position resulted from a long history of targeting washington consumers with marketing and advertising campaigns.since at least,reynolds has advertised in purely local publications,including the seattle times,the spokane spokesman review,and the tacoma.
over time,reynolds efforts in washington expanded to include political activity,more extensive market analysis,and sponsored research at the university of washington.by the and,reynolds was conducting sophisticated market research,including focus groups and direct telephone surveys of smokers in several washington cities,and providing hundreds of thousands of dollars to the university of washington to support research into the effects of smoking.in the,reynolds organized local opposition to city and state legislation that would have banned or limited smoking and cigarette advertising.more recently,reynolds identified washington as a priority market and launched renewed efforts targeted at washington consumers,spending more than in local advertising and giving away more than packs of free promotional cigarettes each year.
in addition to its domestic operations,reynolds has been active overseas through a former affiliate,reynolds international.in the philippines,reynolds licensed fortune tobacco international,fortune tobacco to distribute reynolds brand cigarettes,including tuazon preferred brand,salem.
tuazon complaint alleges that reynolds participated in a global conspiracy to suppress information regarding the addictive and effects of cigarettes.the litigation of similar claims has a long and history in the united states over the past decade.see,strawser atkins,cir in the,nearly all the states sued major tobacco companies for harm arising from the deliberate concealment of the health risks posed by tobacco.tuazon alleges that the conspiracy involving major tobacco companies originated in the united states and,by the,had moved abroad.working through affiliates and subsidiaries,such as the asian tobacco council,the philippines tobacco institute,and fortune tobacco,tuazon claims that reynolds was able to suppress information regarding tobacco addictive and corrosive health effects.as a result,tuazon continued smoking for decades despite growing health problems and warnings from friends and family.
reynolds moved to dismiss tuazon complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and on grounds of forum non conveniens.the district court denied the motion and reynolds now appeals.the district court certified the question for immediate appeal and we granted reynolds permission to appeal the district court order.

the parties agree that tuazon claim arises from reynolds conduct outside of washington.consequently,we must decide whether reynolds contacts with washington suffice to support the exercise of general jurisdiction.to this end,we follow a process,asking first,whether washington jurisdictional statute confers jurisdiction over reynolds,and second,whether the exercise of jurisdiction comports with federal due process requirements.amoco egypt oil leonis navigation,cir.
washington jurisdiction statute 
washington courts apply the service of process statute,rather than the statute,to determine whether general jurisdiction applies.the statute confers general jurisdiction over a corporation that is doing business in the state.crose volkswagenwerk ag.a company is doing business in washington when it participates continuously and substantially in the state markets.id.at.the washington supreme court has no rigid or formulaic test for determining when a company is doing business in washington,and instead conducts a,analysis.id.at 
in crose and more recent cases,washington courts have set guideposts to aid our inquiry.crose involved a products liability lawsuit filed by a washington resident against volkswagen,a german corporation,arising from an injury in california.volkswagen did not sell its products directly to washington consumers,but only to an oregon distributor.despite this attenuated relationship,the washington supreme court held that there was general jurisdiction under because volkswagen generated substantial revenue from a,worldwide chain of distribution.id.
more recent cases have relied on other factors in finding substantial and continuous contacts.in hartley american contract bridge league,the defendant contacts were deemed continuous and substantial where it sold and transported goods to support bridge tournaments it organized in washington and collected fees and dues from washington residents.id.at.the defendant contacts also met the standard in hein taco bell,the defendant had been registered to do business in washington for more than twenty years,owned a chain of restaurants,and depended on local markets and government infrastructure to support its business.id.at.
in contrast,where activity is singular,passive,or collateral to a business principal efforts,washington courts have refused jurisdiction.for example,one court held that a company limited efforts to solicit visits to opryland tennessee,commission payments to travel brokers,and occasional broadcasts of music were not continuous and substantial contacts sufficient to subject the defendant to general jurisdiction in washington.banton opryland,overruled on other grounds by shute carnival cruise lines.in osborne city of spokane,the court found that deriving revenue from sales in washington that accounted for less than of the company regional revenue was insufficient to justify the exercise of general jurisdiction over a canadian insurance brokerage firm because that revenue was not accompanied by indicia of other systematic and continuous contacts,rev on other grounds,scott fetzer weeks.
close cases exist,but this is not one of them.taken together,reynolds activities are very close to those of the defendants in hartley and hein.unlike the defendants in banton and osborne,reynolds does not attract customers or generate revenue on the basis of limited or passive contacts.as in hartley and hein,reynolds does business in washington with a presence that generates substantial revenue and reaches many consumers.
we are not convinced by reynolds argument that its contacts in washington were continuous but not substantial.reynolds has been licensed to do business in washington for decades,maintains an office and a staff of permanent employees,advertises in purely local media,targets washington consumers,and derives million in annual revenues from sales in washington.in short,we hold that reynolds activities in washington constitute doing business within the meaning of the washington service of process statute.
due process analysis 
our inquiry does not end with the washington statute.the due process clause allows in personam jurisdiction to be exercised over a corporate defendant only if it has certain minimum contacts with the forum state such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.helicopteros,at.citing international shoe,at.in applying this standard,we employ yet another familiar test whether reynolds has sufficient contacts with washington and whether the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable in this case.asahi metal indus,superior of,d.
minimum contacts 
in the context of general jurisdiction,minimum contacts exist where a defendant has substantial or continuous and systematic contacts with the forum state,even if the case is unrelated to those contacts.helicopteros,at.the reach of general jurisdiction is defined,in the first instance,by the supreme court decisions in perkins benguet consol.mining et,and in helicopteros.
in perkins,the court sketched for the first time a vision of personal jurisdiction that did not arise from the occurrence of the cause of action in the forum state.id.at.the instant case takes us one step further to a proceeding in personam to enforce a cause of action not arising out of the corporation activities in the state of the forum quoting international shoe,at.t here have been instances in which the continuous corporate operations within a state were thought so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.during world war ii,the president of a philippine mining company established an office in ohio during the japanese occupation of the philippines.at his in ohio,the president 
kept company files and held directors meetings in the office,carried on correspondence relating to the business,distributed salary checks drawn on two active ohio bank accounts,engaged an ohio bank to act as transfer agent,and supervised policies dealing with the rehabilitation of the corporation properties in the philippines.
helicopteros,at.citing perkins,at.applying the principles of international shoe,the supreme court upheld the exercise of jurisdiction by an ohio court in a cause of action unrelated to the mining company activities there.
at the other end of the spectrum,the court deemed the defendant contacts insufficient to justify the exercise of general jurisdiction in helicopteros,at.defendant helicopteros faced a wrongful death suit in state court in texas arising from a helicopter crash in peru.helicopteros contacts with texas consisted of one meeting in houston by its president to discuss a contract,significant purchases of helicopters,spare parts and accessories,training sessions for pilots and managers,and limited banking activities over a period.id.at.at the time of the lawsuit,the company had never 
been authorized to do business in texas had an agent for the service of process performed helicopter operations in texas or sold any product that reached texas,solicited business in texas,signed any contract in texas,had any employee based there,recruited an employee in texas owned real or personal property in texas maintained an office or establishment there maintained records in texas and had no shareholders in that state.
id.at.on these facts,the court rejected the texas supreme court conclusion that helicopteros had sufficient contacts with texas,holding that purchases and related trips,standing alone,are not a sufficient basis for a state assertion of jurisdiction.id.at.
navigating the territory between perkins and helicopteros requires us to balance the facts of each case.kulko superior of,d t he minimum contacts test of international shoe is not susceptible to mechanical application rather,the facts of each case must be weighed to determine whether the requisite affiliating circumstances are present.in evaluating general jurisdiction,we have not developed a precise checklist or articulated a definitive litany of factors.we consider,among other factors,whether the defendant makes sales,solicits or engages in business in the state,serves the state markets,designates an agent for service of process,holds a license,or is incorporated there.bancroft masters,at.it is the nature and extent of the contacts that determines whether they are substantial or continuous and systematic.longevity,continuity,volume,economic impact,physical presence,and integration into the state regulatory or economic markets are among the indicia of such a presence.
although courts have been understandably reluctant to exercise general jurisdiction,amoco egypt,at noting that t he supreme court has upheld general jurisdiction only once,the requisite showing has been sustained in a number of cases.for example,the federal circuit held that the due process clause was satisfied for purposes of general jurisdiction where a defendant employed multiple distributors in the state and generated millions of dollars in annual revenues from sales.lsi indus.hubbell lighting.in lakin prudential securities,cir,the defendant was a savings bank with its principal place of business in georgia,but haled to court in missouri to face claims arising from a dollar,fraud.the eighth circuit held that prudential contacts with missouri were continuous and substantial based on the fact that its million loan portfolio in the state implied lending relationships with hundreds,if not thousands of missouri residents.id.at.noting also that the market was central to prudential business,the court remanded for additional jurisdictional discovery.id.at see also provident bank lehman mgmt,cir holding general jurisdiction proper where the defendant had no property in pennsylvania and conducted no advertising and only a small percentage of its business in the state,but the nature of defendant contacts with pennsylvania was central to the conduct of its business.
yet another example of general jurisdiction is found in metropolitan life ins,cir.over a period,the defendant contacts with vermont,the forum state,included sales of million,ongoing relationships with five authorized dealers for its products in the state,product support for its dealers,national advertising that reached vermont,direct marketing to at least three vermont firms,and more than one hundred visits by employees to vermont.id.at.the defendant owned no property in vermont and did not control its authorized dealers there.id.at.
the second circuit acknowledged that any one of these facts alone might have been an insufficient contact,but held that when taken together,the contacts are sufficient to establish general jurisdiction.id.at emphasis in original.the court nevertheless dismissed the case because jurisdiction would have been unreasonable where neither the plaintiff nor the defendant resided in vermont,the state of vermont had no discernable interest in the case,and the plaintiff only interest in vermont as a forum seemed to be a generous statute of limitations.id.at.tuazon case is strikingly different in terms of the reasonableness analysis,as noted below.
as this review of cases illustrates,determining whether a corporate defendant contacts in a particular case are substantial and continuous turns on the economic reality of the defendants activities rather than a mechanical checklist.gates learjet jensen,cir.generally,an isolated contact with the forum state,among those identified in bancroft masters,will not support general jurisdiction.see,glencore grain rotterdam shivnath rai harnarain,cir holding that there was no general jurisdiction where a defendant only contacts with california amounted to sixteen shipments of rice sold through an independently employed sales agent congoleum dlw aktiengesellschaft,cir noting that no court has ever held that the maintenance of even a substantial sales force within the state is a sufficient contact to assert jurisdiction in an unrelated cause of action bancroft masters,at concluding that occasional,unsolicited sales of tournament tickets and merchandise to california residents and maintenance of a small number of license agreements with california vendors was insufficient to support general jurisdiction.
reynolds contacts in washington are perhaps less than the wartime home away from home involved in perkins,yet far more substantial than the defendant limited contacts with texas in helicopteros.in analyzing the breadth and depth of reynolds contacts with washington,we begin by noting that reynolds sales in washington are not limited or occasional.reynolds has had a serious presence in washington for more than a and generates enormous revenues from of millions of dollars in annual net sales in recent years.lsi,at general jurisdiction exists where,among other factors,the defendant generated several millions of dollars in annual sales in the forum state metropolitan life ins,at general jurisdiction appropriate where defendant sold nearly million in products in the forum state over a period.
reynolds long and successful operations are not accidental.the company did not hide in its north carolina home,passively trickling a small supply of cigarettes to washington.see,sandstrom chemlawn,cir no substantial and continuous contacts where defendant presence in forum state was limited to being licensed to do business and purchasing limited advertisements consolidated dev t sherritt,cir no substantial and continuous contacts where defendant presence in the united states was limited to capital market transactions,appointing an agent for service of process,and sales of products through a subsidiary.the magnitude of reynolds operations and sales in washington reflects an undeniable presence in the state it has held a license to do business there since,has advertised in purely local publications since at least the,has engaged in local political activity to protect its market,and maintains a permanent office and workforce in the state.schreiber,cir reversing the district court dismissal for lack of general personal jurisdiction where the defendant had been licensed to do business in the forum state for almost forty years,had conducted sales and sales promotions,and had recently established a factory there.
selling cigarettes is reynolds core business,in washington and elsewhere.lakin,at provident bank,at.indeed,with the exception of incorporation,each factor identified in bancroft masters is present in abundance.see at.it is also significant that the essence of tuazon worldwide coverup regarding tobacco be characterized as dealings entirely distinct from reynolds business in washington.international shoe,at.the tobacco litigation,in which washington state was a major player,centered around some of these same allegations.even after the global settlement,reynolds participated in a court challenge in washington involving state regulation of smoking.see aviation west dep t of labor and.
reynolds urges that it is conducting business with washington in some way that is meaningfully distinct from doing business in the state.reynolds describes the former as merely interacting with a limited number of customers or suppliers in a state.see bancroft masters,at holding that a company that continues to have license agreements with two television networks and a handful of california vendors was doing business with california,but not doing business in california.although limited sales and licensing arrangements alone may be insufficient to establish general jurisdiction,reynolds decades long presence and its integration into washington markets can hardly be characterized as mere interaction with the state.
finally,we are not persuaded by reynolds argument that affirming the district court would obliterate the distinction between general and specific jurisdiction.although general jurisdiction is infrequently exercised,to conclude that it exists here does not mean that every case of failed specific jurisdiction will lead to the grant of general jurisdiction.the determination simply depends upon the nature and extent of the contacts.it is abundantly clear that a corporation does not necessarily submit to general jurisdiction in every state in which it merely sells a product.but,jurisdiction here is not predicated on sales,or even the notion of substantial sales,alone.the minimum contacts are established by the confluence of reynolds physical,economic,and political presence and the company myriad other activities in the state.
in short,we hold that reynolds continuous and substantial contacts are sufficient to support the exercise of general jurisdiction.
reasonableness 
in the second step of our inquiry,we determine whether the exercise of general jurisdiction in this case is reasonable here,the burden is the defendant to present a compelling case that the exercise of jurisdiction would,in fact,be unreasonable.amoco egypt,at accord burger king,at.in accord with the supreme court guidance in asahi,we consider five factors the burden on the defendant,the forum state interest in the dispute,the importance of the chosen forum to the plaintiff interest in obtaining relief,the most efficient forum for judicial resolution of the dispute,and the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.at.balancing these factors,we conclude that reynolds has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating a compelling case of unreasonable jurisdiction.the exercise of jurisdiction here is reasonable and satisfies the requirements of the due process clause.
we look first to the burden on the defendant of litigating in the chosen forum.reynolds does not identify any specific hardship or otherwise comment on this factor,thus abdicating its burden on this point.evaluation of this burden often contemplates a foreign,as in,defendant haled to court in the united states.in such cases,t he unique burdens placed upon one who must defend oneself in a foreign legal system should have significant weight in assessing the reasonableness of stretching the long arm of personal jurisdiction over national borders.asahi,at.surely the burden on reynolds of litigating in the philippines would be,by degrees of magnitude,greater than litigating in washington state.reynolds does not suggest that the burden is one to be weighed between washington and north carolina.with its long history and substantial business in the state,litigating in washington would not be an onerous burden for reynolds.bancroft masters,at determining jurisdiction to be reasonable when a georgia corporation demonstrated no hardship in litigating in california harris rutsky.ins.svcs.bell clements,cir observing that litigating in california posed only a limited burden to a company,where its employees traveled there regularly for business.
the second factor,a state interest in providing a forum for its residents,weighs in favor of reasonableness.tuazon lawfully immigrated to washington and has taken up residence there washington rightfully takes an interest in his and in this dispute.see dole food,at.reynolds argues that washington interest is limited because tuazon arrived with a fully mature claim resulting from conduct and harm entirely outside of washington.reynolds also impugns tuazon motives for moving to washington,despite the long immigration process and the presence of his family in washington.this argument begs the now lives in washington as a legal resident.reynolds theory not only ignores the fact of our mobile society but would create a novel jurisdictional hurdle by requiring the suit to be brought where the disease matures.
the third factor favors a forum that can provide convenient and effective relief for the plaintiff.it is easy for tuazon to litigate his claim where he.the potential inconvenience of litigating in the philippines the only alternative that has been suggested is mitigated by tuazon long history and deep connections with his country of origin.although a plaintiff choice of home forum is entitled to deference in a forum non conveniens analysis,piper aircraft reyno,d,we are less deferential when determining reasonableness under personal jurisdiction.nobel indus.ab,cir a mere preference on the part of the plaintiff for its home forum does not affect the balancing but see asahi,at.when minimum contacts have been established,often the interests of the plaintiff and the forum in the exercise of jurisdiction will justify even the serious burdens placed on the alien defendant.on the other hand,it is significant that reynolds has not seriously argued that litigating in washington is more of a burden than being in the philippines.thus,this factor is hardly a basis to support a finding of unreasonableness.
the fourth factor requires us to consider the most efficient judicial resolution for this case.the site where the injury occurred and where evidence is located usually will be the most efficient forum.pacific atl.trading main express,cir.no clear winner emerges in this category,although we credit the district court findings that,on balance,washington state provides an efficient and viable forum to resolve tuazon claims.even though tuazon injury occurred in the philippines,his claim will require the presentation of evidence and testimony from regions,including reynolds headquarters in north carolina and other sites where the alleged conspiracy was nurtured such as new york,as well as manila and perhaps other locales in the philippines,and in washington itself,where tuazon has been treated by local doctors since his arrival in.resolving tuazon claims may require a court to apply the law of the philippines to some or all of the substantive dispute.admittedly,these factors may present some difficulties for a court in washington,but it is not significantly easier for any other court to hear this case.for instance,it would not be a simple matter for a civil tribunal in the philippines to exercise compulsory process upon reynolds executives in north carolina.it is neither impractical nor unreasonable for washington to exercise jurisdiction.
the fifth factor calls for us to consider the shared interest of the several states in advancing social policy.while the analysis presupposes that two or more states may be interested in the outcome of a dispute,the conflict of one forum interests with the fundamental substantive social policies of another state may usually be handled through analysis rather than rejecting jurisdiction.burger king,at.what is missing here is evidence of any real or purported conflict.
reynolds struggles to cast this controversy as one implicating high diplomacy and the sovereignty of a foreign nation,arguing that the district court erred in failing to consider the interest of the republic of the philippines.true,this factor often involves conflicts with the sovereignty of foreign nations,but usually when the foreign country is home to the defendant.see,amoco egypt,at where,as here,the defendant is from a foreign nation rather than another state,the sovereignty barrier is high and undermines the reasonableness of personal jurisdiction.reynolds attempts to sidestep this distinction by arguing that it would be unfair to the philippines to prevent tuazon case from being adjudicated there.yet,it is tuazon,a philippine citizen,who decided to bring suit in the united states seeking personal damages from an alleged worldwide conspiracy.contrary to reynolds assertions,it is difficult to see how an american court tramps on the sovereignty of the philippines by exercising jurisdiction over an american company on a claim by an american resident.
from the standpoint of social policy,washington has an interest in a suit involving an alleged coverup by a tobacco company.not only is tuazon a washington resident,washington was a key participant in the global tobacco settlement,which involved related health policy issues.this is not to say that the philippines has no social policy interest in the issues raised by the suit.nonetheless,a weighing of factors does not tip this factor in favor of the philippines.
taking the factors together,we have no difficulty concluding that the exercise of jurisdiction in washington is reasonable.
ii.forum non conveniens 
reynolds also sought relief on the basis of forum non conveniens.a district court has discretion to decline to exercise jurisdiction in a case where litigation in a foreign forum would be more convenient for the parties.lueck sundstrand,cir.in exercising this discretion,a court will consider whether an adequate alternate forum exists and whether the balance of public and private interests favors a different forum.id.
reynolds faces a doubly difficult task in appealing the district court rejection of the forum non conveniens challenge.as an initial hurdle,the plaintiff choice of forum is entitled to deference piper aircraft,at.and where the court has considered all relevant public and private interest factors,and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable,its decision deserves substantial deference.lueck,at.we will reverse the district court determination only where there has been a clear abuse of discretion.id.
adequate alternative forum 
reynolds bears the burden of demonstrating that an alternative forum exists and that it is adequate.jones gnc franchising,cir.generally,an alternative forum is available where the defendant is amenable to service of process and the forum provides some remedy for the wrong at issue.lueck,at quoting piper aircraft,at.this test is easy to pass typically,a forum will be inadequate only where the remedy provided is so clearly inadequate or unsatisfactory,that it is no remedy at all.lockman found.evangelical alliance mission,cir quoting piper aircraft,at.
the district court determined that reynolds failed to show that the philippines was an adequate alternative forum on two to submit to service of process and failure to counter evidence of corruption in the philippine court system.before the district court,reynolds sought primarily dismissal without conditions,but also argued in the alternative that if conditions were imposed,the court should not require waiver of all defenses available at the time plaintiff originally filed this action.although there may have been some ambiguity,purposeful or otherwise,in reynolds position,the acceptance of jurisdiction need not be absolute.a careful reading of the record confirms reynolds consent to service of process in the philippines.a moving party does not forfeit its consent to service by seeking accommodations as part of the dismissal.with ample discretion to tailor any conditions of dismissal,the district court in this case could have done so.see contact lumber moges shipping,cir holding the philippines was an available forum where the district court granted a motion to dismiss on the express condition that defendant consent to the jurisdiction of the philippine courts.accordingly,we conclude that reynolds established its voluntary submission to service of process.
the district court also found that reynolds failed to bear its burden in establishing the philippines as an adequate forum.this showing requires the defendant to establish that the foreign forum laws provide potential redress for the injury alleged the fact that the substantive law may be less favorable is relevant only if it would completely deprive plaintiffs of any remedy or would result in unfair treatment.piper aircraft,at.creative,aztech.pte,cir.
to meet its burden,reynolds offered an extensive affidavit by a former justice of the philippine court of appeals,detailing background about the philippines and its court system,the availability of contract and tort relief,the discovery process,and procedural formalities.under our precedent,this showing is sufficient.lueck,at the district court,in deciding a forum non conveniens motion,is required to ask whether the alternative forum offers a remedy for their losses.
in response,tuazon argued that the philippine courts are too corrupt and plagued with delays to provide an adequate forum.tuazon assertions about the court system rest primarily on his own experience as a lawyer and businessman in the philippines.he concedes that he prefers a court because damages in the philippines are niggardly,a ground that we have rejected in the forum non conveniens analysis.lueck,at rejecting argument that lower damages would render a forum inadequate.
in his deposition,tuazon referred to lengthy delays of up to thirty years in civil proceedings that would make any remedy essentially meaningless.bhatnagar surrendra overseas,cir wherever the line might be drawn separating tolerable delay from is,delay that does not vitiate a remedy and that which of up to a quarter of a century fall on the intolerable side of that line.notably,however,he failed to mention a single episode that he directly observed or of which he has personal knowledge.his corruption claims face the same evidentiary void.indeed,it is difficult to square tuazon testimony about his satisfaction with the court system in several actions that he litigated in the philippines,some all the way to the supreme court,with the general allegations in his brief about corruption.tuazon anecdotal evidence of corruption and delay provides insufficient basis for the district court dramatic holding that the courts of the philippines are an inadequate forum in this civil case.
with no personal testimony on corruption,tuazon instead offers state department country reports that reference corruption,judicial bias and inefficiency,and the potentially improper influence that corporate defendants wield over the judicial process.without diminishing the gravity of such concerns,we note that the reports are focused on human rights in the philippines,and the criminal justice system in particular.as with tuazon testimony on delay,such a general indictment provides insufficient substance to condemn the adequacy of philippine courts in the face of the expert evidence offered by reynolds.
a litigant asserting inadequacy or delay must make a powerful showing.eastman kodak kavlin,noting that the argument that t he alternative forum is too corrupt to be adequate does not enjoy a particularly impressive track record.collecting cases.a close reading of this case,relied on by both tuazon and reynolds,is instructive.the court held that corruption and delay in the bolivian courts made a fair trial impossible.the proof offered was both specific and sordid,unlike the evidence here.the plaintiff offered statements by the minister of justice that bolivian courts were instruments of extortion,detailed affidavits by two experts in bolivian legal and political affairs,and an affidavit by a former legal counsel to the bolivian legislature observing that corruption is endemic to the judicial system of bolivia.id.at.we are aware of only one other federal case to hold that an alternative forum was inadequate because of corruption.see bhatnagar,at,affirming the district court determination that india was an inadequate forum and noting reliance on two expert affidavits stating that the indian legal system was in virtual collapse and suffered delays of years on average.
indeed,in a particular case,the evidence may well support the conclusion that a legal system is so fraught with corruption,delay and bias as to provide no remedy at all but the paltry evidence offered by tuazon does not defeat reynold showing of adequacy in summary,this record does not support the district court finding of inadequacy and we hold that reynolds satisfied its burden to demonstrate the existence of an adequate alternative forum in the philippines.
b.the balance of public and private interest factors 
even when an adequate alternative forum exists,we will not disturb the plaintiff original choice of forum unless the private interest and the public interest factors strongly favor dismissal.lueck,at citing gulf oil gilbert.as we explained recently,a plaintiff need not select the optimal forum for his claim,but only a forum that is not so oppressive and vexatious to the defendant as to be out of proportion to plaintiff convenience.ravelo monegro rosa,cir reversing forum non conveniens dismissal,without discussing adequacy or availability of alternate forum,because the private interest factors weighed heavily against dismissal with this principle in mind,we turn to examine the weight of the private and public interest factors implicated by tuazon lawsuit.
having already navigated several tests and various tests in the jurisdictional analysis,we now tackle a test to evaluate private interest factor considerations the residence of the parties and witnesses,the forum convenience to the litigants,access to physical evidence and other sources of proof,whether unwilling witnesses can be compelled to testify,the cost of bringing witnesses to trial,the enforceability of the judgment,any practical problems or other factors that contribute to an efficient resolution.lueck,at citing gulf oil,at.in applying these factors,t he district court should look to any or all of the above factors which are relevant to the case before it,giving appropriate weight to each.id.this guidance grants the district court the broadest possible discretion.
the district court found that dismissal was not warranted because it is not more convenient to try the case in the philippines based on the private interest factors.neither party is a resident of the philippines both reside in the united states.most importantly,tuazon is a resident of washington,a more convenient forum for both sides than the philippines.it is neither unimaginable nor unreasonable that reynolds,having operated in the state for a,should defend a lawsuit there.
the third and fourth private interest factors,concerning the location and availability of evidence and witnesses,present closer questions.reynolds makes much of the lack of compulsory process to secure key witnesses and documents in the philippines.in response,tuazon argues that the bulk of evidence regarding the alleged conspiracy is l
