beginning in,liutauras dargis was employed as a correctional officer with the cook county sheriff office.in february,dargis suffered a stroke while on duty.when dargis attempted to return to work in july,the sheriff office declined to reinstate him due to physical restrictions imposed by dargis physician,placing him instead on leave without pay.after exhausting his administrative remedies,dargis filed suit in federal court against the cook county sheriff office,cook county sheriff michael sheahan,assistant executive director marcus lyles,executive director ernesto velasco,and cook county dargis alleged,in pertinent part,that the sheriff office violated his due process rights by not providing him with a hearing prior to placing him on leave,and violated the americans with disabilities act ada by failing to reinstate him following his stroke.the sheriff office moved for summary judgment on all claims.the district court denied the motion on the issue of due process,entering judgment instead for dargis on those claims,and directing the sheriff office to hold a hearing on dargis employment status within thirty days.the motion was granted as to dargis ada claims,and dargis remaining claims,all based in state law,were dismissed due to the district court decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over them.dargis now appeals,arguing that the district court erred by not proceeding to trial on the damages he sustained as a result of the due process violation,and by entering summary judgment against him on his ada claims.additionally,dargis argues that the district court erred by not exercising supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claims and by denying a motion to alter or amend the judgment.we affirm the district court.
dargis earned a bachelor of arts in criminal justice from the university of illinois in,and became a correctional officer with the sheriff office on may.by all accounts,dargis gave exemplary service and at the time of the events giving rise to this suit,he had risen to rank of sergeant having supervisory authority over other officers.on february,dargis suffered a stroke while on duty.this stroke resulted in dargis hospitalization,and he was placed on disability leave by the sheriff office.dargis remained on disability leave for over a year.
on june,dargis physician,margaret wade,provided him with a letter setting forth numerous medical conditions from which he suffered.in addition to listing his status as vascular accident stroke,wade indicated that dargis suffered from type diabetes,coronary artery disease,chronic myofacial pain syndrome,bilateral retinopathy,vitreous hemorrhages,peripheral vascular disease,and a neuropathic bladder.wade stated her belief that dargis could return to work as of july,subject to the following limitations no physical contact no physical activity other than sitting in a chair with brief episodes of standing and walking,no lifting,kneeling,stooping,or running,and a work environment with adequate heat and air conditioning.before the date of his return,dargis claims to have been told by an assistant executive director of the sheriff office,john maul,that he would be placed in a position requiring no contact with inmates upon his return upon returning to work on july,dargis met with his supervisor,assistant executive director marcus lyles,and presented him with the letter from wade.dargis also clarified for lyles that not having any inmate contact was necessary because a blow to his head might result in blindness or other serious medical problems.believing that dargis could no longer perform the essential functions of a correctional officer,lyles made the decision not to return him to work.
the parties dispute whether positions exist within the sheriff office that do not require inmate contact.in an affidavit submitted in support of the sheriff office summary judgment motion,lyles stated that correctional officers are primarily responsible for maintaining vigil,standing guard,counting inmates,breaking up fights among inmates,inspecting for contraband,escorting inmates outside their cells,searching inmates and visitors,and searching for escaped inmates.lyles conceded that there are some positions requiring less inmate contact than others,but asserted that all officers,regardless of the position to which they were assigned,must be able to respond to emergencies such as riots or escapes,and must be able to rotate through various positions as needed.this requirement,often occurring due to unforeseeable events,meant that the sheriff office was unable to guarantee that any assignment would shield an officer from all inmate contact.
lyles description of the range of duties for which a correctional officer is responsible is confirmed by the correctional officer job description provided by cook county position classification agency and submitted at the summary judgment stage by dargis.the job description sets forth a correctional officer duties as follows 
observes and supervises the behavior of inmates confined to cook county correctional institutions.enforces rules and regulations established for the maintenance of order,discipline and safety.makes rounds of assigned area to insure that all security procedures are adhered to and all inmates under surveillance are accounted for.communicates with inmates to ascertain attitudes,problems and rehabilitation.performs a variety of other related duties to assist with jail operations.
the job description also lists certain desirable qualifications a correctional officer should exhibit,including c onsiderable good judgment and initiative to assure prompt and thorough action during routine and emergency situations,and the a bility to supervise and control inmate crews.the job description as filed had attached seventeen descriptions of specific positions and duties.
in his affidavit submitted in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,dargis stated that he had performed all seventeen positions attached to the county job description,and conceded that the majority of them involve contact with inmates.dargis asserted,however,that there were a number of assignments not requiring any inmate contact,including the prison tower,the master control security center,various points of entrance to and egress from the prison,the records department,the training academy,the computer room,and the firing range.dargis claims that he repeatedly requested of lyles to be placed in one of these positions,believing that such placement would accommodate the limitations imposed by wade but that his requests were ignored.additionally,dargis requested a hearing on lyles decision,but this request was denied.dargis was instead placed on what the parties refer to as zero pay status.specifically,he was not terminated,which would have necessitated the filing of a charge with the cook county sheriff merit board and a subsequent hearing.see ilcs.instead,dargis remained officially in the employ of the sheriff office,however,he received no pay and had no recourse to a hearing.
on november,dargis filed charges of discrimination with both the illinois department of human rights and the united states equal employment opportunity commission,and he received a right to sue letter on june.dargis initiated this action in the district court on september.on april,he filed an amended complaint stating claims for violation of the ada,violation of the civil rights act of and the due process clause of the constitution pursuant to,constitutional violations resulting from an alleged constructive discharge pursuant to,conspiracy to violate the ada and dargis civil rights pursuant to and,and eight state law claims arising from the illinois constitution,statutes,and common law.the sheriff office moved for summary judgment on all of dargis claims on march.on march,the district court entered an order concluding that the sheriff office had violated dargis due process rights as protected by federal and state law.specifically,the district court found that the sheriff office placement of dargis on zero pay status and refusal to return him to active duty constitutes a deprivation of a protected property interest,despite the fact that dargis technically remains an employee of the department of corrections.the district court concluded that dargis was entitled to a hearing before imposition of this deprivation,and the sheriff office was directed to conduct a hearing within thirty days of the judgment pursuant to ilcs.summary judgment was entered in favor of the sheriff office on dargis remaining federal claims,and the remaining state claims were dismissed without prejudice when the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over them.dargis filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,asserting that the district court had overlooked evidence relevant to his ada claims.dargis also claimed that the district court was required to proceed to trial to determine the damages he suffered as a result of the due process violation.this motion was denied on april.
dargis raises four issues in his appeal.first,dargis argues that there existed genuine issues of material fact which should have prevented the district court from entering summary judgment against him on his ada claims.second,although judgment was entered in his favor on his due process claims,dargis argues that the district court erred by directing the sheriff office to hold a hearing instead of proceeding to trial on his claim for damages,attorney fees and other appropriate relief.third,dargis asserts that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his state law claims.finally,dargis claims that the district court erred when it denied his motion to alter or amend the judgment against him.the sheriff office maintains that no error was committed by the district court.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,and draw all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.breneisen motorola,cir.though given the benefit of this standard,t o survive summary judgment,the nonmoving party must make a sufficient showing of evidence for each essential element of its case on which it bears the burden at trial.kampmier emeritus,cir citing celotex catrett,d.dargis claims that by failing to accommodate him after his stroke,the sheriff office violated the ada mandate that it not discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability.a.to make out a prima facie case of disability discrimination,dargis must establish that he suffers from a disability as defined in the ada,he is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job in question,with or without reasonable accommodation,and he has suffered an adverse employment action as a result of his disability.jackson city of chicago,cir.the sheriff office asserts that dargis can not establish the second element of this test,namely,that he is qualified to perform the essential functions of a correctional officer,whether reasonably accommodated or not.
there are two requirements dargis must meet to show that,though disabled,he is qualified to perform the essential functions of a correctional officer.he must satisfy the requisite skill,experience,education and other requirements of the employment position he holds or desires,and establish that he can perform the essential functions of such position with or without accommodation.ross.state teacher ass ins.trust,cir quoting m.there is no dispute that dargis satisfies the first receiving a degree in criminal justice in,he served admirably as a correctional officer for almost twenty years before his stroke.the sheriff office argues,however,that dargis can no longer perform the essential functions of a correctional officer.indeed,dargis admitted during his deposition that he can not stand watch over the inmates,break up fights,inspect cells,escort inmates when they are out of their cells,or search for escaped inmates.notwithstanding these inabilities,dargis asserts that he can still perform the essential functions of a correctional officer if he is assigned to a position requiring no inmate contact,including the prison entrances and exits,tower,control center,records department,computer room,or firing range.
in miller illinois department of corrections,cir,we considered whether a correctional officer with the illinois department of corrections remained able to perform the essential functions of a correctional officer after she went blind.like dargis,the appellant in miller conceded that she was unable to perform the majority of functions normally associated with being a correctional officer,but argued that she could continue in the position if given the assignment of either switchboard operator or armory officer we held,however,that if an employer has a legitimate reason for specifying multiple duties for a particular job classification,duties the occupant of the position is expected to rotate through,a disabled employee will not be qualified for the position unless he can perform enough of these duties to enable a judgment that he can perform its essential duties.id.at emphasis in original.the reason for this is clear to be able to respond to unexpected surges in the demand for particular abilities.id.
the prison has to be able to call upon its full staff of correctional officers for help in putting down a prison riot,and therefore each officer must have experience in the positions,such as searching and escorting inmates,that provide the necessary training and experience for responding effectively to a riot,as well as the capability for such response.
id.obviously a prison riot is an extreme threat.but there are many other duties that include disciplining prisoners,inspections,intervening in disputes,and dealing with routine but sometimes tense situations that can not be subtracted from the performance expectations of a correctional officer.this necessary ability to respond to emergencies was the exact reason provided by lyles for why cook county correctional officers must be able to rotate through all positions.like the illinois department of corrections in miller,it is the position of the sheriff office that the ability to rotate through all positions,including the majority of them that involve inmate contact,is a prerequisite for someone being qualified to perform the essential functions of a correctional officer.additionally,dargis did not request placement in another position in the sheriff office,but rather sought accommodation in order to retain his position as a correctional officer.because the sheriff office need not manufacture a job that will enable the disabled worker to work despite his disability,hansen henderson,cir,dargis inability to rotate through the various positions of a correctional officer means that he can not perform the essential functions of that job.carving out a job that included very few of the duties all other correctional officers were expected to perform would have the effect of creating a new position for an employee who would not be otherwise qualified.
dargis argues that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence of a requirement that correctional officers be able to rotate through all positions because he is aware of officers who were placed in positions in order to avoid inmate contact.during his deposition,dargis stated that he supervised an officer named barbara siejka,and was directed by his supervisors to assign her to a position without inmate contact because she had a cardiovascular illness.dargis was aware of another officer with the last name bablicock who was assigned to positions not involving inmate contact because she was in the habit of starting arguments with inmates.finally,dargis knew of an officer named emil jones who was assigned to the firing range after he suffered a stroke and returned to work with a cane.
if it is true that the sheriff office regularly assigned officers with dargis restrictions to permanent positions where they were guaranteed no inmate contact,that fact might undercut the legitimacy of its assertion that all officers need to be able to rotate through the full gamut of correctional officer positions.however,these statements by dargis are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact on that point.dargis set forth no evidence tending to
