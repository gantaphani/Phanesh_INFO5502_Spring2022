in this action under the individuals with disabilities education act,we must decide the extent to which a district court must defer to a state hearing officer decision to order a school district to reimburse a student parents for the cost of a private education.
a student in the ashland school district asd,first began suffering from emotional problems in,while in the third grade.at the same time,began exhibiting difficulty with peer integration,was teased by other children,and developed migraine headaches.by,year,the migraines became so severe that parents parents hospitalized their child.treating physician determined that the child was suffering from anxiety and depression,and that the migraines had a medical origin but were triggered by psychological factors.
at this time,asd identified as eligible for special education services and developed an individualized education program iep,as required by the individuals with disabilities education act idea.d.after asd implemented this iep,repeated the fifth grade,with improved results.
throughout sixth grade and the first two trimesters of seventh grade,maintained strong academic performance,and even participated in a program at southern oregon university for talented and gifted children.during the latter part of seventh grade,however,became depressed,began to talk about suicide,and suffered from frequent migraines that ultimately required hospitalization in the spring of.
during eighth to school.attended one class a day at ashland middle school,and spent the remainder of the school day at willow wind,an alternative education program.in september of that school year,asd provided parents with a pamphlet that outlined their rights and responsibilities under the idea.among other things,this pamphlet notified them that a court or hearing officer might refuse to reimburse them for private school costs if they failed to notify asd of their objections to the iep prior to private school enrollment.in late april,near the end of eighth grade year,asd held an iep team meeting to consider strategies to smooth the transition to high school the following school year.over the summer,was hospitalized on two occasions for suicide attempts.by this time,treating physicians and therapists were recommending residential treatment,rather than ordinary public school,to address persistent emotional and medical problems.
in september,shortly after second discharge from the hospital,asd reconvened its team to draft a new iep.parents indicated their desire to enroll in willow wind,as they had done the previous school year,but the program declined because it was unable to monitor the child closely enough to prevent another suicide attempt.thus,asd personnel wrote a modified iep for the next school year,to which parents did not object.although parents enrolled full time at ashland high school in the fall of,they indicated to asd that they were actively searching for a residential facility in which to place their child.
by late november,emotional problems resurfaced.parents and asd agreed that homebound instruction was appropriate,and asd provided a tutor.asd did not draft a new iep because it believed that the home placement was only temporary pending the child transfer to a private residential facility.in december,was once again hospitalized for suicidal tendencies and threatening to injure family members.briefly returned to ashland high school for a total of twelve days between december,and january.on january,parents transferred from ashland high school to youth care,a private residential treatment program.prior to this transfer,parents never indicated any dissatisfaction with the education asd provided the child,and asd never volunteered that,under some circumstances,it was obligated to pay for residential educational facilities.
youth care operates several private residential educational facilities that provide both medical and educational support to enrolled students.initially attended its principal residential treatment program,located near salt lake city,utah.youth care treatment plan listed significant mental health challenges as chronic depression,repeated suicide attempts,and a homicidal fixation on father and sister.youth care provided psychological care,intensive counseling,and educational support sessions.in july,parents and youth care agreed to transfer to youth care pine ridge facility,which offered less intensive psychological treatment.
on september,had been enrolled in youth care for approximately seven mailed asd a formal letter indicating that they were unhappy with the educational services it had provided and requesting reimbursement for the cost of the residential placement.after receiving this letter,asd convened a meeting to draft a new proposed iep.parents rejected that iep in late january,and requested a due process hearing before a state hearing officer to determine whether asd had provided with a free appropriate public education fape and whether they were entitled to reimbursement for the costs of residential treatment.
the hearing officer concluded that the ieps asd offered in september and december did not provide with a fape,as required by the idea see d.the hearing officer further concluded that youth care did provide a fape and was therefore an appropriate placement.the hearing officer found that parents had removed from ashland high school without notifying asd of their concerns with the education it was providing.under oregon administrative rule which required parents to notify asd of their concerns either at an iep meeting or ten days prior to withdrawing failure permitted the hearing officer to deny or to reduce the amount of reimbursement.
for the period prior to september days after parents gave asd notice of their objections to the hearing officer ordered asd to reimburse parents for half of the cost of this residential program.he based this decision on three factors.
first,although parents did not satisfy the notice requirement until september,asd was aware they were exploring a possible residential placement by january at the very latest.in the hearing officer opinion,this should have warned asd that might need a residential placement,which should have prompted it to consider the possibility of such placement when drafting the ieps.asd felt that parents were considering a residential placement because of medical,rather than educational,needs,and therefore it would not be obligated to pay for any residential treatment.the hearing officer determined that because educational and medical problems were intertwined,asd was obligated to pay for residential treatment,and therefore discounted this explanation.
second,the hearing officer determined that parents failure to complain about any of the ieps cut in asd favor.the hearing officer felt that the impact of this failure was tempered,however,by asd failure to provide an appropriate iep.
third,the hearing officer felt that asd failure to notify parents of its possible obligation to pay for residential care also weighed in favor of granting reimbursement.asd was aware that parents were considering a residential program long before parents placed in such a program,but did not inform them of its potential responsibility to pay for that placement.asd had,on earlier occasions,provided parents with pamphlets describing their rights and obligations under the idea,but there was no evidence that parents received a copy of this notice after september.thus,the hearing officer felt that parents failure to provide notice of their objections to the iep was understandable,and concluded that the lack of notice did not heavily favor asd.
the hearing officer also granted parents full reimbursement for all residential care expenses for the period after september.although parents did not satisfy the notice requirement,he concluded that the foregoing considerations compelled requiring asd to reimburse parents.moreover,because asd had the statutorily required ten days notice with respect to this time period,the hearing officer determined that it was proper to award parents full reimbursement.
asd appealed the hearing officer decision to the district court for the district of oregon under i.
the district court reversed the hearing officer award of reimbursement conducting an independent review of the record,the district court determined that parents are not entitled to reimbursement for the expenses associated with the residential placement either before or after they provided asd with notice.
the district court determination rested on several factors,such as the high cost of residential facilities parents clear failure to adhere to the statutorily required notice requirement the medical,rather than educational,nature of placement parents failure to give asd notice that they were rejecting the iep asd cooperation and willingness to revise iep whenever parents wished to change placement and parents apparent unwillingness to consider returning to an asd school.
the district court also rejected parents request for interim relief or reimbursement for residential care during the allegedly delayed administrative that the hearing officer decision was not unreasonably delayed.parents timely appealed this decision.
parents first contend that the district court applied the wrong standard of review to the hearing officer decision.
parents argue that the district court reviews the hearing officer decision to grant reimbursement for abuse of discretion.this claim relies on a misreading of the relevant statutory language and our precedent.
under i c,the district court reviews the records of the state due process hearing,hears additional evidence offered by the parties,and then,basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence,grant s such relief as the court determines is appropriate.thus,the statute commands the district court to review the evidence and come to its own conclusion about what relief is appropriate.see sch.comm.of burlington of,d.
parents cite our decision in parents of student puyallup school district,cir,for the proposition that the district court reviews the hearing officer decision for abuse of discretion.this is a misreading of student there,we concluded that,because section i c grants the district court discretion to craft appropriate relief,we review its conclusion for abuse of discretion.id.we did not discuss the standard of review the district court applies to hearing officer decisions.
contrary to parents assertion,a district court reviews a state hearing officer award of reimbursement de novo under section i c.seattle sch.dist,cir.it is true that section i c carries with it the implied requirement that due weight shall be given to these proceedings.bd.of educ.rowley,d.in other words,the court must give deference to the state hearing officer findings,particularly when they are thorough and careful,at,and avoid substitut ing its own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which it review s,union sch.dist.smith,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in the end,however,the court is free to determine independently how much weight to give the state hearing officer determinations.see county of san diego cal.special educ.hearing office,cir ash lake oswego sch,cir.
parents also argue that the district court relatively brief opinion did not satisfy the standard of review,citing our decision in gregory longview sch,cir,aff sub.nom.sch.comm.of,d.in gregory,we held that a court must consider the hearing officer findings carefully and endeavor to respond to the hearing officer resolution of each material issue.id.the deference required by gregory is nowhere near as great as parents imply after responding to the hearing officer conclusions,the court is free to accept or reject the findings in part or in whole.id.although we would have preferred that the district court opinion were more detailed,it adequately responded to the hearing officer conclusions before reaching a contrary result.
it is true that the district court did not address the hearing officer conclusion that the september iep failed to provide with a fape,or his holding that youth care did provide with a fape.that failure does not mean,however,that the district court did not properly consider the hearing officer conclusions.although the hearing officer dedicated a majority of his opinion to evaluating the ieps,the district court,indeed,did not address the hearing officer findings that september and december ieps failed to provide with a fape.asd did not appeal the hearing officer determination that the september iep was not adequate,and the district court therefore did not address it.with respect to the december iep,the district court did not directly determine if it was proper rather,it found that parents actions showed they were unlikely to place back in an asd school even if the iep was adequate.thus,in the district court opinion,parents participated in the december iep process not to help asd prepare to provide their child with a fape,but merely as a prelude to seeking reimbursement.thus,we are satisfied that the district court adequately responded to the hearing officer conclusions,even if it did not do so directly.
furthermore,the district court provided a clear rationale for its determination.for example,while the hearing officer concluded that residential placement was appropriate because he believed that medical and educational difficulties were intertwined,the district court instead concluded that parents decision to place in youth care was motivated primarily by their worries about medical condition.similarly,parents failure to provide proper notice troubled the district court more than it did the hearing officer,as did their repeated failure to object to the many ieps asd prepared for 
having satisfied ourselves that the district court applied the proper standard of review to the hearing officer conclusions,we turn to the merits of parents appeal.
parents argue that we must give deference to the hearing officer conclusions.we disagree.like the district court,we may not substitute our own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which we review.smith,at internal quotation marks omitted.at the same time,we do not review the hearing officer conclusions for abuse of discretion.forest grove sch.dist,cir,aff,d.instead,we focus our review on the district court decision.
when a district court hears an appeal from a state hearing officer,it exercises broad discretion to craft relief under i c.see sch.comm.of burlington,at.in a case such as this one,where parents seek reimbursement for private school expenses,they are entitled to reimbursement only if a federal court concludes both that the public placement violated idea and that the private school placement was proper under the act.florence county sch.dist.four carter ex rel.carter,d.and even then courts retain discretion to reduce the amount of a reimbursement award if the equities so instance,if the parents failed to give the school district adequate notice of their intent to enroll the child in private school.forest grove sch.dist,d see also a c ii.thus,because the district court had equitable discretion to craft appropriate relief in this case,we review its decision to deny reimbursement for abuse of that discretion,at.
parents contend that the district court conclusion that they are not entitled to reimbursement was predicated on several errors.we consider each of these claims in turn.
parents first claim that the district court improperly considered the high cost of residential treatment when it denied their request for reimbursement.although they are correct that the idea sometimes requires a school district to pay for a child private education,we do not agree with their contention that the cost of residential treatment should necessarily be irrelevant to the district court decision to grant or withhold reimbursement.
when a student requires a residential placement,the idea requires a district to pay for reasonable,expenses associated with that placement.see carter,at.in denying parents request for reimbursement,the district court noted that much of the cost of residential care is directed to medical expenses.the district court concluded that much of medical care was unrelated to educational needs.given
