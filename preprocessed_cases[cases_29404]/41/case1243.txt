tenncare enrollment and eligibility 
the tennessee department of health tdh administers the tenncare program for the state of tennessee.ann.the tenncare program is a federal waiver plan under the medicaid act approved by the secretary of health and human services under.the waiver eliminated certain requirements for eligibility for medical benefits under the medicaid act.
under the tenncare program,tennessee provides medical assistance to eligible persons through managed care organizations rather than through traditional arrangements with providers.tenncare coverage is extended to three groups of individuals existing medicaid beneficiaries and those who meet medicaid financial medical eligibility requirements the uninsured and the uninsurable.comp.regs.a and.the tenncare regulations define uninsured persons as 
a ny person s who as of march,did not have coverage under an individual health insurance policy or who did not have either directly or through a family member coverage under,or access to,health insurance or to another government plan,and continues to lack this access 
comp.regs.persons eligible for tenncare coverage as uninsureds can enroll during periods of open enrollment.comp.regs.d.the open enrollment period continues until the program reaches of the maximum enrollment cap for that year.comp.regs.d.
the tenncare regulations define uninsurable persons as a ny person s who are unable,because of an existing medical condition,to purchase health insurance,but who meets the guidelines of the program.comp.regs.persons eligible for tenncare coverage as uninsurables can enroll at any time.comp.regs.b.
to enroll in the tenncare program,an applicant must answer a series of written questions and submit the completed forms to the tenncare bureau.the same application is used for both uninsured and uninsurable applicants.applicants are not required to reflect on the application whether they are seeking medical insurance as an uninsured or uninsurable person.
the tenncare regulations state that enrollment in the program is complete when the person eligible for enrollment has selected a managed care plan from those available in the area where the person resides,the application has been approved by the bureau of tenncare,and when any applicable premiums have been paid.comp.regs.the regulations further provide that e nrollment shall be deemed complete retroactive to the date of the original application,if that application is approved.comp.regs.this is consistent with the medicaid regulations and waiver that require approval of medicaid coverage up to three months from the date of the approved application.
however,if an application is denied,the tenncare regulations require that written notice to the applicant include the following 
an explanation of the reasons for the bureau actions,including a brief statement of the factual basis and the rule or contract provision relied upon by the bureau 
an explanation of the circumstances under which the tenncare applicant can request an appeal and 
an explanation of the tenncare applicant right to submit documents or other information in support of a request for appeal.
comp.regs.b.furthermore,an applicant may appeal the denial of tenncare coverage within days after the date of the notice of denial.comp.regs.a.
plaintiff hamby application process 
in,hamby,then years old,was treated for skin cancer and testicular cancer.hamby applied for tenncare coverage in december of.because hamby had not yet received a response from the tenncare bureau regarding his december application,hamby completed and mailed a second application to the bureau in february of.
on his applications,hamby stated that he had not been turned down for a health insurance policy other than medicaid or medicare.the tenncare bureau denied both of hamby applications.the tenncare bureau sent hamby a written notice,dated march,which provided in part 
this is why we think you do not qualify for tenncare.
your february application was received after the end of an open enrollment period.
if you or someone in your family has lost or can not get health insurance because of a medical condition,fill in the attached appeal form and return it to us.you and your family members may qualify for tenncare because you are uninsurable.uninsurable people can enroll in tenncare at any time.
there are three ways to qualify for tenncare.we only checked one way.you may also be eligible if you are uninsurable you lose or can not get health insurance because of a medical condition you have or if you qualify for medicaid.
remember even if you are not eligible for tenncare or medicaid you can apply later if the facts about you change.
in june of,hamby sent a third application to the tenncare bureau,in which he indicated that he had been denied health insurance.hamby third application was received by the tenncare bureau on june.the tenncare bureau later informed hamby that he was enrolled in the program effective june.
in june of,hamby filed an appeal and declaratory ruling requesting that his enrollment relate back to the date of his original application in december of.on june,the administrative law judge the alj issued an order finding hamby eligible for tenncare coverage based on his second application submitted in february of.the alj reasoned that the commissioner was required to open tenncare enrollment during the first three months of each calender year until enrollment reached of the enrollment cap applicable for that year,and that hamby had filed his february application during the open enrollment period of that year,when the total enrollment was less than of the maximum enrollment of million.
on september,the commissioner designee reversed the alj order.the designee concluded that hamby enrollment date should have been based on his third application of june,because hamby responded on his december,and february,applications that he had never been denied other medical insurance.the designee also concluded that hamby first two applications were submitted after enrollment for coverage as an uninsured person was closed.hamby did not appeal or request for a hearing concerning the denial of his december and february applications.
plaintiff ooten application process 
on july,ooten,then years old,had a heart attack and was taken to roane county medical center in harriman,tennessee.while in emergency care,ooten daughter completed a tenncare application for ooten and submitted it to the hospital.after her release from the hospital,ooten called the tenncare bureau to inquire about her application.the tenncare bureau informed ooten that her application had been denied and advised her to submit a new application together with a denial letter from an insurance company.the tenncare bureau later sent ooten written notice,dated july,which provided in part 
this is who in your family does not qualify and why we think they do not qualify 
betty ooten 
social security number 
this person s denied for the reason listed below.
your application was received during a period of closed enrollment.
you have the right to request a reassessment 
do you think we are wrong for turning you down for tenncare 
you have the right to ask for a reassessment to tell us why.
on july,ooten filed another application with a denial letter from a private insurance company.this application was received by the tenncare bureau on july.the tenncare bureau enrolled ooten in the program effective july.on july,ooten requested a reassessment of her original application and informed the tenncare bureau that she could not get medical insurance because she had a preexisting medical condition a blockage in her arteries.ooten request for reassessment was referred to a formal hearing.
at a hearing held on february,dena bost,an officer of the tenncare bureau,testified as follows on direct examination 
can you explain why tenncare denied the july application 
a.the july application did not indicate that ooten had been turned down for other insurance,and there was no attachment indicating that either.
q.why did tenncare approve the july application 
a.a denial letter from an insurance company denying her coverage on the basis of her medical condition was attached to that application,and she indicated that she had been denied.
at.on,bost conceded that a person can have an existing medical condition that they know makes them uninsurable and cited personal circumstances.bost also conceded that applicants are not asked if they are unable,because of an existing condition,to obtain health insurance.bost testified that applicants may respond differently to the question have you been denied insurance if they were asked about existing medical conditions.
the alj issued an order on may,denying ooten request that her date of eligibility relate back to the date of her original application.ooten filed a petition for appeal.as of the date of this appeal,defendants had not yet ruled on ooten administrative appeal.
plaintiff hyslope application process 
hyslope,suffering from diabetes,submitted an application for tenncare coverage on may.hyslope indicated in her application that she had not been denied health insurance.the tenncare bureau denied hyslope application because it was received during a period of closed enrollment.the tenncare bureau sent hyslope written notice dated june,which was identical to the written notice sent to ooten.
thereafter,on june,hyslope requested reassessment of her denied application.on july,the tenncare bureau affirmed the denial of hyslope application.the written notice provided in part 
we want you to know that it is still possible that you are eligible for tenncare.
other ways you may be able to get tenncare 
apply for tenncare again if you can not get health insurance because of health problems.include an insurance company letter which states a medical reason why you can not get health insurance if the letter is from an insurance agent,it must be on the agent letterhead.it must be dated within the last months prior to your tenncare application.
at.emphasis in original.
hyslope requested a hearing on july.while awaiting a hearing,hyslope sent a second application,dated august,to the tenncare bureau.in the application,hyslope responded yes to the question have you been denied health insurance the tenncare bureau approved hyslope second application effective august.on november,a telephone hearing was held.hyslope was not represented by counsel at the hearing.
the alj affirmed the denial of hyslope first application on november,finding that hyslope did not submit an insurance denial letter with the application.on november,hyslope requested a reconsideration of the denial of her first application.hyslope stated that she had to go to the hospital due to an ulceration on her toe and that she almost lost her foot due to diabetes.the commissioner designee affirmed the denial of hyslope first application on may.

plaintiffs contend that tenncare eligibility and enrollment process violates their due process rights under the fourteenth amendment because the process does not provide adequate notice that,upon applying,applicants must identify themselves as either uninsured or uninsurable persons,nor does the process express that such a distinction is determinative of their eligibility for coverage.the plaintiffs also contend that they were denied a meaningful hearing,in violation of their due process rights,because of defendants policy to determine a claimant uninsurable status by focusing upon the receipt of an insurance company letter of rejection rather than the plaintiffs medical condition.
defendants argue that plaintiffs have no legitimate claim of entitlement to have their denied tenncare applications treated as applications for coverage as uninsurable individuals since plaintiffs did not indicate on their denied applications that they were uninsurable or were applying as uninsurables.defendants contend that because plaintiffs did not submit insurance denial letters,the tenncare bureau had no indication whatsoever that plaintiffs had existing medical conditions that rendered them uninsurable.defendants assert that plaintiffs did not inform the tenncare bureau of their existing medical conditions until they submitted subsequent applications which the tenncare bureau approved.defendants therefore argue that plaintiffs are entitled to tenncare coverage as of the date they submitted approvable applications and not the date they actually became uninsurable.we disagree with defendants for the following reasons.
due process rights 
the district court concluded that plaintiffs have a substantive interest in tenncare or medicaid benefits and if they meet the program requirements,each of the plaintiffs has a legitimate claim of entitlement that gives rise to procedural and substantive due process rights.
it is well established that the requirements of substantive and procedural due process apply to the deprivation of interests encompassed by the fourteenth amendment protection of liberty and property.bd.of regents roth,d holding that a professor did not possess a property interest in his teaching position where it was subject to a limited term appointment such that no legitimate claim to existed.the united states supreme court established a standard,in roth,for determining whether a person has a property interest 
the fourteenth amendment procedural protection of property is a safeguard of the security interests that a person has already acquired in specific benefits.these take many forms.
to have a property interest in a benefit,a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.he must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.he must,instead,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.
property interests,of course,are not created by the constitution.rather they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.
id.at.thus,the first issue we must decide is whether plaintiffs have a legitimate claim of entitlement to have their denied tenncare applications treated as applications for coverage as uninsurable individuals such that due process requirements are invoked.see id.
plaintiffs,like other tennessee citizens,have a right to apply for and enroll in the tenncare program as uninsurable persons at any time.see.comp.regs.b.the tenncare regulations provide that enrollment in the tenncare program is complete when the person eligible for enrollment has selected a managed care plan from those available in the area where the person resides,the application has been approved by the bureau of tenncare,and when any applicable premiums have been paid.comp.regs.the tenncare regulations further provide that e nrollment shall be deemed complete retroactive to the date of the original application,if that application is approved.comp.regs.finally,tenncare applicants,if denied,will be given an opportunity to have an administrative hearing before the commissioner regarding the denial of their applications.at.unsuccessful tenncare applicants must be notified in writing,which must contain a n explanation of the reasons of the bureau actions,including a brief statement of the factual basis or the rule or contract provision relied upon by the bureau a n explanation of the circumstances under which the tenncare applicant can request an appeal a n explanation of the tenncare applicant right to submit documents or other information in support of a request for appeal.comp.reg.b.
both the supreme court and this court,have analyzed various scenarios that involve a legitimate claim of entitlement,giving rise to a property interest.roth,at.flatford chater,cir banks block,cir.these cases have been instructive to this court in determining what constitutes a property interest warranting due process scrutiny,and what does not.
in roth,the supreme court rejected the plaintiff claim holding that he had no property interest in,but merely a unilateral expectation,which would not constitute a legitimate claim of entitlement rising to the level of a protected constitutional right.at.the court stated that the limited terms of respondent appointment as a professor secured absolutely no interest in for the next year.id.the court compared this claim to that of a welfare recipient legitimate claim of continuous entitlement to his or her welfare benefits for which they had not yet shown eligibility,but were entitled to do so.id.at.citing goldberg kelly,d.
this court,in banks,used the supreme court determination in roth,as instructive guidance in determining the property interest in a plaintiff expectancy of continuous receipt of food stamp assistance.at.we stated that roth was instructive in two respects.id.first,this court held that the plaintiff unilateral expectancy in the continuous receipt of food stamps is not enough to create a constitutionally protected interest,because the food stamp act explicit terms did not justify a reasonable expectancy of entitlement beyond the expiration of the assigned certification period.id.at.in banks,the food stamp benefit recipients were eligible for only a limited certification period,defined as the period for which households shall be eligible to receive authorization cards.id.at quoting c.banks differs from goldberg in this respect whereas goldberg continuous welfare benefit receipt was a legitimate claim of entitlement,the limited nature of banks food stamp awards was merely a unilateral expectation.
second,we were guided by roth holding that property interests are created and their dimensions are defined by an independent source,meaning that the determination of the existence of a property right protected by due process is controlled by the statute creating and defining that right.see also goldberg,at.therefore,this court held in banks that the expectancy of entitlement to a continuous receipt of food stamps was an abstract,unilateral one,and would not rise to the level of a property interest,due to the food stamp act limited certification period of eligibility,much like the teaching contract in roth,which established no property interest beyond the term of the assigned period.banks,at 
with roth property interest claim of subject to a limited and defined employment contract,and banks food stamp recipient property interest claim of continuous benefits subject to a limited certification period,the difference between the denial of due process rights in those two instances and the affirmation of a welfare recipient property interest in goldberg,lies in the continuity of entitlement.id.in goldberg,welfare recipients challenged existing aid termination procedures,where under the statute involved,recipients were not allowed to appear and present evidence prior to termination of their supposedly continuous welfare benefits.at.the supreme court held that such a procedure violated due process concepts since recipients were entitled to benefits,on a continuous basis,so long as they remained eligible.id.
since tenncare is a waiver created under the medicaid act,medical assistance to uninsured and uninsurable individuals is partially federally funded.the medicaid act does not subject its recipients to a limited duration of services so long as the eligibility requirements are met and if challenging a discontinuance,up until the exhaustion of all appeals.a and d.furthermore,this court has previously held that a social security claimant has a property interest in benefits for which he or she hopes to qualify.flatford,at based on the holding in richardson perales,d,in which the court accepted the proposition that petitioner claim to benefits gave him a protectable property interest.since medicaid is a program established by title xix of the social security act,et,we find that plaintiffs likewise have a property interest in the tenncare coverage for which they hope to qualify.id 
based solely on plaintiffs negative responses to the question have you been denied health insurance and their failure to submit insurance denial letters with their original applications,the tenncare bureau presumed that plaintiffs applied for coverage as uninsured persons only,and that plaintiffs did not have an existing medical condition that prevented them from obtaining health insurance elsewhere.moreover,defendants do not even contend that plaintiffs were not uninsurable persons at the time of their original applications.rather,defendants contend that because plaintiffs did not submit insurance denial letters with their original applications,defendants properly denied plaintiffs claims of entitlement to tenncare coverage.however,because defendants applications did not inform plaintiffs of this presumption and because none of defendants regulations explaining uninsurable eligibility criteria stated that an insurance denial letter must be submitted with the application,plaintiffs were justified in believing their original applications would be considered in light of the relevant laws and regulations that would grant plaintiffs medical coverage provided they were eligible.therefore,given plaintiffs eligibility,we hold that plaintiffs have a legitimate claim of entitlement to tenncare coverage as of the date of their original applications.
ii.procedural due process 
additionally,it is that a possessory interest in property invokes procedural due process,which would require adequate notice and a meaningful hearing prior to any attempt to deprive the interest holder of any rights.thomas cohen,cir citing fuentes shevin,d see also mathews eldridge,d holding that a claim of entitlement to social security benefits triggers due process protection.
adequate notice 
the district court concluded that defendants notices did not inform plaintiffs that they could offer proof of an existing condition to qualify as uninsurable,a basic element of this status under tenncare rules or that a second application will undisputably result in a loss of any benefits under their first application.
the supreme court standard applied to a notice inquiry when establishing the constitutionality of a process which may be determinative of the finality of parties rights requires that notice be reasonably calculated,under all circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.mullane cent.hanover trust.the supreme court further clarified the standard for adequate notice in goldberg,at.requiring that notice be reasonably calculated to inform the recipient of the action to be taken and an effective opportunity to be heard.
defendants argue that the tenncare bureau provided plaintiffs with adequate written notices that their applications were denied because the applications were received during a period of closed enrollment they had a right to appeal and seek assistance in appealing and they had a right to request a hearing within days from the date of the notices.defendants point out that the forms necessary for appealing were included with the notices.
we find that although defendants notices adequately informed plaintiffs of tenncare denial of their applications,the notices failed to inform plaintiffs that their applications were denied because they were not considered uninsurable persons their applications were rejected because the applications were incomplete due to a lack of proof of a previous insurance denial if an appeal of a denied application was not pursued,applicants would be barred from a claim of benefits originating from the date of their original applications and if applicants did submit new applications with insurance denial letters,the second claim would cut off eligibility based on the first applications.because defendants failed to include such information in the notices,plaintiffs were not adequately advised of the reasons for denial of their applications,their right to appeal,the existence of a presumption that plaintiffs did not apply for coverage as uninsurable persons,and the consequences of not appealing and filing new applications.
in gonzalez sullivan,cir,the ninth circuit reviewed the sufficiency of notices by the secretary of health and human services the hhs concerning denial of applications for social security disability benefits.the hhs initial notices of denial provided 
if you believe that this determination is not correct,you may request that your case be reexamined.if you want this reconsideration,you must request it no later than days from the date you receive this notice.you may make your request through any social security office.if additional evidence is available,you should submit it with your request.please read the enclosed leaflet for a full explanation of your right to question the determination made in your claim.if you do not request reconsideration of your case within the prescribed time period,you still have the right to file another application at any time.
id.the ninth circuit held that the hhs notices violated a claimant right to procedural due process because the notices did not clearly indicate that if no request for reconsideration is made,the determination is final.id.the ninth circuit reasoned 
requiring notices to accurately state how a claimant might appeal an initial decision does not impose a significant financial or administrative burden on the secretary moreover,the form of the notice s used here is sufficiently misleading that it introduces a high risk of error into the disability decisionmaking process one of the fundamental requirements of procedural due process is that a notice must be reasonably calculated to afford parties their right to present objections.
this court,in day shalala,has followed the ninth circuit views regarding the sufficiency of notice,cir stating that w e join the ninth circuit in finding this particular notice form inadequate.in day,the notice of an applicant denial was similar to that of gonzalez.id.at.plaintiffs argued that the denial of a disability benefits notice and the accompanying explanatory leaflet failed to make clear the crucial distinction between appealing a determination and reapplying for benefits.id.the court agreed that a claimant who reapplied rather than appealed might encounter limitations on the payment of retroactive benefits if eventually approved,which would be calculated from the date of the new application rather than the date of the initial,unappealed one.id.
in the instant case,plaintiffs argued that defendants notification attempts violated due process in two separate ways.first,tenncare denial notices failed to advise applicants of its reasons for denial and of their right to appeal.there is no mention of an applicant status as an uninsurable applicant,when the applicant is issued a denial.all three plaintiffs received denial letters from their original applications stating that they failed to enroll within the open enrollment period,which is a requirement for uninsured applicants only.since there was no section of the application itself that required an applicant to specify under which status they wished to enroll,all applications that did not have an insurance letter attached indicating a recent denial,or an answer in the affirmative as to whether or not they have previously been denied insurance,were categorically denied.once plaintiffs eventually sent a previous insurance letter indicating a denial,they were approved however,the benefits were not retroactive to the date of the first application.applicants eligible for tenncare benefit were not adequately informed as to how to fully receive the benefits to which they were entitled,at the time they were entitled to them,nor were they fully apprised of the reasons for denial as uninsurable applicants.
second,the denial notices did not advise the applicants of the consequences of not appealing and filing new applications.again,all three plaintiffs were told to to tenncare upon receiving their denial letters,instead of appealing.there was no notice given that a new application would cut off eligibility for the benefits requested by plaintiffs first applications.
like the notices in gonzalez and day,we find the notices here to be constitutionally inadequate inasmuch as they failed to adequately advise plaintiffs of their rights to properly apply as uninsurable persons,to be fully informed as to why they were denied as uninsurable applicants,and not merely uninsured applicants,and to the consequences of after a denial instead of appealing such decisions.we therefore hold that plaintiffs were given constitutionally inadequate notices in violation of procedural due process.
meaningful hearing 
the district court concluded that plaintiffs were not allowed to show an existing medical condition that makes them unable to obtain health insurance.
defendants argue that plaintiffs were not denied meaningful hearings because they were represented by counsel,obtained significant discovery from defendants,and were given the opportunity to raise legal challenges to the tenncare coverage eligibility criteria which resulted in the denial of their applications.we disagree.
although plaintiffs timely appealed the denial of their first applications,the tenncare bureau continued to deny plaintiffs coverage because plaintiffs failed to indicate on their applications that they had been denied health insurance and failed to attach insurance denial letters to their applications.when the tenncare bureau received plaintiffs subsequent applications with attached insurance denial letters,it treated the applications as separate applications for coverage as uninsurable individuals.plaintiffs subsequent applications,filed before their requests for reassessment,were ignored by the tenncare bureau for purposes of reassessing their first applications.in sum,because plaintiffs stated on their first applications that they had not previously been denied health insurance,defendants disallowed them from demonstrating at a hearing that they had existing medical conditions that made them unable to obtain health insurance,thus evidencing their uninsurable status,before denying coverage under the original application.see friedrich sec y health human,cir finding that the touchstone of procedural due process is the fundamental requirement that an individual be given the opportunity to be heard in a meaningful manner.we therefore hold that plaintiffs were denied a meaningful hearing in violation of procedural due process.
the dissent dismissive suggestions that a ruling in plaintiffs favor would make a constitutional issue out of every bureaucracy faulty paperwork,is only partly true.because statutory language bestows legitimate rights upon an individual,and those rights are entitled to procedural due process,only those bureaucracies which engage in practices that violate an individual rights,procedurally or otherwise,will have themselves created a constitutional problem.
iii.constitutionality of defendants irrebuttable presumption 
the district court concluded that defendants policy and practice of requiring an insurance denial letter to demonstrate eligibility for tenncare coverage as an uninsurable person constitutes an unconstitutional irrebuttable presumption.
defendants argue that the district court conclusion is erroneous because cleveland bd.of educ.lafleur,d,was the last line of cases in which the supreme court ventured into the irrebuttable presumption analysis.shortly after its decision in cleveland bd.of,the supreme court made it clear that heightened scrutiny of a statute could not be triggered by merely asserting a claim that the challenged statute contained an irrebuttable presumption.see weinberger salfi,d.
in weinberger,the court reviewed the social security administration requirement that irrebuttably presumed that if a marriage did not precede the wage earner death by nine months,the marriage was entered into for the purpose of securing social security benefits.the court upheld the requirement,finding that the due process clause can be thought to impose a bar only if the statute manifests a patently arbitrary classification,utterly lacking in rational justification.id.at.the court explained that the plaintiffs only constitutional claim is that the test they can not meet is not so rationally related to a legitimate legislative objective that it can be used to deprive them of benefits available to those who do satisfy that test.id.at.the court reasoned that the irrebuttable presumption analysis was inappropriate because the plaintiffs noncontractual claim to receive funds from the public treasury did not deserve heightened constitutional protection.id.
in kirk secretary of health and human services,cir,we recognized that the irrebuttable presumption analysis is inapplicable to challenges to aspects of social welfare programs.to challenge the constitutionality of defendants alleged presumption,plaintiffs must prove that defendants presumption is not rationally related to a legitimate state objective.see also weinberger,at.
here,defendants argue that their presumption that plaintiffs did not apply for tenncare coverage as uninsurable persons because they responded no to the question have you been denied health insurance and because they had failed to attach insurance denial letters to their applications is rationally related to the legitimate state goals of extending medical benefits to those persons most in need of them verifying that applicants are unable to purchase health insurance due to existing medical conditions and discouraging health insurance carriers from their enrollees to the tenncare program.
we find that defendants presumption is not rationally related to legitimate state goals because applicants,who have not been previously refused health insurance but have existing medical conditions that make them unable to obtain health insurance,will be excluded from tenncare coverage simply because they provided a negative response to the question have you been denied health insurance a negative response to that question is not conclusive of an applicant status and should not be determinative of their approval or disapproval.the apparent justification for defendants presumption is administrative convenience.by asking have you been denied health insurance,defendants seek to eliminate the need for an individualized determination which may be more time consuming and expensive.however,defendants interest in administrative ease and certainty can not,in and of itself,save the conclusive presumption from the invalidity under the due process clause where there are other reasonable and practicable means of establishing the pertinent facts on which the state objective is premised.vlandis kline,d see also weinberger,at.criticizing portions of the vlandis ruling on other grounds however,reiterating the validity of statutory restrictions,so long as congress could have rationally concluded both that a particular limitation or qualification would protect against its occurrence,and that the expense and other difficulties of individual determinations justified the inherent imprecision of a prophylactic rule.defendants enrollment process is not rationally related to their proffered legitimate state goals.in fact,there are alternative reasonable and practical means by which tenncare can administer its medical benefits,such as modifying the application so as to eliminate the solicitation of vague or ambiguous information regarding the applicant insurance coverage history,instead opting for direct and concise information or modifying the initial denial process by encouraging the immediate supplementation of the application before a decision is made or there is an immediate appeal,rather than suggesting.we therefore hold that defendants current process is not rationally related to legitimate state goals.
conclusion 
for the forgoing reasons,we affirm the district court order in case and affirm the district court order in case.
i respectfully dissent.i would hold that the plaintiffs do not have a property interest in or a legitimate claim of entitlement to the tenncare benefits prior to plaintiffs obtaining approval of their applications,and that even if the plaintiffs could demonstrate such an interest,they have not demonstrated either a procedural or a substantive due process violation.finally,i would hold that the irrebuttable presumption doctrine has no rational application to this case.
it is not clear to me whether in the section entitled due process rights the majority opinion actually holds that the plaintiffs have demonstrated a substantive due process violation,or holds only that the plaintiffs have demonstrated that they have a property interest for the purposes of a procedural due process claim.in my view,the plaintiffs can demonstrate neither.unlike the plaintiffs in goldberg kelly,d,these plaintiffs were not already receiving benefits which the state intended to or did terminate without a pretermination hearing.and the majority conclusion that because tenncare is a program created under the medicaid act,and medicaid is a program established under the social security act,applicants for tenncare,like applicants for social security,have a property interest in the benefits for which they hope to qualify is unwarranted.contrary to the majority opinion claim,we did not hold in flatford chater,cir,that applicants for social security benefits have a property interest in those benefits.rather,based on the supreme court decision in richardson perales,d,which in turn quoted the court observation in flemming nestor,d,that the right t
