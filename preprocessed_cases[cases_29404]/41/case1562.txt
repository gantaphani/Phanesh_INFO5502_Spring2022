irene hojnacki,a discharged employee of addus healthcare,addus brought this action against addus,its chief financial officer and illinois department of corrections officials,alleging due process violations and claiming the right to a hearing.the district court held that the due process claim must fail because hojnacki was not an employee of the illinois department of corrections.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
hojnacki was employed by addus healthcare,a private company under contract with the illinois department of corrections doc to supply health care services to inmates at doc prisons.she worked as medical director at the dwight correctional center for women dwight.in march,doretta,the administrator of dwight healthcare unit hcu,filed an incident report with the warden of the facility,donna.according to the report,administrator had reviewed an inmate medical chart and discovered that she had been given a soft drink.administrator asked a nurse how the inmate came to have the soft drink,and the nurse responded that hojnacki had given the soft drink to the inmate and had asked the nurse to give it to the inmate the report states that hojnacki had been informed that could not be given to inmates and that their diets must come from the doc.the report further indicates that hojnacki stated,apparently upon being informed of this rule,that she would bring the soft drink her self.the report also indicates that s he was advised against it.id.
after receiving the incident report,warden sent a letter to mark heaney,the chief financial officer of addus,relating that hojnacki had knowingly violated prison policies by delivering the up to a prisoner and recommending that appropriate disciplinary action be taken that would disallow her entrance into the dwight correctional.addus then discharged hojnacki because she was no longer allowed access to dwight and because no other similar positions exist ed with the company.
when hojnacki learned that she had been discharged,she requested a hearing from the warden,but the warden refused.hojnacki also claims that the defendants made it known to employees of the prison and to medical professionals in joliet,illinois,that she brought contraband into the prison and gave it to a prisoner,a violation of illinois law.hojnacki denies the allegations against her and further asserts that they have become widely known in dwight,joliet and chicago and that,as a result,she has not been able to find comparable employment.
district court proceedings 
hojnacki filed a complaint against warden,administrator,addus healthcare and heaney.she alleged that all of the defendants had violated her due process rights under the fourteenth amendment by defaming her in connection with her discharge and thereby preventing her from finding comparable employment.she sought a hearing.hojnacki also asserted claims for sex discrimination under title vii against all of the defendants and age discrimination under the age discrimination in employment act against addus and heaney.the remaining counts set forth various causes of action.
the defendants filed motions to dismiss,asserting that,in order to prevail on her due process claim for a hearing,hojnacki had to demonstrate that she was a state employee,a showing that the defendants maintained she could not make.in response to the motions to dismiss,hojnacki accepted the defendants assertions that she would have to show that she was a doc employee to prevail.she stated in her answer we take as bible addus and heaney assertion in order to sustain a claim for constitutional clearing,plaintiff must demonstrate that she was a public employee at.the answer explains further if the defendants are correct in their contention that the plaintiff was not a public employee,then this case should be dismissed.id.at.hojnacki maintained,however,that her employment status could only be determined after discovery.she observed that t he discovery involved in establishing the issue of employment is but a small part of the overall discovery.it would indeed be unfortunate for all of the parties with great amounts of time and expenditures,as well as the time of the court,if it were preordained that the plaintiff was not a public employee.id.at.hojnacki therefore suggested that a limitation of discovery to only the issue of employment should promptly ascertain sufficient information to dispose of the issue.id.
the district court denied the motions to dismiss but adopted the parties view that only a state employee could state a claim against a state agency for defaming her in connection with her discharge and thereby preventing the employee from finding comparable employment.the court also adopted hojnacki proposal and ordered that discovery initially be limited to the issue of whether hojnacki was an employee of the doc.after discovery,the defendants filed motions for summary judgment on that sole issue.
the district court held that hojnacki was not a state employee and entered summary judgment for the defendants on the due process claim.the court also entered summary judgment for the individual defendants on the age and sex discrimination claims,a determination that hojnacki does not appeal.hojnacki moved for a voluntary on the age and sex discrimination claims that remained against addus.the court granted the motion and dismissed those claims with prejudice it also dismissed the remaining claims.the only question on appeal is whether the district court properly granted summary judgment for the defendants because hojnacki is not a state employee.
discussion 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see thomas pearle vision,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see celotex catrett,d.the relevant facts here are not in dispute we therefore must determine only whether hojnacki was an employee of the doc as a matter of law and,if not,whether the defendants were entitled to summary judgment.
a.the cause of action 
alleging a claim under,hojnacki maintained that the defendants had violated her due process rights by defaming her in connection with her discharge and thereby preventing her from finding comparable employment.a person does not have a protectable liberty or property interest in her reputation,see paul davis,d,and mere defamation by the government does not deprive a person of liberty protected by the fourteenth amendment,even when it causes serious impairment of one future employment,siegert gilley,d see paul,at.rather,it is the alteration of legal status,that,combined with the injury resulting from the defamation,justifie s the invocation of procedural safeguards.paul,at.thus,w e have held many times that state employees have a liberty interest in not being discharged from their employment while being defamed such that they can not get other government employment.strasburger bd.of,cir.
it may be that a resulting inability to find work in the defamed person chosen profession is itself an alteration of legal status that would give rise to a due process claim on the part of a employee whose employment was terminated because of the government defamation.see kartseva dep t of state,government contractor employee whose security clearance was inexplicably revoked by the department of state and who could not find comparable work as a result could prevail on her claim for a hearing if the dos action formally or automatically excluded her from government employment opportunities or had the broad effect of largely precluding her from pursuing her chosen career see also greene mcelroy,d t he right to hold specific private employment and to follow a chosen profession free from unreasonable governmental interference comes within the liberty and property concepts of the fifth amendment colaizzi walker,cir if a state or the federal government formally banned a person from a whole categor
