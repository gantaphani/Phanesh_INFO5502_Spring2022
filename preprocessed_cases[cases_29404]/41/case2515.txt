david justice filed suit in federal district court under the americans with disabilities act ada,et,alleging that his employer,crown,cork,seal,crown discriminated against him on the basis of his physical impairment.the district court granted summary judgment to crown,concluding that justice failed to establish that he was disabled within the meaning of the ada,a necessary element of his prima facie case and the evidence showed that justice posed a direct threat to workplace safety.justice now appeals.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to crown and remand the case for further proceedings.
crown owns and operates a plant in worland,wyoming,that produces aluminum beverage cans.justice began working as an electrician at the worland plant in september of,and worked there without difficulty for nearly ten years.in his position as an electrician,justice was required to work regularly around large machines,including power presses,cutters,conveyors,ovens,spray machines,unwinders,and lubricators.justice was also required to use hydraulic and electric lifts,climb ladders,and navigate catwalks suspended above the floor of the plant,all of which were outfitted with safety rails.when working at heights,justice and other employees of the worland plant used standard safety equipment such as waist belts and harnesses.
in march of,justice suffered a stroke that impaired his ability to see,speak,walk,balance,and care for himself.justice doctors withheld him from returning to work for a short period of time.after intense rehabilitative therapy,justice regained his ability to perform many of his life activities but suffered permanent impairment to his ability to balance.justice also continued to suffer from vertigo,or a feeling of movement when there was none.though these conditions caused justice to walk with an unstable gait and otherwise appear unsteady,he was able to adapt and was in actuality more agile than he appeared,experiencing little difficulty with walking and standing.he was eventually released to return to work.the medical release set forth several restrictions he should not work at heights on ladders or scaffolding.his balance is impaired.aplt.app x at.
upon justice return to work,crown initially did not require him to engage in any activities in violation of his medical restrictions.justice was scheduled alongside other electricians who could perform any tasks that he could not perform due to his restrictions which occurred infrequently.he was also permitted to work the day shift with reduced hours.while justice was working under these conditions,crown did not observe any safety problems with his performance and considered him a valuable employee who could contribute to the company.id.at.
justice treating neurologist,roger williams,reexamined him on an annual basis.following his may,examination of justice,williams opined that justice had reached maximum medical improvement,and recommended that justice continue work restriction s that relate to working at unprotected heights,such as on ladders or scaffolding.working on stepladders no higher than six feet should be relatively safe.id.at.after examining justice on may,williams again recommended that justice avoid working on tall ladders or at unprotected heights.experience has shown he can work effectively and safely on shorter ladders and platform lifts.id.at.
these restrictions notwithstanding,justice was able to work safely in the worland plant for approximately two years.a strike began on june,and lasted over eight months,until february of.during this time,justice did not work at the worland plant.when crown employees returned to work,crown initially refused to allow justice and another employee with similar work restrictions to return.after justice union filed a grievance and justice obtained a new work release from williams,crown permitted justice to return to work in late march of.williams march work release again recommended that justice should not work at unprotected heights.when on extension ladders,scaffolding,cherry pickers,he should be restrained with a waist belt and strap.aplt.app x at.
after justice returned to work at the plant,he was placed on the night shift,rather than the day shift he worked before the strike.justice was also assigned a new supervisor,frank pacheco,who had not previously supervised justice directly.pacheco was unaware of the medical restrictions placed on justice,and asked justice to perform tasks that may have been outside his restrictions,such as accessing heights without protection.after observing justice experiencing what pacheco believed to be difficulties with balance,pacheco wrote a memorandum on may,summarizing his observations.pacheco also had a meeting with the plant manager and plant supervisor about his concerns 
in early october of,richard backlund and brian rogers,two of crown area managers,visited the plant.while there,they observed justice acting in an unsteady manner,swaying,and having difficulty with his balance.upon learning that justice had previously been observed acting in a similar manner,the men became concerned for his safety.
on october,backlund and rogers held a conference call with several crown employees,including the plant manager and richard mangus,the worland plant department manager for human resources,to review justice problems.during the call,they discussed their belief that justice may pose a danger to himself and others at the plant.following the conference call,mangus met with justice and informed him of crown concern that although he had not necessarily been working unsafely,there was potential for injury to himself and others due to justice vertigo and balance problems.id.at.justice was then placed on an involuntary leave of absence pending further medical evaluation.crown scheduled an appointment for justice with a neuropsychologist,but justice did not attend,stating that he wanted to see williams first.williams reexamined justice on october,and concluded that justice minor neurological complaints do not seem to limit his vocational abilities.it is still my opinion that he should not put himself at unnecessary risk,such as working at unprotected heights or in unprotected fashion around hazardous machinery.id.at.
following williams examination,justice attended a december,functional capacity evaluation fce with physical therapist rhonda wakai.wakai prepared an initial report of the fce on december.though justice generally performed well on the tests that wakai administered,she did note some concerns it is recommended that justice utilize safety equipment as is standard to the industry when accessing heights,particularly when balance is required.this would include open beams,scaffolding,ladders,and other similar situations.this is in line with williams recommendations,as well.aplt.app x at.based on her examination,wakai concluded that justice was able to work at the very heavy physical demand level for an eight hour day according to the united states department of labor dictionary of occupational titles.id.at.
because justice job description was not available at the time of the fce,wakai was unable to draw any conclusions about his ability to physically perform his job.after providing wakai with a letter purporting to list the physical demands of justice job,crown invited her to perform an evaluation of justice workplace.accompanied by richard mangus,wakai toured the worland plant and observed the areas where electricians were required to work.whether this tour accurately outlined the requirements of the electrician position is unknown.neither justice nor a representative of his union accompanied wakai on the tour,and wakai did not see an electrician performing the tasks associated with the position during the tour.following her visit to the worland plant,wakai prepared a report detailing the results of her evaluation.
wakai visit to the worland plant revealed a number of potential hazards that challenged her perception of her footing and her sense of balance 
slippery footing,the multiple level changes throughout the physical plant,the frequent tight turns in the catwalk area,the frequent need to crouch under structures,and the occasional need to crouch and make a turn at the same time,bouncy walking surfaces,protruding obstacles,and particularly in one area,the visual distraction of having a catwalk that is a grating type material with a very quickly moving object underneath 
aplt.app x at.wakai noted that the operators have taken many precautions to ensure worker safety.id.at.nonetheless,she recommended that justice be encouraged to seek employment that presents fewer obstacles to his physical safety.id.she then left the final approval or disapproval of justice workplace with crown corporate medical director,david spratt.
spratt examined justice medical records,but did not personally evaluate justice.after examining justice records,spratt concluded that justice should not work in an assignment that requires him to maintain balance,work at heights,nor work near moving equipment.aplt.app x at.he did not,however,reach a conclusion as to whether justice could be permitted to continue his job as an electrician in the worland plant.
the management of crown worland plant held a meeting with justice and the president of his local union on february,to discuss the results of the examinations with him.justice was informed that he was disqualified from any assignment that requires working at heights or around moving equipment.id.at.justice was asked what job he felt he could perform in the plant under those limitations and said that he felt he could perform any job available.though justice experience did,in fact,qualify him to perform any job in the plant,he was assigned the position of janitor beginning on february.the position of janitor was the position in the plant and paid substantially less than justice had earned as an electrician.
on april,two months after being reassigned to the position of janitor,justice filed a complaint with the eeoc.after conducting an investigation into justice complaint,the eeoc issued a letter on august,finding reasonable cause to believe that crown had discriminated against justice in violation of the ada.when attempts to conciliate the parties failed,the eeoc issued a letter on december.justice filed this suit in federal district court on march.
crown moved for summary judgment,arguing that justice had presented no evidence that he was disabled under the ada,an essential element of his prima facie case.in the alternative,crown argued that the evidence showed that justice posed a direct threat to workplace safety,a defense to his ada claim.on march,the district court granted summary judgment to crown,concluding that justice had not shown he was disabled within the meaning of the ada,as he had not shown that crown regarded him as disabled or suffering an impairment that substantially limits one or more of his major life activities.aplt.app x at.in addition,the court concluded that crown rightly considered that justice was a direct threat to himself and others in the workplace.id.at.

disability under the ada 
a prima facie case of ada discrimination consists of three elements the plaintiff is a disabled person as defined by the ada is qualified,with or without reasonable accommodation,to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired and suffered discrimination by an employer or prospective employer because of that disability.
zwygart bd.of county comm rs,cir citation omitted.crown sought and the district court granted summary judgment on only the first of these elements,arguing that justice failed to show that he was a disabled person as defined by the ada.under the ada,
t he term disability means,with respect to an individual 
a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual 
b a record of such an impairment or 
c being regarded as having such an impairment.
in claiming that he has a disability,justice did not assert before the district court and does not now assert that either of the first two parts of this definition apply,that he is actually disabled or that he has a record of actual disability.rather,he argues only that crown regarded him as having a substantially limiting impairment under subsection c.
an individual may qualify as disabled under the regarded as subsection in one of two ways a covered entity mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities,or a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual,nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities.sutton united air lines,d see also l defining regarded as having such an impairment.in either event,our focus is on an employer subjective state of mind did the employer mistakenly believe that the plaintiff was substantially limited in performing a major life activity sutton,at.in answering this question,w e analyze only the major life activity or activities asserted by the plaintiff.rakity dillon,cir citing doyal.heart,cir.in the present case,justice argues that crown regarded him as substantially limited in the major life activity of working 
to survive summary judgment on this claim,justice must present some evidence that crown believed that he was significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training,skills,and abilities.eeoc heartway,cir quoting j i.i t is particularly difficult for a plaintiff to prevail on this type of claim,which takes a plaintiff to the farthest reaches of the ada.id.quoting ross campbell soup,cir.it is not,however,an insurmountable showing.id.at.we conclude that based on the record evidence,a reasonable factfinder could infer that crown misapprehended the nature of justice impairment and the risks it posed,and so believed him to be significantly restricted in his ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.
crown argued,and the district court concluded,that there is no evidence that the employer regarded justice as disabled from performing the class of jobs,electrician,in general.aplt.app x at.our reading of the record,though,reveals evidence to the contrary.richard mangus,who took part in the decisions to suspend and ultimately reassign justice,testified that crown initial safety concerns arose because a s an electrician,justice is subject to a lot of high voltages,electricity.id.at.mangus admitted that this was a concern for any electrician,but stated that specific concerns arose with justice because we did feel like he could work safely b ased on his documented vertigo and balance.id.at.similarly,bill decker,who was plant supervisor at the time of the relevant events and also took part in the adverse employment decisions,gave deposition testimony about his perception of justice inability to work on electrical cabinets.id.at.in decker opinion,justice was unable to work on such cabinets being that he was not steady enough to work in them.id.at.h e was too unsteady,in decker view,to even be around current like that.id.at.
these statements suggest that crown at least initially believed that justice balance and vertigo problems could disqualify him from employment as an electrician in,for that matter,from any employment where he might have to work with high voltages or electrical current.the statements undercut crown argument that it only believed that justice was unable to perform the job of electrician in crown plant but could work as an electrician in other environments.aple.br.at.decker and mangus statements do not relate specifically to the plant environment,but seem to indicate a broader fear that justice balance problems posed a safety hazard when working around electrical current in any environment.for this reason,we distinguish the present case from the supreme court decision in murphy united parcel service,d,which held that an employer belief that the plaintiff is incapable of performing a particular job only under certain conditions does not show that the employer believed the plaintiff to be incapable of performing an entire class of jobs.
subsequent medical reports from williams,rhonda wakai,and spratt,none of which indicated that justice had such a limitation,might have disabused crown of that notion.there is,however,no indication that this was the case.in fact,there is evidence suggesting that crown concerns were not assuaged by the medical reports.after williams and wakai had issued their reports on october and december,respectively,mangus wrote to wakai and gave her a description of the job duties of an electrician i n order to get a determination regarding justice physical ability to safely perform his job functions.aplt.app x at.the letter seemed to presuppose that justice balance problems disqualified him from electrical work,describing the c onstant requirement for good balance and steady posture due to requirements to perform work in energized electrical cabinets etc id.
all of this evidence indicates that crown believed that justice balance problems posed a threat when he was working around electricity,a belief unsupported by any of the medical opinions in the record.if justice were in fact incapable of working around electricity due to this perceived impairment,this would significantly restrict his ability to perform an entire class of jobs utilizing his skills,those jobs in the electrical field.heartway,at providing a list of classes of jobs taken from other circuit court cases truck driving,assembly line jobs,manufacturing jobs,welding jobs,and animal care jobs quotation marks and citations omitted.we therefore conclude that justice has presented evidence supporting an inference that crown mistakenly believed him to be substantially limited in the major life activity of working.
also supporting this conclusion is evidence that crown believed that justice balance problems significantly restricted his ability to perform a broad range of jobs.richard mangus admitted there were only about two jobs in the plant he thought justice could do.aplt.app x at.this is consistent with crown later refusal to consider justice for openings at the plant,all of which were available to someone with his level of skill and experience.while this action was taken in,three years after the events at issue in this case,it may nonetheless shed light on crown state of mind at the time of those events.heartway,at even though the employer comments took place four months after the plaintiff was terminated,a jury could reasonably infer that those comments were indicative of his beliefs at the time that he terminated the plaintiff.the worland plant does not,of course,represent a microcosm of all possible jobs,but a reasonable finder of fact could infer from crown determination that justice could only do one or two jobs among the variety of jobs in the plant that crown believed that justice was unable perform a broad range of jobs in various classes.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
crown argues that the foregoing evidence is effectively countered by other evidence in the record.citing mcgeshick principi,cir,and rakity dillon companies,at,crown asserts that the fact that it offered justice another position in the factory shows that it did not regard him as substantially limited in the ability to work.while this evidence is certainly relevant to this inquiry,it does not support summary judgment in this case for two reasons.
first,the fact that crown was willing to consider justice for a single job does not show that crown considered him unlimited in the major life activity of working.as noted,to meet his burden justice must show that crown believed he was restricted in performing either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.heartway,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.neither requires a belief that justice is disqualified from every job imaginable.crown belief that justice is able to perform a single job,or even a narrow subset of jobs,is entirely consistent with a belief that he is nonetheless unable to perform an entire class of jobs or a broad range of jobs.the limited job offer in this case stands in contrast to mcgeshick,in which the evidence showed that the employer considered the plaintiff disqualified from only the particular job at issue,housekeeping aid,due to the physical requirements of the job.mcgeshick,at.there was no indication that the employer considered the plaintiff disqualified from the entire class of similar housekeeping jobs,and the employer invited the plaintiff to apply for other jobs for which he might be qualified.id.emphasis added.thus,the employer considered a number of jobs in its operation to be available to the plaintiff despite his limitations in the present case,by contrast,the evidence indicates that crown considered there to be at best only one or two jobs still available to justice in the worland plant.
second,crown offer of a janitorial position does nothing to rebut the evidence suggesting that crown believed justice balance problems rendered him incapable of performing the broad class of jobs involving electrical work.this distinguishes the present case from rakity,in which the plaintiff employer refused to consider him for a position as an all purpose grocery clerk because the requirements of the job included lifting in excess of the plaintiff medical restrictions.rakity,at.however,the employer continued to be willing to employ the plaintiff as a general grocery clerk,which amount ed to undisputed evidence that the employer did not regard the plaintiff as unable to perform a broad class of grocery clerk jobs.id.at.thus,the crucial fact in rakity was that the job offered to the plaintiff was in the same broad class as the job from which he had been disqualified.here,while crown offered justice another job,the job did not fall within the same class of jobs,and thus sheds no light on whether crown considered justice significantly restricted in the ability to perform this class of jobs.heartway,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
crown also argues that by removing justice from his position as an electrician,it was merely acknowledging his medical restrictions.this court has repeatedly held that w here the recognition of plaintiff limitations is not an erroneous perception,but is instead a recognition of fact,a finding that plaintiff was regarded as disabled is inappropriate.lusk ryder integrated logistics,cir citing hilburn murata elecs,cir.we also find this argument unconvincing.to begin,assuming crown believed that it was unsafe for justice to be around electricity,as the evidence suggests,the evidence indicates that this belief was not a recognition of fact,but an erroneous perception.id.
further,to conclude that crown demotion of justice from electrician to janitor was based on his actual medical restrictions rather than this erroneous perception about his abilities would require us to resolve a disputed issue of material fact in crown favor.crown argues that justice medical restrictions precluded him from working as an electrician because,under its version of the facts,the worland plant was full of obstacles such as unprotected heights and hazardous machinery.while this may be true,there is contrary evidence in the record from which a finder of
