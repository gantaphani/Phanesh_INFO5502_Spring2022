eridiana martnez brought federal and state claims alleging that hongyi cui,a medical resident,sexually assaulted her by digital rape during an examination when she was an patient at the umass memorial medical center.a jury,after trial,rejected her claims.
on appeal,martínez alleges there was error in the district court evidentiary rulings and jury instructions.the evidence claim raises the relationship between rule of the federal rules of evidence,which permits courts to exclude relevant evidence on the ground of prejudice or confusion,and rule,which removes the bar on propensity evidence and permits admission of evidence of similar acts of sexual misconduct in civil cases concerning sexual assault.the instruction claim raises the issue whether the court correctly instructed the jury that martínez had to show cui conduct shocks the conscience to prevail on her fourteenth amendment substantive due process claim.
after a car accident on february,eridiana martínez was brought by ambulance to the emergency department ed at umass memorial medical center in worcester,massachusetts.martínez claims cui digitally raped her,vaginally and rectally,during an examination.cui denied that he ever inserted his finger in or examined her vagina,and hospital records supported him.a rectal exam was performed,which the parties agreed was medically appropriate.the jury accepted cui version and rejected all of martínez claims after about an hour and a half of deliberations.
the hospital records and trial testimony established the following at the ed,martínez was placed in a cubicle,where she had little privacy.at that time,the ed at the umass medical center was located in a long hallway,without private rooms,which held treatment areas divided into three cubicles by partial curtains.martínez could hear patients in adjoining cubicles,only a few feet away,complain of pain.
on admission,martínez complained of severe pain in her neck and on the left side of her body.she was treated by cui,a surgical resident in his internship year,who was accompanied by a spanish interpreter and,at times,a nurse.according to hospital records the ed physician record,cui performed an initial trauma evaluation and a physical exam around cui recorded that a rectal exam and stool occult blood test had been performed on martínez he crossed out the line for a vaginal exam on the form because he did not perform one.cui did not specifically recall this patient,but the jury could have found he recorded information about his own examination of her.
as an intern,cui had to be closely supervised by the attending physician.cui reviewed his exam with brush,the attending physician in the ed,who,in turn,performed his own exam and ordered and pain medication.brush also wrote an attending note in the ed physician record.martínez was discharged at before her discharge,brush recorded that he had reviewed the ed physician said that no vaginal exam had been performed and that a rectal exam had been cui and the patient.martínez also signed the record.
martínez testified at trial that cui initially examined her in front of a nurse and translator and then sent her for.she claimed she was returned alone to her cubicle after,and cui returned,also alone.there,cui lifted her leg,inserted his finger in her rectum and then her vagina,and touched her clitoris.she testified that she did not scream but asked him not to touch her.she also testified that he was drooling during the exam.this encounter lasted about five minutes,according to martínez,and ended when someone called for cui.
several facts presented at trial undermined martínez story.martínez testified that cui rectally assaulted her once.yet even martínez expert witness agreed that a rectal examination was within the standard of care under the circumstances,though a vaginal examination was not.a rectal exam was called for to determine whether,among other things,martínez had suffered internal or spinal injuries.consistent medical testimony also was that,to perform a rectal exam while a patient is strapped to a stretcher,three people are needed to help turn and hold the patient on her side.martínez did not explain how cui could have assaulted her while she was still on the stretcher without anyone present.martínez also did not recall seeing brush at all that day,nor could she explain the presence of her signature next to his on the ed physician record.
martínez also conceded having testified inconsistently at a deposition.martínez admitted that she had previously testified that she cried for help during the alleged attack she insisted at trial though not in the deposition that she had done so quietly.she agreed she had testified earlier,but not at trial,that cui was biting his lip and getting off during the alleged attack.and she admitted that she had previously testified that another patient was in the next cubicle,that she could hear the patients in other cubicles,and that someone from radiology walked into her cubicle during her initial exam with cui.
in the aftermath of the ed visit,martínez said,she was so traumatized from cui alleged assault that she feared having any form of practitioner treat her who was male.yet she visited the office of ron tebo,a chiropractor,eighteen times in,beginning just two days after the alleged attack.she tried to reconcile her claim with testimony that tebo himself touched her only once and never with his hands.martínez was treated by several other male medical personnel in after february as well.
martínez did not make any claim of an inappropriate examination to hospital personnel before she was discharged.martínez testified that a friend,yrure,came into the cubicle shortly after the assault and she reported it to him.yrure did not testify at trial,and the judge instructed the jury it could draw a negative inference from the absence of any witness.
martínez testified that she told her primary care provider,mary sullivan,a nurse practitioner,on february over the phone that cui had assaulted her.sullivan testified that martínez first told her about the alleged assault at the end of an appointment on february,rather than four days earlier as martínez claimed.sullivan obtained the ed physician record from martínez ed visit and went over it with martínez,who was upset and tearful when she left.on march,more than a month after the alleged assault,martínez first filed a formal complaint with the hospital.the board of registration in medicine the board was notified.
more than a year later,on may,the board initiated disciplinary proceedings against cui based on martínez allegations,as well as allegations by another woman,who claimed that cui,while still a surgical resident in his intern year,inserted his finger in her vagina during a postoperative exam on march.the division of administrative law appeals dala conducted exhaustive proceedings,which included discovery and testimony from dozens of witnesses.on january,a dala magistrate found that cui had committed no misconduct and recommended that the board dismiss charges against cui,which the board did.the jury was not told this history it was only informed there had been a prior proceeding.
meanwhile,on february,martínez had sued cui in federal court under,alleging violations of her rights under the fourth,fifth,and fourteenth amendments of the constitution,as well as several state law claims.her federal claims alleged that cui,as a state employee had violated her right to bodily integrity by sexually assaulting her.the district court appropriately characterized this claim as a fourteenth amendment substantive due process claim.
martínez challenges several evidentiary rulings.as to,the court ruled that a could not testify for martínez about cui alleged sexual assault of and b could not testify as a rebuttal witness that cui had performed a rectal examination on her without a chaperone.
the court also ruled that the parties could not refer to the dala proceedings but could mention a prior proceeding when necessary.the court further permitted the defense to impeach martínez using records from her male chiropractor,ron tebo,which showed that she visited tebo offices after cui alleged attack.but the court did not permit martínez to present two rebuttal witnesses to undermine these records.
on february,after about an hour and a half of deliberation,a jury returned a general verdict in favor of cui on all claims,federal and state.the court denied martínez motion for a new trial.martínez timely appealed.
a.the district court evidentiary rulings were not error 
we review preserved evidentiary objections for abuse of discretion we affirm if any error did not affect the parties substantial rights and likely did not affect the outcome of the case,cir.we review objections not raised in the district court for plain error.microfinancial,premier holidays int l,cir.
martínez argues that the district court should have admitted b.testimony as evidence of a similar act in a civil case concerning sexual assault under.or at least in rebuttal under rule.martínez preserved only the second objection,and so we review her rule argument for plain error.though martínez asked the district court to admit testimony,she did not ever argue that this testimony was admissible under rule,and so the court did not mention rule in its rulings.
we conclude that there was,in any event,no error.rule is entitled evidence of similar acts in civil cases concerning sexual assault or child molestation.it provides,in a civil case predicated on a party alleged commission of conduct constituting an offense or offenses of sexual assault,evidence of that party commission of another offense or offenses of sexual assault is admissible and may be considered.a.
in turn,rule balancing test permits courts to exclude otherwise admissible,relevant evidence if,inter alia,its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury.
we start with a few basics.rule,like its counterparts rules and,was enacted in as part of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of,stat,and became effective in,united states larson,cir.the drafters purpose was to supersede rule b prohibition on evidence of like conduct showing propensity in sexual assault cases.see united states meacham,cir weinstein berger,weinstein federal evidence,at to mclaughlin,ed.
after rules were enacted,the question arose whether evidence admissible under these rules was subject to rule balancing test for prejudicial,confusing,or misleading evidence.weinstein berger,supra,at.we agree with the conclusion,universal among the courts of appeals,that nothing in rule removes evidence admissible under that rule from rule scrutiny.see,doe smith,cir,abrogated on other grounds by grindle,cir seeley chase,cir sanders,cir see also united states guardia,f d,cir collecting cases applying rule to rules and weinstein berger,supra,at.the intent of the drafters was that evidence under rule be subject to rule.see larson,at.
questions have also been raised about whether rules change how courts perform the rule balancing tests.see weinstein berger,supra,at to describing circuit disagreement.that is primarily because evidence that rules make of similar sexual assaults by the well be the kind of inflammatory,unduly complex evidence courts often exclude under rule.see.wright graham,federal practice and procedure,at supp.
some appellate courts have imposed external,judicially crafted rules as to district judges consideration of evidence under rule.two circuits have required district courts to apply rule with careful attention to both the significant probative value and the strong prejudicial qualities of this evidence.seeley,at quoting guardia,at internal quotation marks omitted see also doe ex rel.glanzer,cir.others seemingly have instructed district courts to apply rule less stringently,at least in some cases,to avoid having rule swallow evidence congress clearly intended to make admissible,johnson elk lake sch,cir see also united states seymour,cir united states gabe,cir larson,at.several circuits have adopted factors district courts can or should consider to evaluate the admissibility of evidence under rules and,seeley,at johnson,at glanzer,at.and at least one has suggested that appellate courts should more carefully scrutinize district courts decisions under rules.see united states lemay,cir.
we reject these approaches and have no reason to adopt special rules constraining district courts usual exercise of discretion under rule when considering evidence under rule,see doe,at see also,united states dillon,cir united states julian,cir,which we will review under the ordinary standard,see dillon,at.
of course district courts must apply rule with awareness that rule reflects a congressional judgment to remove the propensity bar to admissibility of certain evidence.united states rogers,cir congress has said that it is not improper to draw the inference that the defendant committed this sexual offense because he has the propensity to do so.that awareness includes the fact that the rule analysis also applies.see.weinstein berger,supra a,at.nothing in the text of rules suggests these rules somehow change rule.see.making some propensity evidence merely admissible but not mentioning rule and indeed cautioning that these rules do not prevent consideration of evidence under any other rule.
as to the ruling at issue,martínez argues that the district court applied rule too stringently to testimony and should have accepted her testimony as evidence of a similar sexual assault under rule.though the court did not consider rule because martínez never argued this point,the court did accept that if there were two identical or similar instances of the same type of conduct,that evidence would be arguably relevant to show cui intent or absence of mistake or accident under rule b.but it ruled that there is a great danger of unfair prejudice or confusion here.the trial would be as much about as martinez.
the district court went on to explain why it was excluding this evidence under rule balancing test.the court noted it had the benefit of a highly developed evidentiary record in the dala and board of registration proceedings,an unusual situation.those proceedings revealed two reasons to exclude testimony as potentially unfairly prejudicial and,so,likely to confuse the issues or mislead the jury.
first,there were significant medical distinctions in the two treatment situations that would have required extensive explanation martínez was in an auto accident and whatever trauma she suffered,it was not in her vaginal or anal area.by contrast,had undergone surgery for crohn disease that basically removed her rectum and anus.her intestine was rerouted to a colostomy bag,and she had been suffering from substantial leakage of fecal matter and fluid into her vagina.cui had to perform a postoperative exam to ensure surgical incisions were not bleeding or infected,heavily sedated on morphine,claimed that she that she.cui insert his finger in her vagina.expert testimony established that she would have had a hard time differentiating what cui was touching,and in any event a vaginal exam would have been appropriate.
second,testimony would have required a minitrial,indeed something in the nature of a maxitrial,to probe the complexity of condition,including expert testimony.the record fully supports the district court evaluation of the underlying facts,which are in truth even more complicated than the recitation that the court gave.that,in turn,fully supports the court judgment that martínez case could get lost in the details of the maxitrial,which would have been unduly prejudicial and likely to confuse the issues and mislead the jury.see.
the exclusion of the rebuttal evidence from is even more easily resolved against martínez.the district court had allowed martínez counsel to elicit from cui,during,that cui had examined an unnamed patient perineum without a chaperone.the court could conclude that further testimony from would require going into a great deal of background that,we have already explained,was collateral to the issues at trial and likely to confuse the jury.
references to a prior proceeding and vouching 
martínez next argues that defense counsel prejudiced the jury by essentially revealing that cui had been previously cleared of misconduct.the district court suppressed references to the dala proceedings and the board decision not to discipline cui.but it allowed counsel to refer to a prior proceeding when appropriate.at trial defense counsel nevertheless elicited,without objection from martínez,that cui had not lost his license.
as we understand her brief,martínez argues that the combination of references to a prior proceeding and evidence that cui was still licensed told the jury exactly what the court had excluded that a prior proceeding had cleared cui of misconduct.because she did not object at trial to evidence of cui license status,martínez must show the district court committed plain error by admitting this evidence,which she can not.see united states,cir.
the court limiting instructions further ensured this evidence did not affect martínez substantial rights or undermine the fairness of the judicial process.see id.during trial the district court cautioned the jury that there were a number of pretrial proceedings in this case where witnesses made statements the nature of the proceedings is not important.the issue is whether a statement was made.and the jury instructions told the jury to base its verdict only on the testimony it had heard in that trial.
to the extent martínez tries to avoid her failure to object by arguing,on appeal,that references to a prior proceeding were inappropriate an argument she has preserved,this claim is meritless.the court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that allowing counsel to mention a prior proceeding was a sensible,neutral way for counsel to refer to the dala proceedings when appropriate,such as to impeach witnesses,without telling the jury what happened.
martínez additionally argues the defense prejudiced the jury by vouching for cui in opening when counsel told the jury,cui is here in your community.he is at your service,and i proud to represent him.we bypass whether martínez waived this objection.
in civil cases,to evaluate allegedly improper conduct by counsel,we examine the totality of the circumstances.aqueduct sewer auth.constructora lluch,cir.we consider the nature of the comments,their frequency,their possible relevancy to the real issues before the jury,the manner in which the parties treated the comments,the strength of the case,and the verdict itself.id.and we only reverse upon a showing of prejudice.id.there was more than adequate basis for the jury to reject martínez version of events.despite this comment.
tebo records and testimony rebutting those records 
martínez next argues that the district court should not have permitted the defense to her by using records from tebo office.tebo himself did not take the stand,but his records showed that martínez received treatment at tebo office eighteen times in starting two days after her ed visit.they were used to impeach martínez testimony that the alleged attack by cui left her unable to see male practitioners.
martínez argues this impeachment by contradiction was improper because the tebo records,used for the impeachment,were collateral.see united states lipscomb,cir.a topic is collateral if it is being introduced merely to contradict a witness and does not bear upon a substantive point at issue in trial.see broun,mccormick on evidence,at ed see also wright gold,federal practice procedure,at ed.
the district court could conclude in its discretion that tebo records should not have been excluded as collateral.the heart of martínez lawsuit was cui alleged sexual assault.her claim that she feared being treated by male practitioners went to both the credibility of her story and the extent of her damages.showing that martínez had visited tebo office eighteen times,including two days after the alleged assault,undermined these parts of martínez claim.
the district court also did not abuse its discretion excluding testimony from a tebo patient who had no knowledge of martínez treatment but would have testified that tebo often had other staff members treat patients.nor did it improperly exclude testimony from an expert that tebo care and was improper.the district court allowed martínez to testify that she did not see tebo.the testimony from these witnesses would not have enhanced her testimony the witnesses merely would have challenged tebo general practices,an issue collateral to those at trial.
b.the standard applies to claims that an executive official sexual assault violated the substantive due process clause 
martínez argues that the district court instructed the jury to apply the incorrect substantive rule to her claim that cui alleged sexual assault violated her substantive due process rights.we review her claim of legal error in the court jury instructions de novo.uphoff figueroa alejandro,cir.
the court instructed the jury that martínez had to prove that the behavior of the defendant was so egregious and so outrageous,that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.martínez asked the district court to say that cui conduct simply needs to violate a right of bodily integrity.on appeal,martínez says that she did not need to show that her allegations,if true,shock the conscience.martínez argues that the instructions should have required no further finding than that there was an invasion of her bodily integrity.
martínez is wrong,as the supreme court established in county of sacramento lewis,if not earlier.martínez argument relies on a reading of language in two older first circuit cases,brown hot,sexy safer productions,cir,and pittsley warish,cir,that parties could establish substantive due process claims either by showing the invasion of an identified right or by showing that an officer conduct shocks the conscience that reading of those cases is not good law,has been superseded by supreme court caselaw,and has been rejected,even before this case.depoutot raffaelly,cir.
lewis clarified that the test,first articulated in rochin california,governs all substantive due process claims based on executive,as opposed to legislative,action.at mongeau city of marlborough,cir coyne cronin,cir hasenfus lajeunesse,cir accord,willmar pub,indep.sch.dist,cir ellis ex rel.estate of ellis ogden city,cir chambers ex rel.chambers sch.dist.of philadelphia bd.of,cir wolf fauquier county bd.of supervisors,cir davis carter,cir benzman whitman,cir but see grindle,at.
lewis expressly rejected the notion,which brown assumed,that rights protected by the substantive due process clause as applied to executive actors are somehow separate from the test.lewis held that plaintiffs must show,not only that the official actions shock the conscience,but also that the official violated a right otherwise protected by the substantive due process clause.at estate of bennett wainwright,cir,abrogated on other grounds by maldonado fontanes,cir pagn caldern,cir rivera rhode island,cir see also,at chambers,at.
lewis justified this approach on theoretical and practical grounds.lewis explained that t he touchstone of due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government,at quoting wolff mcdonnell,alteration in original,and only the most egregious official conduct can be said to be arbitrary in the constitutional sense,id.at quoting collins harker heights.restricting substantive due process on executive official actions also prevents the fourteenth amendment from becoming a font of tort law.id.at quoting paul davis,internal quotation marks omitted.only behavior can be sufficiently arbitrary and egregious to be of constitutional significance.id.at.once plaintiffs have shown a constitutionally significant level of culpability,they then may turn to establishing that a protected right was offended.id.at see also washington glucksberg,outlining how to determine whether the substantive due process clause protects a proposed right 
lewis analysis flatly overrules the contrary language in brown and pittsley,see id.at,as this court has already recognized,depoutot,at.
the test is now an essential part of any substantive due process claim against a government
