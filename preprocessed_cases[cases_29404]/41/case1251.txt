ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review a decision of the alj to award black lung benefits to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence and is consistent with applicable law.youghiogheny ohio coal webb,cir.when the question is whether the alj reached the correct result after weighing conflicting medical evidence,our scope of review is exceedingly narrow.absent an error of law,findings of facts and conclusions flowing therefrom must be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.more than a mere scintilla,substantial evidence is that which a reasonable mind might accept as adequately supporting a conclusion.id.as long as the alj conclusion is supported by the evidence,we will not reverse,even if the facts permit an alternative conclusion.id.questions of law are reviewed de novo.peabody coal greer,cir.
we begin with a summary of the medical evidence in this case.between march,and june,several chest were performed on odom.these produced two positive readings for pneumoconiosis and ten negative readings prior to may,the date his initial claim was denied.after may,there were six positive readings and thirteen negative readings.
on may,valentino simpao diagnosed odom with coal workers pneumoconiosis and chronic bronchitis,related to his coal mine employment.simpao concluded that odom was moderately impaired and lacked the respiratory capacity to perform his usual coal mine employment.
on september,wallas bell,odom treating physician since the,reported that odom was totally disabled by coal workers pneumoconiosis.on november,sam traughber examined odom and diagnosed him with coal workers pneumoconiosis and cardiovascular disease.traughber stated that odom should have no further exposure to coal mine dust.
in addition to these doctors,odom was frequently seen by william houser,described below as odom treating physician since.houser is a pulmonary specialist,board certified in internal medicine and pulmonary disease.on june,houser diagnosed odom with chronic bronchitis secondary to coal mine employment and cigarette smoking possible coal workers pneumoconiosis history of bilateral kidney trauma and possible hypertension.the record contains a letter from houser to odom dated october,encouraging him to stop smoking.
in houser treatment notes,an august,report diagnosed odom with coal workers pneumoconiosis,chronic bronchitis,and moderately severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.in a letter dated november,houser noted recent and ct lung scan results showing nodular densities in the right lung,probably due to scarring.the letter stated that pneumoconiosis could be a contributing factor.on july,houser stated that he had treated odom for pneumoconiosis since.on february,houser stated his conclusion,based on pulmonary function studies,that odom pneumoconiosis was a significant factor contributing to his decrease in pulmonary function.
selby examined odom on june.selby observed that,while odom denied that he smoked,there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke about him.selby found evidence of smoker lung disease.odom chest was negative for pneumoconiosis,and selby found no evidence of pneumoconiosis or any disease or impairment induced by exposure to coal dust.selby stated that the decreases in odom pulmonary and respiratory functioning were consistent with the development of bronchial asthma,and that his coal mine employment was not a cause of any pulmonary or respiratory problems.
on august,fino,a pulmonary specialist,reviewed odom medical records.fino concluded that odom did not have an occupationally acquired pulmonary condition.fino based his findings on the following five factors the majority of the chest readings were negative for pneumoconiosis results of pulmonary function studies,which were generally normal when odom gave adequate effort elevated lung volumes consistent with obstructive lung disease but not with pneumoconiosis odom normal diffusion capacity and the absence of an impairment of oxygen transfer.
another pulmonary specialist,tuteur,reviewed odom medical records on august.tuteur found no evidence to support a diagnosis of significant pneumoconiosis.rather,he diagnosed odom with chronic bronchitis induced by cigarette smoke.tuteur noted that odom pulmonary problems began in may of,more than eight years after he had stopped working in a coal mine.tuteur opined that if odom had contracted pneumoconiosis from working in the mine,symptoms would have begun to appear within a few years of his cessation of mine employment.
a claimant seeking benefits after an initial denial must prove that he has suffered a material change in conditions following the denial of his first claim.d.to establish a material change in conditions,a claimant must prove,based on medical evidence of his condition since the initial denial,at least one of the elements previously adjudicated against him.see sharondale ross,cir.n o miner is entitled to benefits simply because his initial claim should have been granted.id.at.
judge neal found that odom had established a material change in conditions.citing houser report,she concluded that odom had established the presence of pneumoconiosis by newly submitted evidence.on appeal,peabody contends that judge neal erred in finding a material change in conditions.peabody first claims that judge neal misidentified the elements of entitlement adjudicated against odom in his initial claim.second,peabody claims that judge neal failed to analyze the new evidence to determine i
