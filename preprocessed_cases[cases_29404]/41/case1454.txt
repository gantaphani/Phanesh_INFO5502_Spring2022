kenneth keith filed a sixth application for disability insurance benefits dib under title ii of the social security act the act,in june of,alleging that he had been disabled under the act since march,due to his back problems and impairments.after a hearing,the administrative law judge alj determined that keith was not disabled at any time prior to his loss of insured status in,and denied his application.thereafter,he sought review,filing an action in the district court pursuant to g,alleging that he was entitled to a new hearing as his right to due process had been violated due to the alj bias against him.the district court dismissed his claim.we disagreed,holding that the alj overall actions raised the appearance of bias,reversed the decision and ordered that the case be remanded to the social security administration for further proceedings.
having received a second hearing before another administrative law judge,and after his application for benefits had been denied and his appeals exhausted,keith is once again before us alleging that the denial of his application was the product of the alj bias against him rather than based upon a proper consideration of the evidence.we affirm.
background 
keith,born in,contracted polio at the age of five,leaving him with a high arch deformity in his right foot.after completing high school,he was employed as a factory worker until he suffered a back injury on march,while lifting a lead weight from atop a foundry mold.approximately one month later,he was admitted to a hospital and diagnosed with a possible herniated disk combined with a moderate narrowing of the spinal canal.based on these findings,and the ineffectiveness of conservative treatments to alleviate his pain,keith underwent back surgery in may of despite the procedure,keith alleges that he continued to experience discomfort and was thus unable to return to work.he was last insured for purposes of dib under the act on september.
unable to return to his previous job,keith sought government assistance,filing four successive applications for social security benefits between and in connection with these applications,keith was examined by at least nine doctors,including specialists in the field of musculoskeletal injuries.while the examining physicians or surgeons reached differing opinions regarding the severity of his injuries,they all agreed that keith ability to stand,sit,bend,stoop,and lift objects was limited.in spite of these limitations and a diagnosis of arachnoiditis in,each of the aforementioned applications were denied because the respective administrative law judges found that keith back ailments did not prevent him from performing sedentary work 
undeterred,keith filed a fifth application,seeking both supplemental security income ssi benefits and dib,in.fortunately for keith,bonsett,a neurologist,testified at the administrative hearing that the combined effects of his back ailments and polio residual met or equaled disability listing c thus making keith eligible for benefits.based in part on bonsett testimony,the alj granted keith ssi claim on july,designating the date the application was,the disability onset date.keith accompanying claim for dib was heard and denied by a different alj.the administrative law judge there reasoned that because another alj had previously determined that keith was not disabled prior to his loss of insured status in,and no evidence had been submitted in contradiction to the most recent filings in the current application,the law of res judicata applied and barred consideration of his claim 
on june,keith filed his sixth application for benefits,again claiming disability as of march.after concluding that res judicata was once more applicable,the alj denied keith claim.the present appeals council agreed that the doctrine of res judicata barred keith claims and denied review.pursuing his only remaining course of appeal,keith filed an action pursuant to in federal district court.but before the trial judge could render a decision,the parties agreed to dismiss the action and remand the case to the social security administration for a decision on the merits of keith claims in light of the amendments to the act 
on remand from the federal court case to the social security administration,the case was heard by a different alj.despite having been directed to render a decision on the merits,he denied the application on the basis of res judicata.the appeals council promptly vacated the decision and again instructed the alj to consider the merits of keith claims.
in accordance with the council order,the alj conducted a hearing.during the course of the hearing,robert hutson,an orthopedic surgeon,testified that,based on his review of the medical evidence,keith failed to meet or equal a listing at any time following his back injury.
alj has he ever in your opinion based upon this medical record ever met or equalled sic any listing 
no,sir.i do believe even back when he had the surgery that there was some question whether he had objective findings at that time to indicate that this surgery be done.
hutson specifically disagreed with bonsett assessment that keith met listing c based on the cumulative effects of his back condition and polio residuals.to the contrary,hutson testified that keith lacked the significant motor loss with muscle weakness,sensory loss,and reflex loss necessary to satisfy the listing.moreover,hutson stated that there was insufficient medical evidence to conclude that keith had suffered any residual loss of function on account of his impairments.
following the hearing,the alj denied keith application,finding that his impairments did not meet or equal listing c,or prevent him from performing light work.in reaching these conclusions,the alj primarily relied upon the medical opinion of hutson,reasoning that his opinion was entitled to greater weight than that of bonsett because bonsett expertise was in the field of neurology and hutson expertise was in orthopedics.because the alj also determined that the finding of disability and the additional grant of ssi benefits were erroneous,he ordered the termination of the benefits.
because the appeals council found that the propriety of the previously awarded ssi benefits was not at issue,the council vacated the alj order terminating keith benefits.but,the council did affirm the denial of his application for dib.seeking further review,keith once again filed an action in the district court pursuant to g,in which he requested another hearing,alleging,inter alia,that the alj most recent decision was the result of bias.the district judge,after review,found that keith had failed to establish bias and thus the denial of benefits was proper keith appealed.
we concluded that the alj actions,including his initial denial of the application on res judicata grounds despite a directive from the appeals council to render a decision on the merits and his termination of keith ssi benefits,raised the appearance of partiality and demanded that the application be considered by a different alj.see our reasoning set forth in keith massanari,cir unpublished order.we reversed the district court decision and ordered the case remanded.
the alj decision on remand 
in accordance with our order,the district court did remand the case for a hearing before another alj.prior to the hearing,keith received notice that hutson,the physician who had testified at his prior hearing,had once again been designated as the medical expert and would provide testimony at the upcoming administrative hearing july.keith filed a written objection with the alj and asked that another medical expert be assigned,based on the ground that,according to keith,hutson was prejudiced against him and that the appellate court seventh circuit,in its prior decision,had also expressed concern over hutson testimony,attitude toward him,and general demeanor.after consideration,the alj denied the request for the reassignment of a new medical expert,noting that keith had failed to allege any facts that would support a claim of prejudice and further that he found no support for the claim that the appellate court was concerned with
