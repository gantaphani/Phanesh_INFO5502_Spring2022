rick camuglia appeals a summary judgment rejecting his claim that he was denied substantive and procedural due process when his restaurant was temporarily shut down for alleged health code violations.we have jurisdiction under and affirm.
background 
the evidence before the district court was as follows on february,guy worthington,an employee of the albuquerque environmental health department ehd,inspected paisano restaurant,owned by camuglia.worthington cited the restaurant for several violations,including cockroaches.camuglia told worthington that the insect problem would be immediately remedied,and invited him to return the next morning to reinspect the premises.
camuglia contacted glen waters of aaction pest control,who had applied pesticides regularly at paisano for some time.the following morning waters began applying uld,a pesticide that is approved for use in restaurants but can be hazardous to humans.the directions for use on the product label begin do not apply directly to food.food should be removed or covered during treatment.do not apply while food processing is underway.all food processing surfaces and equipment should be covered or washed with an effective cleaning compound followed by a potable water rinse.at.the directions also state close room or warehouse and shut off all ventilating systems do not remain in treated areas after application,and leave room closed for at least one hour.ventilate thoroughly before occupants are allowed to.id.
waters testified in his deposition that no ventilating systems were on and there was nobody in the restaurant when he began applying the uld that it was his practice to close all doors in a building before he began spraying and that he did not see any exposed food in paisano.he also testified that although the uld spray settled on areas and tables,paisano employees knew that it was their responsibility to wash everything after we left.that was a standing rule that we had always talked about,before we ever did anything in that restaurant by that time,they pretty much knew what the deal was.this was the first time i was there to do that kind of work.at.a nybody that i work with there,he continued,knew not to be in there when i was doing this they knew they could be in there for at least an hour.i told them two hours just to be on the safe side.id.he added that while he was spraying he did not see anyone in the restaurant until worthington entered.
worthington arrived after waters had begun applying the pesticide.his account contradicts waters account in several respects.he swore in an affidavit that 
the back door of the facility was wide open and people were freely entering and exiting the facility without regard for the presence of chemicals.no notice was posted of the fumigation.no effort had been made to cover food,food preparation areas,tables,or even the salt and pepper shakers.out of concern for public safety,i requested that all employees exit the restaurant and asked to see the warning label for the pesticide being used.
worthington concluded that the uld was not being applied in accordance with its warning label.he contacted his supervisor and together they decided to suspend paisano permit temporarily.see albuquerque,code of ordinances ch,a hereinafter albuquerque code it shall be unlawful for any person to operate a or food processing establishment within the city who does not possess a valid permit issued to him by the enforcement authority id.at c permits may be suspended by the enforcement authority for failure of the holder to comply with the requirements of the code or of other applicable laws,regulations or ordinances.he then returned to his office and prepared an inspection report which,in accordance with ehd policy,was faxed to local media outlets.see id.at c whenever an inspection of a establishment is made,the findings shall be recorded on an enforcement authority inspection form the completed inspection report form is a public document that shall be made available for public disclosure at the enforcement authority office to any person who requests it.as a result,members of the media came to paisano that day and reported on the suspension of paisano permit.the following day,february,worthington reinspected paisano and reactivated its permit after concluding that any food that had been exposed to the pesticide had been discarded and that the food preparation surfaces had been cleaned.
also on february,steve baca,an inspector for the new mexico department of agriculture,which has oversight responsibility for pesticide application,conducted an investigation to see whether the uld had been properly applied.his report repeats the essential facts set forth above worthington was concerned that the uld was not being properly applied it was paisano standard practice to wash all food preparation surfaces after application of the pesticide any uncovered food had already been thrown out and during past applications waters had discussed with paisano employees that they must remain outside during the application of the pesticide and clean the premises after application,but this was not discussed before this application.in addition,baca took three swab samples from within the restaurant.he testified in his deposition that pesticide was detected on the kitchen electric box and the salad area light fixture,but not on the specials board in the dining area.at.he did not test the areas that he was told had been cleaned,like food prep areas,dishes,and any areas close to the food.id.at.his inspection report states that he noted a violation because the operator should have clearly told worthington and the restaurant staff that nobody was allowed into the treated area for one hour.at.when asked at his deposition whether anyone had entered before one hour had expired,he responded that what it sounded like.no specific times were given,but it sounded like pesticide application was stopped,employees were showing up right around that time or soon after,that they were told to go in and clean up,and that was about it pretty much.id.at.he further testified that he believed that it was worthington who had directed the employees to go into the restaurant to clean,but faulted waters because he needed to make it clear that nobody be in there,id.
camuglia filed suit in the united states district court for the district of new mexico.his second amended complaint for deprivation of property without due process alleges three causes of action.the first,which is the only one at issue on appeal,raises a claim under that the city of albuquerque city,ehd,and worthington deprived him of due process of law.it asserts that the application of the pesticide was not improper,and that worthington acted without permitting plaintiff or its representatives to contest the alleged violations,something they had a right to do as a matter of law.at.it further asserts that worthington acts were intentional,willful and wanton and meant to deprive plaintiff of property rights id.at.in their motion for summary judgment the defendants treated this cause of action as alleging deprivations of both procedural and substantive due process.camuglia did the same in his response memorandum,and the district court also addressed both claims.we will therefore treat the complaint the same way.the second cause of action makes the same allegations against the same defendants under the due process clause of the new mexico constitution and the third cause of action is a libel claim against an ehd employee.the district court granted summary judgment on the state constitutional claim and the libel claim was dismissed by camuglia with prejudice.
worthington moved for summary judgment on the claims.he asserted that he was entitled to qualified immunity because there was no constitutional violation and,in the alternative,no violation of clearly settled law.the district court agreed on both grounds and granted the motion.
at a later hearing the city orally moved for summary judgment.camuglia conceded that t he case law is clear,if the underlying individual out,then the municipality is also out.at.shortly thereafter the district court granted summary judgment to the city apparently treating ehd and the city as the same party,a course we also take.camuglia appeals only the adverse judgments on the claims.
ii.discussion 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard the district court should apply under.c.hayes marriott,cir.ordinarily,the district court must view the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment and should grant summary judgment only when there is no genuine dispute over a material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.internal quotation marks omitted.this standard applies to the city motion for summary judgment.it is somewhat modified with respect to worthington,however,because he has asserted qualified immunity.we now turn to the claims against worthington,first explaining the effect of his assertion of qualified immunity.
claims against worthington 
qualified immunity 
under the doctrine,government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.t he affirmative defense of qualified immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.medina cram,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in contrast to a typical motion for summary judgment,which places the initial burden on the moving party,a motion based on a claim of qualified immunity imposes that burden on the plaintiff 
when a defendant asserts a qualified immunity defense,the burden shifts to the plaintiff,who must first establish that the defendant violated a constitutional right.if no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established,there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.if,on the other hand,a violation has been shown,the next step in the qualified immunity sequence is to ask whether the constitutional right was clearly established the relevant dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation.
cortez mccauley,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.thus,we now turn to whether camuglia has presented evidence that would establish the violation of a constitutional right.as noted,he claims violations of both procedural and substantive due process.we start with his claim.
procedural due process 
camuglia contended in district court that his rights were violated when worthington closed paisano and notified the media without providing camuglia with any level of process.at.the district court disagreed,determining that worthington actions were in accordance with albuquerque code ch,c,which states 
notwithstanding the other provisions of et,whenever the enforcement authority finds an imminent health hazard or other conditions in the operation of a or food processing establishment which,in his judgment,constitute a substantial hazard to the public health,he may without any prior warning,notice,or hearing,issue a written notice to the permit holder or operator citing such condition,specifying the corrective action to be taken,and specifying the time period within which action shall be taken and,if deemed necessary,such order shall state that the permit is immediately suspended and all or food processing operations are to be immediately discontinued.any person to whom such an order is issued shall comply immediately therewith.an opportunity for a hearing will be provided if a written request for a hearing is filed with the enforcement authority by the permit holder within five working days.the hearing shall be held within five working days after the date of the filing of the written request for the hearing.
emphasis added.camuglia conceded to the district court that this ordinance is constitutional.he argued,however,that worthington actions were not in accordance with the ordinance because there was no substantial hazard.the district court order rejected this argument 
camuglia disputes whether in fact there was a substantial hazard to the public.he does not,however,dispute that worthington,in his judgment,concluded there was a substantial hazard and decided suspending camuglia license was in the interest of public safety.the ordinance authorized worthington to use his discretion.a mere misapplication or violation of a city ordinance does not become a violation of federal due process rights.
camuglia city of albuquerque,d.the district court therefore held that camuglia was not deprived of procedural due process.although our analysis is somewhat different,we agree with the district court conclusion.
we engage in a inquiry in determining whether an individual rights were violated did the individual possess a protected property interest to which due process protection was applicable was the individual afforded an appropriate level of process clark city of draper,cir internal quotation marks omitted.on this appeal we are not concerned with the first step because worthington concedes that camuglia had a protected property interest.
as for the second step,ordinarily one who has a protected property interest is entitled to some sort of hearing before the government acts to impair that interest,although the hearing need not necessarily provide all,or even most,of the protections afforded by a trial.see mathews eldridge,d the type of hearing required depends on the nature of the private interest at stake the risk of erroneous deprivation given the procedures already guaranteed,and whether additional procedural safeguards would prove valuable and the government interest,and the burdens that additional procedures might impose.but due process is flexible and calls only for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.id.at.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.for example,w here the state must act quickly,a meaningful postdeprivation hearing is adequate.clark,at see also spielman hildebrand,cir removal of child from parents custody requires predeprivation hearing except for extraordinary situations where some valid governmental interest is at stake that justifies postponing the hearing until after the event.internal quotation marks omitted.
in matters of public health and safety,the supreme court has long recognized that the government must act quickly.quick action may turn out to be wrongful action,but due process requires only a postdeprivation opportunity to establish the error.in north american cold storage city of chicago,the supreme court rejected the argument that the city was required to have a hearing before seizing putrid poultry 
the general power of the state to legislate upon the subject embraced in the above ordinance of the city of chicago,counsel does not deny.nor does he deny the right to seize and destroy unwholesome or putrid food,provided that notice and opportunity to be heard be given the owner or custodian of the property before it is destroyed.we are of opinion,however,that provision for a hearing before seizure and condemnation and destruction of food which is unwholesome and unfit for use is not necessary.the right to so seize is based upon the right and duty of the state to protect and guard,as far as possible,the lives and health of its inhabitants,and that it is proper to provide that food which is unfit for human consumption should be summarily seized and destroyed to prevent the danger which would arise from eating it.the right to so seize and destroy is,of course,based upon the fact that the food is not fit to be eaten.food that is in such a condition,if kept for sale or in danger of being sold,is in itself a nuisance,and a nuisance of the most dangerous kind,involving,as it does,the health,if not the lives,of persons who may eat it.
internal citation omitted.this holding has been repeatedly reaffirmed.see,mackey montrym,d we have traditionally accorded the states great leeway in adopting summary procedures to protect public health and safety.st
