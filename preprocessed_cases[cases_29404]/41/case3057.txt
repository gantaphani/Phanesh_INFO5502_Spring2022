this patent infringement case deals with orthopedic devices for the treatment of fractures to the upper arm.defendants stryker,stryker sales,stryker orthopaedics,and howmedica osteonics collectively,stryker appeal from the final judgment of the united states district court for the district of oregon,following a jury trial,finding stryker liable to plaintiff acumed llc acumed for willful infringement of patent the patent.we affirm the district court findings of infringement and willfulness,but vacate the permanent injunction issued against stryker and remand for reconsideration in light of the supreme court decision in ebay mercexchange,llc,d.
background 
a.the technology and patent 
acumed is the assignee of the patent,which is directed to an orthopedic nail for the treatment of fractures in the humerus the upper arm bone which ends in the shoulder ball at top and the elbow joint at the bottom.in the most common form of fracture to this bone,the patient falls on top of his or her arm,breaking the shoulder ball the humeral cortex off from the longer part of the bone the humeral shaft.sometimes the humeral cortex itself breaks into two or three pieces as well.see patent.orthopedic surgeons use nails like the one disclosed in the patent to treat this type of fracture by excavating a hole through the humeral cortex and down the humeral shaft,inserting the nail into the hole,then fixing it in place using bone screws that pass through holes in the nail.this procedure secures the bone pieces of the cortex to each other and to the shaft.
claim of the patent contains every limitation disputed on appeal by the parties.it reads 
an elongated tapered nail for securing fractures of the proximal humerus comprising 
an elongated body having a curved shank configured to occupy an upper portion of the proximal humeral shaft,and a contiguous butt portion extending proximally from the shank and configured to occupy the humeral cortex 
the butt portion being shorter than the shank and defining a plurality of at least three transverse holes,each defining a hole axis,with the three hole axes angularly offset from each other,such that the holes may receive fasteners attached to fragments of the humeral cortex.

stryker dealings with opinion counsel 
on august,stryker german patent attorney,edo graalfs,wrote a letter to his american counterpart,raymond augustin,regarding the humeral nail stryker was in the process of developing.graalfs expressed concern that the stryker nail might infringe the patent 
t he independent claim of this patent has a relatively brought sic,broad scope of protection i advised that the nail must not be provided with a curvature as this is a feature of independent claim.now it turned out that for business reasons it would be a requirement to also use a curved shank.i expressed my doubts that it could be possible to find a structure not covered by the mentioned patent.
augustin then placed a memorandum to file dated december,in which he echoed graalfs concerns 
t he stryker trauma humeral nail would have each and every element of claim of the patent i t is our opinion that there is no strong invalidity argument which could be used against all the issued claims based on the prior art known at this time in conclusion,it is our opinion that a curved version of the stryker trauma humeral nail should not be marketed in the united states.
testimony at trial indicated that the stryker nail eventually sold in the united states did not differ in any relevant respect from the design specifications reviewed by graalfs and augustin in writing these letters.
after his initial memorandum to file,augustin drafted a formal opinion of counsel letter and transmitted it to stryker on november.this opinion letter was longer and more detailed than the earlier memo to file.in it,augustin claim construction arguments basically identical to those made by stryker during this the stryker nail would not infringe any claim of the patent either literally or by equivalents.he also expressed a belief that claim of the patent was invalid due to anticipation by an earlier stryker product 
at trial,acumed presented evidence tending to show that stryker did not seriously rely upon the later opinion letter from augustin.for instance,stryker filed with the fda its application for the accused device on august,some months before augustin transmitted the favorable opinion letter.gregory plakson,stryker director of intellectual property,testified at his deposition that he did not understand portions of the opinion letter and did not ask augustin anything about the opinion.acumed also presented evidence tending to show copying by stryker,including that a stryker consultant confiscated from an operating room a chart detailing the assembly and insertion of acumed product.
litigation background 
stryker began to sell its accused humeral nail in the united states in early.in april,acumed filed suit against stryker in the district of oregon,alleging infringement of claims,and of the patent.following a markman hearing,the district court construed the disputed terms.it defined curved shank as a shank that has a bend or deviation from a straight line without sharp corners or sharp angles and transverse holes as holes across the butt portion of the nail.it also found that 
the term angularly offset from each other means the axes of the three holes are spaced apart from each other,an angle is formed by the axes of any two such holes when viewed in two dimensions from the butt end or from the side,and the axes are not aligned in a parallel orientation.
acumed llc stryker,order on claim construction.the case proceeded to jury trial on infringement,willfulness,and invalidity.the jury found that the asserted claims were valid,that stryker product literally infringed those claims,and that stryker infringement was willful.the district court denied stryker motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and awarded acumed enhanced damages for willful infringement,increasing the damages found by the jury by fifty percent.it permanently enjoined stryker from selling the accused device in the united states.
stryker appeals the jury verdict of infringement and willfulness and the district court grant of injunctive relief.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a.

claim construction and infringement 
curved shank 
the main dispute between the parties on construction relates to the claim requirement of a curved shank,construed by the district court to mean a shank that has a bend or deviation from a straight line without sharp corners or sharp angles.stryker challenges that interpretation,arguing that the better reading of the term is a nonangular continuous bend.
when construing claims,a court must begin by look ing to the words of the claims themselves to define the scope of the patented invention.phillips awh,en banc quoting vitronics conceptronic.the task of comprehending those words is not always a difficult one.in some cases,the ordinary meaning of claim language as understood by a person of skill in the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges,and claim construction in such cases involves little more than the application of the widely accepted meaning of commonly understood words.id.at.c urved,as it is used in the patent,is not a term that ha s a particular meaning in a field of art.id.its ordinary meaning encompasses curvature made up of small discontinuities.consider,for instance,an archway made from rectangular bricks.the bricks are at angles with respect to each other,but the overall effect is to describe an arc.it would be unreasonable to say that such an archway is not curved.if the word curved is given its ordinary,lay meaning,the district court construction is correct.
stryker argues that curved is implicitly assigned a different,narrower meaning by virtue of the context in the written description in which it appears.see id.at t he specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim term by the patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess.in such cases,the inventor lexicography governs.that argument is based on a particular manner of implanting the nail disclosed and touted by the written description.the patent summary of the invention section states that t he curved tapered shape of the present invention permits it to be inserted into a cavity formed by a broach tool having the same shape as the nail.patent.a broach tool is essentially a rasp having the same profile as the hole it is intended to form.id.the patent teaches that broaching is advantageous,since,inter alia,it generally causes less tissue damage than a rotating drill bit or reamer.id.however,b roaching is only suitable for certain shapes of holes and objects in particular,it is useful only for an object that largely pass es through its own envelope.id.objects with angled bends or small radius curves relative to the object length do not pass through their own envelope on insertion,and are not well suited to insertion into a broached hole.id.
stryker argument is essentially an assertion that since the patent says broaching is desirable,the term curved must be construed to cover only embodiments whose curvature allows them to be inserted into a broached hole,excluding angled bends or small radius curves.that assertion is flawed it is an attempt to import a feature from a preferred embodiment into the claims.see phillips,at a lthough the specification often describes very specific embodiments of the invention,we have repeatedly warned against confining the claims to those embodiments.neither use with a broaching tool nor suitability for such use is claimed.indeed,the application which led to the patent originally included claims to the method of implanting the nail with a broaching tool,but the patentee elected to withdraw those claims from the application after the examiner noted they were directed to a separate,distinct invention.
the fact that usability with a broaching tool is merely a feature of a preferred embodiment provides sufficient grounds for refusing to read curved narrowly.we also note,though,that the patent claim not asserted by acumed in this case covers t he nail of claim having a profile that substantially passes within its own envelope.patent.t he presence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation raises a presumption that the limitation in question is not found in the independent claim.medrad,see also wengner,coating mach,comark,at tandon int l trade comm n.that presumption is especially strong when the limitation in dispute is the only meaningful difference between an independent and dependent claim,and one party is urging that the limitation in the dependent claim should be read into the independent claim.sunrace roots enter.sram,see also ecolab paraclipse,wengner,at claim differentiation is clearly applicable when there is a dispute over whether a limitation found in a dependent claim should be read into an independent claim,and that limitation is the only meaningful difference between the two claims.if we were to give curved in claim the meaning which stryker advances,claim would cover only nails that substantially pass within their own envelope s.such a restrictive reading would render claims and identical in scope.since independent claims are presumed to have broader scope than their dependents,the presumption is that claim should not be limited in the manner stryker urges.for the reasons discussed above,that presumption has not been rebutted.
stryker also argues that the district court exclusion of sharp corners or sharp angles renders the construction insufficiently definite,since the court did not specify precisely how sharp is too sharp.however,a sound claim construction need not always purge every shred of ambiguity.the resolution of some easy ones like this properly left to the trier of fact.see ppg indus.guardian indus,a fter the court has defined the claim with whatever specificity and precision is warranted by the language of the claim and the evidence bearing on the proper construction,the task of determining whether the construed claim reads on the accused product is for the finder of fact.modine int l trade comm n,whether claim limitation requiring diameter of about inch embodied held a matter of technologic fact see also abbott labs.baxter pharm,where result is the same under any reasonable construction,we need not construe the disputed phrase with numerical exactitude.here,the accused product has a angle in its shaft.a reasonable jury could have found that in the context of this sort of nail,a rounded bend of six degrees was not a sharp angle.the jury conclusion is bolstered by the testimony of stryker own technical expert,who noted in reference to the stryker nail that there no sharp angle there.there may be some area of imprecision within the district court without sharp angles construction,but this accused product is in no danger of falling within that area.the construction is correct,and the jury finding that the stryker nail possesses a curved shank is supported by substantial evidence.
transverse holes 
the district court defined transverse holes as holes across the butt portion of the nail.stryker argues that this claim term should be limited to holes that are perpendicular to the nail shaft,excluding from the claim scope holes that are tilted so that one end of the hole is vertically offset from the other end.again,this argument is an improper attempt to read a feature of the preferred embodiment into the claims as a limitation.
stryker argument for a narrow reading of transverse stems from the fact that e very description of the transverse holes in the patent contemplates a perpendicular hole.this is a correct characterization of the patent every figure which illustrates the holes shows them going perpendicularly through the shaft,and the written description characterizes the holes in figure as perpendicular to the portion of the nail axis at the butt portion of the nail.patent.however,figure and the text characterizing it simply discloses a single,preferred embodiment of the invention.a lthough the specification often describes very specific embodiments of the invention,we have repeatedly warned against confining the claims to those embodiments.phillips,at see also comark,at.
the plain meaning of claim covers more than the particular embodiment shown in the figures.while the disclosed embodiment possesses perpendicular holes,the claim language covers all transverse word that does not necessarily imply right angles.moreover,the patentees description of their preferred embodiment itself implies a difference between the words perpendicular and transverse.the written description states that figure illustrates a plurality of transverse holes,each of which is perpendicular to the portion of the nail axis at the butt portion of the nail.patent.this implies that a transverse hole need not be perpendicular if it were,the patentee would not have needed to clarify that these holes,in addition to being transverse,were perpendicular to the nail axis.just as in phillips,where the asserted claim mentioned steel baffles and hence strongly implie d that the term baffles does not inherently mean objects made of steel,at,this usage of language is strong evidence that the patentee considered transverse and perpendicular to have distinctly different meanings.
the intrinsic evidence of the specification therefore suggests that the patentees knew how to restrict their claim coverage to holes passing through at right angles.they could have used the word perpendicular,as they did in discussing their preferred embodiment.instead,they chose a different term that implies a broader scope.the intrinsic evidence does not indicate that one of skill in the art would believe the patentees meant perpendicular when they said transverse.there is very little indication that the patentees considered perpendicularlity important to their invention.the patentees tout the virtue of their preferred hole orientation only once,noting that t he predictability of fracture modes makes the orientation of holes in the illustrated embodiment suitable in most cases.patent emphasis added.far from demonstrating that the patentee s intend ed for the claims and the embodiments in the specification to be strictly coextensive with respect to this limitation,phillips,at,this statement admits that the disclosed perpendicular hole orientation may not always be ideal.see patent suggesting that,if holes are not ideally situated,the surgeon may slightly rotate the nail to achieve a more favorable alignment.nowhere in the specification or the prosecution history do the patentees criticize or distinguish tilted,holes.
the dissent states that the specification language which discloses only perpendicular holes should be determinative of the claim scope.in particular,it points to three instances in the written description where transverse holes are described as perpendicular.dissent at citing patent.all three of these instances appear in a textual description of the patent figure,indicating that the holes depicted in that figure are perpendicular to the nail axis.thus,while the dissent emphasizes the fact that there are three references to perpendicular holes in the specification,its argument is ultimately premised on characteristics which the patentee has attributed to a single preferred embodiment.in the context of this patent,such an argument must be contradicted by our repeated statements that limitations from the specification are not to be read into the claims.comark,at see also id.at t he language that the defendant argues should limit claim is clearly found in the patent description of the preferred embodiment.it is precisely against this type of claim construction that our prior case law counsels.
by highlighting the specification phrase each of which is defined and by describing that phrase as important,dissent at,the dissent appears to suggest that the patentee has in some sense imposed a limiting definition upon the word transverse.but the use of the word defined here does not imply a lexicographic definition,especially not a definition of transverse to mean perpendicular.instead,the statement that the holes of the cited embodiment are defined on an axis merely introduces the useful abstract concept of a hole axis,later employed in the claims to describe the orientation of the holes with respect to each other.see patent,claim,the three hole axes are angularly offset from each other.the claims repeatedly echo this form of usage of the word define.see,patent claim,the butt portion defining a plurality of at least three transverse holes,each defining a hole axis emphasis added claim,the curved shank includes a curved portion defining a curved central axis claim,the butt portion defines a central axis.if the word define were always to be an important signifier of limitation,this claim language would indicate that the butt portion has been defined to be transverse holes,that those holes in turn have been defined as hole axes,and that the curved portion and butt parts of the each been dubbed identical to an imaginary central axis.these interpretations are incorrect,but they are the natural consequence of finding a restrictive definition of a term anywhere the word define might appear in this patent,regardless of context.the specification does not define transverse and perpendicular to be coequal in meaning.
the fact that the term transverse has a broader scope than perpendicular also distinguishes this case from nystrom trex,relied upon by the dissent.see dissent at.in nystrom,both parties acknowledge d the ordinary meaning of board as a piece of sawed lumber,but the patentee sought to have that claim term broaden ed to encompass relatively obscure definitions that are not supported by the written description or prosecution history.id.at.we refused to impose a construction broader than the term ordinary meaning.id.at.here,on the contrary,we decline to impose a construction narrower than the term ordinary meaning.
the dissent cites to other patents whose usage of transverse arguably supports its conclusion.dissent at.one of them,patent,is purely extrinsic evidence and therefore merits little consideration.see phillips,at.the other,patent,is cited by the patent and is part of the intrinsic record.however,it was not created by the patentee in attempting to explain and obtain the patent.id.its usage is not that of this patentee,and so it also merits less weight than the evidence of the patentee own words.while these patents merit some consideration,the specification and claims of the patent itself should be given significantly greater weight.id.noting that prosecution evidence is less useful for claim construction purposes.
a proper reading of the intrinsic evidence indicates that where the patentees discussed the perpendicular holes of their preferred embodiment,they were not narrowly defining the term transverse or otherwise limiting the claims,but merely discharging their statutory duties to teach and enable those of skill in the art to make and use the invention and to provide a best mode for doing so.phillips,at.that preferred embodiment can not be the only product covered by the claims if it were,the claims themselves would be unnecessary.the district court construction of transverse holes is correct 
angularly offset 
as noted above,the district court interpreted the claim requirement that the hole axes be angularly offset to mean that the axes of the three holes are spaced apart from each other,an angle is formed by the axes of any two such holes when viewed in two dimensions from the butt end or from the side,and the axes are not aligned in a parallel orientation.neither party challenges this definition on appeal,but stryker argues that its accused product does not fall within the definition.
stryker argument is geometrical in nature.a hole axis under the district court definition is the imaginary line that passes through the center of one of the transverse holes.stryker correctly points out that the axes thus defined by the accused product form skew lines which are neither parallel nor intersecting in space.since those lines neither form angles nor run parallel with each other,stryker suggests that its product falls outside the district court definition.however,this argument ignores an essential part of that definition,which states that an angle is formed when the hole axes are viewed in two dimensions.the district court meaning here is clear the hole axes need not actually intersect.it suffices that the axes appear to intersect in two dimensions.as an example,if the hole axes are sketched on a piece of paper a view of the nail and the lines of that drawing intersect,the product drawn meets the district court definition of angularly offset.it is totally clear that the hole axes of stryker product intersect when drawn on paper,a point well illustrated by stryker own diagram in support of its argument on this point 
this diagram,which represents the accused product,shows intersecting hole axes when viewed in two dimensions.the jury finding that stryker product embodies the angularly offset claim limitation is therefore supported by substantial evidence.
conclusion 
since the district court claim construction is correct and there is substantial evidence to support the jury finding that stryker product embodies each claim limitation at issue,the judgment of infringement is affirmed.
willful infringement 
the jury found stryker infringement to be willful,despite the fact that stryker admitted into evidence the november,opinion letter from augustin which concluded that stryker product would not infringe.favorable opinions of counsel normally present a defense to willfulness,but the protection they afford is not absolute.those cases where willful infringement is found despite the presence of an opinion of counsel generally involve situations where opinion of counsel was either ignored or found to be incompetent.read portec.
willfulness is not an trait,but one of degree.comark,at quoting kelley.whether an infringer ignored the opinion of its counsel is,as part of the willfulness inquiry,also a question of degree.evidence of the extent of that ignorance should be weighed by the factfinder together with the totality of the other circumstances surrounding the infringer culpability.see comark,at evaluating opinion of counsel within a totality of the circumstances.
here,substantial evidence supports a finding that stryker ignored the november opinion letter to an extent sufficient to permit willfulness to be found in these circumstances.most notable is the fact that two patent attorneys,graalfs and augustin,had at first strongly discouraged stryker from marketing the infringing nail in the united states.despite that advice,stryker continued to push towards a united states market entry,filing its fda application months before it received augustin revised legal advice.additionally,acumed presented evidence that stryker copied its product,including that stryker arranged to confiscate a hospital room chart instructing doctors in the use of the acumed nail.
there is evidence in the record tending against willfulness,such as the augustin opinion letter itself and the testimony of stryker director of intellectual property that he ordered no sales be made in the united states until after the favorable opinion letter.however,it is for the jury,not this court,to determine the weight and credibility to be given to the evidence.see comark,at court determining whether to overturn a jury verdict is not required to assume that the jury believed all or indeed any exculpatory evidence.the jury here was free to disbelieve or weigh lightly evidence tending to show stryker reliance on the opinion letter and to place that evidence within the overall factual context of the case.
substantial evidence supports the jury finding that stryker infringement was willful.the judgment of willfulness is therefore affirmed.
permanent injunction 
in ruling on the plaintiffs motion for a permanent injunction,the district court applied the general rule in patent cases that an injunction will issue,once infringement and validity have been adjudged unless there are some exceptional circumstances that justify denying injunctive relief.transcript of record at,acumed,llc stryker,no.oregon.the supreme court has since struck down that general rule in ebay mercexchange,making clear that the traditional test for injunctions applies to patent cases.at.
acumed argues that the facts found by the district court can serve as independent support for the injunction,even without application of the old general rule.this court can not express a position on that argument.if we were to weigh the evidence ourselves to reach a conclusion on injunctive relief,we would effectively be exercising our own discretion as if we were the court of equity.that role belongs exclusively to the district court.our task is solely to review the district court decisions for an abuse of discretion.see ebay.at the decision to grant or deny permanent injunctive relief is an act of equitable discretion by the district court,reviewable on appeal for abuse of discretion.accordingly,the permanent injunction is vacated.on remand,the district court should reconsider the test as propounded by the supreme court decision in ebay as to whether or not an injunction should issue.
iii.conclusion 
the district court claim construction and its findings of infringement and willfulness are affirmed.the permanent injunction is vacated and remanded.
and remanded 
i agree with the majority holding in all respects save one.i write separately to voice my disagreement with the majority holding that the district court properly construed transverse holes in claim of the patent to mean holes across the butt portion of the nail.because the majority concludes that the district court claim construction was proper,it affirms the court finding of literal infringement.from that decision,i respectfully dissent.
at the outset,i note that i am troubled by the district court clear reliance on a common english language dictionary,which was published ten years after the patent issued to construe the term transverse holes.during the claim construction hearing,the court explained that the dictionary would be an aid to our work.the court not only used the dictionary as an aid,but actually utilized the dictionary definitions as the starting point when defining each of the disputed claim terms moreover,the court seemed to disregard the briefs in favor of attorney argument during claim construction.in fact,when stryker argued that acumed attorneys were changing their claim construction during the course of the hearing,the district court responded let not worry about changing.i going to keep you all focused right on the task at hand.i do care what happened before today.i care what going on here.after hearing arguments from the parties regarding the disputed claim terms and on the appropriateness of the dictionary definitions,the district court resolved each issue orally during the hearing.one week later,the court issued a formal order on claim construction that simply reiterated the court oral rulings.acumed llc stryker.
while i acknowledge that there are not formal requirements for a district court methodologies when conducting claim construction hearings and issuing related orders,i raise this concern because i believe the district court methodology led it astray from determining the the meaning that the term transverse holes would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in the context of the entire patent,including the specification.phillips awh,en banc.when one properly begins this claim construction inquiry with the intrinsic evidence,rather than dictionary definitions,it is evident that the district court construction of transverse holes is in error.
with respect to the claim term transverse holes,the district court utilized the dictionary to first determine that a hole is an opening through something.the district court then referred to the dictionary and found two definitions for the term transverse acting,lying,or being across set crosswise made at right angles to the axis of the body.the district court concluded that we should construe the claim term in accordance with the broader of the two dictionary definitions because there is no express disavowal of claim scope in the specification.this approach was specifically rejected by this court sitting en banc in phillips,at,and we have continued to reject this approach to claim construction.see on demand mach.ingram.
in accordance with phillips,the interpretive inquiry should begin not with a dictionary definition,but with the patent itself,to ascertain what an ordinarily skilled artisan reading the patent would understand the claim term to mean.phillips,at.the intrinsic evidence provides no support for the broader of the two dictionary definitions set forth above,that transverse means acting,lying,or being across set crosswise,but fully supports the narrower definition,that transverse means made at right angles to the axis of the body.each of the eight transverse holes described in the specification are specifically described as being perpendicular.id.at describing a plurality of transverse holes,each of which is defined on a respective axis intersecting the nail axis,and perpendicular to the portion of the nail axis at the butt portion of the nail transverse hole is oriented perpendicular to the nail axis the distal holes are perpendicular to the butt end portion of the nail axis emphases added.the majority suggests that the use of both words implies a difference between the words perpendicular and transverse.op.at.the majority contends that if transverse was meant to be construed as perpendicular,the patentee would not have needed to clarify that these holes,in addition to being transverse,were perpendicular to the nail axis.id.i disagree.first,the patentee used the two words to clearly specify which of the definitions of transverse applied to his invention the purpose of using the word perpendicular was to further describe what the inventor meant by the term transverse,not to distinguish it as the majority suggests.second,to say that something is perpendicular also requires mention of a reference plane or line to which the object is located at a right angle.here,the patent specification limits the discussion of transverse holes to holes having an axis perpendicular with respect to the nail axis at the butt portion.patent.that was the point of using the word perpendicular in the specification.thus,by utilizing the word transverse,the patentee did not need to repeat in the claim that each hole was perpendicular to the nail axis at the butt portion.
the specification describes three sets of transverse holes.id.at.with reference to figures and of the patent,reproduced below,the first set includes four proximal transverse holes,the second set is one intermediate transverse hole,and the third set includes three distal transverse holes.each of these eight holes is then described and shown in the accompanying figures as being perpendicular to the nail axis.id.at.most importantly,the specification states that a plurality of transverse holes each of which is defined on a respective axis intersecting the nail axis,and perpendicular to the portion of the nail axis at the butt portion of the nail.id.at emphases added.thus,the specification limits each of the transverse holes by the common characteristic that each has an axis perpendicular to the nail axis at the butt portion.
there is not a single,transverse hole shown or described in the patent.construing transverse to include something other than spite of the repeated,narrow usage of that term in the provide patent coverage that is broader than what the inventor actually invented and disclosed in his specification,which clearly should have been the starting point for claim construction.smith snow,stating if the claim were fairly susceptible of two constructions,that should be adopted which will secure to the patentee his actual invention.since phillips,we have repeatedly rejected the concept of construing claim terms to have meanings broader than the meaning derived from the intrinsic evidence.for example,in nystrom trex,this court stated 
i n the absence of something in the written description prosecution history to provide explicit or implicit notice to the,those of ordinary skill in the the inventor intended a disputed term to cover more than the ordinary and customary meaning revealed by the context of the intrinsic record,it is improper to read the term to encompass a broader definition simply because it may be found in a dictionary,treatise,or other extrinsic source.

patent scope should be coextensive with what the inventor invented as evidenced by what is disclosed in the patent specification.netword,llc centraal,stating that the claims should not enlarge what is patented beyond what the inventor has described as the invention renishaw plc marposs societa per azioni,the construction that stays true to the claim language and most naturally aligns with the patent description of the invention will be,in the end,the correct construction.thus,where,as here,the intrinsic evidence clearly provides one meaning for the term transverse,it is inappropriate to give that term a broader interpretation,particularly where the only support for the broader interpretation is extrinsic this case,a dictionary which supports the narrower construction as well.
moreover,the district court interpretation of hole,which neither party is challenging,makes the majority interpretation of transverse redundant and nonsensical.the court found that the word holes in the phrase defining a plurality of at least three transverse holes,means openings through the butt portion of the nail.claim construction order,at.this makes sense in the context of orthopedic implants,because a hole is necessarily through the part,which in the case of an intramedullary nail is to accept a screw.here,the majority definition of transverse as being across is redundant when read together with the definition of holes.it makes the phrase transverse holes mean openings through across the butt portion of the nail.the majority claim construction thus impermissibly renders the claim term transverse meaningless,a methodology that this court has repeatedly denounced.merck teva pharms.usa,a claim construction that gives meaning to all the terms of the claim is preferred over one that does not do so.see also bicon,straumann,cross med,medtronic sofamor danek.only if transverse requires perpendicularity does each claim term have a distinct meaning 
that transverse means perpendicular in direction is further supported by other intrinsic evidence,namely,other patent references cited during prosecution of the patent.for example,patent,entitled bone nail,discloses a pair of holes passing through the nail in transverse relation to its longitudinal direction and both axes of the said both pairs of holes being located in different planes extending in transverse direction relative to the longitudinal direction of the nail.patent,abstract.the first hole is defined by the nail entrance and exit.the second distal hole is defined by the nail entrance and exit.as shown in figures and,both of these holes are perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the nail at the distal portion.the hole axes are similarly described as being located in a plane normally extending relative to the longitudinal axis of the nail.patent.thus,the usage of transverse in the patent is consistent with the definition requiring perpendicularity.
the narrower definition of transverse is also more consistent with extrinsic evidence that demonstrates how those skilled in the art would understand the term.first,in another patent application filed within a year of the issue date of the patent,the patent inventor,randall huebner,uses the word transverse in a way that clearly denotes perpendicularity in direction.there,as here,huebner describes a transverse hole extending through a shaft,stating the head of the shaft includes a hole extending therethrough in a direction generally transverse to the axis of the shaft.patent,filed,see also id.at describing another hole as formed through head with a central axis generally transverse to elongate axis of shaft.huebner use of transverse in that application clearly shows a directional requirement implicit in the term transverse that is not encompassed in the broader definition accepted by the majority.next,although the district court chose to rely exclusively on a general dictionary that was not contemporaneous with the patent,technical dictionaries,including one highly relevant to the field of orthopedic implants at the time the patent issued,define transverse as referr
