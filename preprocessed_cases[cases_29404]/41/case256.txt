francis carroll brought suit against,inter alia,his former employer,xerox corporation,alleging disability discrimination in violation of the americans with disabilities act ada,and the massachusetts statute.laws ch,and various state common law claims.the district court dismissed the common law claims and subsequently allowed xerox motion for summary judgment on the remaining disability discrimination claims.on appeal,carroll challenges both rulings.we affirm.
carroll began working at xerox in.after holding various positions there,he assumed his first sales position with xerox in.in,carroll transferred to a sales position in xerox boston office and began reporting to john,the district manager of the boston office.in march,was promoted to,general manager of the new england customer business unit cbu,and carroll began reporting directly to joseph profeta,the new manager of sales operations.
while reporting to profeta,carroll served as an agent channel manager acm.in this role,he managed independent sales agents who sold xerox equipment to smaller accounts.as an acm,carroll managed the sales of his agents,trained his agents and answered their questions,tracked his agents progress on revenue and units sold to ensure that sales targets were met,and communicated with his agents,supervisors and colleagues through and other means.
in,xerox eliminated a number of cbu positions,including one of the four acm positions and many support personnel,as part of a.at various times throughout,carroll had a,and then a,administrative support person reporting to him.when both of these administrative support personnel made job changes for personal reasons,they were not replaced due to the personnel reduction taking place in the cbu.
in early,carroll received his sales targets for that year and learned that his target objectives had increased from the previous year.although these large increases were partly the result of the typical increases that occurred every year,they were also the result of a change in the methodology used to generate the performance objectives from to.on or about april,plaintiff began falling behind in meeting his sales targets for that year.at about this time,he complained to profeta about his workload and the job pressure.
on april,carroll went to his primary care physician,eric reines,for a physical.reines found that carroll had a mild leaking from two valves of his heart,which reines saw frequently in healthy patients.based upon these results,reines only concern was preventing an infection called endocarditis,and he accordingly instructed carroll to take antibiotics prior to any dental work.
in july,carroll complained to in a meeting about his workload.in this conversation,carroll requested that xerox allow him to take an early retirement.although supported carroll in his request for early retirement,that request was denied on the ground that carroll position did not fall within the eligibility criteria for the early retirement program.
on september,carroll went to urgent care,complaining of chest pains.after a number of an electrocardiogram and a stress.reines concluded that it was unlikely that carroll had coronary artery or heart disease.to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,reines concluded that the chest pain was related to stress and that the pain resulted from a muscle spasm in the esophagus.reines concluded that,albeit painful,the condition has no medical repercussions and no bearing upon a patient heart condition.
at carroll request,reines wrote a letter addressed to whom it may concern which stated 
carroll chest pains probably are not due to coronary artery disease but probably are stress related carroll has reported extreme work stress which is the likely cause of the chest pain and in men is a very common cause of hypertension and hypertensive response to exercise.
as a result of this condition,carroll took disability leave from september to december.other than a restriction,there were no other restrictions placed on carroll activities during the leave period.in the fall of,psychologist joseph patalano treated carroll for mental health issues.patalano saw carroll twice a month,and had phone contact with him twice a month.while carroll was out on disability leave,one of the other acms,richard jarry,successfully covered carroll territory in addition to his own and the territory of one of the acms who was terminated in the.
in late november or early december,while out on leave,carroll informed profeta that he would be interested in exploring a transfer to a position with xerox in houston,texas,where much of his family lived.carroll had worked for xerox in texas for several years prior to assuming his post in boston.profeta told him that he would help him with his transfer request.
with patalano approval,carroll returned to work at xerox on december.his doctors did not communicate to xerox any restrictions on his ability to work.on his first day back to work following his leave,carroll interviewed for a sales representative position at the xerox office in houston profeta arranged for xerox to cover carroll travel expenses.carroll made no reference in his houston interview to a medical condition that interfered with his ability to work,nor did he ask for any restrictions on his work or for any accommodations for any medical condition.
the interview apparently went well.that evening,xerox offered carroll a sales representative position in the houston cbu at the highest salary for the grade corresponding to that position.that salary was lower than the salary he was receiving as an acm.
carroll telephoned profeta from houston to inform him that the sales representative position offered to him in houston was a position on a lower level than his position as a sales manager.profeta checked with human resources and learned that xerox policy required that carroll salary be adjusted to the maximum of the range for the new position which was a,position.nevertheless,when profeta asked him whether he still wanted the transfer,carroll reiterated his desire to transfer to houston,notwithstanding the salary reduction.accordingly,he signed xerox offer letter,agreeing to assume the sales representative position in houston at the lower salary,as stated in the letter.carroll continued to work in the houston cbu as a sales representative for over two years until he voluntarily retired on may.carroll did not request any accommodation or reduced workload in houston,except for a short disability leave for a back injury unrelated to his stress condition in.
in may,carroll filed a disability discrimination charge against xerox with the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.he subsequently filed a complaint in federal court against xerox,and and profeta individually,alleging disability discrimination under federal and state law.in essence,carroll premised his claim on allegations that xerox failed to reasonably accommodate his disability by either a reducing his workload in boston or b transferring him to the sales representative position in houston at the same salary he had in boston and xerox discriminated against him because of his disability in denying his request for early retirement.
in addition,carroll brought against defendants various state common law claims of breach of estoppel,fraud and misrepresentation,and civil conspiracy.shortly thereafter,carroll filed an amended complaint which effectively dismissed his disability discrimination claims against the two individual defendants,and profeta.the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the common law claims in their entirety,leaving xerox as the only remaining defendant in the case.xerox then moved for summary judgment on the disability discrimination claims.ruling from the bench,the district court granted that motion on grounds that carroll failed to satisfy the statutory elements of such claims.specifically,the court held that carroll failed to demonstrate,inter alia,a showing of discriminatory intent on the part of xerox and that he was a qualified individual with a disability under the relevant statutes.the court also found that the record failed to show that carroll ever made a request for a reasonable accommodation.with respect to carroll showing of disability,the court stated in its separate supplemental written order 
carroll failed to show that he was precluded by his impairment from a substantial class of jobs or a broad range of jobs.instead,the evidence presented by the plaintiff tended to show only that he was precluded from performing his particular job.as such,the impairment does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.
this appeal ensued.
summary judgment is proper where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.once the moving party has pointed to the absence of adequate evidence supporting the nonmoving party case,the nonmoving party must come forward with facts that show a genuine issue for trial.see dfi puerto rico,cir leblanc great american ins,cir.n either conclusory allegations nor improbable inferences are sufficient to defeat summary judgment.geils band employee benefit plan smith barney shearson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.rather,to withstand a properly supported motion for summary judgment,the opposing party must present enough competent evidence to enable a factfinder to decide in its favor on the disputed claims.goldman first bank of boston,cir citing anderson liberty lobby,d.evidence that is merely colorable or is not significantly probative can not deter summary judgment.anderson,at.citations omitted.

a.the ada standard 
the ada prohibits discrimination in employment against qualified persons with a disability.a discrimination under the ada includes not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee,unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business.id.b a.
carroll appears to premise his claim of disability discrimination upon two discrete theories of liability disparate treatment and failure to reasonably accommodate his stress and anxiety disorder.under either theory,a threshold showing of disability is required.
with respect to his disparate treatment claim,carroll alleges that xerox discriminated against him because of his alleged impairment by,inter alia,forcing him to transfer to a position at a lower salary.to recover under this theory pursuant to the ada and its massachusetts analogue,chapter,carroll must show that he suffers from a disability or handicap,as defined by the ada and chapter that he was nevertheless able to perform the essential functions of his job,either with or without reasonable accommodation,and finally that xerox took an adverse employment action against him because of,in whole or in part,his protected disability.lessard osram sylvania,cir.as to his reasonable accommodation claim,carroll needs to show,in addition to the first two prongs set forth above,that xerox,despite knowing of his alleged disability,did not reasonably accommodate it.see higgins new balance athletic shoe,cir.
as noted,the district court ruled against carroll on all of these elements.the parties raise several issues on appeal bearing upon each of these elements.however,we only reach the initial question of disability,concluding that carroll failed to produce sufficient evidence that he had a disability within the meaning of relevant law.in light of this threshold deficiency,we need not address the remaining grounds upon which the district court relied in its grant of summary judgment.
the disability requirement can be satisfied by demonstrating a physical or mental impairment that substantially limited one or more of carroll major life activities a.tracking that standard,we apply a analysis when considering statutory disability under a.see bragdon abbott,d.first,we consider whether carroll alleged condition constitutes a mental or physical impairment.see id.second,we identify the life activities upon which carroll relies to determine whether they constitute major life activities under the ada,see is,activities that are of central importance to daily life.toyota motor,williams,d.third,tying the two statutory phrases together,we ask whether the impairment substantially limits the activity found to amount to be a major life activity.whitehall,cir citing bragdon,at.to be substantially limiting,t he impairment impact must be permanent or.toyota motor.at.citing j ii iii.
under the framework articulated above,i t is insufficient to merely submit evidence of a medical diagnosis of an impairment.id.rather,those seeking ada protection must offer evidence that the extent of the limitation caused by their impairment in terms of their own experience is substantial.id.at.quoting albertson,kirkingburg,d alterations in original.
application 
mindful of the individualized inquiry mandated by the ada in disability evaluation,sutton united air lines,d,we address the particulars of carroll case.carroll complained of anxiety disorder and stress he argues on appeal that this disorder chiefly impacted the major life activity of working this case does not require us to decide whether anxiety disorder and stress is an impairment,nor whether working is a major life activity within the meaning of the ada assuming,arguendo,that both propositions are correct,we turn immediately to the third element of the statutory test,which we find dispositive.in doing so,we conclude that carroll claimed impairment does not substantially limit the asserted activity of working.
we note at the outset that substantially limits is defined under the eeoc regulations as 
i unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform or 
ii significantly restricted as to the condition,manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition,manner or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.
j.factors to be considered in assessing whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity are the nature and severity of the impairment the duration or expected duration of the impairment and the permanent or impact,or the expected permanent or impact.id.j.
furthermore,to determine whether a substantial limitation exists when work is at issue,we have looked to whether plaintiff can show that he or she is significantly restricted in his or her ability to perform a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.whitney greenberg,rosenblatt,kull bitsoli,cir internal quotation marks omitted american airlines,cir j i stating that the activity of working is substantially limited only where an individual is significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training,skills and abilities.we have noted that t he inability to perform a single,particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.whitehall laboratories,at quoting j i.see santiago clemente executive airlines,cir t o be substantially limited in the major life activity of working,santiago must be precluded from more than a particular job.
as the district court recognized,carroll failed to show that he was precluded by his claimed impairment from a substantial class of jobs or a broad range of jobs.indeed,carroll fails to point to evidence in the record to show that he was unable to perform any job other than his own acm job with the particular sales targets and workloads that
