a jury returned a verdict of against richard galgano for medical malpractice in his treatment of sharon primus,who was later diagnosed with breast cancer in.on appeal,the doctor raises two issues.he argues the evidence was insufficient to show his failure to meet the appropriate standards of care and causation.he also argues the district court committed error in failing to instruct the jury under.laws ann.ch,west and that the verdict should be reduced to the cap under that statute.we affirm.in doing so,we hold,in an issue of first impression,that a defendant must request an instruction under.laws ann.ch,and waives his claim if he does not do so.
sharon primus,whose husband is in the military,saw a number of physicians at luke air force base in arizona between and regarding a cyst or cysts in her breast.
on october,primus saw susan allen,a specialist in family medicine at luke air force base,for a routine annual examination.allen palpated a millimeter lump in primus breast.according to primus medical records,the lump was located in her left breast primus,however,maintains that this is a mistake and that the lump was in her right breast.allen ordered a mammogram be performed on primus the next day.allen also referred primus to lawrence riddles,a surgeon at luke air force base allen noted in primus record that she should be evaluated by a surgeon,and a biopsy should perhaps be performed.riddles saw primus on november.based on his examination and the mammogram ordered by allen,he concluded that there was no evidence of cancer.riddles also recommended that primus return for a visit in three months time primus did not see riddles again,however.primus did see allen in november.at that time,allen found no mass in primus breast.no biopsy was performed despite allen query.
on july,primus saw another surgeon at luke air force base,earl walker.this time,primus went directly to a surgeon,rather than being referred by a general practitioner.according to walker notes,primus complained of a cyst in her right breast.palpation revealed a millimeter cyst in her right breast.walker made a preliminary diagnosis of fibrocystic disease,and ordered a mammogram.the mammogram was performed on july,and primus saw walker to discuss it on august.walker again diagnosed the lump as fibrocystic disease,noting that it was a millimeter smooth lump.primus saw walker for a third time in january.he noted a to millimeter lump,palpated her lymph nodes,and recommended that she come back in july for another mammogram.primus did not have a third mammogram while at luke air force base.
primus also saw allen for another annual physical examination on december,and complained of a cyst in her right breast.allen noted that primus should follow up with a surgeon,and perhaps a needle aspiration or surgical biopsy could be performed.again,no biopsy or needle aspiration was performed,nor were such diagnostic procedures ever performed while primus was in arizona.primus also saw a nurse at luke air force base,diane musselwhite,in june.nurse musselwhite noted that primus had a millimeter lump in her breast 
primus left arizona in july,and relocated with her family to massachusetts when her husband was transferred to hanscom air force base.she became pregnant in august.during primus pregnancy,changes in her breast were attributed to normal effects of pregnancy.primus saw martin gross,an obstetrician,on october.at that time,a hardened area was detected in primus right breast.in november,primus saw michael shaw,a,who recorded that primus had normal pregnant breasts.gross also did an evaluation of primus breasts when he delivered her child in april,and found no mass in her breast.
on october,after the birth of primus son,primus saw richard galgano,a private physician who saw patients from hanscom air force base,for a complete medical examination.galgano palpated a lump and noted in her record a cyst in the outer portion of her right breast.primus told galgano that a lump in that breast had been diagnosed as by doctors in arizona after a mammogram.she also told him it had not changed in size since then,and that it was not painful.though he palpated the lump,galgano did not refer her to a surgeon,nor did he obtain her medical records or perform a.
primus was diagnosed with breast cancer in.on march,she consulted a general practitioner,daniel melville,who,after palpating a lump in her right breast,immediately arranged for both a mammogram and an ultrasound.primus had a mammogram,but the ultrasound was not performed at the recommendation of the radiologist,who felt that the mammogram alone clearly indicated the presence of cancer.melville called primus at home the evening of the day she had her mammogram to tell her she needed to see a surgeon as soon as possible.primus saw the surgeon,kevin,the next day,march.diagnosed breast cancer on the basis of the mammogram and palpation of the lump.he ordered a biopsy on april,to confirm his diagnosis,and then scheduled surgery for primus shortly thereafter.by that time,the cancer had metastasized into four lymph nodes.the lump was estimated to be millimeters in size,but the final pathology report recorded it as millimeters.she underwent a radical mastectomy on may,that entailed removal of her entire breast and lymph nodes and began chemotherapy in june.after the mastectomy,breast reconstruction was attempted unsuccessfully.at trial,primus and her husband testified about the pain,suffering,and embarrassment which had resulted from the loss of her right breast,the chemotherapy,and the failed reconstructive surgery.
on march,primus filed a medical malpractice action in the district court in massachusetts.it was consolidated for the purpose of discovery and trial with another case arising out of overlapping facts,which had originally been filed in district court in arizona in july.primus united states.the arizona case alleged a cause of action against the united states for medical negligence by walker under the federal tort claims act ftca,b.because ftca claims are heard by a judge rather than a jury,see,the instant case was tried to a jury,while the case against the united states was tried by the district court.for this reason,some evidence was presented to the judge out of the presence of the jury.the district court instructed the jury that it was only to consider the claims against galgano,not those against walker.the ftca case was governed by arizona law,while the instant case was tried under massachusetts law.
the defendant filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law.a,at the close of plaintiff case,and renewed the motion at the close of all the evidence.both motions were denied.the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff consisting of for damages suffered as a result of negligence,and for future pain and suffering.defendant then filed a motion for entry of judgment,styling it as being in accordance with.laws ann.ch,and requesting that the district court reduce the verdict to as an operation of law.defendant also filed a motion for judgment in accordance with.b,arguing that plaintiff had failed to present evidence demonstrating deviation from the accepted standard of care or that that deviation was causally related to plaintiff injury.both motions were also denied.primus galgano,d.
the defendant now appeals these rulings,arguing that the plaintiff failed to introduce expert testimony evidence demonstrating deviation from the accepted standard of care and a causal relationship between that deviation and plaintiff injury,and that the verdict must be reduced to as an operation of law.
iii.sufficiency of the evidence 
galgano argues primus did not produce expert evidence that he deviated from the expected standard of care or that the alleged deviation was causally related to any injury,including a diminished chance of survival or longer life.to prevail on a negligence claim under massachusetts law,a plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence a legal duty owed by defendant to plaintiff a breach of that duty proximate or legal cause and actual damage or injury.heinrich sweet,cir quoting jorgensen.port,cir.
under massachusetts law,the rule in medical malpractice cases against physicians is 
w hether the physician,if a general practitioner,has exercised the degree of care and skill of the average qualified practitioner,taking into account the advances in the profession.in applying this standard it is permissible to consider the medical resources available to the physician as one circumstance in determining the skill and care required.under this standard some allowance is thus made for the type of community in which the physician carries on his practice.
brune belinkoff.the plaintiff must present expert testimony as to the standard of care and its breach,unless the breach is sufficiently obvious as to lie within the common knowledge of the jury.heinrich,at quoting haggerty mccarthy.
evidence of a causal connection between the negligence of the defendant and damages suffered generally must be established by expert testimony that the injury sustained was more probably than not a result of the doctor negligence.glicklich spievack.where the question is,as here,whether 
a physician negligent conduct has caused a delay in the diagnosis of patient cancer,proximate causation can be proved by expert evidence which shows,to a reasonable medical certainty,that the patient would have had a much improved chance of survival or longer life if diagnosis and treatment meeting accepted standards of care had been appropriately initiated.
joudrey nashoba cmty,quoting cusher turner.precise evidence as to when the cancer began or precisely when or how quickly it metastasized or changed is not required under massachusetts law.cusher,at see glicklich,at.all that is needed is testimony to a reasonable medical certainty that,absent the defendant negligence,the plaintiff would not have had a metastasis of the cancer and would have had a much improved chance of survival or longer life.
o ur review is weighted toward preservation of the jury verdict,even though we review de novo a district court denial of a rule motion for judgment as a matter of law.heinrich,at quoting rodowicz.mut.life ins,cir.a jury verdict stands unless the evidence was so strongly and overwhelmingly inconsistent with the verdicts that no reasonable jury could have returned them.walton nalco chem,cir internal quotation omitted.
at core,galgano argument is that most of plaintiff expert evidence was directed at the negligence of walker in and,and the evidence as to galgano on both standard of care and causation was simply insufficient.he also argues that the plaintiff expert in later testimony changed her mind as to whether galgano had committed malpractice.the plaintiff had one expert witness,mary jane houlihan,formerly the director of the breast care program of beth israel hospital in boston.this was her first expert testimony on behalf of a plaintiff previously she had only testified on behalf of defendants.the plaintiff also relies on galgano testimony on to show that she met her burden.
houlihan testified on direct examination that in her view walker,the treating physician in and early,had deviated from the requisite standard of care.by contrast,she gave a less direct answer as to galgano,but she concluded with 
well,what i was getting at was that i not sure whether he had the records that day,because it difficult sometimes to get them,and he noted this and did nothing further.
i opinion is that this was not necessarily a gross deviation from the standard of care but a deviation from the standard of care in that getting the records he would have seen that this had increased in size 
or he could have referred her to a surgeon for further evaluation.
but i feel that most of what had occurred had already happened,is what i am trying to say,that it had not been worked up in and.
she also noted that the size of the lump had increased from to millimeters in to millimeters in.when primus had the radical mastectomy in,breast tissue and lymph nodes were removed.four of the nodes had cancer.
houlihan opined that the to millimeter mass described by walker in and,by implication,by galgano in was the same mass removed in the cancer was removed from the same site as the lump noticed in and.galgano counsel conceded at oral argument that it was the same lump in,and.it was houlihan opinion that after primus surgery in,primus had about a fifty percent chance of having a recurrence and going on and dying from it.had the cancer been diagnosed in or and treated,primus would have had a close to normal life expectancy.
on,houlihan was told of the statements primus had made about her medical history to galgano.the court then asked 
i just want to be clear.when you say galgano deviated from a duty of care,you say that he did so in failing to follow up on obtaining the prior medical records that had been assembled in arizona 
the witness that was.that was my concern,if either this mass had been identified by him,i opinion is that it would have been helpful either to have had the medical record or,if that was available,to have this looked at by a surgeon to determine whether anything else needed to be done at this point.
the court does any of the information rogers brought out that you did have access to change your mind in any sense about the opinion 
the witness well,it comes back to what i was trying to say earlier,which is that i think that it would change my mind somewhat.
but i also think that,again,still had been any test done to prove what this thing was that had been there,presumably,you know,since,never an ultrasound,never a needle placed in it to know exactly what it was.
that what i was trying to say.
on redirect,houlihan was asked to return to the question of whether her mind had been changed by learning that primus gave a detailed history to galgano 
and do you recall the judge posing questions about whether or not,knowing learning today through rogers,whether your mind had changed,and you answered in the affirmative correct 
that correct.
all right.did your new knowledge of primus having given her detailed history to galgano alter your opinion in any way as to whether his conduct deviated from the standard of care of a primary physician 
i think,if there was that much discussion about the breast issue,it would helpful to hear this from the patient,but i would have would have really felt then that the primary care physician should have obtained the old records and referred the patient for evaluation by a breast surgeon.
she then was even more explicit.
doctor,there is the key fact that sharon primus informed galgano about,and that was that after her pregnancy the lump remained.is that a fact that when she saw galgano,she talked about that lump,and he,in fact,documented it.is that right 
i only heard that here today.
all right.now,so,he should have gotten those records 
and he should have immediately referred his patient to a surgeon 
and not having the records,should have undertaken a de novo workup,just the way you just indicated 
should have referred her to a surgeon.
this was the essential testimony on breach of the standard of care.houlihan testified that had galgano reviewed primus medical records he would have learned two things that there was a mass that had gradually grown in size in the right breast and a recommendation,either by allen in december or by nurse musselwhite in june,that primus be seen by a breast surgeon and,second,that neither an ultrasound nor a cyst aspiration had been undertaken.this information would have led a competent physician to make a referral to a surgeon.
galgano,on,confirmed that,if he had had the information contained in primus medical records,he would have recommended a different plan.he conceded that if he had known that there was a progression in the size of the lump he would have referred her to the surgeons.he also said that if he had been aware that primus had not had the july mammogram as recommended by walker,that knowledge would have shaped his response all of this information would have been available to him had he obtained primus records from nearby hanscom air force base.
galgano defense as to standard of care was basically that he was entitled to rely on primus own statements as to her medical hi
