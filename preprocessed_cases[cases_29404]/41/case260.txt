on september,plaintiff wanda sánchez gave birth to her daughter natalie at defendant ashford presbyterian community hospital.the delivery was difficult after the attending physician applied considerable traction,natalie emerged,but with an injury resulting in partial paralysis of her left arm.this medical malpractice suit followed,brought under diversity jurisdiction by sánchez,natalie,and sánchez husband,josé alicea ponce.the suit was originally brought against the physicians who had cared for sánchez during her pregnancy,including the one who delivered natalie.subsequently,ashford was joined as a defendant.plaintiffs settled with the physicians for,but continued their case against ashford.after trial by jury,ashford was found to be liable for plaintiffs damages,which were assessed at,again,although the jury had not been informed of the settlement.the trial judge threw out the verdict for want of sufficient evidence.this appeal ensued.we hold that,even if the verdict against ashford were supported by sufficient evidence,it constitutes an impermissible given plaintiff prior settlement with the physicians.we therefore affirm without having to reach the issue of sufficiency of the evidence or related issues plaintiffs raise.
we summarize the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.andrade jamestown hous,cir.
sánchez became pregnant in.having delivered a previous child by caesarian section,she sought care at centro the center specialized in natural childbirth after a caesarian section.her treating physicians there included héctor rosario,maría román,carlos roure,and josé santiago.
on september,a week before her due date,sánchez was examined by roure,who determined that sánchez pregnancy was causing her to suffer hypertension and that she should be hospitalized.since sánchez was so close to her due date,her doctors decided to induce labor the next day.
labor was induced the morning of september.rosario was the attending physician also present at various times were several nurses,including nurse elsie oliveras.after several hours of contractions,the baby head emerged,but then indication called the turtle sign that the baby shoulder was stuck in response,rosario instructed nurse oliveras to push sánchez legs toward her head putting her in the mcroberts position and then to apply suprapubic pressure,so as to rotate and free the baby shoulder.
nurse oliveras seemed confused over how to execute these maneuvers.after she attempted to put sánchez in the mcroberts position,rosario told her in an urgent tone that she was performing the maneuver incorrectly and directed her to do it the right way.then,after being told to apply suprapubic pressure,nurse oliveras repeatedly asked how,how do i do this 
at this point,rosario sought outside help.he left the room for a minute or so and returned with another doctor.the other doctor applied suprapubic pressure,and soon after baby natalie was delivered.it later became apparent that as a result of the traumatic delivery,natalie had suffered an injury to her brachial plexus a net of nerves connecting the spinal cord with the arm due to the injury,she is unable to lift her left arm past degrees.the specific cause of the injury,crediting plaintiffs evidence,was probably excessive traction by rosario during delivery,excessive pulling that overly strained the nerves near the baby neck.
on may,plaintiffs brought suit against rosario,román,roure,and santiago of the centro.the crux of the claim was that the doctors were negligent in providing care to sánchez by failing to advise her that,due to her having diabetes,she bore a high risk of a complicated natural childbirth,and that a caesarian section was the safer alternative.
subsequently,plaintiffs amended their complaint to include ashford as a defendant.plaintiffs claimed that ashford was negligent in failing to provide qualified nursing staff during the delivery,as evidenced by nurse oliveras confusion over how to perform the maneuvers ordered by rosario.as developed at trial,plaintiffs theory was that because of nurse oliveras confusion,rosario was forced to seek outside help,using up precious time.after a doctor sees the turtle sign,he or she has less than ten minutes to deliver the baby any longer risks brain damage or death by suffocation.due to the resulting time pressure,plaintiffs claimed,rosario hurried the remainder of the delivery and,in his rush,applied the excessive traction that caused natalie injury.
on september,plaintiffs settled with the physician defendants for.the physicians remained parties in the case,however,as the subjects of a by ashford.after trial,by way of a special verdict form,the jury found both ashford and the physicians negligent,attributing half the liability for natalie injury to ashford and half to the physicians.the jury assessed plaintiffs total damages to be ashford resulting liability was.
subsequently ashford moved to set aside the verdict for insufficient evidence.the trial judge granted the motion,finding there was no evidence that ashford nurses were undertrained,nor evidence that the nurses in any way contributed to natalie injury.see ponce ashford presbyterian community.plaintiffs now appeal.
plaintiffs appeal is essentially.they argue first,that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury finding that ashford was negligent second,that there was not sufficient evidence to support the jury finding that the physicians were negligent and third,that the trial judge committed various errors that led the jury to underestimate plaintiffs damages they ask this court to reverse the trial court decision to vacate the verdict against ashford,to enter judgment as a matter of law on ashford against the physicians,and to remand for a partial new trial limited to the question of damages.
the third prong of plaintiffs appeal is crucial to their case.even if plaintiffs were correct that there was sufficient evidence to find ashford negligent but insufficient evidence to find the physicians ashford liable for plaintiffs victory would be a hollow one.the resulting award against ashford would be yet plaintiffs have already recovered precisely this amount in settlement from the physicians.since puerto rico like most jurisdictions prohibits double recovery in this context,plaintiffs would net exactly zero.hospital del maestro,cir.thus,in order to prevail,plaintiffs must show that the jury was erroneously led to underestimate damages,so as to reopen the possibility of winning an award on remand exceeding their settlement 
we see no prejudicial error underlying the jury damages assessment,however.plaintiffs allege three such errors,which we address seriatim.first,they take issue with the following jury instruction 
ashford may not be found liable for any damages which may have been caused by the negligent acts or omissions of the treating physicians.plaintiffs may only recover damages against ashford if they establish that the injury suffered by baby natalie alicea sánchez was proximately caused by ashford negligent acts or omissions.
plaintiffs argue that the instruction misled the jury to believe that it was supposed to assess only that portion of plaintiffs damages attributable to ashford,rather than plaintiffs total damages had the jury properly understood the latter as its task,it would have reached a figure of,rather than fifty percent of that.
however,plaintiffs did not object to the instruction on this ground at trial to the contrary,plaintiffs suggested the very language used in the instruction and agreed that the instruction should be clear that ashford is liable for its own negligence exclusively.having waived the claim,ashford is entitled to review only for plain error,drohan vaughn,cir,and we find none.
the gist of the instruction was simply that ashford could not be held vicariously liable for the acts of the defendant physicians.unlike in the case plaintiffs rely on,murray,cir,the instruction here did not specifically even in measuring damages as opposed to determining liability the jury was to consider only damages attributable to ashford.id.at.moreover,the special verdict most immediately guid
