ronald halstead was convicted of both healthcare fraud under u.and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments under and sentenced to months imprisonment.after unsuccessful appeals,he filed this petition for collateral review under to vacate his money laundering conviction on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to support convictions of two distinct crimes.he claims that the transactions supporting his money laundering conviction were the same transactions supporting his healthcare fraud conviction,leading to a merger problem.he argues that the only way the government could have avoided merger of the two crimes would have been to prove that he laundered the net profits,not the gross receipts,of the healthcare fraud,which the government did not do.in making this claim,halstead relies on the supreme court decision in united states santos,which was decided after his convictions and which,he argues,should be applied retroactively on collateral review.
in santos,the court held that,in order to avoid a merger of the crimes of money laundering and operating an illegal gambling business,the term proceeds in the money laundering statute must be construed to mean net profits,not gross receipts,of the illegal gambling business.
while we agree with halstead that santos does apply retroactively on collateral review,we conclude that it does not warrant relief in this case where the laundering of proceeds from the healthcare fraud involved transactions distinct from and subsequent to the transactions involved in the healthcare fraud itself.we read santos to require a restricted interpretation of proceeds only when a broader interpretation would risk a merger of a money laundering crime and a crime for operating an illegal gambling business.in this case,however,regardless of whether proceeds is defined as gross receipts or net profits,a merger problem does not occur,because halstead commission of healthcare fraud was complete before he committed money laundering.accordingly,we affirm.
ronald halstead,a trained chiropractor,had been a consultant to chiropractic and medical practices since through his corporation,management one systems,doing business as practice systems.in late,halstead advised robert burns,a chiropractor in morgantown,west virginia,how burns could increase his income by performing more reimbursable tests per patient visit by linking his chiropractic practice with a medical practice and marketing the joint practice in a specified manner.under halstead direction,burns formed a parent company,west virginia healthcare management,to own two subsidiary corporations,one a chiropractic clinic known as mountaineer chiropractic center and the other a medical clinic known as priority one medical associates.he had burns retain amando medina as a doctor to staff the priority one medical association,naming him also as the nominal owner of the corporation.medina,however,performed scant medical work,as he was retained mostly to prescribe chiropractic services so that those services would be covered by the patients healthcare benefits.
halstead also hired a marketing specialist to generate increased traffic through the combined medical and chiropractic clinics.the marketer implemented a program where the clinic held marketing dinners,which were free for anyone who filled out a form listing an employer who provided health insurance benefits.at these dinners,the clinic would give out certificates for free examinations and.
to capitalize on the patient traffic thus generated,halstead implemented a procedure for the clinic chiropractors to follow when seeing new patients,providing an exact script for this purpose.the chiropractors were instructed to apply pressure to joints and ask the patient if he or she noticed any pain or discomfort.after applying pressure,the chiropractor was supposed to tell the patient,i think you agree with me that we have a serious problem here under the script,the chiropractor was then instructed to take two of the patient and to show the to the patient,informing the patient that,t hese vertebrae are severely twisted out of position.finally,the chiropractor was directed to tell the patient that to visits were required to correct the problem.if the patient hesitated,the chiropractor was instructed to say,verbatim as you remember those vertebrae are severely twisted out of position.i hate to see you leave here today not making a commitment to getting the treatment you know you need,and i know you need.to make sure that the examination script was being followed,halstead taped some of the chiropractic exams,listened to them,and reviewed them with the chiropractors to point out discrepancies between the script and the actual examination.
to take advantage of the patients healthcare benefits,which often required that a medical doctor order and supervise specified chiropractic services,halstead and burns adopted two courses of action.first,they had the medical corporation,priority one,do all the billing of insurance companies and other healthcare providers,regardless of whether the patients visits were chiropractic or medical in nature.second,halstead advised burns to require medina to focus on authorizing chiropractic treatments.while medina thus became these patients physician,it was in name only,as he actually acted mostly as a rubber stamp for the chiropractors requests.often,medina would go through stacks of treatment sheets,signing each one without a clear idea of what treatments he was approving or whether they were necessary.
the clinic also employed a second doctor,rebecca price,with the hope that she too would sign off on these chiropractic treatment forms.price,however,refused to participate in this fashion,and when the practice forged her signature on documents submitted to insurance companies and other healthcare providers,she resigned.
halstead and burns also orchestrated the cash flow thus obtained from the insurance companies and healthcare providers.all billings to them were conducted by priority one,the medical subsidiary,and the payments received were deposited into priority one checking account.priority one then transferred these funds to the management company,west virginia healthcare management,which had purportedly been created to provide management services for priority one.west virginia healthcare management then transferred the money to halstead and burns checking accounts.with respect to halstead,the money was paid to the checking account of his company,practice systems.
during the course of the conspiracy,priority one billed insurance companies and healthcare providers approximately million and received something less than that amount.while some of the amounts received were attributable to legitimate chiropractic services,the probation officer in this case determined,for purposes of sentencing,that approximately million of the amounts received were from fraudulent billing.
halstead and his were indicted in september,and halstead was subsequently convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and healthcare fraud,in violation of counts of healthcare fraud,in violation of and one count of conspiracy to launder monetary instruments,in violation of h.the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment,entering judgment on july.
on appeal,halstead convictions were affirmed,but his sentence was vacated and the case remanded for resentencing in light of united states booker.united states.filcheck,fed.appx.cir.on remand,the district court,applying the advisory guidelines range,sentenced halstead to months imprisonment,and we affirmed.see united states halstead,fed.appx.cir.
following halstead convictions,the supreme court handed down its decision in united states santos,holding that,in order to avoid a merger problem,the term proceeds in the money laundering statute must be construed to mean net profits when the proceeds are derived from an illegal gambling business.based on that decision,halstead filed this motion under,contending that his conviction for money laundering should be dismissed because a merger problem existed and the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove that the proceeds from his healthcare fraud were net profits,rather than gross receipts.
the district court denied halstead motion.it assumed,without deciding,that santos applied retroactively but concluded that santos did not apply to halstead,based on our unpublished decision in united states howard,fed.appx.cir,cert.denied.in howard,we concluded that the term proceeds in the money laundering statutes generally means receipts,not profits,and that santos applied only to money laundering cases in which the predicate offense was illegal gambling.
the district court granted halstead application for a certificate of appealability,noting that courts are split on the correct reading of santos,and,by order dated may,we expanded the certificate of appealability to address whether santos applies retroactively to cases on collateral review,noting that the resolution of that question could preempt the issue for which the district court granted a certificate of appealability.
when santos was decided,halstead convictions were final.nonetheless,halstead contends that santos should be retroactively applied on collateral review to his money laundering conviction under because it effected a substantial change in the law,narrowing the reach of the money laundering statute.in santos,the defendants were convicted of both conducting an illegal gambling business and of laundering the proceeds of that business.to avoid a merger of the two crimes,the supreme court held that proceeds in the money laundering statute meant the net profits,rather than the gross receipts,of the illegal gambling business.in doing so,the court narrowed the scope of the money laundering statute.
the government concedes that santos applies retroactively to cases on collateral review,and we agree.
when the supreme court issues new rulings in criminal cases,substantive rules generally apply retroactively,while procedural rules do not.schriro summerlin.a rule is substantive rather than procedural if it alters the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes,id.at,and rules include decisions that narrow the scope of a criminal statute by interpreting its terms,id.at.
in santos,the court did narrow the scope of the money laundering statute by interpreting the term proceeds in a to mean the net profits of an illegal gambling business rather than its gross receipts.accordingly,we hold that santos applies retroactively on collateral review.
applying santos,halstead contends that there is a potential merger of the money laundering crime and the predicate crime in this case,healthcare fraud,in the sense that the same transactions could support convictions for both crimes.he thus claims that santos requires that the money laundering statute be construed narrowly so as to apply only to the net profits of the predicate crime and thereby avoid the potential merger of the two crimes.halstead asserts that because the government did not prosecute the money laundering statute in his case narrowly,as required by santos,his money laundering crime merged with the healthcare crime,requiring that the money laundering conviction be vacated.as he argues,t he same basic facts in the health fraud part of the indictment were repeated as the facts of the money laundering part of the indictment the indictment simply unbundled the criminal conduct in this case into legally separate components this overlap gives rise to the merger problem which was discussed in santos.he asserts that if his money laundering count is not dismissed,he will be punished unfairly with a longer sentence than that which would otherwise be imposed for violating only the healthcare fraud statute.
the government contends that halstead reads santos too broadly.it argues that santos applies only to money laundering cases in which the predicate crime is illegal gambling.the government urges that we adhere to our earlier holdings that the term proceeds in the money laundering statute refers to gross receipts,rather than simply profits.see,united states singh,cir.it argues that santos created an exception to this general rule,and thus,only in cases where the predicate offense is illegal gambling should we read proceeds to mean net profits.while the government acknowledges that it could prosecute a defendant for both illegal gambling and money laundering only if it could prove that the defendant laundered net profits of the illegal gambling business,not its gross receipts,it asserts that it can prosecute a defendant for laundering gross receipts from other underlying illegal activities.
because santos was decided by a vote,its holding has been the subject of much debate.this court has not,however,addressed this question in a published opinion.
in santos,the government proved that defendants santos,diaz,and others operated an illegal gambling business and that santos runners gathered bets from gamblers,kept a portion of the bets between and as their commissions,and delivered the rest to santos collectors.collectors,one of whom was respondent diaz,then delivered the money to santos,who used some of it to pay the salaries of collectors including diaz and to pay the winners.santos,at.on these facts,the government obtained convictions of santos and diaz for running an illegal gambling business,as well as for money laundering.
a plurality comprised of justices scalia,souter,thomas,and ginsburg announced the judgment of the court and joined the plurality opinion written by justice scalia.recognizing that the money laundering statute at its core prohibits financial transactions involving the proceeds of specified unlawful activity with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity,a emphasis added,the plurality observed that,if proceeds meant gross receipts,nearly every violation of the statute would also be a violation of the statute,because paying a winning bettor is a transaction involving receipts that the defendant intends to promote the carrying on of the lottery.since few lotteries,if any,will not pay their winners,the statute criminalizing illegal lotteries,would merge with the statute.santos,at plurality opinion.this scenario,the plurality wrote,gave rise to a merger problem.id.at.justice stevens,writing separately and concurring in the judgment only,agreed.see id.at stevens,concurring.thus,because the defendants were tried for laundering gross receipts of the illegal gambling business,a majority held that their money laundering convictions had to be vacated.
although the plurality and justice stevens reached the same result,they were not in complete accord as to the reasons for reaching it.for its part,the plurality found that the term proceeds in a was ambiguous because proceeds can mean either gross receipts or net profits,and neither the statute nor statutory context gave an indication as to which meaning was more appropriate.at plurality opinion.the plurality thus invoked the rule of lenity and concluded that proceeds should always be defined as profits because that definition is always more.id.at.
justice stevens,on the other hand,began by evaluating the money laundering statute legislative history for clues as to the proper interpretation of proceeds.santos,at stevens,concurring.since this analysis yielded no definitive answer,justice stevens determined that congress could have defined the term proceeds differently when applied to different predicate offenses.as he stated,t his court need not pick a single definition of proceeds applicable to every unlawful activity,no matter how incongruous some applications may be.id.at.he thus focused on the definition of proceeds when the unlawful activity was illegal gambling and found that t he consequences of applying a gross receipts definition of proceeds to the gambling operation conducted by respondents are so perverse that i can not believe they were contemplated by congress.id.at.what he found to be perverse was essentially the effect of the merger problem coupled with differential sentences for the two crimes.as he explained 
allowing the government to treat the mere payment of the expense of operating an illegal gambling business as a separate offense is in practical eff
