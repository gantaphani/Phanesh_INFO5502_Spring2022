john harrison sued benchmark electronics huntsville,behi,alleging,inter alia,that behi engaged in an improper medical inquiry,in violation of the americans with disabilities act of ada,d.the district court granted summary judgment in favor behi on all claims.we reverse.
in november,aerotek,a company that places temporary workers at behi,assigned harrison to work at behi.harrison worked as a debug tech,and his responsibilities included identifying problems with,repairing,and testing electronic boards.although he suffers from epilepsy and takes barbiturates to control his condition,the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc determined that he did not have a disability as defined under the ada.
at the time harrison commenced his temporary position at behi,the company had a practice of screening temporary employees for potential permanent employment.if a supervisor believed that a temporary employee would meet behi needs,he would invite that employee to submit an application for employment and complete the necessary drug testing and background check.usually,after a candidate had cleared both a background and drug test human resources would extend him an offer,unless the hiring manager instructed otherwise.
on may,harrison submitted an application for permanent employment,at the request of his supervisor,don anthony.along with his application,he consented to a drug test.in july,anthony called faye robinson,the director of behi human services department,to get the requisitions for three permanent positions,including the position for which harrison had applied.he identified harrison as the only person he was interested in employing.after corporate had approved his requisitions,anthony told harrison to take the drug test,and he complied.harrison was at no time informed that his performance was deficient or that he had an attitude problem.
in july,lena williams,employed in behi human resources department,was notified that harrison test had come back positive and was awaiting review by a medical review officer mro.she called anthony and asked him to send harrison her way.she stated that she did not tell anthony about the positive drug screen at any time,because she had a duty to keep such information confidential.robinson also testified that as a matter of policy her department never discloses the or an employee drug test.
regardless of how he found out about the drug test results,anthony informed harrison that he had tested positive for barbiturates.harrison responded by claiming to have a prescription,which anthony instructed him to retrieve.anthony then called the mro and passed the phone to harrison,who answered a series of questions about the medication.the mro asked him how long he had been disabled,what medication he took,and how long he had taken it.he replied that he had epilepsy since he was two years old,he took barbiturates to control it,and he stated the amount of his dosage.anthony did not ask any questions,but he remained in the room during this colloquy and heard harrison responses to the mro questions.
on july,the mro reported to williams that harrison drug test had been cleared.by this time,williams had also received clearance to hire harrison,information she passed on to anthony.however,anthony told human resources not to prepare an offer letter for harrison anthony then asked aerotek not to return harrison to behi.on august,aerotek informed harrison that he would not be returning to behi,because he had a performance and attitude problem,and because he had been accused of threatening anthony.he was fired from aerotek that same day.
through the course of the litigation,anthony has asserted three reasons to support his decision not to hire harrison he was too busy preparing for a audit to extend the offer harrison had made threats against him and several employees had expressed concern to him about harrison competence anthony maintains that,in light of these concerns,he simply needed more time to evaluate harrison.behi has also asserted that anthony lacked the authority to hire harrison,because corporate had closed all open positions and revoked all previously approved requisitions for employees,including the position for which harrison applied,on august.harrison argues that the revocation can not support anthony decision not to hire him,because it came weeks after he told human resources not to prepare the offer letter.
on may,harrison sued behi in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama he alleged various violations of the ada namely,that behi engaged in an improper medical inquiry,he was not hired due to a perceived disability,and he was terminated due to a perceived disability.behi denied these claims and moved for summary judgment,focusing solely on the perceived disability claim.in his response,harrison maintained that he had made out a prima facie case for an improper medical inquiry and a perceived disability.behi replied,arguing that the eleventh circuit has not yet recognized a private right of action for the making of an improper medical inquiry even if it had,harrison failed to plead it and regardless,the undisputed material facts established that behi was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
the district court granted behi motion,as to both the medical inquiry and perceived disability claims with regard to the medical inquiry claim,the court agree d with behi that harrison had failed to plead it.despite this statement,the court went on to examine the merits of the medical inquiry claim.the court first acknowledged that we have never held that a private right of action exists for such claims.even assuming a private right of action,however,the court held that harrison could not make out a prima facie case for an improper medical inquiry.because harrison tested positive for barbiturates,the court held that behi was then authorized to ask harrison whether he had a legitimate use for such medication.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards as the district court.sierra club,leavitt,cir.in so doing,we must view all evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.galvez bruce,cir.
before addressing the merits of harrison appeal,we must first examine whether he,a individual,can state a private cause of action for a prohibited medical inquiry in violation of d.we have not yet decided whether a plaintiff has a private right of action under d.bennett dominguez,app x,cir see also posey alternative home health care of lee county,wl,at.may,noting that while we have not yet determined whether a private cause of action is available under d,other courts have found such actions to be proper.harrison urges us to join our sister circuits who are unanimous in recognizing a private cause of action irrespective of the plaintiff disability status under d.see,murdock washington,cir fredenburg contra costa county dep t of health,cir griffin steeltek,cir see also conroy state dep t of corr,cir stating the same in the context of

the ada was enacted to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate to end discrimination against individuals with disabilities and to bring persons with disabilities into the economic and social mainstream of american life,pt,at,reprinted in.with regard to employment,the ada makes it illegal for a covered entity to discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability.
a.the act also restricts an employer ability to make medical examinations or inquiries that relate to an applicant disability status.see 
d.subsection d states the general bar against using medical examinations or inquiries to discriminate.subsections d through d provide further guidance regarding three distinct phases of the application process,see d but,see 
d and employment,see d.
in the stage,which is at issue in this case,a covered entity shall not conduct a medical examination or make inquiries of a job applicant as to whether such applicant is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of such disability.d a.an employer may only inquire into the ability of an applicant to perform functions.
d b emphasis added see a providing that an employer may make inquiries into the ability of an applicant to perform functions,may ask an applicant to describe or to demonstrate how,with or without reasonable accommodation,the applicant will be able to perform functions.section d prohibition is premised on congress belief that h istorically,employment application forms and employment interviews requested information concerning an applicant physical or mental condition,pt,at.congress believed that employers were using this information to exclude applicants with those with hidden disabilities such as epilepsy,diabetes,emotional illness,heart disease and their ability to perform the job was even evaluated.id.thus,subsection d assure s that misconceptions do not bias the employment selection process.id.
in interpreting d,we are guided by traditional canons of statutory construction.our starting point is the language of the statute itself.united states dbb,cir.moreover,
w e assume that congress used the words in a statute as they are commonly and ordinarily understood,and we read the statute to give full effect to each of its provisions.united states mclymont,cir per curiam.we do not look at one word or term in isolation,but instead we look to the entire statutory context.united states mclemore,cir citation omitted.we will only look beyond the plain language of a statute at extrinsic materials to determine the congressional intent if the statute language is ambiguous applying it according to its plain meaning would lead to an absurd result or there is clear evidence of contrary legislative intent.see consolid.bank,office of comptroller of currency,cir citations omitted.
id.turning first to the statutory language at issue in this case,the plain language of d does not predicate suit under the statute on an applicant disability status.in contrast to the ada general prohibition of disability discrimination in a,which refers only to qualified individuals with disabilities,d refers broadly to applicants.an applicant is a person who submits a formal application to do something or for a position,especially as part of recruitment or selection process a candidate.the oxford english dictionary ed.we assume that congress used this term as it is commonly and ordinarily understood,and in the absence of any limiting language,we do not infer otherwise.
of course,defining the plain meaning of a statutory word is only our starting point for statutory construction.we must also consider its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.mclemore,at.an argument could be made that because d expressly incorporates a prohibition of discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities,only disabled applicants may sue under subsection d.see adler i m rail link,d,holding that the prohibition against inquiries specifically refers back to the general prohibition against qualified individuals with disabilities,abrogated by cossette,at reasoning that,a lthough subsection d provides that subsection a general prohibition against discrimination shall include discrimination on the basis of medical examinations and inquiries,that provision is only one of several protections afforded by subsection d,and it is only discrimination itself and not illegal disclosure that requires a showing of disability citations omitted.we reject the adler court reading.the restrictive language of a incorporated by reference in 
d simply does not extend to subsection d.rather,subsection d incorporates a general rule that to maintain an action for discrimination itself,a plaintiff must be disabled under the ada.thus,one way a disabled plaintiff could meet his prima facie case of discrimination would be by showing that his employer discriminated against him by requiring a medical examination or making a improper medical inquiry in violation of subsection d.in contrast,d sets forth a specific bar against medical examinations and inquiries with respect to any applicant who has not yet received a job offer.in this context,a potential employer is not allowed to conduct any medical examinations,and may only inquire into an applicant ability to perform functions.
giving effect to the full statute,d does not limit coverage to applicants who are also qualified individuals with disabilities,and we do not infer such a restriction.in addition,we note that a contrary reading would go against clear evidence of contrary legislative intent.consol.bank,at.in enacting d,congress sought to prevent employers from using medical inquiries to exclude applicants with those with hidden disabilities such as epilepsy,diabetes,emotional illness,heart disease,and their ability to perform the job was even evaluated,pt,at.the legislative history of d indicates that congress wished to curtail all questioning that would serve to identify and exclude persons with disabilities from consideration for employment by drafting d.griffin,at.allowing applicants to sue will enhance and enforce congress prohibition.moreover,a contrary reading would vitiate d effectiveness it makes little sense to require an applicant to demonstrate that he has a disability to prevent his potential employer from inquiring as to whether or not he has one.griffin,at internal quotation and citation omitted.when viewed in its full statutory context,and consistent with our sister circuits holdings,subsection d does not require a showing of disability.see fredenburg,at see also griffin,at.
finally,although administrative interpretations of an act by its enforcing agency are not controlling,they do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which we may properly resort for guidance.meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,d see eeoc,enforcement guidance on inquiries and medical examinations of employees under the americans with disabilities act eeoc notice eeoc,july,available at this statutory language makes clear that the ada restrictions on inquiries and examinations apply to all employees,not just those with disabilities.thus,we now explicitly recognize that a plaintiff has a private right of action under 
d,irrespective of his disability status.
the district court concluded that harrison failed to plead his medical inquiry claim in his complaint,a determination harrison contests on appeal.we only require that a plaintiff provide a short and plain statement of the claim showing that he is entitled to relief.a.the point is to give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.davis bottling,cir quoting bell atl.twombly,d.a complaint f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.davis,at internal quotation and citation omitted see twombly,at.at ashcroft iqbal,d noting that rule requires more than unadorned,accusation see also sinaltrainal,cir citing iqbal,at.at,for the same proposition.
harrison satisfied our liberal pleading standard.his complaint alleged that behi questioned him about his seizures following a drug test,and he claimed damages for these allegedly prohibited medical inquiries.thus,behi had fair notice that harrison sought relief under d,and his allegations,which specifically referred to medical inquiries,were more than speculative to the extent that the district court concluded otherwise,it erred.
finally,harrison objects to the district court holding that he failed to make out a prima facie case for a prohibited medical inquiry under 
d a.the district court reasoned that because the questions posed to harrison were permissible questions following a test for illegal drug use,he failed to state a claim under the statute.
section d prohibits medical examinations and certain medical inquiries at the stage.consistent with congress intent,the regulations adopted under the ada by the eeoc provide that an employer may make inquiries into the ability of an applicant to perform functions,may ask an applicant to describe or to demonstrate how,with or without reasonable accommodation,the applicant will be able to perform the job related functions.a see also.the regulations clarify that while it is appropriate for an employer to inquir
