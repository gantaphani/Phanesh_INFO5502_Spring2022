in this appeal,appellant donna cusson cusson challenges the district court decision to grant summary judgment to appellees liberty life assurance company of boston liberty and the fleetboston financial corporation long term disability plan ltd plan.after liberty terminated cusson disability ltd benefits,cusson sued in the district court of massachusetts,arguing that the termination of her benefits was improper under the employee retirement and income security act erisa.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants,and cusson now appeals.after careful consideration,we affirm the district court judgment.
background 
a.the long term disability plan 
cusson was employed at fleetboston as a senior facilities planner.she was covered under both a disability plan std plan and the ltd plan.liberty is both the administrator of and payer of benefits under the ltd plan.under the terms of the insurance policy the policy for the ltd plan,the definition of disability or disabled for ltd purposes varies over time with the duration of the disability.for the initial period after a claimant switches into the ltd plan from the std plan,a person is considered disabled if she is unable to perform all of the material and substantial duties of her own occupation.however,after months,a person is considered disabled if she is unable to perform,with reasonable continuity,all of the material and substantial duties of her own or any other occupation for which s he is or becomes reasonably fitted by training,education,experience,and physical or mental capacity.
cusson fibromyalgia diagnosis and initial ltd benefits award 
in march,cusson was diagnosed with breast cancer.she began to receive benefits under the std plan in april because of the pain and fatigue caused by her chemotherapy.cusson was notified on october,that she qualified for ltd benefits under the policy.liberty also informed cusson that she was required to apply for social security disability income ssdi benefits.cusson chemotherapy ended in october.however,she continued to feel symptoms similar to what she felt during her cancer treatment,including dizziness,fatigue,headaches,and widespread body pain.
in february,cusson rheumatologist,james figueroa figueroa,diagnosed her with fibromyalgia.fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic and frequently difficult to manage pain in muscles and soft tissues surrounding joints.rose hartford fin.servs.group,cir citing taber cyclopedic medical dictionary ed.a patient may be diagnosed with fibromyalgia if she has a history of widespread pain for at least three months and pain in at least eleven out of eighteen tender point sites upon digital palpation.id.symptoms of fibromyalgia can include stiffness,fatigue,and disturbed sleep.see sarchet chater,cir.
on march,at liberty request,cusson completed an activities questionnaire,a document in which a claimant is asked to describe her activities and her functional limitations.cusson indicated that she was able to sit for approximately two hours,stand for fifteen to thirty minutes,and walk for thirty to minutes.she noted that these lengths of time were depending on the day and how i feel.she also reported memory and concentration problems,and indicated that she was never able to predict how she would feel from one day to the next.
on august,at liberty request,figueroa filled out a questionnaire regarding cusson condition.figueroa was asked to describe specific restrictions and limitations preventing your patient from being able to work.figueroa also submitted a physical capacities form,on which he reported that cusson could lift no more than ten pounds twice a day,could sit for four hours per day but needed to stand up every fifteen minutes,could stand for up to one hour but needed to sit every five to ten minutes,and could walk for an hour but needed to rest every few minutes.figueroa concluded that cusson could not work a full day until her pain and fatigue subsided.
on march,liberty notified cusson that beginning september,the definition of disabled under the policy would change,after which cusson would have to be unable to perform all of the material and substantial duties of any occupation for which she was qualified.on may,figueroa,at liberty request,completed a functional capacities form and a restrictions form.the functional capacities form asked figueroa to list,for various activities,whether cusson had n o r estrictions,could perform the activity f requently to of the time,o ccasionally up to of the time,or was u nable to perform the activity.figueroa indicated that cusson was u nable to squat,bend,kneel,climb,push or pull objects,or lift any weight over ten pounds.
review and termination of cusson ltd benefits 
on may,liberty hired omega insurance services,omega to conduct video surveillance of cusson.eleven days later,liberty again told cusson to apply for ssdi benefits,warning that if she did not,liberty would reduce her disability benefit by the amount she was eligible to receive from the social security administration ssa.liberty also informed cusson that it would help her obtain ssdi benefits.
omega conducted surveillance of cusson on june,and.omega videotaped cusson when she was observed outside of her home,and it obtained fifty minutes and seconds of video over the course of these six days.the video footage that was obtained appeared to show cusson engaged in normal activities.for example,on june,cusson was observed walking her dog for approximately thirty minutes according to the omega report,cusson walked in a smooth,fluid manner without exhibiting any external signs of impairment.later that day she drove to a nearby home depot store and was seen exiting the store an hour later carrying a shopping bag.on june,cusson was observed having lunch with a friend at a restaurant and then going to a wal mart.cusson was inside the wal mart for almost one hour,after which she exited with a loaded shopping cart.she loaded the items from her cart,including what omega report described as a large bag of cat litter,into her car,and she was also observed bending at the waist to pick up items that had fallen on the ground.
on july,liberty told cusson that if she did not provide proof of her ssa application by august,liberty would immediately reduce her benefits by the estimated amount of the ssdi benefit.liberty also instructed omega to conduct a second round of surveillance.this surveillance occurred between july and,during which time cusson was seen on the surveillance tape once,on july,for a total of one minute and seven seconds.
in august,liberty ordered a third round of video surveillance.omega performed this surveillance on august,and.cusson was seen leaving her home only on august.cusson was observed bending fully at the waist to retrieve an item outside her front door.she was then seen driving to a local restaurant and eating lunch with another person,and was then seen driving to a dry cleaner,a wal mart,and other department stores.during the course of her errands,she was observed carrying various items into and out of stores and bending at the waist to retrieve items from or place items into her car.
on september,cusson completed another activities questionnaire from liberty,in which she described her functional limitations,including pain,fatigue,memory loss,and inability to concentrate.cusson reported that since her last activities questionnaire from march,she could not remember going to a mall because malls were just too big instead,cusson noted,she went mostly to small stores with easy access in out.cusson also reported that she had good days and bad days.she said that on a good day she would be able to perform activities such as running errands,visiting other people,and having lunch outside her home.however,she reported that on a bad day she would be unable to sleep because of her pain and would often be unable to get out of bed for several days.
on october,figueroa reported to liberty that,during an work day,cusson could sit for less than two hours,stand for less than thirty minutes,and walk for fifteen minutes.figueroa also noted that cusson could not lift or carry more than ten pounds and could not work eight hours per day in any occupation.two days later,figueroa reported to liberty that cusson limitations tend to vary with the severity of her symptoms.
upon receipt of figueroa reports,liberty referred cusson file to robert millstein millstein,a liberty employee,for review.millstein reviewed cusson claim and concluded that the video surveillance demonstrates functional capacity which exceeds that reported on the most recent activities questionnaire and confirms that the claimant retains the physical capacity to perform work at a light level.millstein noted a number of apparent inconsistencies between cusson reported limitations and the video surveillance.for example,millstein noted that although cusson reported fatigue,the surveillance showed that on consecutive days,cusson is seen out of her house for long periods of time performing activities which would be best characterized as requiring light to medium physical capacity.thus,millstein concluded,the record does not support the presence of fatigue which would preclude work.millstein also noted that cusson was seen going into large stores,such as wal mart and home depot,even though she had previously reported that she did not go to malls because malls were too big.millstein also noted that cusson was seen bending at the waist and placing a large object,a bag of cat litter,in her car.
millstein report contained inaccurate statements about the surveillance results.millstein frequently confused sightings of cusson returning home with sightings of cusson leaving her home.millstein also said that on certain days cusson left her home and remained out of her home for long periods,when in fact the surveillance for those days clearly shows that cusson returned to her home at various points throughout the day.as a result of these errors,millstein report overstates the amount of time cusson spent outside of her home on certain days,sometimes by as much as a factor of three.
in november,liberty ordered a fourth round of surveillance,this time conducted by mjm investigations,mjm.mjm observed cusson on november and.cusson was seen outside of her home for a total of roughly half an hour over the course of the surveillance.on november,cusson was observed exiting her house carrying various bags and leaving her home as the passenger in a car.on november and,cusson was briefly seen driving to various locations to run errands.cusson was not seen outside of her home on november,or.
on november,liberty conducted a transferable skills analysis and labor market survey tsa of cusson claim,relying solely on millstein report.the analysis concluded that cusson could perform her occupation as a facilities manager as well as other occupations,such as construction manager,estate manager,and civil engineer.
on december,liberty sent cusson a letter informing her that her benefits were being terminated.the letter discussed the video surveillance and millstein review of cusson file.the letter also noted the results of the tsa and informed cusson that she was capable of performing her original job as a facility planner.in addition,the letter noted that liberty had written to figueroa requesting a response to millstein report and the video surveillance,but that figueroa had not responded.
cusson appeal and further tests 
on june,cusson notified liberty that she was appealing its decision to terminate her benefits.cusson submitted various documents,including her own sworn statement affidavits from her friends,family,and former colleagues and a chart comparing the surveillance reports with her own recollection of her activities on the days she was surveilled.cusson sworn statement and activity chart indicate that on some of the days she was seen outside of her home,she would hit a wall and return home crying in pain.however,cusson activity chart is completely silent as to what she was doing,or what symptoms she was experiencing,on many days when she was not observed outside of her home.
cusson also submitted medical reports from examinations by peter schur schur,a rheumatologist,and daniel cohen cohen and jean matheson matheson,who specialize in sleep disorders.schur examination was paid for by cusson health insurer as part of her treatment.schur examination indicated that cusson had limited motion in her shoulders,hips,and back had fair muscle tone at best and was painfully sensitive to touch.schur concluded that cusson was disabled at present,and recommended treatment options.cohen and matheson indicated that cusson had trouble sleeping because of her pain,but they did not render an opinion as to disability.
cusson also submitted a report from paul blatchford,ed.blatchford,a vocational rehabilitation expert,who conducted an evaluation on february.blatchford report detailed cusson impaired performance on a variety of standardized vocational tests approved by the united states department of labor dol.the report noted that cusson appeared exhausted and distracted throughout the entire proceeding.blatchford noted that under dol guidelines,the occupations for which cusson was qualified required sedentary to light exertion levels.blatchford concluded that cusson functional capacity precluded her from performing and sustaining any activities.blatchford also disputed liberty interpretation of the surveillance videos.he argued that the videos failed to address cusson cognitive limitations.he also noted that although the video showed that cusson was capable of short periods of activity,a fact that she herself had reported,it did not show cusson engaged in sustained activity that would be necessary for any kind of employment.
on july,liberty informed cusson that it had referred her file for two peer reviews.both reviews were paid for by liberty.one review was conducted by walter longo longo,an oncologist,who determined that there was no objective data supporting ongoing impairment due to prior therapy for breast cancer,but that it was possible that cusson could have limitations due to fibromyalgia.the other was conducted by jeffrey liebermann liebermann,a rheumatologist,who concluded that cusson should be able to perform the duties of light or sedentary occupations despite her fibromyalgia,and that cusson impairments were entirely subjective.liebermann also claimed to have spoken on the phone with figueroa.liebermann reported that during his conversation with figueroa,figueroa said that he had told cusson that he no longer wished to be consulted about the disability aspects of her case.on august,liebermann sent figueroa a letter purporting to summarize their conversation and requesting that figueroa review and make comments or corrections to the letter and fax it back to him.figueroa did not sign the letter or return it.
on september,cusson underwent an examination by mitchell abramson abramson.abramson reported that cusson had multiple trigger points for pain and was unable to bend forward more than forty degrees due to back pain.abramson concluded that cusson appear ed to be disabled due to her medical illness.on september,blatchford wrote an addendum to his february,report,stating that liberty interpretation of the surveillance reports was inaccurate,and contradicted by the videotapes themselves.blatchford noted that the video of cusson running errands was consistent with cusson ability to perform activities for limited periods of time,but that cusson need for frequent rest and her tendency to fade after engaging in any task for a sustained period of time showed that she lack ed the ability to engage in sustained work,whether sedentary or otherwise.
cusson submitted abramson report,blatchford addendum,and other documentation to liberty on september.in response,liberty conducted a second round of peer reviews.both of these additional reviews were conducted by mls national medical evaluations,mls and paid for by liberty.the first review was conducted by reynold karr karr,a rheumatologist,who concluded that he did not identify any objective medical basis for impairment or need for physical restrictions based upon review of the accompanying medical record.the second mls review was conducted by matthew kaufman kaufman,an oncologist.kaufman indicated that,from his perspective as an oncologist,there was no identifiable or medically supported level of functional impairment that can be objectively verified.however,kaufman noted that fibromyalgia fell outside his area of expertise,and conceded that cusson may have a level of functional impairment due to fibromyalgia psychological overlay.
on november,liberty upheld its decision to terminate cusson benefits.liberty stated that based on the totality of clinical and objective medical documentation contained in cusson file,sedentary to light capacity has been established.
award of ssdi benefits 
on january,an administrative law judge alj awarded cusson ssdi benefits,with a disability date of march.in granting the benefits,the alj found that cusson was unable to do sustained work activities in an ordinary work setting on a regular and continuing basis.
district court proceedings 
on december,cusson filed suit against liberty and the ltd plan in the district of massachusetts under erisa,et.cusson sought to recover her benefits pursuant to a b.liberty answered and asserted a counterclaim seeking reimbursement for overpayment of benefits under the policy as a result of cusson having received ssdi benefits.the parties filed for summary judgment on all issues.
because the ltd plan gave liberty discretion to determine eligibility for benefits,the district court applied an abuse of discretion standard to liberty decision.under this standard,liberty decision would be upheld if it was reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.gannon metro.life ins,cir.the district court recognized that liberty had a structural conflict of interest,since it both evaluated benefit claims and paid the benefits.however,the district court,citing the supreme court decision in metropolitan life insurance glenn,held that even in the face of a conflict,the standard of review remained deferential,and that the conflict was one factor among many that a reviewing judge must take into account,d.
cusson made two main arguments in her district court case opposing the denial of benefits.first,she argued that liberty and its reviewers improperly used and interpreted the surveillance videos.second,she argued that liberty review process was flawed,and that these flaws showed that liberty decision was an abuse of discretion.the district court held that liberty decision to terminate her benefits was not an abuse of discretion.with respect to the surveillance results,the court held that,although the surveillance supported the inference that cusson could not perform sustained activity,the surveillance also supported the inference that cusson and figueroa had significantly overstated cusson functional limitations.the court also rejected cusson various claims of procedural unfairness in liberty review process.in addition to upholding liberty decision to terminate cusson benefits,the court also granted summary judgment to liberty on its counterclaim.
cusson now appeals the district court decision.
ii.discussion 
applicable law and standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.thompson coca cola,cir.normally,when we review a district court grant of summary judgment,w e will reverse only if,after reviewing the facts and making all inferences in favor of the party here,cusson,the evidence on record is sufficiently to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the issue in favor of either side.id.internal quotation marks omitted.however,in an erisa context,the district court sits more as an appellate tribunal than as a trial court.leahy raytheon,cir.in such cases,summary judgment is simply a vehicle for deciding the issue,and,consequently,the party is not entitled to the usual inferences in its favor.orndorf paul revere life ins,cir.
when an erisa plan gives the administrator the discretion to determine eligibility for benefits as in this case,a reviewing court must uphold that decision unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.gannon,at citing vlass raytheon employees disability trust,cir.however,cusson argues that the supreme court decision in glenn changed the standard of review from an abuse of discretion standard to a combination of factors standard in cases where,as here,there is a structural conflict of interest.we disagree.
in deciding what effect a conflict would have on the standard of review,the supreme court in glenn elucidate d what the court said in firestone,namely,that a conflict should be weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.glenn.at quoting firestone tire rubber bruch,d.however,the court went on to say,we do not believe that firestone statement implies a change in the standard of review,say,from deferential to de novo review.id.rather,the court said that firestone means what the word factor implies,namely,that when judges review the lawfulness of benefit denials,they will often take account of several different considerations of which a conflict of interest is one.id.at.
because glenn did not alter the standard of review,and because our review of the lower court grant of summary judgment is de novo,we will review liberty decision to deny cusson benefits under the same abuse of discretion standard used by the district court.see denmark liberty life assurance denmark iii,cir where the plan administrator has discretion,glenn baseline principle,consistent with this circuit prior precedents,is that judicial review of such a decision is for abuse of discretion.
appropriate weight given to the conflict of interest 
although the presence of a conflict of interest does not change the standard of review in this case,the conflict itself can,under certain circumstances,be accorded extra weight in the court analysis.in glenn,the supreme court held that t he conflict of interest at issue should prove more important perhaps of great importance where circumstances suggest a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision,including,but not limited to,cases where an insurance company administrator has a history of biased claims administration.at.on the other hand,the conflict should prove less important perhaps to the vanishing point where the administrator has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy.id.
we have interpreted this language from glenn to mean that courts are to inquire into what steps a plan administrator has taken to insulate the decisionmaking process against the potentially pernicious effects of structural conflicts.denmark iii,at.although cusson argues that it is liberty burden to show that the conflict did not affect its decision,the supreme court explicitly declined to specify a rule for determining the weight that a conflict should be given.see glenn.at neither do we believe it necessary or desirable for courts to create special rules,or other special procedural or evidentiary rules,focused narrowly upon the conflict.we therefore apply the same burden of proof to the conflict issue that we do to any other aspect of an erisa claim for improper denial of benefits hence,cusson bears the burden of showing that the conflict influenced liberty decision.see terry bayer,cir here,claimant bears the burden of making a showing sufficient to establish a violation of erisa,namely,that the benefit termination was unreasonable.internal quotation marks omitted.
cusson has not raised and,thus,the parties have not briefed the issue of the adequacy of liberty internal procedures to insulate the review process from the conflict.instead,cusson argues that certain alleged flaws in the way the review was conducted prove that liberty decision was influenced by its conflict.as discussed below,we do not find that these alleged flaws show that liberty was improperly influenced by its conflict.
firstly,cusson argues that liberty relied exclusively on millstein report,including his inaccurate statements about the surveillance results,rather than relying on the totality of the record.cusson correctly points out that in its initial denial letter,liberty quoted language that it claimed was from the surveillance reports,but that was actually from millstein interpretation of the surveillance.liberty also claimed that it relied on its tsa,but the record indicates that the tsa was based solely on millstein report.
we find nothing wrong with the degree of liberty reliance on millstein report.although the denial letter from liberty quoted millstein summary of the surveillance data,and not the surveillance reports themselves,the record also indicates that liberty case manager did review the tapes.moreover,as the district court noted,even though millstein made inaccurate statements about the surveillance data in his report,millstein main substantive point about the surveillance that it showed cusson engaged in activities that she claimed she could not do was accurate.many of the activities that cusson was observed doing were activities that she specifically reported being unable to do,such as bending at the waist and lifting objects heavier than ten pounds.moreover,when cusson was seen outside,she did not appear to show any signs of fatigue or impaired physical capabilities.while this is by no means ironclad proof of ability to work,it is evidence that liberty was entitled to consider.we read liberty decision as being based not simply on the amount of activity observed,but also on the nature of the activity observed,and millstein report contained no errors with respect to the latter.
next,cusson argues that liberty improperly relied on liebermann hearsay testimony about his conversation with figueroa.liebermann claimed that he spoke with figueroa and that figueroa understood that there was a significant discrepancy between the claimant reported functionality and what was seen on the surveillance tapes.liebermann further claimed that figueroa indicated that he had told cusson that he no longer wished to be involved in the disability aspect of her case.however,cusson noted that figueroa never responded to liebermann request to sign off on liebermann account of their conversation.thus,cusson argues,liebermann entire account of the conversation is hearsay that neither liberty nor the district court should have relied on in its decision.
however,a plan administrator is not a court of law and is not bound by the rules of evidence.speciale blue cross blue shield ass n,cir.because figueroa never responded to liebermann request to comment on his account of the conversation,it was not an abuse of discretion for liberty to assume that liebermann account of the conversation was accurate.since cusson never presented liberty with any evidence to challenge directly liebermann account of the conversation,we find nothing inappropriate about liberty reliance on that account.
cusson next argues that liberty reviewing physicians were biased against patients with fibromyalgia.although liebermann report mentions some of the evidence submitted by cusson,cusson alleges that liebermann reached his conclusion about her ability to work without actually analyzing the medical evidence in her file.in his report,liebermann stated this claimant has a diagnosis of f ibromyalgia.as such,she should be able to perform the duties of light or sedentary occupations.cusson argues that this statement indicates that liebermann had a preconceived notion that fibromyalgia could never be a disabling diagnosis,and thus did not fairly consider her file.similarly,millstein cited a study of fibromyalgia patients that indicated that most of them were eventually able to return to work.cusson points out that the seventh circuit has held that t he fact that the majority of individuals suffering from fibromyalgia can work is the weakest possible evidence that an individual claimant can.hawkins first union.long term disability plan,cir.
if liebermann or millstein had said that fibromyalgia patients are never disabled,those statements would be clearly wrong.however,although liebermann and millstein made statements that might be interpreted as improper generalizations,it does not necessarily follow that they relied on such generalizations when issuing their reports.had either doctor concluded that cusson was not disabled because fibromyalgia is never or not always disabling,that conclusion would have been inappropriate.however,both doctors reports indicate that they reviewed the surveillance footage and based their conclusions on the apparent contradiction between the footage and cusson reported impairments.
cusson also argues that liberty reliance on paper file reviews instead of direct medical examinations shows that it was influenced by its conflict.cusson acknowledges that this court has found a nonexamining physician review of a claimant file to be reliable medical evidence.gannon,at.however,cusson argues that the particular circumstances of this case warrant a preference for reports by examining physicians.she notes that fibromyalgia is a disease that can only be diagnosed by a clinical examination of a patient based on subjective reports of pain.certain circuits have held that in such cases some deference to examining physicians is appropriate.see,kalish liberty life assurance,cir hawkins,at the gravest problem with the opinion offered by an erisa plan administrator doctor was his refusal to accept subjective symptoms of pain and fatigue known to be associated with fibromyalgia.moreover,cusson notes that liberty reviewing physicians were paid for their reports by liberty,whereas cusson treating physicians were paid by her health insurance company.the supreme court has recognized that physicians repeatedly retained by benefits plans may have an incentive to make a finding of not disabled in order to save their employers money and to preserve their own consulting arrangements.black decker disability plan nord,d internal quotation marks omitted.
we see no reason why the nonexamining physicians reports in this case are unreliable.we recognize that fibromyalgia is a disease that is diagnosed primarily based on a patient pain symptoms.however,liberty reviewers did not question the diagnosis of fibromyalgia instead,they questioned the effect of the disease on cusson ability to work.t his court draws a distinction between requiring objective evidence of the diagnosis,which is impermissible for a condition such as fibromyalgia that does not lend itself to objective verification,and requiring objective evidence that the plaintiff is unable to work,which is allowed.denmark liberty life assurance denmark ii,cir,vacated on other grounds,cir.because it is permissible to require documented,objective evidence of disability,it was not inappropriate for liberty reviewers to rely on the lack of such documented evidence,or on the footage that contradicted cusson reports of limitations,in making their recommendations.the fact that liberty reviewers were paid for their reports does not,by itself,lead us to believe that liberty was influenced by its conflict,since cusson has provided no evidence that liberty retained its reviewers specifically because they have a record of denying claims.
next,cusson claims that liberty failed to provide her complete medical record to its reviewers.liberty internal files indicated that a ll medical records had been sent to its reviewers.however,the reviewers did not list certain documents that were favorable to cusson such as various medical records,her activity log,and portions of the surveillance reports that showed no activity in their reports.the district court held that under our holding in tsoulas liberty life assurance,it would be improper for the court automatically to assume that unless the medical report lists each item the examiner reviewed,he or she did not review it.see,cir.however,cusson argues that the district court reliance on tsoulas was incorrect.cusson points out that in tsoulas,the plaintiff claim that liberty failed to provide certain documents to the reviewers was obviously incorrect because some of the documents that the plaintiff said were missing were explicitly listed in those same reviewers reports.id.in contrast,the documents that cusson claims were not provided are not listed in any of liberty reviewers reports 
cusson attempt to distinguish tsoulas from this case fails.contrary to cusson
