the plaintiffs in this case are eight individuals involved in a clinical drug trial sponsored by amgen.when the study was terminated,the plaintiffs sued claiming that amgen was legally required to continue providing them with the drug.the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to require amgen to provide them with the drug immediately.the district court denied the motion and the plaintiffs appealed.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the district court denial of the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.
the plaintiffs are all kentucky residents that suffer from parkinson disease,a neurogenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of neurons in the brain,resulting in tremors,shaking,slow movement,and muscle stiffness and rigidity.the current treatment for parkinson disease focuses on replacing dopamine in the brains of parkinson disease sufferers,thus masking the symptoms of the disease.none of these current treatments are curative,however,as none of them halt the loss of neurons.
a colorado biotechnology company named synergen,designed a protein called gial derived neutrotropic factor,commonly known as gdnf,which studies preliminarily indicated could protect and restore dopamine producing neurons.believing that gdnf could potentially provide a breakthrough treatment for parkinson disease,amgen purchased synergen in for approximately million.having acquired the drug,however,amgen was now faced with the problem of how to effectively deliver gdnf to the brain.in,amgen sponsored two clinical studies of gdnf to determine whether a delivery method known as intracerebroventicular administration icv,in which the drug is injected directly into the central cavities of the patient brain,was effective.unfortunately,these studies failed to prove that icv was safe or effective as a delivery method.
subsequently,steven gill of frenchay hospital in bristol,england developed a means of delivering the drug directly to the brain known as bilateral intraputaminal ipu infusion.this procedure involves implanting a pump filled with gdnf in the patient abdomen attached to catheters which,when threaded through the patient check,neck,and head,deliver the gdnf directly to the putamen region of the brain.
in,amgen supported an trial in the united kingdom for the administration of gdnf using ipu with five patients suffering from parkinson disease.although the study yielded favorable results because the study was,meaning study participants knew they were receiving gdnf and no participants received a placebo,amgen concluded that more research was necessary.another study was also conducted at the university of kentucky medical center in which gdnf was administered via ipu to ten patients all ten of these patients showed benefits after six months of treatment but,it was unclear whether this improvement was the result of the gdnf or a placebo effect as there was no control group in the study.
based on the result studies,in amgen sponsored a phase ii,randomized,study of gdnf using the ipu method of delivery in order to test its safety and efficacy.as part of this study,amgen and the university of kentucky entered into a clinical trial agreement.under the agreement,amgen agreed to sponsor the university as one of the study center locations and the university agreed to carry out amgen protocol for the trial.amgen protocol,which was approved by the institutional review board at the university,indicated that the trial would begin with each participant having a pump inserted in their abdomen and the catheter inserted through a hole drilled in their skull.the participants would then receive treatment or a saline placebo solution for approximately weeks.at the end of the study,the protocol indicated that the participants may elect to continue treatment for up to an additional months.
the plaintiffs in this case elected to participate in the clinical trial at the university.each plaintiff signed an informed consent document,indicating that they were aware of the risks of the clinical trial and agreeing to participate.like the protocol,the informed consent document indicated that study participants could elect to continue treatment for months after the end of the study.the informed consent document also informed participants in the study that they might be required to withdraw from the study if they find that your being in the study is more risk than benefit to you,if you are not able to follow the directions they give you,or if the agency funding the study decides to stop the study early for a variety of reasons.the informed consent document was signed by each participant and by the physician investigators leading the study.
using the unified parkinson disease rating scale amgen hoped to see a increase in motor scores relative to the placebo after six months of treatment.in june,the study results showed only a increase in the group using gdnf and a increase in the group being administered the placebo.seven of the subjects demonstrated dramatic improvement,but four of the seven were receiving the placebo.
despite these less than stellar results,amgen decided to continue with the clinical trial but convert it into an study with all patients receiving gdnf.the plaintiffs contend that after gdnf was administered,they experienced marked physical,cognitive,and emotional improvement.the plaintiffs also have submitted affidavits from several patients from other study locations attesting to similar improvements.moreover,the plaintiffs have submitted affidavits from all of the doctors participating in the university of kentucky study and principal investigators involved in the new york and chicago studies that unanimously state that gdnf is safe and effective.
despite the plaintiffs belief that gdnf was working,in september,amgen announced that it was terminating all clinical use of gdnf based on two scientific concerns.the first was the discovery that several study participants had developed neutralizing antibodies.antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that attack substances such as viruses,bacteria,and in some cases,synthetic proteins like gdnf.such neutralizing antibodies could clear the drug from a patient system,neutralizing the effects of the drug.more worrisome to amgen,however,was that the antibodies could attack naturally occurring gdnf in the body.while it is unclear what naturally occurring gdnf does,animal studies have shown that an absence of gdnf during development causes irreversible damage to vital organs.
the second disturbing discovery was that several primates used in a toxicology study of ipu delivered gdnf developed lesions in the cerebullum,an area of the brain critical for movement and coordination.based on these concerning scientific findings along with the lack of efficacy shown by the study,amgen made the decision to terminate the study.amgen consulted the fda regarding discontinuation of the study and the fda indicated that given the evidence termination of the study was reasonable.
the plaintiffs claim that the drug is effective and that amgen has exaggerated the safety risks of gdnf.the plaintiffs submitted to the district court an affidavit from the principal investigator of the new york study suggesting that the primates legions were not a cause for alarm as the primates received larger doses of gdnf than study participants received and because the primates,unlike the study participants,were rapidly withdrawn from gdnf.the affidavit also disagreed with amgen placebo effect theory and asserted that the antibodies found in several study participants were not harmful.
the plaintiffs assert that amgen reasons for ending the study were financial rather than safety and efficacy.they allege that because of the prolonged time it took amgen to develop a delivery method for gdnf,amgen has little time left before its patent on the drug expires.moreover,based on the invasive means of delivering the drug,only those with severe parkinson disease would use the drug,leading to less profit.finally,gdnf has a short shelf life and thus amgen would constantly be required to produce new proteins.the plaintiffs claim that all of these considerations led amgen to conclude that it was financially untenable to bring the drug to market and thus amgen terminated the study.amgen vehemently disputes the plaintiffs claims 
after deciding to terminate the study,several investigators and amgen met with the fda to consider whether to permit compassionate use,meaning use of a drug even if the drug is proven unsafe,of gdnf for the participants.the fda stated that it would permit compassionate use of gdnf but left the decision up to amgen.after seeking advice of eight external experts three bioethicists and five parkinson disease experts,seven of whom advised amgen to terminate the use of the drug,amgen decided not to allow compassionate use of gdnf.
the plaintiffs filed suit on june,naming amgen as the sole defendant.the district court had jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship,and none of the plaintiffs causes of action arise under federal law.on june,the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction requiring amgen to provide the physicians at the university of kentucky with gdnf and to allow the doctors to administer it to the plaintiffs.none of the plaintiffs have received gdnf treatment since september.
the plaintiffs advanced three legal theories to support their motion for a preliminary injunction.first,they claimed that gdnf is beneficial to them,and that amgen is contractually obligated to supply them with gdnf.second,they argued that amgen is liable under a theory of promissory estoppel as amgen promised to continue to provide the plaintiffs with gdnf and the plaintiffs detrimentally relied on this promise.third,they asserted that amgen owes them a fiduciary duty,and that is has breached that duty by unreasonably denying them access to gdnf.in response,amgen denied that it made any such enforceable promises to the plaintiffs and denied owing the plaintiffs any fiduciary duty.
the district court held a hearing on the plaintiffs motion on july and on july denied the motion.the district court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate a strong likelihood of success on the merits based on any of their claims.the district court also concluded that the plaintiffs could not prove that they would suffer irreparable harm if they did not obtain a preliminary injunction nor could they establish that public policy would be furthered by issuing the injunction.thus,the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.this appeal ensued.
the district court decision to deny the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction relied in part on a decision from the southern district of new york in a nearly identical case,suthers amgen,d.in suthers,two parkinson disease sufferers who participated in the amgen study at the new york university site filed suit against amgen in the southern district of new york and sought a preliminary injunction requiring amgen to provide them with gdnf.the plaintiffs in suthers advanced nearly identical legal claims as this case breach of contract,promissory estoppel,and breach of fiduciary duty.the district court denied the plaintiffs motion on grounds similar to the district court reasoning here.specifically,the suthers court concluded that the plaintiffs have shown neither a likelihood of success nor a sufficiently serious showing of merits to warrant the extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction.id.at.the court found that the plaintiffs breach of contract claim was unlikely to succeed because the plaintiffs could not show any contract between the plaintiffs and amgen.while their informed consent document arguably gave them a right to gdnf,the court concluded that this agreement was between the plaintiffs and new york university rather than the plaintiffs and amgen,and that the principal investigators did not have the authority to bind amgen.the court also concluded that the plaintiffs promissory estoppel argument had little chance of success as amgen had made no direct promises to the plaintiffs.finally,the court held that under the facts of the case,amgen did not have a fiduciary duty to continue treatment.as a result of these determinations the district court did not address whether the plaintiffs or the defendants would suffer irreparable harm based on the district court decision.the plaintiffs in suthers initially appealed the district court decision but later withdrew their appeal.
the plaintiffs assert that the district court erred in denying their motion for a preliminary injunction.we review a district court grant of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.tucker city of fairfield,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,improperly applies the law,or uses an erroneous legal standard.id.a district court errs only if it incorrectly applied the law,or relied on clearly erroneous findings of fact.ramsey formica,cir.we review the district court conclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.golden,cir.
to determine whether to grant a preliminary injunction,a district court must consider the plaintiffs likelihood of success on the merits whether the plaintiff may suffer irreparable harm absent the injunction whether granting the injunction will cause substantial harm to others and the impact of an injunction upon the public interest.deja vu of nashville,metro.gov t of nashville davidson county,cir.none of these factors,standing alone,is a prerequisite to relief rather,the court should balance them.golden,at.thus,even though a finding of no likelihood of success is usually fatal,gonzales bd.of med.exam rs,cir,a district court should ordinarily analyze all of the factors.leary daeschner,cir.we will review the district court analysis as to each of these factors in order to ensure that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.
the first factors to be considered is whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.the plaintiffs identify three grounds on which they allege that amgen is legally obligated to provide them with of contract,promissory estoppel and fiduciary duty.the district court concluded that the plaintiffs had little chance of success on any of these grounds.we find nothing in the record that suggests the district court abused its discretion in reaching such a conclusion.
turning first to the plaintiffs breach of contract claim,the district court concluded that there was no breach of contract by amgen because no contract ever existed between the plaintiffs and amgen that required amgen to continue to provide the plaintiffs with gdnf.the court found that the informed consent document that the plaintiffs rely upon as evidence of a contract between them and amgen did not directly bind amgen because neither amgen nor any agent of amgen signed the informed consent document.we find no abuse of discretion in the district court conclusion on this point.
under kentucky law,in order to recover in any action based on breach of a contract,a plaintiff must show the existence and the breach of a contractually imposed duty.lenning commercial union ins,cir citing strong louisville nashville.thus,the plaintiffs must show by clear and convincing evidence proof of an actual agreement between them and amgen.see auto channel,speedvision network,llc,d.
the plaintiffs admit that amgen did not sign the informed consent document,which the plaintiffs point to as the primary basis for their breach of contract claim.moreover,there are no other documents that create a contractually enforceable duty for amgen to continue to provide gdnf to the plaintiffs.the clinical trial agreement was not signed by the plaintiffs but rather was signed by amgen,the university of kentucky,and the principal investigators.thus,the plaintiffs claim that amgen is directly contractually obligated to provide the plaintiffs with gdnf is unlikely to succeed on the merits because it is axiomatic that courts can not bind a to a contract because that party never agreed to the terms set forth therein.eeoc frank nursery crafts,cir 
moreover,the principal investigators in the university of kentucky study were not in a position to enter into a binding contract with the plaintiffs on amgen behalf,as the district court correctly concluded that the principal investigators were independent contractors rather than amgen agents.under kentucky law,whether a relationship is created rather than merely a contractor relationship is determined by examining the following factors 
a the extent of control which,by the agreement,the master may exercise over the details of the work 
b whether or not the one employed is engaged in a distinct occupation or business 
c the kind of occupation,with reference to whether,in the locality,the work is usually done under the direction of the employer or by a specialist without supervision 
d the skill required in the particular occupation 
e whether the employer or the workman supplies the instrumentalities,tools,and the place of work for the person doing the work 
f the length of time for which the person is employed 
g the method of payment,whether by the time or by the job 
h whether or not the work is a part of the regular business of the employer and 
i whether or not the parties believe they are creating the relationship of master and servant.
sam horne motor implement gregg.of these factors,the most critical element in determining whether an agency relationship exists is whether the alleged principal has the right to control the details of the agent work.grant bill walker,cir bottled gas,cir.
here,the above factors suggest that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the plaintiffs had little chance of success based on their agency theory of contract liability.as the district court properly pointed out the clinical trial agreement provides that the institution agrees to act as an independent contractor without the capacity to legally bind amgen and also agrees that it is not acting as an agent or employee of amgen.because the kentucky doctors were employees of the university of kentucky,they too were independent contractors lacking the power to bind amgen.abney amgen,wl july.citing berry delta airlines,cir,for the proposition that an employee of an independent contractor typically can not be considered an agent of the employer.
other factors also indicate that the principal investigators were independent contractors and not agents of amgen.the set up of the kentucky study,consistent with federal regulations,left the principal investigators in charge of the details of the work.see indicating that in a clinical drug trial a n investigator is responsible for ensuring that an investigation is conducted according to the signed investigator statement,the investigational plan,and applicable regulations for protecting the rights,safety,and welfare of subjects under the investigator care and for the control of drugs under investigation.furthermore the principal investigators drafted and implemented the protocol for the study themselves,not amgen.moreover,the doctors were highly specialized professionals with extensive experience in their field.the study took place at the university of kentucky,not at an amgen facility.the university also received a set amount of money from amgen as a result of the study.finally,as the documents regarding the study indicated,the study was structured such that amgen sponsorship of the study would be independent of control over the study.thus,the above factors indicate that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that it was unlikely that any direct agency relationship existed between amgen and the university of kentucky or its physicians.
moreover,the record suggests that the district court was similarly correct in concluding that it was unlikely that the principal investigators had any apparent authority to bind amgen.apparent authority,which may be possessed by an independent contractor,is the authority the agent is held out by the principal as possessing.it is a matter of appearance on which third parties come to rely.mill church of christ hogan,emphasis added.nothing in the record nor in the plaintiffs brief demonstrates any representations made by amgen to the plaintiffs that could have led the plaintiffs to believe that the principal investigators were agents of amgen for purposes of the study.nothing suggests that amgen even had any contact with any of the plaintiffs as it was the principal investigators who controlled the study and were in charge of the plaintiffs care.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the plaintiffs claim based on apparent authority had little chance of success on the merits.
the plaintiffs second claim is that amgen is legally required to provide them with gdnf based on promissory estoppel.the plaintiffs promissory estoppel argument is premised on their claim that the principal investigators informed them that they would make decisions based upon the patients best interests and that if gdnf proved to be safe and effective,study participants could continue to receive the medication following termination of the study.the district court concluded that the plaintiffs have not shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits because the plaintiffs have not submitted any evidence of a clear promise by amgen.the district court did not abuse its discretion in reaching such a conclusion.
promissory estoppel requires a promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee which does induce such action or forbearance and injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.bergman baptist healthcare,d,analyzing kentucky law.where there is no evidence of a promise,promissory estoppel can not be established.
in this case,there is no evidence of a promise by amgen to continue to provide the plaintiffs with gdnf following the termination of the study.the plaintiffs do not assert that amgen directly promised to continue to provide them with gdnf.instead,they assert that the principal investigators promised that the plaintiffs would continue to receive the medication and that subsequently amgen is bound by those promises.this theory is untenable,however,because,as discussed above,neither the university of kentucky nor the principal investigators were agents of amgen.there is also no evidence that the university or the principal investigators had the apparent authority to bind amgen via their promises to the plaintiffs.as a result,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that there is little chance that the plaintiffs will succeed on the merits of this claim.
the plaintiffs final claim is that amgen,working through the principal investigators,breached its fiduciary duty to ameliorate their pain and treat their illness with the best medicine available.the district court held that amgen had no fiduciary duty to continue to supply the plaintiffs with gdnf.the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the plaintiffs likelihood of success on this claim is minimal.
under kentucky law,while there is no set formula for determining whether a fiduciary duty exists,as a general rule,courts can conclude that such a relationship is one founded on trust or confidence reposed by one person in the integrity and fidelity of another and which also necessarily involves an undertaking in which a duty is created in one person to act primarily for another benefit in matters connected with such undertaking.steelvest,scansteel serv,layne bank one,cir.while f iduciary relationships can be informal,they must evidence circumstances showing both parties agreed that one party would be acting in the interest of the other.in re sallee,cir.
in this case,the record does not demonstrate that amgen and the plaintiffs agreed that amgen would be acting primarily for the benefit of the plaintiffs.amgen had various reasons for the undertaking sponsorship of the university of kentucky study.while benefitting the plaintiffs could arguably be described as one of those reasons,there is nothing to suggest that the parties agreed
