this case involves a medicare provider at first paid in full for certain medical services but later determined,through operation of the congressionally mandated recovery audit contractor rac program,to be liable to repay the government for these services found not to be medically reasonable and necessary.we must decide whether such a medicare provider may in its appeal of the revised determination of overpayment challenge a lack of good cause for reopening the initial,erroneous determination.
palomar medical center palomar is a medicare service provider located in escondido,california.the secretary of health and human services the secretary administers the medicare program through the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms.this case concerns inpatient rehabilitation services that palomar gave a medicare patient after a hip surgery.there was no question that the patient needed rehabilitation services but through several levels of administrative appeal,these services were found not reasonable and necessary and not covered by medicare because they were done in the hospital rather than in a less intensive and less expensive setting.
cms had reimbursed palomar claim for these services in full.congress,however,had enacted the rac program,aimed at recovering medicare overpayments,and a rac reopened palomar claim to determine whether there had been an overpayment.the audit did not fare well for palomar,as the rac determined that palomar had been overpaid because the services provided were not medically reasonable and necessary.palomar was held liable for the overpayment by the rac,and this conclusion was confirmed at four levels of administrative appeal.among these,an administrative law judge alj had decided that the overpayment would have to be accepted because there was not good cause to reopen the claim.but the medicare appeals council mac then reversed that decision,concluding that the alj had no jurisdiction to review the rac decision to reopen.
congress had said that medicare claims could be reopened under guidelines set by the secretary in regulations the secretary had adopted regulations that are material here one regulation says that a contractor decision to reopen is final and not subject to appeal a second regulation says that such a decision is not appealable and a third regulation says that a reopening in the period of one to four years after an initial determination to pay a claim is to be upon good cause for reopening 
a revised determination issued after a reopening is appealable in this appeal,palomar contends that a medicare provider may challenge a revised determination based on lack of good cause for reopening,even though it could not challenge the reopening immediately thereafter.the district court granted summary judgment for the secretary,holding that because the regulations bar appeals of reopenings,it makes no sense to permit challenges to the basis for reopening after a revised determination has issued.
that decision comes to us on appeal and poses the question whether the requirement of good cause for reopening should have been a limitation on the rac audit of palomar that could be enforced by palomar appeal of the rac decision.it is not an easy question because of competing principles.on the one hand,congress wanted an effective recovery audit program to reduce medicare payments with resulting benefits for medicare beneficiaries and taxpayers,under procedures set by the secretary.on the other hand,the provider has a legitimate interest in finality of determinations on its revenue for medical services.however,in view of the goals of the rac program and the secretary regulations stating that decisions to reopen are final and not appealable,we hold that the issue of good cause for reopening can not be raised after an audit conclusion and the revision of a paid claim for medical services,and affirm the district court.
background 
to place this appeal in context,we start with an explanation of medicare and its system for payments and administrative appeals,then discuss the rac program,and end with a discussion of the nature of palomar claims.
a.the medicare program 
medicare is a federally funded health insurance program for aged and disabled persons.et.medicare part a gives insurance benefits for inpatient hospital and related services and makes reimbursement payments to those who provide such services.id.through cms,the secretary contracts with fiscal intermediaries,generally private insurance companies,to perform coverage determination and payment functions.id,erringer thompson,cir.
medicare coverage is limited to services that are medically reasonable and necessary.a a.medicare service providers,such as palomar,submit claims for reimbursement for covered services,and their fiscal intermediaries make initial determinations of coverage and amount.id.a.initial determinations are appealable.see.in the administrative appeals process,a medicare provider may request a redetermination by its fiscal intermediary,id.appeal a redetermination to a qualified independent contractor qic for a reconsideration,id.appeal a reconsideration to,and request a hearing before,an alj,id.and appeal an alj decision to the mac,id.the mac decision is the final decision of the secretary and may be appealed to a federal district court.g.
in certain circumstances,an otherwise final determination or decision may be reopened.see.early medicare regulations on reopening generally incorporated social security regulations on reopening.then,in,congress added to the medicare statute a provision governing reopening and revision of determinations.this provision states,the secretary may reopen or revise any initial determination or reconsidered determination described in this subsection under guidelines established by the secretary in regulations.b g.in,cms promulgated an interim final rule that established regulations implementing the reopening provision and other statutory changes.at 
the regulations define a reopening as a remedial action taken to change a binding determination or decision that resulted in either an overpayment or underpayment,even though the binding determination or decision may have been correct at the time it was made based on the evidence of record.a.a provider may request a reopening,or the contractor,qic,alj,or mac may initiate a reopening on its own motion.id.b e.at.
a contractor may reopen a determination on its own motion within one year for any reason or within four years for good cause.b.good cause may be established if there is new and material evidence that was not available or known at the time of the determination that m ay result in a different conclusion,or t he evidence that was considered in making the determination or decision clearly shows on its face that an obvious error was made at the time of the determination or decision.id.a.
two of the reopening regulations are subject to conflicting interpretive arguments and to challenge on this appeal.first,a states that t he contractor,qic,alj,or mac decision on whether to reopen is final and not subject to appeal.second,l states that a contractor,qic,alj,or mac determination or decision to reopen or not to reopen an initial determination,redetermination,reconsideration,hearing decision,or review decision is not an initial determination and is not appealable.
by contrast,a revised determination or decision that results from a reopening is appealable,but o nly the portion of the initial determination revised by the reopening may be subsequently appealed.a,f.
in the preamble to the interim final rule on reopenings,cms responded to comments about enforcement of the good cause standard.at.a commenter recommended that cms create enforcement provisions for the good cause standard when contractors reopen claims,because,according to the commenter,contractors often ignore the guidelines set out in regulations and manuals and cite a request for medical records as good cause for a reopening,even though the medical records existed at the time the contractor initially reviewed the claim.id.in response,cms said 
the regulations require that contractors abide by the good cause standard for reopening actions after one year from the date of the initial or revised determination.cms assesses a contractor compliance with federal laws,regulations and manual instructions during audits and evaluations of the contractors performance.thus,the necessary monitoring and enforcement mechanisms are already in place.
b.the recovery audit contractor program 
more than one billion medicare claims are processed each year.ctrs.for medicare medicaid,the medicare recovery audit contractor rac program an evaluation of the year demonstration hereinafter rac evaluation report.thousands are paid improperly,most commonly because they are for services that were not medically necessary or were improperly coded.see id.at.cms makes efforts to calculate,reduce,and prevent improper payments.yet improper payments for medicare constitute a high percentage,more than ten percent,of all payment errors in federal programs.id.
to supplement cms efforts to protect the fiscal integrity of the medicare program,congress enacted the rac program.congress told the secretary to conduct a demonstration project using racs to identify underpayments and overpayments and recoup overpayments under the medicare program.medicare prescription drug,improvement,and modernization act of mma,a,stat.congress directed the secretary to examine the efficacy of the use of racs with respect to duplicative payments,accuracy of coding,and other payment policies in which inaccurate payments arise.id.a.the statute specified the scope and duration of the rac demonstration project at least two states having high per capita utilization of medicare and not longer than three certain qualifications for racs,and also permitted payment to racs on a contingent basis.see id.a,b,d.congress decided to rest on the secretary expertise and did not give the secretary further direction on the means of implementing the rac program.
the rac demonstration project began in march and ended in march.rac evaluation report.cms selected three states,california,new york,and florida,and three racs each rac had jurisdiction in a single state.id 
under the demonstration project,racs reviewed paid medicare claims to identify and correct improper payments.they were bound by medicare policies,regulations,local and national coverage determinations,and manual instructions.id.at.during the demonstration,cms gave each rac medicare claims data from through.id.at.cms did not specify a procedure for analyzing the claims data.rather,each rac used its own methodology to identify claims that clearly contained errors resulting in improper payments and claims that likely contained such errors.id.in cases of clear improper payments,such as duplicate claims,racs performed automated review,where they notified the provider of any underpayment or overpayment amount.id.in cases of likely improper payments,racs performed complex review,where they requested medical records from the provider to further review the claim and then made a determination on the accuracy of payment.id.rac determinations constituted initial determinations that could be appealed to a fiscal intermediary,qic,alj,mac,and federal district court.
through the demonstration project,racs successfully corrected more than billion in improper medicare payments about million in overpayments collected from providers and about million in underpayments repaid to providers.id.at.the net savings returned to the medicare trust funds,after subtracting underpayments repaid,amounts overturned on appeal,and costs of operating the rac demonstration,was nearly million.
in light of the demonstration project success,congress made the rac program a permanent part of the medicare integrity program and expanded its coverage to all states.h.
c.the facts underlying palomar claims and appeal 
in june,palomar provided inpatient rehabilitation facility irf services to john doe,a year old man who had undergone a right total hip arthroplasty.on july,a fiscal intermediary paid palomar claim of for the irf services provided to doe 
under the rac demonstration project,the rac for california,prg schultz the rac,selected palomar claim for complex review.on april,cms sent palomar a letter notifying it that the rac had selected one or more of its claims for review.on the same date,the rac sent palomar a letter requesting medical records and documentation to support the medical necessity of doe irf stay.the letter said that the request was due to a recent review and discovery of potential overpayment of your medicare paid claim s.palomar tendered the requested records and documentation,and on july,the rac notified palomar of its revised determination of overpayment because doe rehabilitation in an inpatient hospital facility was not reasonable and necessary.see a a.the rac told palomar that it had to repay the overpayment amount.
decisions at four levels of administrative review affirmed the rac initial determination of overpayment.a redetermination by a fiscal intermediary and a reconsideration by a qic each held that the rehabilitation services were not medically necessary and excessive because they were given in a hospital instead of a less intensive setting such as a skilled nursing facility.the alj next agreed that palomar services were not medically reasonable and necessary,though it gave relief on the ground that there was not good cause for the reopening by the rac the mac then reversed the alj decision,concluding that neither the alj nor the mac had jurisdiction to assess good cause for reopening because the rac decision to reopen was not subject to the administrative appeals process and the services were not medically reasonable and necessary.
palomar appealed the mac decision on the reviewability of the reopening to the district court,but did not challenge the mac decision that the irf services were not reasonable and necessary.palomar and the secretary filed cross motions for summary judgment,and the district court referred the case to a magistrate judge.
the magistrate judge first gave the secretary interpretation of the reopening regulations substantial deference under thomas jefferson university shalala,d,and gave the regulations themselves chevron deference.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.applying thomas jefferson,the magistrate judge concluded that the secretary interpretation was consistent with both the plain language of l and a and cms statement in the interim final rule that it would enforce the good cause standard through its own internal procedures rather than through the administrative appeals process.see at.the magistrate judge reasoned that.a states on its face that a decision on whether to reopen is not appealable,and that there was essentially no distinction between challenging the discretionary decision to reopen and challenging the legality of the reopening,because the fact of the reopening is not appealable.the magistrate judge thus accepted the secretary interpretation and concluded that palomar could not challenge the reopening.it did not decide whether the rac had good cause to reopen because,it stated,that issue is not appealable.the magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny palomar motion for summary judgment and grant the secretary motion for summary judgment.
the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation.the district court agreed that it owed deference to the secretary interpretation because it was consistent with the plain language of the regulations and the secretary intent at the time she promulgated the regulations that the rac reopening of palomar claim was not subject to administrative appeal and that palomar was not deprived of due process.the district court also held that it did not have jurisdiction to review the merits of palomar challenge to the reopening because the reopening was not appealable.palomar timely appealed 
ii.jurisdiction and standards of review we have jurisdiction under g and b a and.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.kaiser found.hosps.sebelius,cir.the administrative procedure act apa governs our review of the secretary actions.see id.under the apa,we will hold unlawful and set aside an agency action that is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.
iii.discussion 
we consider palomar challenge to the secretary interpretation of the applicable regulations palomar position that the regulations,if interpreted adversely to its position,violate the governing medicare statute and palomar argument that even if the agency can not on administrative appeal assess good cause for reopening,a federal district court has jurisdiction to make that assessment.
palomar challenge to the secretary interpretation of the regulations 
palomar first challenges the secretary interpretation of.l and a under the apa,et.
we give substantial deference to the secretary interpretation of medicare regulations.thomas jefferson,u.at robert kennedy med.ctr.leavitt,cir.the secretary interpretation is controlling unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer robbins,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in other words,we must defer to the secretary interpretation unless an alternative reading is compelled by the regulation s plain language or by other indications of the secretary intent at the time of the regulation s promulgation.thomas jefferson,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
palomar contends that the secretary interpretation of the regulations to bar provider challenges to rac reopenings based on lack of good cause is not entitled to deference because it is inconsistent with the regulations plain language and the secretary prior interpretation and application of similarly worded reopening provisions.we disagree.
the contested regulations provide by their express terms that t he contractor,qic,alj,or mac decision on whether to reopen is final and not subject to appeal,a,and similarly that a contractor,qic,alj,or mac determination or decision to reopen or not to reopen is not an initial determination and is not appealable,id.l.the reopening regulations elsewhere provide,on the other hand,that a revised determination or decision resulting from a reopening is appealable.id.
the secretary interprets the language barring appeals of decisions on whether to reopen and decisions to reopen or not to reopen to mean that the regulations foreclose any challenge to a decision to reopen,even after a revised determination or decision has issued.so the secretary reasons that palomar could have appealed the issue of medical necessity the substance of whether it was compensated in an amount beyond what was covered under medicare but it can not now gripe on appeal about whether its claim should have been reopened.palomar argues that the cited regulatory language forecloses only challenges to the threshold decision to reopen or not to reopen.under palomar interpretation,a provider may not appeal the denial of a request to reopen or the reopening of a claim that is not revised,but a reopened claim that is revised is fair game for appeal on both the portion of the determination or decision revised and the validity of the underlying reopening.
if the regulations had merely foreclosed an appeal of the decision to reopen,we might give more credence to palomar argument.but the regulations say that the reopening decision is not only not appealable,it is also final.the secretary interpretation of the words final and not subject to appeal and not appealable to mean that a contractor decision to reopen may not be challenged at any time for any reason is not only reasonable and permissible it is the most natural reading of the regulations.see l,a.final is defined as not to be undone,altered,or revoked conclusive.oxford english dictionary ed see also american heritage dictionary ed online version n ot to be changed or reconsidered unalterable webster third new international dictionary not to be altered or undone.the regulations expressly state that decisions on reopening are final and may not be appealed.if a decision to reopen could not be appealed immediately,but good cause for reopening could be litigated after a revised determination had issued,then the decision to reopen would not in a real sense be final.we conclude that the regulations mean what they say reopening decisions are final,and final means they can not be challenged after an audit and revised determination.
palomar contrary position,if credited as a necessary interpretation of the regulations,would lead to a bizarre and inefficient system of recovery audits and appeals.all agree,including palomar,that there could be no appeal of an initial decision to reopen a claim.but palomar interpretation that the good cause issue could then be brought in through the back door after a revised claim determination would mean that the government to state its best case would on every reopening have to make a record of the good cause for the reopening.that would be inefficient and tilt the focus from the reasonableness and necessity of providing medical services to the strength of the rac grounds for reopening.
we are not unsympathetic to the interest of palomar in finality of its medical services receipts.but congress created the rac program and gave the secretary discretion to set regulations that would govern reopening of medicare claims.the secretary in her regulations said that there would be no appeal of a reopening and that a decision to reopen was to be final.in these circumstances,the values that congress stressed in setting up the rac program,as well as fairness to providers,seem to be accommodated well by a system in which there is no ability to appeal a reopening decision when made there is ability to appeal the merits of any revised determination of a claim after a reopening,but no ability at that time to litigate good cause for the reopening and the secretary has discretion to enforce the good cause standard by means of her own choosing,including reviewing rac performance by looking at determinations overturned on appeal,instructing racs to consistently document their good cause,and gaining independent,reviews to ensure the accuracy of rac claim determinations.rac evaluation report.further,if good cause for reopening could be raised on appeal after a revised determination,this would result in inefficiency in any case where good cause was later rejected,because all of the evidence and proceedings on the merits of medical necessity would be wasted 
for the reasons stated,the plain language of the regulations supports the secretary interpretation.palomar contrary interpretation is by no means compelled by the regulation s plain language.thomas jefferson,at internal quotation marks omitted.
palomar urges us to consider the language of the regulations in light of their prior interpretation and application and argues that,so considered,the secretary current interpretation deserves no deference because it is inconsistent with her prior interpretation and application of reopening provisions in other contexts.see regents of of cal.shalala,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
palomar claims three examples of the secretary allegedly inconsistent prior interpretations.first,the secretary permitted procedural challenges to social security administration ssa and pre medicare reopenings despite a social security handbook provision stating that t he decision to reopen or not to reopen is not an initial determination and is not subject to appeal.see soc.sec,social security handbook see also,cole ex rel.cole barnhart,cir heins shalala,cir in re umdnj,wl.second,the secretary has permitted provider appeals challenging the lawfulness of medicare cost report reopenings,despite a regulation stating,a determination or decision to reopen or not to reopen a determination or decision is not a final determination or decision within the meaning of this subpart and is not subject to further administrative review or judicial review.a see,canon health care hospice,llc bluecross blueshield ass gov t benefits adm r,wl,at,see also harrison house of georgetown bluecross blueshield ass medi care,wl,at.third,in palomar separate appeal of a different rac reopening,in re palomar medical center palomar i,the mac vacated the alj decision that the rac did not establish fraud or good cause for reopening and remanded the case to the alj to give the parties an opportunity to present evidence on the basis for reopening,as the alj had raised that issue in the first instance.
palomar contends that because the secretary has permitted procedural challenges to ssa reopenings,pre medicare claim reopenings,post medicare cost report reopenings,and impliedly,the rac reopening in palomar i,her interpretation of l and a to bar such challenges is not entitled to deference and is invalid.we are not persuaded for several reasons.
first,palomar overlooks that the secretary promulgated the regulations at about the same time that the rac program started.congress set the rac demonstration project in december.rac evaluation report.cms announced the demonstration in january,and the demonstration began on march.id.on march,cms promulgated the reopening regulations,including l and a,and they became effective on may.id.because cms promulgated and began applying the reopening regulations when it began the rac demonstration project,it had in mind the goals of the rac program.congress had authorized the rac program to improve the accuracy of medicare payments and recoup overpayments.cms made a policy choice not to subject rac reopening decisions to administrative review,thereby placing the focus of an appeal of a revised determination on the merits of the revision,in furtherance of congressional aims,rather than on the rac basis for reopening.
moreover,in the preamble to the regulations,cms made clear its aim to enforce the time limits and standards for reopening through internal procedures rather than through administrative appeals.in response to a commenter complaint that contractors request medical records to justify reopening decisions even though the records existed when the initial determinations were made,cms said that it monitored and enforced contractors compliance with the good cause standard through audits and evaluations of the contractors performance,and it declined to create enforcement provisions for the good cause standard,in addition to the internal mechanisms already in place.at.these statements by cms reinforce the plain language of the regulations,and make clear that providers may not challenge reopening decisions based on lack of good cause or the other regulatory requirements for reopening.
finally,the issue we face is the secretary interpretation of two newly promulgated regulations on the reopening of medicare claim determinations,not her interpretation of other regulations governing ssa reopenings or medicare cost report reopenings.congress did not intend to forever bind cms to ssa policies.before congress authorized the reopening and revision of medicare claim determinations,no independent set of regulations governed medicare reopenings instead,ssa regulations generally governed.then,in,congress authorized medicare reopenings,and in,congress mandated the rac demonstration project.the secretary then promulgated independent medicare reopening regulations and included in them two regulations that nowhere exist in ssa regulations.see,containing no analogue of a.compare listing among a ctions that are not initial determinations and are not appealable a medicare contractor decision to reopen or not to reopen emphasis added,with listing among a dministrative actions that are not initial determinations and are not subject to the administrative review process an ssa denial of a request to reopen but not an affirmative decision to reopen.the challenged regulations are similarly distinct from the medicare cost report reopening regulations cited by palomar,as cost report determinations are subject to a separate appeals process from claim determinations and are not included in the rac program.
neither the secretary prior conduct of ssa reopenings nor her subsequent conduct of cost report reopenings make her interpretation of l and a plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation s.auer,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the secretary has consistently held that these regulations bar administrative review of racs compliance with the time limits and standards for reopening.see,in re motta,wl,at,in re joseph,wl,at,in re reg l med,wl,at,in re providence joseph med,wl,at july.palomar i does not undermine the secretary position because there,in contrast to cases,the issue of administrative reviewability was not raised or decided.
we hold that the secretary interpretation of her reopening regulations is controlling and is not arbitrary and capricious under the apa.see auer,at 
palomar contention that if the secretary regulatory interpretation is followed,the regulations violate the medicare statute 
palomar next contends that if the reopening regulations foreclose review of the reopening deadlines and standards,the regulations are invalid under the apa.
in reviewing an agency construction of a statute that it is charged with administering,we ask,first,whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at resident councils of leavitt,cir.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.but if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,we do not simply impose our own construction on the statute,but rather,ask,second,whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.if the agency construction is reasonable,we defer to it.see resident councils,at.
if congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.such legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,at.
the medicare statute states the secretary may reopen or revise any initial determination or reconsidered determination described in this subsection under guidelines established by the secretary in regulations.b g.the statute does not address appeal rights to enforce the reopening regulations and so,under chevron step one,is silent on the precise question at issue.see chevron,at.we apply chevron step two 
because congress in b g explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,it gave the secretary an express delegation of authority to elucidate the reopening and revision of initial determinations by regulation.at.we give the secretary reopening regulations controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.
palomar contends that the reopening regulations as interpreted by the secretary are arbitrary,capricious,and manifestly contrary to the medicare statute because they allow her to reopen claim determinations in violation of the guidelines she established in regulations.see b g.the secretary responsive position is that claim determinations are reopened and revised under the guidelines she established in the reopening regulations,but that those guidelines are enforced internally rather than through provider appeals.there is nothing arbitrary or capricious about this position,and it reasonably avoids the inefficiencies that we noted above.
in basing its argument on,palomar ignores congress statutory directive to establish the rac program.concerned about the millions of dollars of medicare trust funds being lost to improper payments,congress directed the secretary to use racs to identify and correct past overpayments and underpayments.congress did not require good cause for rac reopenings,in either the mma or.nor did congress specify how any reopening conditions established by the secretary in regulations should be enforced.see b g.the secretary in her discretion has chosen to require good cause for reopenings and to enforce that standard internally.this enforcement scheme sensibly balances providers interests in fairness and finality against congress and the public interests in paying medicare claims accurately and preserving funds for future medicare
