background 
schaaf worked for glaxosmithkline gsk first as a sales representative and then as a district sales manager dsm before assuming the role of regional vice president rvp in.in her new role as rvp,schaaf was tasked with overseeing a region that included all of florida and a portion of southern region that,at the time,had consistently failed to meet gsk sales expectations.schaaf superiors encouraged her to address these shortfalls by approaching the rvp position with creativity and innovation,and indicated that the goal of increasing sales volume in the faltering region was of central importance.after a few years at the helm,the early signs indicated that schaaf had successfully risen to the challenge under her direction,the region performance increased markedly and its sales figures returned to satisfactory levels.
although initial indications seemed positive,problems between schaaf and her subordinates eventually tainted schaaf managerial accomplishments.in july,three dsms working under murray,stewart miller,and jose complaints with the gsk human resources hr department,bemoaning schaaf alleged unprofessional management style.hr then interviewed each of these three dsms,in addition to all of the other gsk employees who reported directly to schaaf.the other employees verified murray,miller,and castrillo initial complaints regarding schaaf management,and,in some cases,further elaborated on her alleged faults.
the interviews revealed both broad complaints and specific grievances about schaaf.for example,the employees complained about schaaf antagonistic and inflexible management style,chronic inaccessibility,poor communication skills,harsh and demanding demeanor,and tendency to play favorites,as well as about her failure to provide written feedback on performance appraisals,her practice of sharing some dsms confidential information with other employees,her unwillingness to respond to messages for weeks at a time,and her failure to acknowledge the contributions of her subordinates.the interviews left no question as to how the dsms viewed schaaf as a supervisor.for instance,one employee lamented the t errible state of the region morale,explaining,morale ca be positive.just no way.you do know when she is going to strike.only thing predictable is that it going to be nasty another reported that schaaf was simply not open to hearing differing viewpoints,and a third starkly described schaaf as very cold and uncaring.schaaf subordinates reiterated that schaaf management defects contributed significantly to the group low morale.
after these initial interviews with the subordinates,gsk also interviewed schaaf to offer her a chance to respond to their concerns.gsk then determined that the employees grievances were severe and pervasive enough to warrant taking formal disciplinary action against schaaf by issuing her a verbal warning.lisa gonzalez,schaaf immediate superior,also instructed schaaf to complete a performance improvement plan pip with the goal of bettering her communication skills and management style.according to gsk,the improvement plan was designed to allow schaaf an opportunity to correct her shortcomings and to foster improved relationships with her instance,the pip required schaaf to issue previously uncompleted written performance reviews to her subordinates,to attend programs,and to complete exercises with her subordinates.
incidentally,in july,the same month that murray,miller,and castrillo first complained to hr,schaaf informed gonzalez,her superior,that schaaf was pregnant with her fourth child and planned to take maternity leave beginning in early as a result,schaaf expressed some concern regarding her ability to complete the pip prior to the commencement of her leave.rather than making a diligent attempt to satisfy the plan requirements and to demonstrate her willingness to improve herself professionally,however,schaaf instead ignored several pip deadlines,including deadlines to register for the required management courses and to complete the written performance evaluations.schaaf even failed to meet the deadline for simply returning a signed copy of the plan to her superiors.as a result of this demonstrated unwillingness to cooperate,schaaf did not satisfy the pip requirements by the target date of december.gonzalez then extended this time frame until,and,when schaaf likewise failed to meet this new deadline,gonzalez extended it again until after schaaf returned from her maternity leave.
schaaf began her leave on january.during her absence,an interim rvp took her place,and the subordinates reported that the region functioned significantly better while schaaf was gone.while serving as rvp,the interim also discovered and corrected several significant administrative problems that had occurred under schaaf watch,including scores of expense reports that schaaf had ignored and several invoices from outside creditors that schaaf had failed to pay.the subordinates reported that,under the interim rvp,productivity had increased,communication had improved,and morale was markedly higher.
shortly before schaaf return,the dsms requested a meeting with gonzalez,schaaf superior,to express their concerns that the region increased morale and productivity could dissipate immediately if schaaf resumed her role as rvp.gonzalez took these reservations seriously when schaaf returned to work on april,she was immediately instructed to travel to gonzalez office in north carolina.once there,gonzalez gave schaaf a choice she could either accept a demotion to district sales manager or leave the company,but in any case she would not be reinstalled as rvp.schaaf eventually accepted the demotion to dsm,and submitted a request for a written statement of the reasons for her demotion.
gsk provided the requested written response,in which it informed schaaf that her subordinates had complained of her overbearing and hostile management style and that her region functioned markedly better in her absence.gsk also indicated that schaaf failure to complete the pip requirements and her demonstrated unwillingness to change her management behavior contributed to her demotion.schaaf then sued,claiming that gsk impermissibly demoted her for reasons related to her statutorily protected maternity leave.
ii.discussion 
schaaf raises a number of issues on appeal,but her primary arguments center on whether gsk violated schaaf rights under the family and medical leave act fmla.schaaf alleges that gsk violated the statute both by interfering with her fmla rights and retaliating against her for exercising those rights.
the district court granted judgment as a matter of law in gsk favor on both of these claims.on appeal,this court reviews that grant de novo,and it draws all reasonable inferences in favor of schaaf,the nonmoving party.see rossbach city of miami,cir.the standards set forth by federal rule of civil procedure guide the de novo evaluation that rule permits a court to grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against a party if it finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.granting such a motion is proper when the facts and inferences point overwhelmingly in favor of one party,such that reasonable people could not arrive at a contrary verdict.carter city of miami,cir.
while rule provides the legal standards for determining whether judgment as a matter of law was appropriate in this case,the fmla provides the substantive law under which this court evaluates schaaf allegations.the statute purpose,among others,is to provide employees with the flexibility needed to care for a newborn child.to this end,the statute affords eligible workers up to t
