plaintiff mckesson information solutions,mckesson appeals the final decision of the united states district court for the eastern district of california dismissing mckesson infringement suit against defendant bridge medical,bridge after the court found the only patent at issue,patent the patent,unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.
as set forth in considerable detail below,this case involves mckesson nondisclosure of three items of information during prosecution of the patent in a setting where the applicant had applications.the district court found each of the three nondisclosures individually and collectively material to prosecution of the application that led to the patent.with regard to deceptive intent regarding each nondisclosure,the district court found circumstantial evidence strongly supports an inference of deceptive intent.after assessing all the facts,the district court held that mckesson failed to provide a credible explanation for the material nondisclosures.as the district court noted,this was not a case of mistake or prosecuting attorney testified that he would make all the same nondisclosure decisions again if prosecuting the same applications today.
the district court thorough written opinion documents the court correct understanding and application of the relevant precedent.the issues of materiality and intent are.with regard to the issue of intent,the law recognizes that deceptive intent is virtually never shown or disproved by direct evidence.instead,the ultimate fact finding on the issue depends on assessment of all the inferences,favorable and unfavorable,that can be drawn from pertinent evidence.to prevail on appeal,mckesson must demonstrate that the district court findings of fact are clearly erroneous.after careful review of the record,we conclude that mckesson has not met its burden,and we therefore affirm.
the patent provides a patient identification system for relating items with patients and ensuring that an identified item corresponds to an identified patient.patent,at.this is accomplished first by providing a set of bar codes associated with a given patient such that one bar code from the set is physically attached to the patient and the other bar codes from the set are physically attached to,for example,the patient medications and second by providing a portable handheld bar code reader or patient terminal wirelessly connected to a base station unit typically located in the patient room that communicates via modem with a system computer capable of processing and storing patient data.id.thus,among the handheld patient terminal,the base station,and the system computer,the patent teaches a three node approach to communications.at.moreover,because the handheld patient terminals are portable,it is desirable to prevent one such terminal from wirelessly communicating with a base station in,say,an adjacent room.the base stations of the patent therefore include a programmable unique identifier that only allow s communication with a portable handheld patient terminal having a corresponding program identifier.patent.
the only independent claim of the patent incorporates both of these,communications and a programmable unique limitations.claim thus provides 
a patient identification and verification system comprising 
a programmed system computer means for processing and storing patient data

c output means operatively interconnected to the programmed system computer means for output of data from the programmed system computer means 
d first bar code identifier means adapted for attachment to a patient for identification of the patient,the bar code identifier means including a patient unique code 
e a plurality of second bar code identifier means for identifying patient care related items,such as medication,

i microprocessor controlled portable handheld patient terminal means having bar code reader means for scanning the first bar code identifier means to identify the patient and for scanning the second bar code identifier means for relating various items to a specific patient,the portable handheld patient terminal means further including keyboard means for data entry and display means for display of information,the portable handheld patient terminal means including electromagnetic wave transceiver means including means for transmission of patient and item data as an electromagnetic wave which is representative of the first and second bar code identifier means scanned by the bar code reader means and including means for receipt of data as an electromagnetic wave 
ii microprocessor controlled base station means including electromagnetic wave transceiver means for receipt of and transmission of the patient and item data as an electromagnetic wave to the electromagnetic wave transceiver means of the portable handheld patient terminal means,the base station means being interconnected to the programmed system computer means at least in part by electrical lines for receipt and transmission of the patient and item data on the electrical lines to the programmed system computer means,the base station means includes a programmable unique identifier,the base station means including means for only allowing communication with a portable handheld patent sic terminal means having a corresponding program identifier,the patient system including means for programming the portable handheld patient terminal means with the corresponding identifier programmable unique identifier limitation and 
iii the programmed system computer means including program means for verifying the patient and item data properly correspond and transmitting an alarm signal if improper correspondence noted.

on october,claim was submitted in substantially this that the programmable unique identifier limitation was separated as a limitation in dependent claim part of parent application the application subsequently abandoned in response to an april,rejection by examiner david trafton of the united states patent and trademark office pto.accompanying this submission were the remarks of prosecuting attorney michael schumann 
none of the references either singularly or in combination teach or suggest the claimed invention.in addition to numerous other differences,none of the references teach the three node approach to communications as provided in the claimed invention.in the present invention,the first node of communication is a main or central computer which may have its own terminals for of information.the second node of communication are sic the base stations which are wired to the main computer.the base stations are preferably located in the various patient rooms and other suitable locations.the third node of communication in the present invention is the portable handheld patient terminal which cooperates with the base stations to provide for wireless transmission of data between the base station and the patient terminal.this approach provides a system which allows for maximum portability of the patient terminals and yet allows access to the main computer in an inexpensive manner by use of the base stations which provide wired communication to the main computer.many of the references such as koenig do disclose the use of wireless transmission which has long been in use,and many of the systems do disclose the use of bar code readers to scan bar codes to see if they correspond.however,none of the references disclose the real time,interactive three node communication system of the present invention as claimed.

in a december,office action,examiner trafton maintained his rejection of amended claim,albeit based upon a different combination of prior art references patents to blum and pejas.however,examiner trafton also explained that dependent claim would be allowable if rewritten in independent form.at.schumann accepted this offer on june,by abandoning the application and filing a continuation application application with the only independent claim rewritten in the manner suggested by examiner trafton.the claims in their current form were allowed on february,and the patent issued on august.
during this same time period,schumann was simultaneously prosecuting another the application before another pto examiner,robert lev.the invention of this simultaneous application was similar to the invention of the similar,in fact,that schumann initially disclosed the same body of prior art with both applications.at.the first submitted version of the application included application claims and,which together teach communication

in a february,office action,examiner lev rejected these claims as obvious over a combination of prior art references including the patents to blum and pejas.at.although both of these prior art references were in front of examiner trafton prior to his april,rejection of the communication system of the application,see at,examiner trafton did not cite the combination of blum and pejas in that rejection,see at.and,although schumann disclosed the existence of the application to examiner trafton on or about august,at,schumann did not bring examiner lev rejection of application claims and to examiner trafton attention.
schumann responded on august,to examiner lev rejection by narrowing claim to encompass only real time data communication.see at.schumann also added new application claims through.of those,claims and through are the most relevant

id.at emphasis added.thus,claim teaches communication,claim teaches communication,claim teaches the addition of a unique address limitation,and claim teaches a programmable unique address.
on october,days after schumann had argued to examiner trafton in the course of prosecuting the application that n one of the references either singularly or in combination teach or suggest the three node approach to communications as provided in the claimed invention schumann had a telephonic interview with examiner lev to discuss his discovery of a prior art reference,patent the patent to baker.at.baker teaches a cordless telephone system in which a portable telephone handset or station communicates via optical transceivers with one of possibly several subsystem controllers,which in turn communicate with a central controller.patent.baker also teaches the use of unique codes for each subsystem and station within the subsystem.id.in light of these teachings,examiner lev suggested to schumann that he cancel the newly added claims.at.schumann neither agreed with examiner lev,nor disclosed the existence of baker to examiner trafton.
in a december,office action,examiner lev again rejected all claims pending in the application.claim was rejected as anticipated by patent the patent to sunstedt,and claims,and through were rejected as obvious in light of several new combinations of prior art references,including blum and sunstedt.at.sunstedt teaches a vending system for use in restaurants in which a waiter wirelessly transmits a customer order from a portable handheld terminal to an input station subject to intermittent polling by a polling station.patent id.once the information at the input station is detected by the polling station,the order is then transmitted to a local data processor which calculates the customer bill.id.thus,in examiner lev opinion,sunstedt communication system in combination with other prior art references,including blum,rendered claims,and obvious.at.examiner lev was of the further opinion that the addition of baker unique address also rendered claims and obvious.at.examiner trafton had not considered these combinations of references during prosecution of the application,and schumann did not disclose any of these rejections to examiner trafton.
on june,schumann responded to examiner lev rejection by further narrowing application claim to encompass only handheld terminals capable of initiating communication themselves,as opposed to the system taught by sunstedt requiring intermittent polling to initiate communication.at.in that same response,schumann cancelled application claims.on december,examiner lev issued a notice of allowance for the eighteen remaining claims.the claims issued on july,as patent the patent.
on july,schumann filed application a continuation in part of the application.as with the,examiner trafton was the examiner assigned to the application.examiner trafton allowed nine application claims on december,and the patent thereafter issued as patent the patent.the only independent claim of the patent provides

patent emphasis added.as with the patent,claim of the patent encompasses communication.prior to the issuance of the patent,schumann did not notify examiner trafton that the claims of the patent had been allowed.
mckesson initiated the present suit for infringement against bridge on december,in the united states district court for the eastern district of california.bridge answered mckesson complaint by pleading the affirmative defenses of unenforceability due to inequitable conduct,equitable estoppel,and unclean hands.bridge also brought counterclaims against mckesson for declaratory judgment.the district court bifurcated the trial into two phases,with the first phase being a bench trial on the inequitable conduct affirmative defense and the second phase being a jury trial on the remainder of the claims,counterclaims,and affirmative defenses.a bench trial of the first phase resulted in an unenforceability judgment in favor of bridge,thereby rendering the second phase unnecessary.
the court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law on june.mckesson info.solutions,bridge,wl cal.june,findings and conclusions.in particular,the court found by clear and convincing evidence that,in the course of prosecuting the patent,schumann failures to disclose the existence of the baker patent,examiner lev rejections of the initially broad claims in the application which issued as the patent,and the allowance of claims in the patent were material omissions done with an intent to deceive.findings and conclusions,slip op.at.
with respect to schumann failure to disclose the baker patent to examiner trafton,the court first noted that until examiner lev brought baker to schumann attention,the same prior art references had been cited in the and prosecutions,the and applications,respectively,slip op.at.the court found this fact supportive of a finding of materiality because,as schumann testified,i f the same art had been before the examiners and the claims are substantially similar,that is probably a pretty good indication that the reference would be pretty material.id.another fact the court deemed significant was examiner lev finding that the baker patent rendered the address code in the portable handheld of the application obvious,because,as schumann admitted,the address code of the application was the same as the programmable unique identifier limitation of the application,see,slip op.at.taken together,these two observations led the court to conclude that the baker patent meets the reasonable examiner materiality standard and should have been disclosed to examiner trafton,slip op.at.
the court buttressed its materiality conclusion with the further observation that the baker patent also includes very type of communication schumann used to differentiate the claims of the patent from the prior art.see,slip op.at.the court explained,in accordance with expert testimony elicited at trial,that schumann could not have made this patentability argument if examiner trafton had the opportunity to consider the baker patent,slip op.at.given this further observation,the court found the baker patent to be not merely material,but highly material.id.
mckesson offered several reasons why,in its view,baker would not have been material to examiner trafton.first,mckesson contended to the district court that disclosure of the baker patent would have been cumulative of other prior art because other prior art references,the blum and hawkins patents.id.the blum reference,patent the patent,describes a portable handheld device useful in a hospital setting.the user of blum handheld device first plugs it into a central computer in order to download patient data.the user then unplugs the device and carries it from bed to bed,and uses the downloaded data to ensure that each patient receives the correct treatment medication.patent.the hawkins reference,patent the patent,describes a portable id code transfer system in which the portable unit learns its associated id code from the base communication unit thereby eliminating any requirement for manually coding the portable unit with an id code to match the base unit,patent,useful for portable telephone systems,garage door openers and remote computer terminals which communicate with a master computer,id.in the context of a portable telephone system,the hawkins reference also describes communication between the base unit and an outside telephone network in the event that the portable unit and base unit have matching ids.id.at.
the district court found this argument unpersuasive in part because lev,who already had both the blum and hawkins patents before him,added the baker patent to the mix of prior art in the prosecution,and then relied on it in rejecting claims to a portable handheld terminal.findings and conclusions,slip op.at.clearly,the court continued,examiner lev did not view baker as cumulative,but rather treated it as an important addition to the prior art previously cited by schumann.id.emphasis in original molins plc textron,holding that a district court did not clearly err in finding materiality where the prior art reference at issue had been considered material by examiners in related foreign patent applications.the court also viewed the baker patent as more explicitly and clearly disclos ing a wireless communications system than either the blum or hawkins patents.findings and conclusions,slip op.at.reasoning that the baker patent need not invalidate the claims of the patent in order to be material,the district court thus found that a reasonable examiner would have been substantially likely to consider the baker patent important to the evaluation of the application given the similarity of the core features of the baker patent to the subject matter of the patent.id.ultimately,then,the district court found baker highly material and not cumulative,slip op.at.
the court next evaluated intent and found that schumann did in fact intend to deceive examiner trafton by failing to disclose the baker patent.the court first explained that intent was inferable because schumann was informed of the baker patent materiality by the pto itself when examiner lev brought the patent to schumann attention,suggested cancellation of certain claims,and then rejected claims as obvious in light of claim elements that were present in the application,slip op.at.the court also reasoned that given the mere gap between schumann representation to examiner trafton that the prior art does not disclose the approach to communications as provided in the claimed invention and his telephonic discussion with examiner lev,schumann could not have or certainly should not have missed baker significance since it rendered his recent statement to examiner trafton untrue,further confirming that intent to deceive should be inferred,slip op.at.
the court found additional evidence of deceptive intent in schumann admission at trial that he knew his duty to disclose material information continued for at least months after he learned of the baker patent,and yet schumann did nothing to bring baker to examiner trafton attention,slip op.at.moreover,the court explained,schumann himself evidenced his realization of the strength of the baker patent when he chose not to even attempt to overcome examiner lev rejection based on baker and cancelled the claims in the application that were rejected due to baker.id.and because the cancelled claims included,according to schumann own admission,aspects of the invention under review by examiner trafton,schumann either knew or should have known that the baker patent was material in the case,slip op.at.
the court recognized schumann testimony that although he has no recollection whatsoever of prosecuting the patent,he believes,looking at the baker reference now,that it is cumulative.id.however,the court found this explanation incredible both because it would have been unreasonable,in the court opinion,to conclude that baker is cumulative,and because no contemporaneous evidence,notes,records,files,was adduced at trial to show that schumann actually analyzed baker and arrived at such a conclusion,slip op at.the court further rejected schumann explanation as strain ing credulity in light of the sequence of events surrounding the baker patent 
examiner lev located the baker patent on his own he brought it to schumann attention in a telephone interview he suggested the cancellation of certain claims,and then issued a rejection of those claims based in part on baker shortly thereafter,schumann found that the rejection based on baker could not be overcome,requiring him to cancel the claims regarding a handheld patient terminal system communicating wirelessly with base stations and via wires with a remote central computer in order to continue with the prosecution finally,even though schumann had disclosed the same prior art in both the and prosecutions through that point in time,he concluded that the baker patent had no bearing on the prosecution which involved the same wireless system rejected in the prosecution.
slip op.at.the court also discredited the testimony as inconsistent with schumann assertion on the witness stand that it was his practice to be over inclusive and to bend over backwards to make sure he got everything into the case,slip op.at.the totality of this evidence,according to the court,overwhelmingly establishe d that schumann,by withholding the baker patent from examiner trafton,acted with an intent to deceive,slip op at.
as to schumann failure to disclose examiner lev rejections of the claims in the application,the court began its analysis by rejecting mckesson argument that our decision in dayco products,total containment,created a new disclosure requirement that did not apply to schumann prosecution of the patent in the.findings and conclusions,slip op.at emphasis in original.using dayco as a guide,the court continued its analysis by explaining that examiner lev rejections are material if the rejected claims were substantially similar to the claims pending before examiner trafton.findings and conclusions,slip op.at quoting dayco,at.
based on this standard,the court found that examiner lev february,rejection of claims and in the application would have been important to examiner trafton examination because those claims,which disclosed all three nodes of the patient identification system,with the identical means of communication among the core structures,substantially overlapped with the limitations of claim of the patent.findings and conclusions,slip op.at.moreover,the court explained,this rejection would have been of additional importance to examiner trafton because it contradicts the argument for patentability schumann made to examiner trafton on october,slip op.at.the court further found materiality in examiner lev december,rejection of claims,and through of the application both because of the substantial similarity between those claims and claim of the patent,and because examiner lev relied on the baker patent,which had not been disclosed in the prosecution,to reject the unique address limitation of claims and,which was also a limitation of the patent,slip op.at.this finding was buttressed by the court observation that schumann acquiesced to examiner lev rejection by canceling claims through,slip op.at.here,too,the court reasoned that the rejection would have been of additional importance to examiner trafton because it contradicts schumann october argument for patentability,slip op.at.
mckesson also argued,relying on our opinion in akron polymer container exxel container,that schumann effectively disclosed examiner lev rejections by disclosing the existence of the application to examiner trafton.the district court rejected this argument by distinguishing akron polymer on its facts and by explaining that section b of the manual of patent examination and procedure mpep as well as our decision in li second family lp toshiba,plainly impose a duty of disclosure beyond citation of the application.findings and conclusions,slip op.at.
regarding intent,schumann testimony at trial,according to the court,was that although he did not recall prosecuting the application,he explained that he probably did not believe activity in the application was material to the prosecution because the case involved only a terminal,while the involved an entire system,slip op.at.the court discounted this explanation as contradicted by the actual wording of the claims rejected by examiner lev,which included all of the elements of a wireless system.id.moreover,the court continued,schumann admitted on cross examination that his argument was a distinction without a difference.id.the court also discounted as not credible and the product of newly developed hindsight,schumann testimony that his firm at the time did not have procedures in place for citing office actions in applications,slip op.at.schumann trial testimony in this regard was further undermined,in the court estimation,by his deposition testimony that a rejection in a application ought to be disclosed if it was deemed to be relevant.id.and even if schumann former firm did have such procedures in place a matter not decided in fact,the court held that our decision in brasseler,i,stryker sales,prevents firms from insulat ing their attorneys against charges of inequitable conduct by instituting policies that prevent the attorneys from complying with the law,findings and conclusions,slip op.at.thus,the court concluded that while schumann disclosure of the of the application to examiner trafton is some evidence of a lack of intent to deceive under akron polymer,weighing all the evidence here,as the court must,said disclosure does not overcome the inference of an intent to deceive established on these facts.findings and conclusions,slip op.at emphasis in original footnote omitted.
the district court next addressed schumann failure to disclose the allowance of the claims of the patent.again the court looked to dayco and mpep b,and held that a notice of allowance in a application is material if the allowed claims could conceivably have given rise to a double patenting rejection.findings and conclusions,slip op.at.mckesson argued that,even so,the claims of the patent are not sufficiently similar to the claims of the patent to render the allowance of those claims material.the district court disagreed,finding that although the claims of the patent do not have a comparable programmable unique identifier limitation,examiner trafton should have been given the opportunity to consider whether the added limitations in the were,slip op.at.indeed,the court continued,given that examiner lev had rejected the unique identifier as obvious,it is certainly conceivable that the could have been rejected under the doctrine of double patenting.id.thus,the court concluded that the allowance of the claims was material and should have been disclosed.
as to intent,the court discounted schumann explanation as implausible that the two patents did not raise a double patenting issue because the claims were different in those cases,slip op.at.specifically,the court explained that because the structure of limitations are defined by the specification,and because the entire specification is included in the specification,schumann certainly should have known,if he did not know,that an allowance of identical claims might have been important to make of record.id.even giving schumann credit for disclosing the existence of the application that led to the patent,the court nevertheless found that schumann withheld the allowance of the claims with deceptive intent.
as a final step,the court engaged in equitable balancing and concluded that the pattern of material nondisclosures,such as present here,weighs firmly in favor of unenforceability,id,because the showings of materiality and intent are high with respect to each identified nondisclosure,slip op.at.the court thus entered judgment against mckesson on infringement and dismissed bridge pending counterclaims as moot and without prejudice.mckesson subsequently appealed to this court.because the district court disposed of all claims and counterclaims,its judgment is final and we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to a.see int l tech.hughes aircraft.

we first discuss schumann failure to disclose the baker patent to examiner trafton during prosecution of the applications leading to the patent.mckesson first points out that examiner lev cited baker solely for its disclosure of a unique address code,and that hawkins,which was before examiner trafton,also discloses that same feature.moreover,according to mckesson,hawkins is a better and more relevant reference with regard to the prosecution because hawkins further teaches a programmable unique identifier for wireless communications between a portable terminal and base station,as claimed in the,unlike baker,which allegedly does not teach that critical feature of programming.appellant br.at emphasis in original.therefore,mckesson contends,baker disclosure of a unique address code was merely cumulative to hawkins.id.at.
even if mckesson is correct that hawkins discloses a programmable unique identifier limitation more clearly than baker,the importance of baker to a reasonable examiner is not limited to the disclosure of that limitation.one of schumann primary arguments for the patentability of the claims of the patent was the use of communication.accordingly,the communication system disclosed in of portable handsets,one or more subsystem controllers,and a central be material quite apart from the disclosure of anything analogous to a programmable unique identifier limitation.
insofar as both patents disclose communication,mckesson characterizes hawkins as being on equal footing as baker.we disagree.the hawkins specification,which contemplates communication between a garage door opener and a remote control in one embodiment,leaves no doubt that the invention described therein is a communication system consisting of a base station and a portable unit.admittedly,in the wireless telephone embodiment,this system is capable of connecting to a third communication node,a telephone system network.patent claim.however,unlike the baker patent,only two nodes are described in any significant detail in the hawkins patent.
moreover,the telephone system network node of the hawkins patent is not the analogue to the central controller node in the baker patent because the central controller node is an internal node entirely separate from any outside network node.in other words,the base station node in the wireless telephone embodiment of the hawkins patent directly connects to the telephone system network node,but the analogous subsystem controller node in the baker patent only indirectly connects with an outside network node via the central controller node.see,patent explaining that the central controller controls incoming and outgoing calls to a telephone central office id.thus,we find no clear error in the district court conclusion that baker discloses communication more clearly than hawkins.
mckesson further argues that the art of record showed at least twelve systems in order to demonstrate that baker is cumulative.appellant reply br.at.however,aside from hawkins in combination with blum,the only two such systems specifically pointed to by mckesson are patent the patent to pejas,and patent the patent to koenig.appellant reply br.at.
pejas relates to an system in which one or more bar code reading pens are each connected to their own portable terminal.patent.the portable terminals communicate wirelessly with converters which,in turn,communicate with a control centre.id.the system facilitates communication between the control center and a particular terminal by associating an address with each terminal.id.thus,pejas appears to disclose both communication to converter to control center,as well as a unique addressing scheme analogous to the programmable unique identifier limitation of the patent.importantly,however,the description of the preferred embodiment in baker spans over eleven columns and provides a highly technical discussion of the implementation of the communication system with unique addressing,whereas the same description in pejas is just under two columns and provides only cursory implementation details.compare patent,with patent.therefore,we find no clear error in the district court failure to find that pejas renders baker cumulative.
koenig,the other reference identified by mckesson,discloses a similar reader,or wand,attached to a portable terminal for reading bar codes.patent.when the wand successfully reads a bar code,the data is transmitted from the terminal to a remote computer via a modem.id.as a threshold matter,we question whether koenig actually discloses a communication system because it appears from the claims that the modem is not a distinct node.see id.stating that said computer means comprises a minicomputer and a modem interface emphasis added.in addition,koenig does not disclose anything analogous to the programmable unique identifier limitation of the patent.accordingly,we hold that the district court did not clearly err by finding baker noncumulative.
mckesson advances another assignment of clear error by contending that the district court,in concluding that baker undermines schumann argument to examiner trafton on october,that none of the references either singularly or in combination teach the three node approach to communications as provided in the claimed invention,at,misinterpreted schumann statement by focusing solely on a comparison of the similarities of baker and the claims and not their differences,appellant br.at.according to mckesson,schumann was not referring to communication generally,but rather to communication with all of the limitations present in the claims,as provided in the claimed invention.in particular,mckesson points out 
bridge adduced no evidence that a the central controller of baker may have its own terminals for of information b the subsystem controller of baker is preferably located in the patient rooms and other suitable locations or c the cordless phone of baker constitutes a portable handheld patient terminal including all the limitations thereof contained in the claims of the patent.
appellant reply br.at.
we are not persuaded by this argument.reading schumann statement to examiner trafton in context,schumann was plainly referring to the differences between the communication system of the claims and communication systems of the prior art,exclusive of any other differences between the claims and the prior art.see at in addition to numerous other differences,none of the references teach the three node approach to communications as provided in the claimed invention.emphasis added.moreover,the existence of differences between baker and the claims does not,standing alone,render baker immaterial.see li second family,at information concealed from the pto may be material even though it would not invalidate the patent.thus,the district court did not clearly err in this regard.
mckesson contends that,irrespective of baker materiality,the district court clearly erred in finding that schumann intended to deceive examiner trafton.in the proceedings below,the district court relied in part upon our decision in bruno independent living aids,acorn mobility services,to infer an intent to deceive.see findings and conclusions,slip op.at.in bruno,we upheld a district court finding of intent where prior art was withheld from the pto but was nevertheless submitted to the fda as part of that agency product approval process.at.the high materiality of the withheld prior art coupled with the lack of a credible explanation for the nondisclosure led us to conclude that the district court had not committed clear error by inferring an intent to deceive,at.in this case,the district court rejected as incredible schumann explanation for nondisclosure of the baker reference.
mckesson believes bruno is distinguishable from the present case for three reasons.first,mckesson argues,the device disclosed to the fda included a more relevant feature than any art of record in the,whereas in this case the features disclosed in baker were already present in the art of record.appellant br.at.we reject this argument because it is nothing more than an attempt to rehash an argument rejected above,namely,that baker is cumulative of the prior art that was already in front of examiner trafton.
the second distinction raised by mckesson is that in bruno,the patentee affirmatively disclosed the device to the fda while simultaneously withholding it from the pto,but here,schumann made no comparable disclosure outside the pto.appellant br.at.to begin with,we see no meaningful distinction between disclosure outside the pto as opposed to disclosure within the pto.with that in mind,we find bruno to be on point because,as in that case,schumann had closely related applications the application and the application in which a noncumulative,material prior art reference baker was withheld from one examiner trafton but was simultaneously in front of the other examiner lev.
finally,mckesson points out that the device disclosed to the fda in bruno was a substantial equivalent of the product containing the patented technology,but in this case,there is no such substantial equivalence because the baker patent relates to a cordless telephone system and the patent relates to a patient identification and verification system.appellant br.at.mckesson reads too much into bruno.we did not hold in that case that substantial equivalence is necessary to support a finding of inequitable conduct we merely found that substantial equivalence is sufficient.in other words,we did not hold that a prior art reference must be substantially equivalent to the claimed invention in order to be material.
mckesson also attempts to seek refuge from bruno by looking to our holding in akron polymer.in akron polymer,applications were being prosecuted by the same attorney to different examiners.the prosecuting attorney disclosed the application to the examiner of the application,but did not disclose the filing of the second application to the examiner of the application.in the first trial of the case,the district court held that the second application was not material to the prosecution of the application.the district court also found no culpable intent on behalf of the common applicant and thus no inequitable conduct.on appeal,we disagreed,holding that the application was highly material to the prosecution of the application,because it could have conceivably served as the basis of a double patenting rejection.akron polymer,at.we thus remanded for further adjudication of the inequitable conduct issue.id.
on remand,the district court found deceptive intent with regard to nondisclosure of the second application to the examiner of the application.the patentee appealed the judgment of inequitable conduct,arguing error in the finding of deceptive intent.we noted that w hen examining intent to deceive,a court must weigh all the evidence,including evidence of good faith.id.at.because the district court had given no weight at all to the inference of good faith that had to be drawn from disclosure of the second application,we found clear error in the district court assessment of culpable intent.consequently,we reversed the judgment of unenforceability.
akron polymer stands for no more than the unsurprising proposition that all evidence of intent,including all inferences,favorable and unfavorable,must be weighed when assessing culpable intent.in that case,the district court overlooked a favorable inference that should have been drawn in favor of the patentee.that error undermined the judgment of unenforceability.
we agree with mckesson assertion that akron polymer earns it some credit for the fact that schumann did disclose the of the application to examiner trafton in the assessment of the overall inferences to be drawn from all the facts in the case.the district court did in fact credit mckesson with some evidence of a lack of intent to deceive under akron polymer.findings and conclusions,slip op.at see also,slip op.at giving schumann credit for disclosing the of the application that issued as the patent.but the district court weighed all the evidence,as discussed above in this opinion,and held that the favorable inference drawn from disclosure of the second application does not overcome the inference of an intent to deceive established by the other facts,slip op.at.
mckesson continues by contending that schumann did not know and should not have known of baker materiality because examiner lev cited it during prosecution of the patent only for its unique addressing feature that was already before examiner trafton in the better disclosure of hawkins.appellant br.at.moreover,mckesson states,the gap between schumann october assertion to examiner trafton that none of the prior art teaches communication and schumann october interview with examiner lev regarding baker can not be evidence of intent,given that the assertion to examiner trafton was before the interview with baker.id.
these two arguments are unconvincing.as to the former,simply because examiner lev cited baker for its unique addressing feature did not release schumann from the relevance of baker other teachings.although mckesson argument might have some merit if examiner lev had cited one small section of a much larger work,citation to the baker patent put schumann on notice of the content of the whole document.and as to the second argument,schumann duty to disclose material information to the pto extended well beyond october.see,fox,structural preservation,the duty of candor extends throughout the patent entire prosecution history.mpep ed,the duty to disclose material information extends to information individuals covered by are aware of prior to or at the time of filing the application or become aware of during the prosecution thereof.therefore,the fact that schumann learned of baker after his october assertion to examiner trafton is of no consequence.the mere gap is important,however,because it bolsters the district court inferences that schumann knew or should have known of baker materiality to the application,and that he intentionally withheld baker from examiner trafton with deceptive intent.
we also reject mckesson attempt to downplay the significance of schumann cancellation of claim of the application subsequent to examiner lev citation to baker.irrespective of schumann disagreement with examiner lev conclusion that claim incorporated both communication and a unique address obvious in light of a combination involving baker,schumann cancellation of that claim fairly gives rise to an inference that he recognized baker would also present a significant obstacle to the patentability of dependent claim of the application.yet,in spite of the advice provided to prosecuting attorneys in the version of the mpep that information specifically considered and discarded as not material ought to be recorded in the attorney file or applicant file,including the reason for discarding it,mpep ed,schumann offered no such recorded reason he was only able to give speculative testimony about the conclusions he must have drawn at the time with respect to baker materiality.the district court,as it was free to do,found this testimony incredible.findings and conclusions,slip op.at.accordingly,we see no clear error in the district court inference of intent from schumann cancellation of claim.
finally,mckesson asserts that critikon,becton dickinson vascular access,is distinguishable.in that case,we found an intent to deceive where an applicant knowingly failed to disclose a prior art patent during prosecution that recited a limitation corresponding to a point of novelty the examiner relied upon during the course of prosecution,at.mckesson primarily distinguishes the case at hand by stating that baker does not disclose a point of novelty of the claims,and that the evidence does not show that schumann understood baker to disclose any such point of novelty.both of these points of distinction are incorrect.as we explained above,baker discloses two of the patent points of novelty communication and unique addressing.in addition,the evidence unquestionably shows that schumann understood baker to disclose at least unique addressing,and that schumann should have understood baker to disclose communication.therefore,the district court did not clearly err by further inferring deceptive intent from schumann subsequent failure to disclose baker to examiner trafton.as the district court held,the overwhelming circumstantial evidence,coupled with the lack of any credible explanation for nondisclosure of baker,supports the finding of deceptive intent.findings and conclusions,slip op.at.
we now turn to schumann failure to disclose examiner lev rejections in the application patent.this court addressed the failure to disclose rejections in applications for the first time in dayco.we held that 
a contrary decision of another examiner reviewing a substantially similar claim meets the akron polymer reasonable examiner threshold materiality test of any information that a reasonable examiner would substantially likely consider important in deciding whether to allow an application to issue as a patent.at,at emphasis in original.patent disclosures are often very complicated,and different examiners with different technical backgrounds and levels of understanding may often differ when interpreting such documents.although examiners are not bound to follow other examiners interpretations,knowledge of a potentially different interpretation is clearly information that an examiner could consider important when examining an application.
dayco,at first emphasis added.
in the proceedings below,mckesson urged the district court to hold that a substantially similar claim is a claim having substantial similarity in content and scope to the claim at issue.the court declined,explaining first that the phrase in content and scope was not used by this court in dayco,and second that mckesson has not provided any persuasive explanation for how this language substantively alters the result here.findings and conclusions,slip op.at.instead,the court announced that it would apply a substantially similar test in determining whether there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable examiner would have considered the rejections important in deciding whether to issue the application as a patent.id.at.the court further noted that we found substantial similarity in dayco among claims that were in some respects substantially identical.see dayco,at emphasis added.mckesson argues on appeal that the district court misapplied dayco because it used a lesser in some respects identical test which failed to account for differences between the compared sets of claims.
as we explained in digital control,materiality may be proven in numerous ways,including via the reasonable examiner standard.at.under dayco,that standard is satisfied in the setting if the rejected claims are substantially similar to the claims at issue.at.in other words,a showing of substantial similarity is sufficient to prove materiality.it does not necessarily follow,however,that a showing of substantial similarity is necessary to prove materiality.indeed,in the same way that prior art need not be substantially similar in order to be material,the telephone system of baker,though not substantially similar to the claims,is nevertheless material,rejected claims in a application also need not be substantially similar in order to be material.therefore,to the extent there is a difference among in some respects identical,substantially similar,and substantial similarity in content and scope,that difference is inconsequential so long as the evidence clearly and convincingly proves materiality in one of the accepted ways.see digital control,at.here,the district court found under the accepted reasonable examiner standard that examiner lev rejection of certain claims was in fact material to the prosecution of the application before examiner trafton.our role on appeal is to determine whether that finding is clearly erroneous.
as to the district court finding of materiality with respect to examiner lev rejection of claims and in the application on february,mckesson points to four differences between those claims and the claims of the patent which mckesson argues were ignored by the district court 
t he portable handheld terminal system of claims lacks a first and second bar code identifier means,lacks the base station limitations of a programmable unique identifier,a means for allowing communication with a portable terminal having a corresponding unique identifier and a means for programming the portable terminal with the unique identifier,lacks any patient identification or verification limitations,and lacks any means for an alarm signal if the verification does not correspond.
appellant br.at.according to mckesson,these differences,combined with the fact alleged by mckesson that the communication system disclosed in claims and is cumulative of prior art already before examiner trafton,demonstrates that examiner lev rejection of those claims would not have been of any particular relevance to examiner trafton in the prosecution.id.at.
we find this argument unpersuasive.we note as an initial matter that the district court did not ignore the differences cited above rather,the court explicitly mentioned mckesson redline comparisons of the various claims to demonstrate that there are wording differences,and even some differences in claim limitations,and then explained the rationale for rejecting those differences as insufficient to undermine a finding of materiality.findings and conclusions,slip op.at.moreover,even if the district court opinion had not adequately addressed the differences pointed to by mckesson,we would not be inclined to find clear error as a result.both the version of claims and rejected by examiner lev on february,as well as the version of the application claims rejected by examiner trafton on april,unquestionably disclose communication,the existence of which,as schumann subsequent statements to examiner trafton reveal,was crucial to schumann patentability argument.it is therefore evident that prior to examiner trafton april rejection,examiner lev rejection of communication would have been considered important by any reasonable examiner in examiner trafton position.and after april,when examiner trafton did not cite any combination of blum and he would in the subsequent december office materiality of examiner lev rejection was arguably magnified.lest there be any doubt as to the materiality of examiner lev rejection,we note that on august,schumann responded to examiner lev by limiting the system of the application to real time communication,see at,and on october,over one month sought to overcome examiner trafton rejection with a nearly identical argument limiting the system of the application to real time,interactive three node communication,id.at emphasis added.moreover,any differences between the,bar code reading systems of the application and the related application are plainly less significant than the obvious differences between the bar code reading systems of either application and the telephone system of baker.yet,in spite of the obvious differences presented by the latter system,we held above that baker is material.it must be the case,then,that the four differences pointed to by mckesson are insufficient to deprive examiner lev february rejection of materiality.along those same lines,and in light of our holding above that baker is not cumulative,we must likewise hold here that any citation to examiner trafton regarding examiner lev february rejection would not have been cumulative.
we arrive at the same conclusion with respect to examiner lev rejection of claims and on december,in view of a combination of blum and sunstedt.as we stated above,schumann sought to overcome this rejection by further limiting the system of the application to handheld terminals that do not require the polling taught by sunstedt,but rather are capable of initiating communication themselves.it is at best unclear whether the claims of the patent are similarly limited,or whether the initiation of communication by the handheld terminal which seems to be described in the specification is merely part of a preferred embodiment.see,patent next,the nurse will read the patient identifier bar code on the patient identification bracelet and the item identifier bar code on the items to be administered and press a send key on the bar code reading device while in the patient room.this activates the transmission of data via the telephone wiring to the computer system.suffice it to say,it is substantially likely that examiner lev rejection of the system in the application in view of blum and sunstedt would have been considered important to a reasonable examiner confronting the claims of the application.and as before,the materiality of this rejection was arguably magnified by the fact that examiner trafton never cited any combination of blum and sunstedt before deciding to issue a notice of allowance.
with respect to examiner lev rejection of claims and through in the same december office action,mckesson raises a few additional materiality arguments we have not yet addressed.the first of those is mckesson argument that examiner lev rejection of claims through is immaterial because those claims recite a method of communication,whereas claim of the patent recites a system for communication.however,mckesson merely asserts in conclusory fashion that the method of claims through in the application is very different from the system of claim in the patent.appellant br.at.because we disagree with this characterization,we conclude that this argument is simply a distinction without a difference.see li second family,at affirming a finding of inequitable conduct where an applicant for semiconductor structure claims misrepresented the pto previous disposition with respect to related method of manufacture claims in another application pending before a different examiner.mckesson also argues that schumann cancellation of these claims in the face of examiner lev rejection is not evidence of materiality because such cancellation is a legitimate and acceptable practice to obtain an early issuance of a patent,and because schumann explicitly stated that he was not acquiescing in the rejection but reserving the right to bring the claims in a further application.appellant br.at emphasis in original.while these facts may be evidence that schumann disagreed with examiner lev,schumann cancellation of the claims remains evidence that examiner lev rejections could not be easily overcome.as such,we see no error with the district court conclusion that schumann it is characterized as acquiescence or legitimate and acceptable practice is evidence of materiality.finally,mckesson points out that because rejected claim discloses communication,instead of communication,examiner lev rejection of that claim is not material.at most,this distinction demonstrates that examiner
