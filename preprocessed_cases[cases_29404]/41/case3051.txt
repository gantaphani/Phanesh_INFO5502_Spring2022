alphapharm,and genpharm,collectively alphapharm appeal from the decision of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,following a bench trial,that patent was not shown to be invalid under.takeda chem,mylan,d.because we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that the claimed compounds would not have been obvious in light of the prior art,and hence that the patent has not been shown to be invalid,we affirm.
background 
diabetes is a disease that is characterized by the body inability to regulate blood sugar.it is generally caused by inadequate levels of hormone produced in the pancreas.insulin allows blood sugar or glucose,which is derived from food,to enter into the body cells and be converted into energy.there are two types of diabetes,known as type and type.in type diabetes,the pancreas fails to produce insulin,and individuals suffering from this type of diabetes must regularly receive insulin from an external source.in contrast,type diabetic individuals produce insulin.however,their bodies are unable to effectively use the insulin that is produced.this is also referred to as insulin resistance.as a result,glucose is unable to enter the cells,thereby depriving the body of its main source of energy.type diabetes is the most common form of over of diabetic individuals.
in the,a class of drugs known as thiazolidinediones tzds was introduced on the market as a treatment for type diabetes.takeda chemical industries,and takeda pharmaceuticals north america,collectively takeda first invented certain tzds in the.takeda research revealed that tzds acted as insulin sensitizers,compounds that ameliorate insulin resistance.although the function of tzds was not completely understood,tzds appeared to lower blood glucose levels by binding to a molecule in the nucleus of the cell known as ppargamma,which activates insulin receptors and stimulates the production of glucose transporters.takeda,d at.the transporters then travel to the cellular surface and enable glucose to enter the cell from the bloodstream.id.
takeda developed the drug actos,which is used to control blood sugar in patients who suffer from type diabetes.actos has enjoyed substantial commercial success since its launch in.by,it held of the tzd market,and gross sales for that year exceeded billion.id.at.the active ingredient in actos is the tzd compound pioglitazone,a compound claimed in the patent in suit.
takeda owns patent the patent entitled thiazolidinedione derivatives,useful as antidiabetic agents.the patent is directed to compounds which can be practically used as antidiabetic agents having a broad safety margin between pharmacological effect and toxicity or unfavorable side reactions.patent.the asserted claims are claims,and.claim claims a genus of compounds.claim claims pharmaceutical compositions containing that genus of compounds.those claims read as follows 
a compound of the formula 
or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof.
an antidiabetic composition which consists essentially of a compound of the formula 
or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof,in association with a pharmacologically acceptable carrier,excipient or diluent.
for purposes of this appeal,the critical portion of the compound structure is the left moiety of the molecule,namely,the pyridyl ring that chemical structure,which has an ethyl substituent pictorially drawn to the center of the pyridyl ring,indicates that the structure covers four possible compounds,compounds with an ethyl substituent located at the four available positions on the pyridyl ring.takeda,d at.the formula includes the compound,compound,compound pioglitazone,and compound.
claim of the patent covers the single compound pioglitazone.that claim,which depends from claim,reads 
a compound as claimed in claim,wherein the compound is ethoxy benzyl thiazolidinedione.
patent,claim.pioglitazone is referred to as the compound because the ethyl substituent is attached to the on the pyridyl ring.that portion of the compound is depicted as 
alphapharm,a generic drug manufacturer,filed an abbreviated new drug application anda pursuant to the act seeking food and drug administration fda approval under j et to manufacture and sell a generic version of pioglitazone.alphapharm filed a paragraph iv certification with its anda pursuant to j b ii,asserting that the patent is invalid as obvious under.in response,takeda sued alphapharm,along with three other generic drug manufacturers who also sought fda approval to market generic pioglitazone,alleging that the defendants have infringed or will infringe the patent.
on january,the district court commenced a bench trial solely on the issues of validity and enforceability of the patent.alphapharm advanced its invalidity argument,asserting that the claimed compounds would have been obvious at the time of the alleged invention.alphapharm obviousness contention rested entirely on a prior art tzd compound that is referenced in table of the patent as compound b.the left moiety of compound b consists of a pyridyl ring with a methyl group attached to the of the ring.that portion of its chemical structure is illustrated as follows 
alphapharm asserted that the claimed compounds would have been obvious over compound 
the district court found that alphapharm failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the asserted claims were invalid as obvious under.the court first concluded that there was no motivation in the prior art to select compound b as the lead compound for antidiabetic research,and that the prior art taught away from its use.as such,the court concluded that alphapharm failed to make a prima facie case of obviousness.the court continued its analysis and found that even if alphapharm succeeded in making a prima facie showing,takeda would still prevail because any prima facie case of obviousness was rebutted by the unexpected results of pioglitazone nontoxicity.the court then rendered judgment in favor of takeda.the district court also held that the patent had not been procured though inequitable conduct.that decision has been separately appealed and has been affirmed in a decision issued today.
alphapharm timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
standard of review 
in this appeal,we are presented with one issue,namely,whether the asserted claims of the patent would have been obvious under at the time the invention was made.an invention is not patentable,inter alia,if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art.a.because a patent is presumed to be valid,the evidentiary burden to show facts supporting a conclusion of invalidity,which rests on the accused infringer,is one of clear and convincing evidence.ak steel sollac ugine.whether an invention would have been obvious under is a question of law,reviewed de novo,based upon underlying factual questions which are reviewed for clear error following a bench trial.alza mylan.
obviousness 
alphapharm raises three main arguments in support of its contention that the claims would have been obvious.first,alphapharm asserts that the district court misapplied the law,particularly the law governing obviousness in the context of structurally similar chemical compounds.according to alphapharm,the record established that compound b was the most effective antidiabetic compound in the prior art,and thus the court erred by failing to apply a presumption that one of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to make the claimed compounds.alphapharm asserts that such a conclusion is mandated by our case law,including our en banc decision in in re dillon.second,alphapharm argues that the court erred in determining the scope and content of the prior art,in particular,whether to include the prosecution history of the prior patent.lastly,alphapharm assigns error to numerous legal and factual determinations and certain evidentiary rulings that the court made during the course of the trial.
takeda responds that the district court correctly determined that alphapharm failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the asserted claims are invalid as obvious.takeda contends that there was overwhelming evidence presented at trial to support the court conclusion that no motivation existed in the prior art for one of ordinary skill in the art to select compound b as a lead compound,and even if there was,that the unexpected results of pioglitazone improved toxicity would have rebutted any prima facie showing of obviousness.takeda further argues that all of alphapharm remaining challenges to the district court legal and factual rulings are simply without merit.
we agree with takeda that the district court did not err in concluding that the asserted claims of the patent would not have been obvious.the supreme court recently addressed the issue of obviousness in ksr international teleflex,d.the court stated that the graham john deere of kansas city,d,factors still control an obviousness inquiry.those factors are the scope and content of the prior art the differences between the prior art and the claims the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art and objective evidence of nonobviousness.ksr.at quoting graham,at.
in a thorough and opinion,albeit rendered before ksr was decided by the supreme court,the district court made extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law as to the four graham factors.alphapharm arguments challenge the court determinations with respect to certain of these factors,which we now address.
differences between the prior art and the claims 
selection of compound b as lead compound 
alphapharm first argument challenges the court determination with regard to the differences between the prior art and the claims.alphapharm contends that the court erred as a matter of law in holding that the tzds were nonobvious in light of the closest prior art compound,compound b,by misapplying the law relating to obviousness of chemical compounds.
we disagree.our case law concerning prima facie obviousness of structurally similar compounds is.we have held that structural similarity between claimed and prior art subject matter,proved by combining references or otherwise,where the prior art gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions,creates a prima facie case of obviousness.dillon,at.in addition to structural similarity between the compounds,a prima facie case of obviousness also requires a showing of adequate support in the prior art for the change in structure.in re grabiak.
we elaborated on this requirement in the case of in re deuel,where we stated that n ormally a prima facie case of obviousness is based upon structural similarity,an established structural relationship between a prior art compound and the claimed compound.that is so because close or established s tructural relationships may provide the requisite motivation or suggestion to modify known compounds to obtain new compounds.id.a known compound may suggest its homolog,analog,or isomer because such compounds often have similar properties and therefore chemists of ordinary skill would ordinarily contemplate making them to try to obtain compounds with improved properties.id.we clarified,however,that in order to find a prima facie case of unpatentability in such instances,a showing that the prior art would have suggested making the specific molecular modifications necessary to achieve the claimed invention was also required.id.citing in re jones,dillon,grabiak,in re lalu.
that test for prima facie obviousness for chemical compounds is consistent with the legal principles enunciated in ksr while the ksr court rejected a rigid application of the teaching,suggestion,or motivation tsm test in an obviousness inquiry,the court acknowledged the importance of identifying a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary skill in the relevant field to combine the elements in the way the claimed new invention does in an obviousness determination.ksr.at.moreover,the court indicated that there is no necessary inconsistency between the idea underlying the tsm test and the graham analysis.id.as long as the test is not applied as a rigid and mandatory formula,that test can provide helpful insight to an obviousness inquiry.id.thus,in cases involving new chemical compounds,it remains necessary to identify some reason that would have led a chemist to modify a known compound in a particular manner to establish prima facie obviousness of a new claimed compound.
we agree with takeda and the district court that alphapharm failed to make that showing here.alphapharm argues that the prior art would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to select compound b as a lead compound.by lead compound,we understand alphapharm to refer to a compound in the prior art that would be most promising to modify in order to improve upon its antidiabetic activity and obtain a compound with better activity upon selecting that compound for antidiabetic research,alphapharm asserts that one of ordinary skill in the art would have made two obvious chemical changes first,homologation,replacing the methyl group with an ethyl group,which would have resulted in a compound and second,or moving the ethyl substituent to another position on the ring,the,thereby leading to the discovery of pioglitazone.thus,alphapharm obviousness argument clearly depends on a preliminary finding that one of ordinary skill in the art would have selected compound b as a lead compound.
the district court found,however,that one of ordinary skill in the art would not have selected compound b as the lead compound.in reaching its determination,the court first considered takeda patent the patent,which was issued on september,and its prosecution history.the court found that the patent discloses hundreds of millions of tzd compounds.takeda,d at.the patent specifically identified compounds,including compound b,that were synthesized according to the procedures described in the patent,but did not disclose experimental data or test results for any of those compounds.the prosecution history,however,disclosed test results for nine specific compounds,including compound b.that information was provided to the examiner in response to a rejection in order to show that the claimed compounds of the patent were superior to the known compounds that were disclosed in a cited reference.the court,however,found nothing in the patent,or in its file history,to suggest to one of ordinary skill in the art that those nine compounds,out of the hundreds of millions of compounds covered by the patent application,were the best performing compounds as antidiabetics,and hence targets for modification to seek improved properties.id.at.
the court next considered an article that was published the following year in by sodha et entitled studies on antidiabetic agents.ii.synthesis of benzyl dione and its derivatives sodha ii.the sodha ii reference disclosed data relating to hypoglycemic activity and plasma triglyceride lowering activity for tzd compounds.those compounds did not include pioglitazone,but included compound significantly,sodha ii identified three specific compounds that were deemed most favorable in terms of toxicity and activity.notably,compound b was not identified as one of the three most favorable compounds.on the contrary,compound b,was singled out as causing considerable increases in body weight and brown fat weight.
the court also considered takeda patent.that patent covers a subset of compounds originally included in the patent application,namely,tzd compounds where the pyridyl or thiazolyl groups may be substituted.id.at.the broadest claim of the patent covers over one million compounds.id.at.compound b was specifically claimed in claim of the patent.the court noted that a preliminary amendment in the prosecution history of the patent contained a statement that the compounds in which these heterocyclic rings are substituted have become important,especially compound b.id.
based on the prior art as a whole,however,the court found that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have selected compound b as a lead compound for antidiabetic treatment.although the prosecution history of the patent included the statement that characterized compound b as especially important,the court found that any suggestion to select compound b was essentially negated by the disclosure of the sodha ii reference.the court reasoned that one of ordinary skill in the art would not have chosen compound b,notwithstanding the statement in the patent prosecution history,given the more exhaustive and reliable scientific analysis presented by sodha ii,which taught away from compound b,and the evidence from all of the tzd patents that takeda filed contemporaneously with the p atent showing that there were many promising,broad avenues for further research.id.at.
the court found that the three compounds that the sodha ii reference identified as most favorable and valuable for the treatment of diabetes,not compound b,would have served as the best starting point for further investigation to a person of ordinary skill in the art.id.at.because diabetes is a chronic disease and thus would require long term treatment,the court reasoned that researchers would have been dissuaded from selecting a lead compound that exhibited negative effects,such as toxicity,or other adverse side effects,especially one that causes considerable increases in body weight and brown fat weight.id.at.thus,the court determined that the prior art did not suggest to one of ordinary skill in the art that compound b would be the best candidate as the lead compound for antidiabetic research.
admissions from alphapharm witnesses further buttressed the court conclusion.rosenberg,head of alphapharm intellectual property department,testified as a b witness on behalf of alphapharm.in discussing sodha ii,rosenberg admitted that there was nothing in the article that would recommend that a person of ordinary skill in the art choose compound b over other compounds in the article that had the same efficacy rating.rosenberg,acknowledging that compound b had the negative side effects of increased body weight and brown fat,also admitted that a compound with such side effects would presumably not be a suitable candidate compound for treatment of type ii diabetes.alphapharm expert,mosberg,concurred in that view at his deposition when he admitted that a medicinal chemist would find such side effects undesirable.
moreover,another alphapharm b witness,barry spencer,testified at his deposition that in reviewing the prior art,one of ordinary skill in the art would have chosen three compounds in sodha ii as lead compounds for research,not solely compound b.in addition,takeda witness,morton,testified that at the time sodha ii was published,it was known that obesity contributed to insulin resistance and type diabetes.thus,one of ordinary skill in the art would have concluded that sodha ii taught away from pyridyl compounds because it associated adverse side effects with compound 
we do not accept alphapharm assertion that ksr,as well as another case recently decided by this court,pfizer,apotex,mandates reversal.relying on ksr,alphapharm argues that the claimed compounds would have been obvious because the prior art compound fell within the objective reach of the claim,and the evidence demonstrated that using the techniques of homologation and would have been obvious to try.additionally,alphapharm argues that our holding in pfizer,where we found obvious certain claims covering a particular salt,directly supports its position.
we disagree.the ksr court recognized that w hen there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified,predictable solutions,a person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp.ksr.at.in such circumstances,the fact that a combination was obvious to try might show that it was obvious under.id.that is not the case here.rather than identify predictable solutions for antidiabetic treatment,the prior art disclosed a broad selection of compounds any one of which could have been selected as a lead compound for further investigation.significantly,the closest prior art compound compound b,the exhibited negative properties that would have directed one of ordinary skill in the art away from that compound.thus,this case fails to present the type of situation contemplated by the court when it stated that an invention may be deemed obvious if it was obvious to try.the evidence showed that it was not obvious to try.
similarly,alphapharm reliance on pfizer fares no better.in pfizer,we held that certain claims covering the besylate salt of amlodipine would have been obvious.the prior art included a reference,referred to as the berge reference,that disclosed a genus of pharmaceutically acceptable anions that could be used to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts,as well as other publications that disclosed the chemical characteristics of the besylate salt.pfizer,at.noting that our conclusion was based on the particularized facts of this case,we found that the prior art provided ample motivation to narrow the genus of anions disclosed by berge to a few,including benzene sulphonate.id.at.here,the court found nothing in the prior art to narrow the possibilities of a lead compound to compound b.in contrast,the court found that one of ordinary skill in the art would have chosen one of the many compounds disclosed in sodha ii,of which there were over ninety,that did not disclose the existence of toxicity or side effects,and to engage in research to increase the efficacy and confirm the absence of toxicity of those compounds,rather than to choose as a starting point a compound with identified adverse effects.thus,pfizer does not control this case.
based on the record before us,we conclude that the district court were not clearly erroneous and were supported by evidence in the record.moreover,we reject the assertion that the court failed to correctly apply the law relating to prima facie obviousness of chemical compounds.because alphapharm obviousness argument rested entirely on the court making a preliminary finding that the prior art would have led to the selection of compound b as the lead compound,and alphapharm failed to prove that assertion,the court did not commit reversible error by failing to apply a presumption of motivation.we thus conclude that the court did not err in holding that alphapharm failed to establish a prima facie case of obviousness.see eli lilly zenith goldline,affirming the district court finding of nonobviousness upon concluding,in part,that the prior art compound would not have been chosen as a lead compound.
choice of the claimed compounds 
even if alphapharm had established that preliminary finding,and we have concluded that it did not,the record demonstrates that alphapharm obviousness argument fails on a second ground.the district court found nothing in the prior art to suggest making the specific molecular modifications to compound b that are necessary to achieve the claimed compounds.in reaching that conclusion,the court first found that the process of modifying lead compounds was not routine at the time of the invention.takeda,d at.mosberg opined that the steps of homologation and were routine steps in the drug optimization process,but the court found that testimony unavailing in light of the contrary,more credible,testimony offered by takeda experts.id.at.in addition,the court relied on rosenberg admission that a person of ordinary skill in the art would look at a host of substituents,such as chlorides,halides and others,not just methyls in modifying the pyridyl ring.id.
pioglitazone differs from compound b in two respects,and one would have to both homologate the methyl group of compound b and move the resulting ethyl group to the on the pyridyl ring in order to obtain pioglitazone.with regard to homologation,the court found nothing in the prior art to provide a reasonable expectation that adding a methyl group to compound b would reduce or eliminate its toxicity.based on the test results of the numerous compounds disclosed in sodha ii,the court concluded that homologation had no tendency to decrease unwanted side effects
