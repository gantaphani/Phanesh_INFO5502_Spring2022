in this diversity case,daniel and catrina jerden plaintiffs brought a claim of medical negligence against paul amstutz defendant after defendant,a neurosurgeon,mistakenly diagnosed jerden as having a brain tumor based partly on defendant interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging mri reports.defendant conducted invasive and unwarranted brain surgery on jerden before the correct diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was made.
plaintiffs appeal from the judgment entered against them after a jury trial resulted in a verdict for defendant,contending that the district court committed reversible error warranting a new trial.plaintiffs assert that there was reversible error based on the granting of defendant motion for a limiting instruction to the testimony of plaintiffs expert witness,karl gross,on the last day of trial the actual jury instruction limiting gross testimony the testimony of defendant witness,don bowser,relating to his opinion of the magnetic resonance angiogram mra report and the district court denial of plaintiffs motion for a new trial in light of the above claims and newly discovered evidence that defendant has a prosthetic eye.we agree that there was error in the granting of a motion limiting the jury consideration of gross testimony,and error with regard to admission of bowser opinion concerning the mra report.we reverse and remand.
in june,jerden was referred to amstutz,who was called upon to evaluate an unknown illness.after examining mri reports of jerden,amstutz made a diagnosis that jerden had a brain tumor and recommended a craniotomy.on july,amstutz performed a craniotomy on jerden,who was thereafter correctly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis based on pathology analysis of the brain tissue removed during the operation.
plaintiffs,in their action for medical negligence,asserted that a less invasive biopsy would have had fewer physical implications and would have allowed a greater possibility of recovery from the effects of the plaques formed in the brain by the demyelination associated with multiple sclerosis.plaintiffs alleged that defendant failed to review adequately the diagnostic mri reports,radiology reports,and jerden medical history and symptoms,which indicated signs of multiple sclerosis.plaintiffs also contended that defendant was negligent for failing to use less intrusive diagnostic methods than the craniotomy and for failing to consult with qualified specialists such as neurologists.
the jury trial commenced on may.as pertinent to this appeal,plaintiffs presented testimony from two medical doctors,karl gross,a neurologist,and martin johnson,a neurosurgeon,who both testified that defendant breached his standard of care and that this breach was the cause of plaintiffs injuries.defendant countered with the presentation of medical testimony from elaine edmonds,a neurologist,and edward neuwelt,a neurosurgeon,who both testified that the initial diagnosis of a brain tumor was reasonable under the circumstances.in addition,the jury heard testimony from defendant amstutz and from a neurosurgical nurse practitioner,bowser,who had worked with defendant since and who had assisted amstutz during jerden operation.
after a trial,the jury returned a verdict for the defendant on june.on june,plaintiffs filed their motion for new trial which was denied on september.plaintiffs appeal.
we first consider plaintiffs contention that the district court erred by granting a motion to strike testimony of gross,a neurologist,and instructing the jury that it could not consider his testimony on the issue of negligence 
oregon has adopted a locality rule in medical malpractice actions whereby physicians have the duty to use that degree of care,skill and diligence that is used by ordinarily careful physicians or podiatric physicians and surgeons in the same or similar circumstances in the community of the physician or podiatric physician and surgeon or a similar community.last amended.pursuant to federal rule of evidence,the district court was required to follow the oregon locality rule when presented with the testimony of medical experts who testify as to the appropriate standard of care for local physician defendants.under this evidentiary rule,experts must show knowledge of what is proper conduct by practitioners in the community or a similar community under circumstances similar to those which confronted the defendant.creasey hogan,or.
during the trial,on wednesday,may,gross testified for plaintiffs,stating that the mri reports taken on june,were highly suspicious of multiple sclerosis that he had been referred cases from neurosurgeons who had looked at mri reports that were suspicious of multiple sclerosis and that in his experience as a neurologist,when a neurosurgeon is suspicious of multiple sclerosis,a referral is made to a neurologist.gross also testified as to what as a neurologist he would have done or recommended,rather than a craniotomy,had he been consulted on mri reports such as these in the case where a patient had complained of numbness.gross did not expressly testify that he had knowledge of the proper medical conduct within defendant community or a similar community.during the testimony of gross,counsel for defendant objected based on lack of foundation,lack of qualification as to what a surgeon should do,after asking gross if he ever practiced surgery.although the district court did not at this time make a ruling concerning this objection,plaintiffs counsel in substance cured this objection by asking gross about his professional experience as a neurologist working with neurosurgeons.see creasey,at allowing the testimony of medical experts from another discipline in medical malpractice actions on matters where the principles of both schools concur.
on may,defendant moved to strike the portion of gross testimony relating to whether defendant satisfied his standard of care.the record is not crystal clear on whether the basis for the motion was disclosed when it was made on may,or on the last day of trial,june,when the motion was granted.however,this potential difference is not material to our analysis which proceeds on the assumption that the basis was disclosed on may,two days after gross testimony had concluded.defendant argued that gross testimony relating to defendant standard of care was inadmissible because gross,in his testimony two days earlier,had not stated that he was familiar with the proper medical conduct in defendant community in compliance with the foundational requirement under creasey the court granted the defendant motion to strike on june,concluding that a necessary predicate for the testimony was not given,which the court described as a lack of magic words.shortly thereafter,the court instructed the jury you have heard testimony from karl gross.this testimony should be considered by you for a limited purpose only.you are instructed that you may not use any of gross testimony as a basis for deciding whether amstutz was negligent.
plaintiffs have argued on appeal that the limiting instruction regarding gross testimony should not have been given because the objection was untimely,and because the phrasing of the instruction was overbroad.we focus on the first contention,and consider the issue of the timeliness of the objection to be dispositive in our assessment of whether trial error by the district court occurred 
the rule requiring timely objection to evidence in federal trials is set forth explicitly in the federal rules of evidence.error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected,and a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record,stating the specific ground of objection,if the specific ground was not apparent from the context.
this rule is reflected in the guidance of a respected procedural treatise.an objection must be made as soon as the ground of it is known,or could reasonably have been known to the objector,unless some special reason makes its postponement desirable for him and not unfair to the offeror.charles alan wright kenneth graham,federal practice and procedure ed citing john wigmore,code of evidence ed.the requirement of timely and specific objections serves to ensure that the nature of the error is called to the attention of the judge,so as to alert him or her to the proper course of action and enable opposing counsel to take corrective measures.united states,cir quoting advisory committee note to rule a,first alteration in original.
the specific basis for defendant objection to gross testimony should have been asserted when gross testified as to defendant compliance with his standard of care without reciting that he had knowledge of the proper medical conduct within defendant community an objection is timely if it is made as soon as the opponent knows,or should know,that the objection is applicable.jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence joseph mclaughlin,ed footnotes omitted see also san antonio cmty.hosp.cal.dist.council of carpenters,cir concluding that the failure to raise a hearsay objection until the close of direct examination is a waiver of the objection mcknight johnson controls,cir belmont indus.bethlehem steel,cir.
despite the apparent delay and the lack of timeliness of the defendant specific objection at issue,we recognize that trial courts have broad discretion in making evidence rulings and handling late objections.home indem.lane powell moss miller,cir see also united states achiekwelu,cir even when a district court admits evidence without objection,the district court has the discretion to grant a subsequent motion made after the close of the evidence to exclude the evidence.however,we hold here that the court late exclusion of gross testimony was an abuse of its discretion because the untimely decision unfairly prevented plaintiffs from providing a curative response.
we have adhered to the general rule that neither the district court nor the opposing party may unfairly deprive parties of the opportunity to lay a foundation in support of their evidence.the opposing party may not delay objections until after trial such that it becomes too late to resolve them effectively.see bartleson united states,cir holding that an objection not raised during trial is waived because the delay denied the witness the opportunity to lay a better foundation for his testimony,and potentially denied the government the opportunity to introduce other evidence on the issue.also,the district court may not exclude evidence before trial without allowing the parties to lay a foundation for its admission.see wendt host international,cir holding that the district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence on summary judgment without providing the parties with the opportunity respectively to lay a foundation for the admission of the survey or to challenge the adequacy of the foundation.our prior decisions viewed together support the principle that an objection to admission of evidence on foundational grounds must give the basis for objection in a timely way to permit the possibility of cure.
this principle is reinforced by decisions of other circuits that have required district courts to give parties an opportunity to respond to objections to the foundation of their evidence.given the liberal thrust of the federal rules it is particularly important that the side trying to defend the admission of evidence be given an adequate chance to do so.padillas,cir citation omitted.counsel should not sandbag daubert concerns until the close of an opponent case,thereby placing opposing counsel and the trial court at a severe disadvantage.alfred caterpillar,cir 
considering our precedent and that of other circuits interpreting rule,we hold that the exclusion of testimony for lack of foundation is improper following an untimely objection if such objection unfairly deprives the proponents of the testimony of an opportunity to cure the objection.applying this rule here,we conclude that the district court did not give plaintiffs an opportunity to lay a foundation for the testimony after the basis of defendant objection to the existing foundation was belatedly made clear.any foundational flaw in the testimony of gross as presented likely could have been fixed if defendant had disclosed to plaintiffs the basis for his objection when gross was still on the witness stand and available to amplify his testimony 
defendant contended at oral argument that his objection at the close of plaintiffs evidence was timely because plaintiffs failed to present an essential element of their case so that the testimony was not improper until plaintiffs closed their case without providing the necessary predicate.however,we reject this argument because oregon case law describes the foundation requirement as a rule of evidence,and not as an element of defendant standard of care.see creasey,at stating that while the definition of defendant standard of care is a rule of law,t he evidence question is one of foundation or competency can an expert testify as to the propriety of a local practitioner treatment absent some knowledge of the standard of medical treatment in the community.therefore,the testimony of gross was immediately objectionable once gross stated his opinion on the standard of care if he had not satisfied all necessary foundation for his opinion testimony 
a timely and specific objection to gross knowledge of the standard of medical conduct in defendant community would have allowed plaintiffs to attempt to resolve the foundational concern by asking gross whether he had knowledge of the proper standard for defendant community or a similar community.the district court should have given plaintiffs an opportunity to lay a proper foundation under the locality rule,if they could do so,before the court decided to grant defendant untimely motion and to severely limit the jury consideration of gross testimony.by striking key portions of gross testimony that supported the negligence claim,without providing plaintiffs with an opportunity to correct the foundational requirement of knowledge of local medical standards,the district court abused its discretion.
plaintiffs also assert error in the admission of bowser testimony concerning his observations of the mra report,which are a special type of mri report.bowser is a neurosurgical nurse practitioner who acted as defendant surgical assistant during the operation on jerden.he testified that he routinely reviewed imaging reports before operations although he was not licensed to interpret them.
plaintiffs examined bowser as an adverse witness during their.during,defendant asked bowser about his observations of the mra report of jerden and whether he thought that they indicated a brain tumor.defendant argues that plaintiffs failed to make a timely objection to this testimony.the transcript shows that plaintiffs counsel promptly and specifically objected when these questions were raised by the defendant but the objection was overruled by the court the district court held that these statements were admissible because bowser was testifying as a fact witness and did not state any opinions as an expert 
lay witnesses can permissibly base opinion testimony upon their experience,but the federal rules of evidence require that lay opinion testimony be a rationally based on the perception of the witness,b helpful to a clear understanding of the witness testimony or the determination of a fact in issue,and c not based on scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge within the scope of rule.the mere percipience of a witness to the facts on which he wishes to tender an opinion does not trump rule.united states,cir holding that opinions were based on specialized knowledge within the meaning of rule because they were properly characterized as testimony based on the perceptions,education,training,and experience of the witness.
bowser testimony contained detailed and scientific observations about the mra report and the conclusions that he interpreted the mra of jerden brain to show signs of a brain tumor.bowser testimony did not merely relate his factual observations of what occurred that was within his competence to describe instead,he rendered opinions and inferences that he drew from his observations and that,as he hims
