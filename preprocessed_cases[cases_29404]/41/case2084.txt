kevin ray buckwalter,appeals the district court dismissal of claims he brought against the members of the nevada state board of medical examiners board members,in their individual capacities,under.buckwalter alleged that the board members deprived him of his constitutional rights when,in an ex parte emergency proceeding,they summarily suspended his authority to prescribe medication.the issues presented for review are whether the board members are entitled to absolute immunity from liability for the exercise of their summary authority,and whether younger abstention proscribes the federal courts from hearing buckwalter case while the state proceedings are pending.
we hold that the board members are absolutely immune from buckwalter claims for money damages,and that younger abstention bars buckwalter claims for equitable relief.we therefore affirm.
background 
buckwalter has been a licensed physician in nevada since.in,the nevada state board of medical examiners the board began to investigate citizen complaints that buckwalter was overprescribing narcotic analgesics.the board investigative committee ordered a peer review of the results of the investigation to determine whether buckwalter conduct as a physician was consistent with prevailing professional standards.two peer reviewers concluded that in several instances,buckwalter conduct fell below the minimum standard of care.
edward cousineau,a board member,filed a formal administrative complaint with the board.the complaint charged buckwalter with three counts of wrongdoing and alleged that he was an imminent threat to the health and safety of his patients and the public in general.on that basis,cousineau asked the board to summarily suspend buckwalter authority to prescribe or administer controlled substances.
on november,the board convened an emergency telephone meeting to review the complaint and summary suspension request.buckwalter was not notified of the charges against him or offered an opportunity to participate in the meeting.in the meeting,the board members concluded that there was sufficient evidence that buckwalter posed a danger to public welfare to justify the summary suspension of his authority to prescribe,administer,and dispense controlled substances in nevada.the board members also scheduled a full hearing on the administrative complaint for march,as well as a prehearing conference for early february.the board immediately notified buckwalter of the summary suspension and the hearing schedule.
in the months following the summary suspension,the parties worked to reach a settlement.on the eve of the hearing date,buckwalter and the board entered into a joint stipulation to vacate the hearing in anticipation of a finalized settlement.ultimately,however,the full board voted to reject the proposed settlement.buckwalter did not withdraw from the stipulation or demand that a hearing be reset,opting instead to attempt to reach a new settlement that would pass muster with the board.
the parties never reached a mutually satisfactory agreement,and in november buckwalter commenced this action under in the district of nevada,charging the board and its members with depriving him of constitutional due process.the complaint alleged that the board members denied buckwalter due process first by summarily suspending his prescribing privileges,and second by failing to promptly conduct a hearing following the summary suspension.
the district court dismissed all of buckwalter claims,holding that they were barred by absolute immunity and,in the alternative,that younger abstention precluded a federal court from hearing the case.buckwalter timely appealed.
ii.standard of review 
whether a public official is entitled to absolute immunity is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.miller davis,cir quoting goldstein city of long beach,cir.we review de novo the district court decision to abstain under the younger doctrine.potrero hills landfill,cnty.of solano,cir.
we also review de novo a district court order dismissing a complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.see cervantes united states,cir.we assume that buckwalter allegations of fact are true and analyze them in the light most favorable to his claims.see id.
iii.discussion 
absolute immunity.
state and federal executive are absolutely immune from suits if they perform special functions which,because of their similarity to functions that would have been immune when congress enacted,deserve absolute protection from damages liability.buckley fitzsimmons,d quoting butz economou,d.
it is the nature of the function performed,not the identity of the actor who performed it,that determines whether an official is cloaked by absolute immunity.id.at.the paradigmatic functions giving rise to absolute immunity are those of judges and prosecutors.see tamas dep t of soc.health,cir quoting olsen idaho state bd.of,cir.absolute immunity is also accorded to officials of government agencies performing certain functions analogous to those of a prosecutor or a judge.butz,at.
to determine whether a particular state officer role is functionally comparable to that of a judge,we consider six nonexclusive factors,decocted from butz,that indicate a judicial function 
a the need to assure that the individual can perform his functions without harassment or intimidation b the presence of safeguards that reduce the need for private damages actions as a means of controlling unconstitutional conduct c insulation from political influence d the importance of precedent e the adversary nature of the process and f the correctability of error on appeal.
cleavinger saxner,d citing butz,at.if,upon applying these butz factors,we determine that an official was functioning in a judicial or capacity when he undertook the act giving rise to the suit,then absolute immunity protects him from liability.id.an official can not be subjected to responsibility in a civil action,however erroneous the act may have been,and however injurious in its consequences it may have proved to the plaintiff.id.at quoting bradley fisher,wall.
we have previously held that members of state medical boards are functionally comparable to judges and thus entitled to absolute immunity for their acts.mishler clift,cir.but that does not settle this case the protection of absolute immunity reaches only those actions that are judicial or closely associated with the judicial process.id.quoting buckley,at.and buckwalter contends that two acts by the board members were nonjudicial and therefore outside the ambit of absolute immunity their summary suspension of his prescribing privileges and their failure to provide him a prompt postdeprivation hearing.we consider each act in turn.
the summary suspension.
in mishler,we held that absolute immunity applies to acts occurring during the disciplinary hearing process.id.at.buckwalter argues that when the board members exercise their emergency summary suspension authority,they should not enjoy the same immunity that they do when they conduct formal disciplinary hearings.
determining whether mishler rationale extends to a prehearing summary suspension requires us briefly to review the operation of the two nevada statutes that define the board disciplinary authority,as those statutes appeared in chapter of the nevada revised statutes,and the nevada administrative procedure act,nevada revised statutes 
chapter specifies that once the board receives a complaint about a physician,an investigative committee reviews it to determine whether is has a reasonable basis.see.if the investigation substantiates the complaint,the board may bring formal charges against the physician and set a hearing date.id.physicians facing discipline must receive notice of the charges,the hearing date,and any possible sanctions they are also entitled to representation by counsel and the right to present evidence on any relevant issue.see id.
section of the nevada administrative procedure act empowers the board to summarily suspend a medical license if the agency finds that public health,safety or welfare imperatively require emergency action,and incorporates a finding to that effect in its order.id.following a summary suspension,however,a formal administrative hearing must be promptly instituted and determined.id.
the defendants in mishler also members of the nevada state board of medical not summarily suspend the plaintiff license they revoked it after an administrative hearing.see at.we concluded that five of the six butz factors militated in favor of absolutely immunizing the board members from liability for that action.id.at.
first,we noted that an agency whose raison is to discipline medical professionals is likely to provoke frequent litigation.see id.at.given the vital interests at stake,the court concluded that there was a strong need to make certain that board members could perform these disciplinary functions without the threat of harassment or intimidation.id.
second,we opined that it was difficult to dispute that adequate procedural safeguards trammeled the board members authority.id.the comprehensive umbrella of statutes governing the board conduct created procedural safeguards akin to those available under federal administrative law.id.at see also butz,at t he administrative procedure act contains a number of provisions designed to guarantee the independence of hearing examiners in light of these safeguards,we think that the risk of an unconstitutional act by one presiding at an agency hearing is clearly outweighed by the importance of preserving the independent judgment of these men and women.
reviewing the third factor the board members insulation from political influence we concluded that the board members were sufficiently independent because they were appointed by the governor and removable only for good cause.id.at.
the fourth butz factor,the importance of precedent,was the only one that we felt did not weigh in favor of absolute immunity.see id.at it is unclear from the record to what extent the nevada board relies on precedent in making its disciplinary decisions.the fifth and sixth factors,however,buttressed the case that the board members were judicial homologues when performing their disciplinary functions 
i t is clear that the disciplinary process is adversary in nature and that errors made by the board are correctable on appeal.physicians are entitled to representation by counsel and may present evidence at a formal disciplinary hearing.the decision of the board must be in writing and contain the board findings and any sanctions.judicial review of the nevada board decision is available.
id.internal citations omitted.
viewing the six factors as a totality,we held that the board members were functionally comparable to judges,and that adjudicating hearings was a act for which they were absolutely immune from liability.id.
the calculus is obviously somewhat different in the context of emergency summary suspensions.in nevada,summary suspension proceedings entail substantially fewer procedural protections for physicians they are nonadversarial and often ex parte,they employ an indeterminate burden of proof,and they are not subject to the various procedural strictures that govern formal disciplinary hearings.and although the board is required to institute a formal hearing after a summary suspension,nevada law only requires that it be promptly instituted a vague directive that raises the possibility of coercive delays.
indeed,buckwalter own experience demonstrates the parsimony of the procedural safeguards built into the summary suspension procedure.he received no notice of the emergency ex parte telephone conference in which his prescribing privileges were suspended.he had no opportunity to contest the charge that he was a danger to the public before the board members curtailed his professional authority.and the revocation hearing date the board scheduled was to have taken place more than four months after the summary suspension.the board members may have considered a wait reasonable.buckwalter,whose livelihood was at stake,presumably did not.
in spite of these procedural deficiencies,we are convinced that the board members summary suspension power is analogous to a judicial function.the mishler court application of the butz factors to the board members disciplinary hearing authority largely applies to their summary suspension authority.first,the board members interest in performing their functions free from harassment is at its apex when a physician poses a serious threat to public safety.see mishler,at in view of the public interest of ensuring quality health care,there is a strong need to make certain that board members can perform these disciplinary functions without the threat of harassment or intimidation.internal quotation marks omitted.abrogating absolute immunity for summary suspensions could make board members hesitant to act quickly and decisively to protect the public.
second,though summary suspension proceedings lack the procedural safeguards of formal disciplinary hearings,state law provides that whenever the board members exercise their summary suspension power,a formal hearing ineluctably follows.the board members temporary emergency judgment is thus necessarily tested in the crucible of an administrative hearing with a full complement of procedural safeguards.had buckwalter opted to go forward with the disciplinary hearing instead of stipulating to postpone it,he would have received precisely the due process that the physician in mishler did.the same logic extends to the fifth butz factor,the adversary character of the proceeding.summary suspensions are effectively adversary because they are subject to mandatory postdeprivation review.
buckwalter argues that the safeguard of a mandatory postdeprivation hearing is inadequate,because the requirement that the hearing be promptly instituted and determined is too vague to provide meaningful due process.there is no indication,however,that the board exercised its implicit discretion to interpret the term promptly in an abusive manner in buckwalter case.cassim bowen,cir w e are unwilling to invalidate a statute because it might,but need not,be applied in an unconstitutional manner.quotation marks omitted.in the emergency suspension meeting,the board members set dates for both a formal hearing and a prehearing conference and immediately informed buckwalter of the schedule.buckwalter did not complain at the time that the board members were being dilatory.four months is not swift process,but neither is it unreasonably slow.see id.at postdeprivation hearing delay of four or five months is sufficiently prompt to provide due process.we are persuaded that is a sufficient restraint on improper use of the board summary powers.
the third factor is the board members insulation from political influence.in mishler,we concluded that the structure of the nevada board and the procedural requirements of their decisionmaking process show that the board members are sufficiently insulated from political influence.at.buckwalter argues that the real world of nevada politics belies that judgment.he alleges that the board members pursued buckwalter case and refused to settle it to burnish the board image in the wake of a public scandal involving the reuse of medical supplies at an outpatient endoscopy center.
judicial independence is a structural characteristic,not an empirical one.the question is whether the conditions of an official employment tend to promote independent judgment,not whether a particular decision was affected by the official cognizance of current events.see cleavinger,at noting that members of a prison disciplinary committee are not independent because they are direct subordinates of the warden see also stern marshall,d explaining that the life tenure and salary protections of article iii were adopted to create the conditions under which judges would be likely to act free from improper influence.we have already held that the structure of the board shows that its members are sufficiently insulated from political influence.see mishler,at.even if buckwalter claim that a scandal influenced the board members behavior is true,that fact does not gainsay the board members political independence.after all,j udges do not exist in a vacuum.hoptowit ray,cir,abrogated on othe
