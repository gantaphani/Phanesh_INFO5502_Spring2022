factual and procedural background 
carolyn modica began working as an inspector for the texas cosmetology commission tcc in beaumont,texas,in august.in,modica and other tcc employees expressed concerns about the demotion of their supervisor,larry perkins,in a letter sent to the chairman of the tcc.modica also attended a tcc meeting during which she addressed the tcc regarding perkins demotion,her discovery of files containing pornography on an employee computer,and her concerns that the executive director,neil holifield,had instructed inspectors to report their numbers incorrectly.
according to modica,following the tcc meeting,her supervisors retaliated against her in various ways for voicing her concerns and associating with other employees.specifically,modica asserts that she was denied a merit pay raise and that her application for the position of director of enforcement was ignored.in november,modica filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc alleging gender discrimination.
in december,during an inspection of a beauty school in her district,modica was involved in an altercation with the school and her brother.the police were called to the scene and modica accused the two of assaulting her.crediting modica account,the police arrested the vice president and her brother however,two months later,the vice president filed a criminal complaint against modica.following a jury trial,modica was convicted of simple assault.
in september,modica was again denied a merit pay raise.in may,modica sent a letter to texas state representative roberto gutierrez accusing the tcc and holifield of the following cheating on numbers to make performance levels higher eliminating the tracking system for complaints abusing travel expenses misusing state funds permitting inappropriate activities in the workplace failing to make the law books sold to the public consistent harassing and abusive conduct and preferentially treating schools found in violation of state regulations and failing to hold administrative hearings to collect outstanding fines.
in june,modica applied for the position of executive director,which became vacant after holifield death.her application was considered,but she did not receive an interview and was not selected for the position.antoinette humphrey was selected as the new executive director,and,in that capacity,humphrey was charged with responding to modica complaints.accordingly,she met in person with representative gutierrez to address the contents of modica may letter modica participated in the meeting via telephone.modica contends that shortly after the meeting,humphrey began retaliating against her by micromanaging her schedule and requiring her to travel long distances to perform inspections.on november,modica filed the underlying suit against humphrey and others alleging first amendment retaliation pursuant to.
in april,modica injured her knee while working as a result,she filed a claim for workers compensation benefits and took medical leave in june.before modica took leave,humphrey informed her that her inspection district would be eliminated due to budgetary constraints.humphrey subsequently offered her an inspector position in san antonio modica accepted and was expected to report to work on august.
on july,modica communicated with the tcc human resources manager via to ask whether the agency was covered by the fmla and to request the appropriate documents.two days later,modica sent a second to the human resources manager requesting the relevant forms for short and disability.the following day she renewed her request for the documents.modica asserts that she never received the information or forms that she requested.
on august,modica notified the tcc that she was still on medical leave.humphrey responded that the san antonio position needed to be filled immediately however,she offered modica a position in el paso,which was to be held open through the end of august,the expiration of modica medical leave.modica accepted but warned that she was not sure when she would be able to return to work.modica subsequently extended her medical leave until november,consequently,she did not report to work on september as expected.on september,the tcc terminated modica employment humphrey informed her that the el paso position needed to be filled immediately and no other inspection positions were available.
modica subsequently amended her pleadings to allege wrongful termination in retaliation for filing an eeoc charge,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,exercising her first amendment rights and taking fmla leave.the defendants filed various motions for summary judgment and partial summary judgment.the district court dismissed the tcc and individual commissioners for various reasons the court also dismissed modica title vii claim as untimely.nevertheless,the court concluded that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding whether humphrey actually terminated modica for requesting fmla leave or writing the letter to representative gutierrez.the court further concluded that humphrey was not entitled to qualified immunity against either of these claims.humphrey timely appealed,challenging the district court denial of summary judgment based on her assertion of qualified immunity.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
because this an appeal from the district court denial of summary judgment predicated on qualified immunity,we have jurisdiction only to the extent that the appeal concerns the purely legal question whether the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity on the facts that the district court found sufficiently supported in the summary judgment record.kinney weaver,cir en banc.accordingly,we do not review the district court determination that a genuine factual dispute exists instead,we consider only whether the district court erred in assessing the legal significance of the conduct that the district court deemed sufficiently supported for purposes of summary judgment.id.at.
qualified immunity 
humphrey challenges the district court denial of qualified immunity against both of modica claims of retaliatory discharge.the doctrine of qualified immunity immunizes government officials acting within their discretionary authority from civil damages if their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional law of which a reasonable person would have known.hernandez ex rel.hernandez.dep t of protective regulatory,cir.the qualified immunity determination is a inquiry.first,the court must decide whether a plaintiff allegations,if true,establish a violation of a clearly established right.id.second,if the plaintiff has alleged a violation,the court must then decide whether the conduct was objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law at the time of the incident.id.even if the government official conduct violates a clearly established federal right,the official is nonetheless entitled to qualified immunity if her conduct was objectively reasonable.id.accordingly,to decide whether the district court erred in denying humphrey motion for summary judgment,we must first determine whether modica allegations,if true,manifest conduct that is objectively unreasonable in violation of a clearly established federal right.see kinney,at.
when a defendant invokes qualified immunity,the burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate the inapplicability of the defense.atteberry nocona hosp,cir quoting mcclendon city of columbia,cir en banc per curiam.
to discharge this burden,a plaintiff must satisfy a test.first,he must claim that the defendants committed a constitutional violation under current law.second,he must claim that the defendants actions were objectively unreasonable in light of the law that was clearly established at the time of the actions complained of.see id.this bifurcated legal standard is designed both to promote clearer standards for official conduct and to spare defendants unwarranted liability and court costs.

section first amendment retaliation 
to prevail on a first amendment retaliation claim,a public employee must establish the following she suffered an adverse employment action her speech involved a matter of public concern her interest in commenting on matters of public concern outweighs the employer interest in promoting efficiency and her speech motivated the employer adverse action.johnson louisiana,cir.whether the speech at issue is on a matter of public concern is a question of law that must be determined by the court.salge edna indep.sch,cir.
humphrey argues that the district court erred in concluding that modica speech was protected by the first amendment because it did not involve matters of public concern instead,she contends that modica speech solely concerned private matters because it was in furtherance of a personal dispute.modica letter to representative gutierrez discussed private workplace issues,such as inappropriate activities in the work place and preferential treatment of certain schools,as well as matters of public concern,namely the misuse of public funds.accordingly,modica speech is properly classified as mixed speech.we have observed that m ixed speech cases are perhaps the most difficult subset of employee speech cases to adjudicate.kennedy tangipahoa parish library bd.of control,cir.in deciding whether modica speech as a whole relates to the public concern such that it is entitled to protection,we consider the content,form,and context of a given statement,as revealed by the whole record.connick myers,d teague city of flower mound,cir.
although modica letter addressed some private issues,the content of modica letter is primarily public.modica expressed private concerns relating to management policies such as allowing employees to participate in inappropriate activities during work hours and holifield abuse of his authority however,t he existence of an element of personal interest on the part of an employee in the speech does not prevent finding that the speech as a whole raises issues of public concern,dodds childers,cir.modica raised concerns about the misuse of public funds in regard to employee travel and unnecessary purchases for the office,as well as concerns about the erroneous reporting of the number of inspections to the state legislature see branton city of dallas,cir stating that speech disclosing evidence of impropriety by city officials addresses matters of public concern see also marohnic walker,cir public interest is near its zenith when ensuring that public organizations are being operated in accordance with the law,and seeing that public funds are not purloined.citations omitted.as we explained in kennedy,the content of the speech may relate to the public concern if it does not involve solely personal matters or strictly a discussion of management policies that is only interesting to the public by virtue of the manager status as an arm of the government.at.despite modica statement in the letter that she was a victim of retaliation and harassment,only two of the ten issues she addressed relate to this allegation the letter primary focus is holifield malfeasance.accordingly,the releas e of the letter to the public would inform the populace of more than the fact of modica employment grievance,see id.at,and,the content of modica speech weighs in favor of protection.
the form of modica speech,a letter to a state representative,also militates in favor of protection.though not dispositive,modica choice to inform someone outside the tcc of her concerns supports her contention that the speech is public.dodds,at finding that the form and context of an employee complaint did not support her contention that she addressed a matter of public concern where she did not address her complaints to anyone outside the institution terrell of.police,cir terrell personal notebook can not serve as the basis for a claim that he was fired for exercising his first amendment rights.he made no effort to communicate the contents of the notebook to the public,and the evidence does not suggest that he would have had any occasion to do so.in teague,former police officers alleged that they were discharged for exercising their first amendment rights by filing grievances against the chief of police.we reasoned that the form of the plaintiffs speech was private because the grievances focused on their inability to obtain redress for removal from an investigation.id.at.in contrast,the majority of modica concerns did not relate to her personal grievances,but to the impact holifield management had on the public and licensees consequently,we conclude that the form of modica speech was primarily public.
the context of modica speech also favors protection.although there is evidence of an dispute in the underlying circumstances,namely the reassignment of larry perkins and modica allegations of retaliation,the majority of modica concerns did not relate to this dispute nor her job,but to the operation of the tcc as a whole.kennedy,at.therefore,unlike terrell,where terrell speech regarding an investigation related only to his own job,kennedy speech here referred to producing a safety plan demanded by the parish at large to safeguard patrons and employees alike,and indeed,her own suggestion appeared within the plan itself.for example,modica expressed concerns regarding the elimination of the complaint tracking system,the delay in holding administrative hearings,and the failure of the agency to distribute the regulation books for which it received payment.indeed,modica letter only addressed perkins in the context of holifield elimination of the complaint tracking system,stating that the high reporting of complaints had made her previous boss,larry perkins and us look bad.this reference is more of an explanation as to why the elimination of the complaint tracking system is questionable than an effort to address her disagreement with the reassignment of larry perkins.
nor did modica letter focus on her failure to receive promotions or raises.once again teague offers a useful comparison.unlike the letter at issue in teague,modica letter urged that action be taken against holifield because the public and tcc deserve to have better representation,not that she receive a particular redress,whereas t he grievance submitted by teague and burkett to ragland express ed the need to be given a fair hearing concerning our handling of the jones investigation,teague,at third alteration in original.further,in teague,we noted the plaintiffs attempt to take their grievance to the town manager however,we concluded that t his was not an attempt to make the matter public,but rather simply an effort to go over their supervisor head by appealing to someone with supervisory authority over him.at.in contrast,modica letter constitutes an effort to bring public attention to problems in the tcc administration of its public duties.although,some statements are attributable to her personal grievances this represented only a small aspect of the letter and the underlying circumstances.further,her complaints regarding holifield,commencing in july,were related to allegations of misuse of state funds,not personal grievances indeed,it is not until after she made these complaints to the tcc that she alleges she was retaliated against by way of not receiving promotions.accordingly,we conclude that the context of the letter is more public than private in nature.
despite the presence of some private interests,the content,form,and context of modica letter demonstrate that her speech was predominately public.in moore city of kilgore,texas,cir,we observed that the plaintiff speech involve d a hint of personal employee considerations but nevertheless concluded that his speech as a whole,considering the content,context,and form together,involve d a matter of public concern.id.at footnote omitted.likewise,taken as a whole,modica speech is entitled to first amendment protection.
the district court concluded that modica interest in commenting on these matters outweighed humphrey interest in promoting efficiency and humphrey does not challenge this conclusion on appeal.the court further determined that modica raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether her speech was a substantial or motivating factor in her termination.as explained above,because this is an appeal of a denial of summary judgment predicated on qualified immunity,we do not review the district court conclusion that a genuine issue of material fact exists.consequently,we conclude that,if true,modica allegations are sufficient to establish a violation of her first amendment rights.
humphrey does not dispute that the first amendment bar against retaliation for protected speech was clearly established federal law.see,kinney,at.nor does she argue that her conduct was objectively reasonable.accordingly,we conclude that modica has alleged a violation of a clearly established right and we affirm the district court denial of summary judgment on modica first amendment retaliation claim based on humphrey assertion of qualified immunity.
fmla retaliation claim 
humphrey argues that the district court erred in denying her motion for summary judgment with regard to modica fmla claim on several grounds.first,she contends that a public official is not an employer for purposes of the fmla.next,she argues that she is entitled to qualified immunity because the fmla was not clearly established law at the time and because her decision to terminate modica employment was not objectively unreasonable.
whether humphrey is an employer for purposes of the fmla 
relying on kazmier widmann,cir,abrogated by nevada department of human resources hibbs,d,humphrey contends that this circuit does not permit suits against public officials under the fmla.specifically,humphrey relies on footnote of the kazmier decision stating that t he claims brought against the defendants in their individual capacities must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it is clear that the state of louisiana is the real party in interest.kazmier,at.humphrey reliance on kazmier is misplaced.
as a general rule the eleventh amendment does not bar suits against officers in their individual capacities.hudson city of new orleans,cir martin thomas,cir.nevertheless,where the state is the real and substantial party in interest,the eleventh amendment may bar the suit.see ysleta del sur pueblo laney,cir pendergrass greater new orleans expressway comm n,cir.
humphrey contends that in kazmier we stated our unwillingness to hold public officials liable under the fmla.this proves too much.the application of the eleventh a mendment to suits against state officials in their individual capacity depends on the circumstances.luder endicott,cir.consequently,the kazmier panel conclusion that the state was the real party in interest must be limited to the facts of that case.luder,at explaining that the state would be required to pay damages to the plaintiffs and concluding that casting the suit,brought under the fair labor standards act,as one against the officers in their individual capacities was a transparent effort at an end run around the eleventh amendment.moreover,we have previously recognized the general rule that the eleventh amendment does not bar suits against state officials in their individual capacities.hudson,at martin,at.when panel opinions appear to conflict,we are bound to follow the earlier opinion.tire,pitney bowes,cir.accordingly,even if kazmier could bear the weight humphrey intends for it to carry,we would not be bound.humphrey reliance on kazmier is misguided and the eleventh amendment does not bar the instant suit.nevertheless,it does not necessarily follow that public employees may be sued in their individual capacities under the fmla thus,we turn to humphrey contention that she is not an employer for purposes of the fmla.
humphrey argues that employees of public agencies may not be held personally liable under the fmla as employers.we have not had occasion to consider this question however,several our sister circuits,as well as various district courts,have done so.the sixth and eleventh circuits have held that a public official is not an employer for purposes of the fmla when sued in her individual capacity,but the eighth circuit reached the opposite conclusion.compare mitchell chapman,cir,and wascura carver,cir,with darby bratch,cir.the district courts are similarly divided on this question however,it appears that a majority have concluded that public employees may be liable in their individual capacities under the fmla.see cantley simmons,d,while some district courts have decided otherwise,the majority of district courts have concluded that public employee supervisors can be sued individually under the fmla.compare sheaffer county of chatham,d,holding that public employees can be liable under the fmla,and morrow putnam,d,same,with keene rinaldi,d,holding that public officials are not liable in their individual capacities under the fmla.
we begin our analysis with the text of the statute.doe kpmg,llp,cir.the fmla provides,in relevant part 
the term employer 
i means any person engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce who employs or more employees for each working day during each of or more calendar workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year 
ii includes 
i any person who acts,directly or indirectly,in the interest of an employer to any of the employees of such employer and 
ii any successor in interest of an employer 
iii includes any public agency,as defined in section x of this title and 
iv includes the government accountability office and the library of congress.
a.the statute plainly includes in the definition of employer any person who acts,directly or indirectly,in the interest of an employer to any of the employees of such employer.a ii i.the statute further includes public agencies as employers.id.a iii.therefore,if a public employee acts,directly or indirectly,in the interest of an employer,he satisfies the definition of employer under the fmla,and therefore,may be subject to liability in his individual capacity.accord darby,at.
the sixth circuit rejected this interpretation in mitchell,holding that the fmla individual liability provision does not extend to public agencies.at.the court offered three reasons for its conclusion 
first,section a segregates the provision imposing individual liability from the public agency provision.second,an interpretation that commingles the individual liability provision with the public agency provision renders certain provisions of the statute superfluous and results in several oddities.finally,as evidenced by other provisions of the statute,the fmla distinguishes its definition of employer from that provided in the fair labor standard act flsa,by separating the individual liability and public agency provisions.
id.at.we address each argument in turn.
the sixth circuit concluded that the section defining employer,a,explicitly separates the individual liability provision and public agency provision into two distinct clauses.mitchell,at.the court reasoned 
notwithstanding this repeated and consistent use of the em dash,section a lacks any punctuation demonstrating an between clauses ii iv.indeed,the separation of otherwise related concepts,what the term employer includes into distinctly enumerated clauses compels an interpretation that treats each clause in an independent manner.this is particularly the case in light of clause ii inclusion of an em dash preceding the individual liability provision and successor in interest provision.
id.at.we respectfully disagree.congress use of the word and following clause iii suggests that there is some relationship between clauses i iv.accord hewett willingboro bd.of,d,in a
