respondent jackson hospital corporation,kentucky river medical center,the hospital,appeals from the judgment of the district court,entered on january,which granted to petitioner richard ahearn petitioner,regional director of the ninth region of the national labor relations board the board and on behalf of the board,a temporary injunction,pursuant to j of the national labor relations act nlra,j.the petition for injunction arose from the board administrative investigation into unfair labor practices allegedly committed by the hospital against its employees,in violation of a,and of the nlra,a.on appeal,the hospital principally argues that the district court used an incorrect legal standard in granting the injunction,and the district court decision amounted to clear error and an abuse of discretion.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court injunction order.
procedural history 
on january,the board filed a petition for injunction under j of the nlra,j.the petition alleged,in pertinent part,that there was reasonable cause to believe that the hospital had undertaken various actions that violated a,and of the nlra,a.on february,the board filed an amended petition to the same effect,which included additional claims for relief,specifically unlawful threats of discharge,loss of jobs,and license revocation for engaging in strike activity unlawful surveillance of employees participating in a union strike unlawful discharge and disciplining of employees in retaliation for their union activities implementation of break schedules for unit employees without providing notice and opportunity for collective bargaining on the issue and refusal to meet and collectively bargain with the employees union.the board requested injunctive relief,specifically that the district court order the hospital pending the nlrb ruling on the merits with respect to a simultaneous administrative proceeding before it to reinstate the discharged employees,to recognize and bargain with the union,and to cease and desist from committing the unfair labor practices.the hospital filed an answer,in which it denied that it had engaged in unfair labor practices and denied that the board was entitled to a temporary injunction.
on january,the district court entered a page memorandum opinion and order granting the petition in part.in relevant part,it ordered the reinstatement of three discharged hospital employees,and it ordered the hospital to cease and desist from unlawfully threatening employees with discharge,conducting surveillance of its employees while they are lawfully striking,and altering employees break schedules without providing notice and opportunity to engage in collective bargaining.judgment to this effect was entered on january.
on february,the hospital moved for a partial stay pending appeal to this court,which the district court denied on march.the hospital filed a notice of appeal on march.the board filed a with respect to the portions of the district court order that denied injunctive relief,but later withdrew the by stipulation of dismissal on june.
a.the union formation and the hospital refusal to negotiate 
the hospital operates a bed acute care hospital in jackson,kentucky.on june,the union steelworkers of america,the union was certified as the exclusive bargaining representative for the hospital nurses and employees.the union met with the hospital several times to negotiate a first contract,but was unsuccessful.a decertification election was held on december,but the union filed unfair labor practice charges,and the board impounded the ballots pending an investigation.following the resolution of these charges,the ballots were counted and the union won the election.the union demanded bargaining in april of,but the hospital refused to meet with the union,claiming that the union had to provide a complete economic proposal before it would bargain.
b.the hospital threats,union strike,and the hospital hostility toward the strikers 
by the spring of,the employees began to murmur about a possible strike to pressure the hospital into bargaining with the union.evidence was presented that in april,the hospital supervisors told the employees that strikers might lose their jobs.supervisor ken hicks told an employee in april that,in the event of a strike,employees who were replaced would not have a job when the strike ended.house supervisor phyllis gibbs told a group of employees in june that any employees who did not have a contract and went on strike would be fired.also in june,nursing supervisor allena hale told three employees that she had been told that employees would be fired if they went on strike without a contract.edward burnette,the emergency room director,told at least four employees that if they went on strike they were setting themselves up to be fired.at.on several other occasions,burnette told employees that if they insisted on participating in union activity and going on strike they would lose their jobs.
in,the union served the hospital with a day strike notice.soon thereafter,supervisor diana blankenship told a group of five employees that if this is not ruled an unfair labor practice strike,some of you all will not be coming back,and made a similar comment to another employee on another occasion.on july,employee anita turner approached her supervisors,asking to alter her schedule so she could participate in the strike.chief nursing officer michelle became very angry and loud and told turner that if she left the facility obenchain would see to it that turner lost her license,based on patient abandonment.obenchain had initiated such procedures in the past.
nevertheless,the union went on strike on july.during the strike,the hospital had picketers videotaped as they engaged in their strike activities.the hospital also posted signs from a hospital window visible from where the employees picketed.on august,the union made an unconditional offer to return to work,which the hospital accepted.the strikers returned to work on august.
c.the hospital adverse actions 
terminations of laotta sizemore,clara gabbard,and sandra barker hutton.
this appeal principally revolves around the terminations of three employees laotta sizemore,clara gabbard,and sandra barker hutton.
laotta sizemore was a registered nurse rn hired by the hospital in as a weekend house supervisor.sometime after the union was originally certified in,sizemore position was eliminated and she became a nonsupervisory night shift rn.thereafter she became active in the union,wearing union buttons to work and speaking out in favor of the union.during the strike,sizemore accepted a position as an emergency room nurse manager at another hospital,but she wished to continue working at the hospital on a,or prn,basis.on august,the day the strike ended,sizemore notified the hospital of this desired change by letter,stating,effective today,i would like to change my status from to prn.the hospital sent sizemore a letter,dated august,instructing her to report to work at on august.at.sizemore indeed reported on august,only to discover that although her name appeared on the schedule,her shifts were crossed out.sizemore queried hale as to why her shifts were crossed out,and hale replied that she did not know.sizemore left messages for obenchain and her supervisor,neither of whom returned her calls.
on september,sizemore agreed to cover someone else shift and completed the necessary paperwork.when she called supervisor jeri howard to ensure that she was on the schedule,howard replied that sizemore was not on the schedule any more.at.as it turned out,after sizemore submitted her request,obenchain recommended to the hospital ceo david bevins that sizemore not be retained as a prn because she had failed to work a day notice period before resigning,pursuant to the hospital resignation policy.thus,sizemore was discharged.her discharge papers indicate an effective date of august,and state that sizemore resigned,failed to work her notice period,and was.obenchain nevertheless failed to contact sizemore with any of this information,nor did she even return the calls sizemore had placed to her upon discovering her schedules on august.obenchain also acknowledged that no hospital policy states that an employee has to resign or work a notice period before converting from to prn status,which is what sizemore august,written notice had clearly endeavored to do.
clara gabbard had been a ward clerk with the hospital since.in april of,gabbard gave her supervisor,robin mcglothen,written notice that she was unavailable to work the weekends of august and september,due to her annual participation as chairperson of the breathitt county honey festival.subsequently,gabbard became involved in union activity,informing obenchain that in the event of a strike she would not cross the picket line and supposedly received a mean and hateful look in response.at.indeed,gabbard actively participated in the strike,including making tapes that were placed on a local radio station and published in the newspaper.
after the strike,gabbard again reminded the hospital on august and,that she needed the following two weekends off to serve at the honey festival.the hospital nevertheless put her on the schedule,and gabbard learned of this from another employee on august.gabbard again gave notice,this time to supervisor hale.gabbard indeed did not work the weekend of august,and the hospital found another employee to cover the shift.however,on august,the hospital notified gabbard by letter of her termination.obenchain testified that she recommended gabbard discharge for failing to follow the hospital trade and cover policy.at.the policy requires employees to obtain their own coverage if they do not notify supervisor obenchain of such intended absences by of the of the month.because obenchain received gabbard request for time off on august,the hospital apparently reasoned,gabbard was responsible for finding her own coverage.the hospital had mailed a copy of the policy with correspondence,via certified mail,directing gabbard to follow the trade and cover policy.however,gabbard evidently did not receive the certified mail.however,the trade and cover policy does not mention discipline or discharge for failure to follow the policy.at.
the hospital has a separate incidents of absence policy,which provides that for each unexcused absence where an employee provides at least two hours notice,the employee receives an incident of absence.at.two incidents of absence within a day period results in a verbal warning.it is undisputed that gabbard provided well over two hours notice of her intended absence.indeed,gabbard provided several months notice considering her first notification to her supervisor in april of,although admittedly not to obenchain directly.it also appears undisputed that gabbard did not have any incidents of absence on her record at the time of her august,absence.nevertheless,obenchain did not consider an alternative penalty to discharge in gabbard case.moreover,prior to the strike,another employee,jeri howard,had agreed to cover another employee under the trade and cover policy,but failed to show up,and received only a verbal warning.at.no explanation was provided by the hospital for this apparent differential treatment.
sandra barker hutton was a billing and admitting clerk for the hospital between march and march,and a prn thereafter.hutton also worked during the day for the commonwealth attorney office.hutton also was active with the union,wearing buttons from through july of,and she picketed during the strike.following the strike,the hospital informed hutton by letter of her return to work as a prn.
in march of,the hospital owner,community health systems chs reached a million settlement agreement with the united states government regarding its various violations of the false claims act fca,et.as part of this agreement,chs hospitals were required to conduct claim fraud prevention training in the form of a video by september.based on the september,deadline,the hospital set an internal deadline of september,for the completion of training.the hospital cfo randy cooper posted a schedule of viewings to take place on august to.
hutton received a phone call from representatives from the hospital business office,who scheduled hutton to watch the compliance video on august,at hutton was never informed by anyone of the september deadline or that anyone missing the deadline would be terminated.hutton took time off from her job to attend the scheduled august,viewing,but was told that the training had been canceled due to a computer.she was also told by her supervisor denise trusty that she would be called to reschedule the training and that she had to complete the training before returning to work.again,hutton was not informed of any deadline to complete the training.
a week later,after her supervisor still had not called her,hutton called trusty to ask about the training.trusty told her that she did not have a date yet but told hutton to call back the following monday.hutton called on the following monday,september,and left a message but received no return phone call.the following day,she received a letter from cfo randy cooper informing her that she was being purged from the hospital prn listing because she had made no effort to attend any video session and because the deadline for viewing had been august,not september,as cooper later testified.at.
other adverse actions 
prior to the strike,the hospital housekeeping and maintenance employees had been allowed to select their own break and lunch times.however,immediately following the strike,the hospital implemented a schedule for breaks and lunches,which assigned a particular break and lunch time for each employee.the record also contains an assortment of evidence pertaining to various other firings of employees who had participated in the strike,namely lois noble,beverly clemons,sandra baker,and diane taulbee.additionally,the hospital issued a verbal warning to phlebotomist sally dunn,who was a strong union supporter prior to the strike.on her second day back to work following the strike,dunn testified that she was approached by her supervisor,diana blankenship,and accused of taking a minute break,when in fact she had taken a minute break.dunn told blankenship that she could verify it on the computer,but blankenship allegedly replied,it does matter,they said you did,so consider this a verbal warning.blankenship then asked dunn if she had taken a phlebotomy tray outside while smoking,and dunn admitted that she had.blankenship repeated that dunn could consider this a verbal warning.
the chilling effect on employees 
evidence in the form of several affidavits was presented indicating that these actions by the hospital had created a chilling effect on the employees union support.registered nurse patricia hollifield averred in an affidavit that she knew of several strikers,including gabbard,who were fired after the strike and that she was very careful thereafter to avoid openly supporting the union she also indicated that other employees wanted to lay low about union support for fear of retaliatory discharge.registered nurse anita turner,who had been threatened by obenchain with license revocation,averred that she felt like a nervous wreck based on her knowledge of several firings and obenchain threats,and she consequently accepted a job at another hospital.registered nurse shirley white had also experienced a chilling effect after learning of several firings including gabbard,causing her to believe that the h ospital wants to fire all the strikers.she averred that she had spoken to other employees who felt the same way.although she had worn a button and attended union meetings prior to the strike,she never wore a union button again after the strike,for fear of retaliation.she also indicated that she never saw other employees wearing union buttons after the strike.additionally,janie jenkins testified that,although she had worn a union button regularly for six months preceding the strike,she only wore a union button for a week following the strike and stopped thereafter,as did virtually all of her colleagues.she added that because of the discharges,the threats,the resignations,and the hospitals refusal to bargain,she felt really discouraged and felt like the union could really help us.at.she also averred that she was afraid of being fired for any small error,and that she had talked with several other employees who felt the same way.
d.the district court decision 
in a january,order,the district court found that the board had established reasonable cause to believe that the hospital had committed a violations with respect to the firing of six employees including the three firings at issue in this appeal,as well as the hospital repeated threats of job loss or license revocation,intimidating signs during the strike,unlawful video surveillance of the strikers,and alteration of employees break schedules after the strike.
regarding sizemore discharge,the district court found that sizemore august,letter requesting a change in status was not a resignation,that no policy required a nurse to resign before changing status,and that no one notified sizemore of any possible adverse consequences related to her request.regarding gabbard discharge,the court found that evidence existed in the record indicating that the hospital asserted reason for the termination was pretextual inasmuch as a employee had received less harsh treatment and the hospital policies did not contemplate discharge for unexcused absences.regarding hutton discharge,the court found reasonable cause for a a violation inasmuch as hutton discharge closely followed her strike participation and because she was not notified of any adverse consequences for failure to complete training by a certain date.
the district court also found that granting a temporary injunction for interim reinstatement of the terminated employees was just and proper because the threats of getting fired,closely followed by actual firings,was inherently chilling to union support,and because the four affidavits suggested that the hospital adverse actions were actually having a chilling effect on union support.at.the district court therefore ordered the hospital to reinstate sizemore,gabbard,and hutton,as well as the other employees.the court also ordered the hospital to cease and desist from unlawfully threatening its employees with termination,engaging in surveillance of striking employees,and altering the employees break schedule without notice and opportunity for union bargaining.
e.the administrative law judge administrative decision 
on february,the administrative law judge alj presiding over the administrative proceedings with respect to the hospital actions,also found that the hospital had unlawfully terminated sizemore,gabbard,and hutton.the alj rejected the hospital argument that sizemore failed to follow the resignation and reinstatement policy,finding instead that sizemore did not resign but only requested a change of status.the alj was particularly persuaded by the fact that obenchain initially granted sizemore request and placed her on the schedule but later crossed her off.the alj also found that gabbard actions were not subject to termination under the hospital policies inasmuch as she gave more than two hours notice of her intended personal absence and that similarly situated employees had received better treatment.finally,the alj found that hutton termination was discriminatory,based on four factors the hospital inconsistent testimony about the deadline for watching the compliance video,the hospital failure to inform hutton that she would be terminated if she did not watch the video,the hospital false accusation that hutton made no attempt to watch the video,when in fact she had shown up as scheduled and made several phone calls to no avail,the hospital false accusation that hutton was difficult to reach,and significant evidence of disparate treatment.indeed,the alj refused to credit any of the hospital representatives testimony on the matter inasmuch as it was replete with falsehoods and with obvious and unexplained inconsistencies.at.the alj also found that the hospital threats,video surveillance,and intimidating signs activity constituted a violations,and that the unilateral break schedule changes violated a of the nlra.
unlike the district court,however,the alj did not find the discipline of sally dunn,who had been smoking a cigarette while handling blood samples,violated a.in light of this ruling,petitioner no longer argues in favor of the district court ruling on this point.
the issue of whether a district court applied the correct legal standard is a legal question,which this court reviews de novo.united states willis,cir citing in re sorah,cir internal citation omitted.
the hospital devotes a large segment of its brief to challenging the district court use of the reasonable and proper standard,which this court has employed with respect to j injunctions.specifically,the reasonable and proper standard requires that a district court find that there is reasonable cause to believe that unfair labor practices have occurred,and that injunctive relief with respect to such practices would be just and proper.schaub west.plumbing heating,cir.the hospital argues that the more traditional framework for reviewing petitions for injunctions is correct in this context and urges this court to reverse on this basis.the traditional framework is the test employed by this court in the context of other petitions for injunctions,and requires a district court to consider whether the moving party has a substantial or strong likelihood of success on the merits whether the moving party would otherwise suffer irreparable injury whether the issuance of a preliminary injunction would cause substantial harm to others and whether a preliminary injunction would serve the public interest.see leary daeschner,cir.we disagree with the hospital.
a.the reasonable and proper inquiry is supported by longstanding sixth circuit precedent that a panel can not overrule 
we note initially that this circuit has consistently used the reasonable and proper standard.a contrary holding of this panel would contravene the rule that one panel can not overrule another panel thus the reasonable and proper standard may only be overruled by this court sitting en banc or the supreme court.see united states moody,cir citing salmi secretary of health human,cir.
although the hospital claims that the supreme court has ruled to the contrary on this issue,it only cites weinberger,d for this proposition.the hospital fails to explain the many sixth circuit cases that have been decided using the just and proper standard in the twenty years since weinberger.see,fleischut nixon detroit diesel,cir gottfried sheet metal workers int l ass n,local union,cir kobell united paperworkers int,cir schaub,at.if the current j standard were in clear contravention of supreme court precedent,it seems unlikely that this or any other circuit would have continued to adhere to it for two decades without concern.
the hospital also asserts that our decision in eeoc anchor hocking,cir compels us to use the traditional standard.anchor hocking held that title vii provision authorizing the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc to request temporary injunctive relief does not permit a district court to issue a preliminary injunction without the traditional showing of irreparable injury.id.at.anchor hocking thus rejected the eeoc suggested standard that,upon the filing of a discrimination prima facie showing of a title vii a district court determination that prompt judicial action is necessary,a preliminary injunction must issue.id.at.however,anchor hocking dealt with a different statute,specifically,f of title vii of the civil rights act of as amended,f,and the court undertook a careful statutory analysis before rejecting the eeoc argument that a showing of irreparable injury is not necessary.and,contrary to the hospital contentions,title vii does not have the same language as the nlra in particular title vii does not contain the just and proper language the hospital may realize that these cases are not on point,given that it asks the court to revisit the current j standard and abandon it in favor of a traditional balancing test.hospital br.at emphasis added.
b.the reasonable and proper standard properly takes into account a hospi
