this appeal leads us into the often surreal world of medicare administration.it arises out of efforts by south shore hospital the hospital,an acute care hospital located in south weymouth,massachusetts,to obtain relief for its transitional care center the tcc from medicare cost limits on reimbursement of routine patient care expenses.the health care financing administration hcfa denied the hospital application on the ground that its purchase of determination of need don rights from an unaffiliated nursing home rendered unavailable the new provider exemption codified at e the provider reimbursement review board the board of the united states department of health and human services hhs affirmed this determination.see shore,wl prrb,shore i.the federal district court,however,took a different view,reversing the board decision.shore hosp.thompson,d,shore ii.this timely appeal ensued.
we conclude that the new provider exemption is less than pellucid that the secretary interpretation of the relevant regulatory language is reasonable although not inevitable that the hospital has failed to show that the secretary vacillated in his interpretation and that substantial evidence supports the board finding that the nursing home from which the hospital acquired the necessary don rights operated as an equivalent of the tcc.consequently,we sustain the secretary refusal to classify the tcc as a new provider,reverse the decision of the district court,and direct the entry of judgment in favor of the secretary.
statutory and regulatory framework 
the medicare act,provides federal funding for a range of medical services for the elderly and disabled,including reimbursement for the reasonable cost of certain services provided by skilled nursing facilities snfs.id.b a ii,b,g.the act expressly vests in the secretary of hhs the discretion to determine reasonable costs by regulations that,inter alia,may provide for the establishment of limits on the costs to be recognized as reasonable based on estimates of the costs necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services.v a.in this regard,the act mandates routine cost limits rcls that restrict per diem reimbursement to of the national average for similarly situated providers id.a.exemptions and exceptions that permit higher rates of reimbursement are allowed to the extent the secretary deems appropriate,based upon case mix or circumstances beyond the control of the facility.id.c.
at issue here is an exemption for new providers of skilled nursing services.e.the secretary promulgated this exemptive regulation in to ameliorate the initial underutilization faced by many market entrants.it authorizes an exemption when t he provider of inpatient services has operated as the type of provider or the equivalent for which it is certified for medicare,under present and previous ownership,for less than three full years.e.this,then,permits the secretary,under some circumstances,to deny the exemption by tying together present and previous ownership.
although this phraseology makes previous ownership an important datum,the regulation does not dictate how previous ownership determinations should be made.the secretary has interpreted this phrase,more majorum,by reference to part i of hcfa provider reimbursement manual the manual.pertinently,the manual has long defined change of ownership as including the sale of all or some portion of a provider facility or assets used to render patient care,so long as such sale affects licensure or certification of the provider entity.the manual eventually integrated change of ownership,so defined,into determinations of previous ownership and,ultimately,into the definition of new provider.see id.b.it warns,however,that t he mere existence of a change of ownership does not in itself make an institution or institutional complex eligible for a new provider exemption.id.rather,the secretary conducts a comparison of the operations conducted by the previous and current owners in order to decide whether the current owner qualifies.equivalency plays an important role in this comparison,for,generally speaking,previous ownership will not be carried forward unless,at a bare minimum,the previous owner operations and the current owner operations are deemed equivalent.
ii.procedural background 
the hospital began to plan for the tcc in,with an eye toward supplementing its existing continuum of care.but there was a rub massachusetts,like many states,titrates the provision of health care by requiring various types of facilities to secure determinations of need as a prerequisite to offering covered services see.laws ch.tit.because massachusetts had placed a moratorium on the issuance of don rights for skilled nursing beds,the hospital plans were stymied until it arranged to purchase the necessary don rights from prospect hill manor nursing home prospect hill,a facility that had gone into receivership in march.no other transfers of property,patient records,or assets accompanied the purchase,and the entity known as prospect hill vanished shortly after transferring the don rights.
the commonwealth of massachusetts approved the transfer of don rights on condition that the hospital assume liability for any and all medicaid overpayments to prospect hill.subsequently,it approved a phantom relocation of prospect hill to the hospital campus.armed with these approvals,the tcc opened its doors in january of.
on may,the hospital petitioned hcfa to classify its nascent tcc as a new provider.the hospital continuing interest in the exemption is easily grasped in first full year of tcc routine service costs exceeded the applicable rcls by almost.and when congress replaced medicare existing reimbursement system with a prospective payment system that looked to a facility reimbursement levels as a basis for setting future rates,see balanced budget act of,a,stat,codified as amended at e a ii,the lure of the new provider exemption became irresistible.
in due course,hcfa rejected the hospital application on the ground that the conveyance of don rights required that prospect hill previous operations be imputed to the tcc.following an evidentiary hearing,the board affirmed this determination.shore i,supra,at.in so holding,the board found that,in the circumstances of this case,the transferred don rights were a sufficient basis for imputation of previous ownership to the purchaser and that prospect hill and the tcc were equivalent providers.id.at.in regard to equivalency the board acknowledged that prospect hill had not furnished the same level of nursing care that characterized the operations of the tcc,but nonetheless concluded that prospect hill had been operating as an snf during the three years prior to the conveyance.id.at.the secretary declined to intervene,thus making the board decision administratively final.f.
the hospital petitioned for judicial review.see id.the district court reversed,declaring that the tcc was a new provider in every relevant sense and that the board could not reasonably have ruled otherwise.shore ii,d at.accordingly,the court remanded the matter to the board for a determination of what level of reimbursement the tcc,as a new provider,should receive.id.at.this appeal followed.
iii.standard of review 
an inquiring court can set aside an agency adjudicatory decisions only if those decisions are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a,or unsupported by substantial evidence in the administrative record,id.e.this standard tightly circumscribes judicial review.see citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d henry ins,cir.
here,there is a further gloss on this familiar formulation.where congress has entrusted rulemaking and administrative authority to an agency,courts normally accord the agency particular deference in respect to the interpretation of regulations promulgated under that authority.bowles seminole rock sand.johnson watts regulator,cir.courts withhold such deference only when the agency interpretation of its regulation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with its language.thomas jefferson shalala,d.this deference is at its apex when,as in this instance,a regulation concerns a complex and highly technical regulatory program in which the identification and classification of relevant criteria necessarily require significant expertise and entail the exercise of judgment grounded in policy concerns.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
both the district court and the court of appeals are bound by these principles.therefore,we review the district court resolution of such a case de novo,applying essentially the same standards as pertained in that court.fisheries of,daley,cir.dpw sec y of,cir.that the parties brought the issues forward on for summary judgment is not significant substance must prevail over form,and the fact remains that the parties have presented this matter as a case stated,on a fully developed administrative record.our review proceeds accordingly.
iv.analysis 
we turn now to the secretary construction and application of the new provider exemption,e.our analysis proceeds in three steps.first,we discuss the reasonableness of the secretary interpretation of the exemption.second,we address the hospital related claim that the secretary has applied the regulation.finally,we scrutinize the board finding that prospect hill and the tcc were equivalent providers.
interpretation of the exemption.
despite the fact that medicare rules fall squarely within the secretary domain,deference is due to the secretary interpretation of a particular regulation only when the language of the regulation either compels that interpretation or admits of differing interpretations,and the secretary chooses reasonably among them.christensen harris county,d chevron natural res.def.council,d.here,the hospital main argument is that the new provider exemption is unambiguous and demands an interpretation at odds with the secretary rendition.
we find the new provider provision vague and,therefore,manifestly ambiguous.this case hinges on the meaning of the phrase previous ownership,and section e neither defines nor explains that phrase.to complicate matters,the terms provider and institution are central to an understanding of the exemption,and those terms subsume any number of components,changes in one or all of which might,depending on the context,lead one to deduce that a new provider has or has not been created.because the regulation is not drawn in blacks and whites but leaves significant gray areas unresolved,it is ambiguous.see paragon health network,thompson,cir discussing the same regulation and reaching the same conclusion 
to state the obvious,the fact that the regulation is ambiguous means that some interpretation is inevitable.the question reduces,therefore,to whether using the transfer of don rights as a basis for ascribing prospect hill operations to the hospital comes within a reasonable interpretation of the regulation.we think that this question must be answered in the affirmative.
in this case,the secretary relied on section of the manual for guidance.noting that prospect hill don rights were virtually the only assets it owned at the time of the transfer,he determined that the sale of the rights qualified as a purchase of assets affecting licensure or certification and,therefore,constituted a change of ownership.shore i,supra,at.in this connection,the secretary explained that there need not be a high degree of operational continuity between providers in order for the operation of one to be imputed to the other.following this train of thought and citing section of the manual,the secretary determined that the relocation of beds from prospect hill to the tcc did not substantially change the population served or the number of inpatient days accumulated.id.at.concomitantly,the secretary looked back at prospect hill operational history and determined that it had functioned as the equivalent of an snf during the previous three years because it had furnished some skilled nursing rehabilitation services,as identified in b and c.shore i,supra,at.accordingly,he denied the hospital application for a new provider exemption.
the hospital,ably represented,attempts to discredit the secretary reasoning in several different ways.first,it emphasizes the genesis of the change of ownership definition contained in which originally addressed the obligations of facilities leaving the medicare program and argues that the secretary arbitrarily applied this definition to the new provider exemption.but the secretary,through hcfa,historically has defined change of ownership differently in different contexts and we see no reason why the secretary,in the exercise of his broad authority to interpret regulations that he himself has promulgated,can not choose to apply section dilucidation in this context,regardless of the provision origins.
the hospital also argues that a transfer of don rights alone can not constitute a continuation of ownership for purposes of this case because prospect hill closed its doors for unrelated reasons and,thus,the transfer did not contribute to the loss of its licensure and certification.the district court found merit in this argument,see shore ii,d at,but we do not.fairly read,section requires only that the transfer affect licensure or certification,not that it be the dispositive factor.here,the don rights were a sine qua non for the operation of a nursing home whether prospect hill or the tcc and the handsome price that the hospital paid for them which appears to have been in the range of attests to their materiality.we can not say that the secretary acted unreasonably in rejecting the conceit that the significance of don rights should be measured solely by the happenstance of when the original owner of the rights went out of business.
in a related vein,we question the emphasis placed by the lower court on the fact that prospect hill don rights were out of circulation at the time of the purchase.see id.at.the court implication is that medicare ought to spend more reimbursement dollars for routine service costs because the hospital has rescued these dormant beds from the scrap heap.id.even if we credit the district court characterization of the hospital as a rescuer,however,that would not impugn the secretary discretionary decision to treat all purchasers of don rights alike.see arkansas oklahoma,d affirming that,within wide limits,agencies may decide for themselves what factors pertain to their decisionmaking.the secretary vision of the transfer as simply relocating the beds in question is not impermissible.
this reasoning also defeats the hospital fragmentation argument,in which it points out that a previous owner may sell its don rights to one party,its site to a second party,and a third pivotal asset say,its equipment to yet another party.according to the hospital,this threatens to create a situation where one previous owner can spawn a multitude of successors,none of whom will be regarded as a new provider.
unlike the hospital,we find this result to be acceptable.after all,we would not hesitate to use the term previous ownership in reference to three hospitals resulting from the split of a single facility,thompson,d,finding that previous ownership precluded a new provider exemption when a nascent facility bought con rights from three different institutions.consequently,the fragmentation argument fails.
the hospital next asserts that its actions were guided by the plain meaning of the regulation and that a ny contrary interpretation of the regulation would require a gross distortion of the english language.appellee br.at.this approach is doubly flawed.in the first place,it overlooks the patent ambiguity of the regulation.in the second place,accepting it would make a mockery of the deference due to the secretary interpretation of his own regulations.as the hospital itself acknowledges,change of ownership is a term of art in the medicare context.as such,interpretation of the term lies peculiarly within the compass of the secretary expertise.see thomas jefferson,at.pauley bethenergy mines,d.
in a variation on this theme,the hospital maintains that the secretary interpretation of the new provider exemption oppugns the underlying policy of the exemption when applied to states,such as massachusetts,that have imposed moratoria on new nursing home beds.as the seventh circuit explained,however,moratoria on don rights effectively limit the number of permitted beds and thus reduce competition among such facilities.paragon,at.this means that any given facility in a moratorium state will be less likely to experience and sustain a high vacancy rate during its early years.consequently,new or expanded facilities in moratorium states have less need for special swaddling to prevent the financial drain of initial underutilization.see id.
the district court attempted to distinguish paragon as a change of ownership between related corporations.shore ii,d at.but the court never explained how this circumstance compromised the underlying policy of the new provider exemption.insofar as we can discern,relationship through a common corporate parent will have little effect on whether the transfer of don rights does or does not ameliorate a facility initial underutilization.once that is understood,there is no principled reason why the facility discussed in paragon should have any diminished claim to improved reimbursement by virtue of being a related subsidiary 
in a further endeavor to blunt the force of paragon,the hospital notes that the language of the regulation at issue does not distinguish between facilities in states with and without moratoria.for this reason,it muses,the secretary interpretation inevitably will lead to.relatedly,it suggests that the secretary ought to bear the burden of adducing sufficient evidence or analysis to show that the putative oligopoly effect in moratorium states will help relieve initial costs.
in asserting these propositions,the hospital leans heavily on the decision in ashtabula county med.ctr.thompson,d.we think that case that is currently on appeal to the sixth the wrong decisional framework.the court opinion appears to place the burden on the secretary to show that his interpretation of a regulation is reasonable.see id.that is not the law.the burden is on the party challenging the secretary reasoning to show that it fails to pass muster under the reasonableness standard.see save our heritage,faa,cir mary of nazareth hosp.ctr.schweiker.hence,it is the hospital that must show that the secretary unreasonably relied on the oligopoly effect theory.the hospital has not done so and,indeed,there is evidence in the record suggesting that the tcc did in fact enjoy a relatively high level of patient utilization from the start.
as to the charge of,it suffices to say that discretion,such as that specifically conferred upon the secretary to establish limits on routine care costs,almost invariably involves and,thus,inevitably entails some level of variation.see sprandel sec y of hhs,cir per curiam observing that it is impossible to block out administrative categories that do not chafe at the outer edges.we need find only that,from some plausible standpoint,the secretary had an organizing primum mobile sufficient to justify his actions.the secretary proffered oligopoly effect theory passes this test.
the hospital rejoinder is that the secretary interpretation of section effectively obviates new provider status for many or even all new snfs within massachusetts.even if true,this lament does not call the secretary judgment into serious question.the goal of regulation is not to provide exact uniformity of treatment,but,rather,to provide uniformity of rules so that those similarly situated will be treated alike.in addition,as the seventh circuit suggested,the secretary reasonably may have concluded that,in states that have imposed moratoria because they no longer need additional nursing beds,subsidizing the costs of new snfs is unnecessary for the efficient delivery of services.paragon,at.
to sum up,we find no plausible reason to discredit the secretary rationale that,when one facility purchases another don rights in a moratorium state,lessened competition will enhance initial utilization and,thus,will help defray costs in the transferee facility early years.on that rationale,it makes sense,for purposes of construing the new provider exemption,to attribute the operations of the seller to the acquirer of the don rights.after all,w hen congress entrusts an agency with the responsibility for drawing lines,and the agency exercises that authority in a reasonable way,neither the fact that there are other possible places at which the line could be drawn nor the fact that the administrative scheme might occasionally operate unfairly from a particular participant perspective is sufficient,standing alone,to undermine the scheme legality.dpw,at.we therefore follow paragon and uphold the secretary interpretation of the disputed regulation as against the hospital reasonableness challenge.
consistency.
the hospital has a fallback position even if the secretary interpretation of the new provider exemption is not arbitrary and capricious,its thesis runs,his interpretation flouts prior practice.the theoretical foundation on which this position rests is sound if,over time,an agency interprets a regulation erratically,that inconsistency may warrant a court in declining to defer to the agency in a particular situation.see good samaritan hosp.shalala,d ins,d.in this case,however,the hospital thesis fails.
once proffered,agency interpretations are not chiseled in stone.see good samaritan,at.an administrative agency is not disqualified from changing its mind.citation omitted.as we have pointed out,e xperience is often the best teacher,and agencies retain a substantial measure of freedom to refine,reformulate,and even reverse their precedents in the light of new insights and changed circumstances.ins,cir.
this does not mean that an agency may change positions with the same ease that an actor changes costumes.for example,an agency may not,without rhyme or reason,create conflicting lines of precedent governing materially identical situations.shaw supermarkets,nlrb,cir.but an agency may learn from its mistakes and decide to discard one interpretation in favor of another,as long as it thereafter consistently applies the new interpretation.see,rust sullivan,d motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.
the hospital complains that the secretary has only sporadically denied new provider exemptions to facilities that have acquired don rights from other providers.to support this plaint,the hospital cites a single incident,involving a facility known as creek,in which hcfa granted a new provider exemption despite the facility use of transferred con rights.this citation is unpersuasive.the incident occurred well before the tcc applied for its exemption,and it is impossible to tell from the scanty record why hcfa granted creek an exemption.
it is incumbent on a party complaining of inconsistency in administrative action to bring before the reviewing court sufficient particulars of how the appellant was situated,how the allegedly favored party was situated,and how such similarities as may exist dictate similar treatment and how such dissimilarities as may exist are irrelevant or outweighed.city,thompson.while the hospital speculates that the unexplained grant of an exemption to creek betrays a pervasive inconsistency in hcfa decisions,it has not supported this conjecture with proof.nor has the hospital shown that its circumstances bear a substantial similarity to those of creek in all or nearly all relevant aspects.hence,we can not say that the creek scenario demonstrates administrative inconsistency 
that ends this aspect of the matter.because the hospital has failed to show that the secretary interpretation of the new provider exemption constitutes a reversal of position,its argument fails.although patently inconsistent applications of agency standards to similar situations are by definition arbitrary,the law does not demand perfect consistency in administrative decisionmaking.see.bell.fcc,cir.
along somewhat the same lines,the hospital urges what amounts to an ex post facto theory.it asseverates that hhs published its new guideline,in august of,more than two years after the hospital first submitted its application for new provider status.thus,the
