thomas barrett filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition on december,seeking the discharge of in unsecured nonpriority debt.among those claims are two student loans totaling.defendant educational credit management corporation ecmc appeals the judgment of the sixth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap,cir.bap,affirming the bankruptcy court order discharging barrett student loan debts on the basis of undue hardship pursuant to a.ecmc argues that barrett was required to provide corroborating evidence in the form of expert medical proof to establish that the circumstances underlying his inability to repay the loans will likely continue for a substantial portion of the repayment period.ecmc contends further that barrett failed to establish that he has made a good faith effort to repay his loans in light of his decision not to participate in the income contingent repayment plan.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
thomas barrett incurred student loan debt totaling while earning masters degrees in both health administration and business administration from saint louis university in.barrett has a long history of medical problems after receiving his graduate degrees,barrett was diagnosed with hodgkin disease in the summer of.oncologists at the cleveland clinic discovered compromised lymph nodes in barrett neck,abdomen,spleen,lungs,and liver,and barrett was diagnosed as being at the highest level of hodgkin,stage ivb.he underwent intravenous chemotherapy treatment for over nine months,from august to april.while barrett received chemotherapy,his student loans became due.barrett applied for,and received,an economic hardship deferment for his loans while barrett was recovering from chemotherapy,he was too weak to work and was unable to earn any income.due to accumulated medical bills,barrett filed for chapter bankruptcy on december.
in october,barrett began experiencing pain in his shoulders.he was diagnosed with avascular necrosis,a condition that causes the patient bones to die due to lack of blood supply.barrett testified that he experiences massive pain in his shoulders,hips,and knees.he was originally prescribed oxycontin pain medication,and later underwent surgery in april to repair the joint in his right shoulder.following the surgery,barrett continued to experience a great deal of pain in his shoulder.after arthroscopic surgery revealed that the shoulder cap prosthetic was loose,a second surgery on the right shoulder was performed in august.due to the second surgery,barrett was forced to wear a sling on his right shoulder at the trial before the bankruptcy court.
barrett testified that he now takes forty milligrams of oxycontin three times per day,ten milligrams of oxycodon four times per day,and two milligrams of hydromorphone four times per day,and that the pain in his right shoulder is so great that he ca even hold a coffee cup with his right hand.following a recovery period for each surgery,barrett expects to undergo surgery to repair his left shoulder and both hips.
due to the pain that he experiences,barrett work opportunities are limited.barrett testified that he currently performs computer networking jobs on a basis that require no more physical exertion than the movement of a computer mouse with his left hand.barrett testified that he has attempted to find a job with a company but has been unable to secure employment because he can not work at a level that would have to be sustained to work at a job.because of the pain that he experiences,barrett ability to work really depends on how he feel s that day,and that can be very bad or it can be somewhat bad.moreover,barrett testified that,in his experience,employers were not willing to hire someone in his condition,stating if i bring up what i what happened to me in the past,it seemed like they lose interest.barrett testified that because his medical condition has worsened since he filed the chapter petition,he has incurred an additional in medical bills and expenses.according to barrett schedule j,his projected monthly income is and his projected monthly expenses total 
on november,the bankruptcy court conducted an adversary proceeding.barrett was the sole witness.in addition to testimony from barrett,the bankruptcy court also admitted barrett tax returns for the years,and,barrett schedules i and j listing his current expenditures,a february,letter from brad pohlman,a of a search performed on the department of education interactive repayment calculator,and a copy of the hhc poverty guidelines as originally published in the federal register on february.on december,the bankruptcy court issued a memorandum opinion stating that it found barrett testimony to be credible and concluding that barrett had demonstrated that it would be an undue hardship if his student loans were excepted from his chapter discharge.on appeal,the bap unanimously affirmed the bankruptcy court determination.ecmc now timely appeals.
we focus our review of cases appealed from the bap on the bankruptcy court decision,reviewing findings of fact for clear error,and conclusions of law de novo.in re tirch,cir.whether the repayment of student loans would impose an undue hardship on the debtor is a question of law reviewed de novo.in re cheesman,cir.
the bankruptcy code limits the discharge of student loans only to those circumstances where repayment will impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor dependents.a.as undue hardship is not defined in the bankruptcy code,we have joined most of our sister circuits in adopting the brunner test,named for the case in which it originated oyler educ.credit mgmt,cir.the brunner test requires the debtor to prove,by the preponderance of the evidence 
that the debtor can not maintain,based on current income and expenses,a minimal standard of living for himself and his dependents if forced to repay the loans that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans and that the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans.
id.quoting brunner new york state higher educ.serv,cir.to satisfy the second prong,barrett must show that circumstances indicate a certainty of hopelessness,not merely a present inability to fulfill financial commitment.id.at quoting in re roberson,cir see also in re hornsby,cir observing that debtors need not live in abject poverty before a discharge is forthcoming.these circumstances may include,but are not limited to,illness,disability,a lack of useable job skills,or the existence of a large number of dependents.id.ultimately,the most important factor in satisfying the second prong is that the additional circumstances must be beyond the debtor control,not borne of free choice.id.
on appeal,ecmc does not challenge the bankruptcy court finding that barrett satisfied the first prong of the brunner test that barrett can not maintain,based on current income and expenses,a minimal standard of living if forced to repay the loans.rather,ecmc argues that barrett was required,and failed,to provide expert corroborating evidence to carry his burden of proof in satisfying the second prong.in particular,ecmc contends that barrett could not competently testify to his prognosis or future health,and that expert medical evidence was necessary to competently project barrett future ability to repay his student loans.
in our prior interpretations of undue hardship under a,we have not declared that expert medical evidence is necessary to corroborate a claim of additional circumstances premised on the debtor health.in tirch,the most recent sixth circuit case to apply the brunner test to a,we held that a debtor student loans are nondischargeable where the debtor fails to demonstrate how her physical condition prevented her from working.tirch,at despite ecmc argument to the contrary,we did not hold that the debtor claim was foreclosed by the lack of corroborating expert medical evidence.rather,we emphasized repeatedly that the debtor testimony by itself failed to meet the undue hardship standard.see id.at.in fact,we explicitly declined to consider whether expert corroboration was necessary to satisfy the second brunner prong we have no occasion to delve into the bap holding that the bankruptcy court assessment of the debtor testimony regarding her mental and emotional health is sufficiently reliable to support the bankruptcy court findings in that regard,without the necessity of expert corroboration,because the bankruptcy court made no such assessment.id.at.under tirch,to satisfy brunner second prong,barrett must precisely identify his problems and explain how his condition would impair his ability to work in the future.id.at.tirch,however,does not require barrett to offer corroborating expert testimony to meet this burden.
three other decisions by this court interpreting a,cited by the parties,provide little guidance.in oyler,this court formally adopted the brunner test as the governing standard in an undue hardship analysis and held that a debtor decision to accept a the fact that he was qualified for not constitute an undue hardship.oyler,at.in in re miller,cir,we held that a debtor seeking a partial,rather than total,discharge of student loans must nevertheless satisfy a undue hardship standard.neither oyler nor miller discuss the evidence a debtor must offer to support a finding that the debtor faces additional circumstances that indicate the debtor state of affairs are likely to persist.
in in re cheesman,cir,we upheld a finding by the bankruptcy court that the debtors had satisfied the undue hardship standard.because the cheesman debtors did not claim additional circumstances due to their health,cheesman is not on point.nevertheless,we based our conclusion that the debtors had satisfied the additional circumstances requirement in part based on the debtors employment history,which did not indicate that the cheesmans financial condition would improve considerably if she obtained a position as a teacher aide.id.at.thus,cheesman suggests that a debtor work history is a relevant and significant consideration in projecting whether a debtor current state of affairs is likely to persist.
we decline to adopt here ecmc position that barrett was required to produce an expert witness to corroborate his health status,and instead concur with the bap that a requirement of corroborating evidence when plaintiff is unable to afford expert testimony or documentation imposes an unnecessary and undue burden on plaintiff in establishing his burden of proof,if corroborating evidence is understood to be limited to expert medical testimony.even where some corroborating evidence of the debtor claimed illness is required,the notion that only expert medical testimony would suffice has been rejected.see,burton educ.credit mgmt.in re burton,this court,in light of the fact that other credible evidence often exists,does not suggest expert testimony is the only method of corroboration available to debtors.swinney academic fin.servs.in re swinney,although such corroborating evidence does not have to necessarily consist of extensive expert testimony,such evidence should consist of more than simply bare allegations that is,whenever a debtor health,whether mental or physical,is directly put at issue some corroborating evidence must be given supporting the proponent position for example,if properly authenticated,letters from a treating physician could be utilized.
we also find unpersuasive barrett position that,because of the expense involved with obtaining corroborating medical evidence,requiring such evidence creates a significant and unnecessary bar to debtors seeking discharge of student debt at the adversary proceeding,barrett argued that he was unable to submit his medical records or to obtain expert medical testimony because the cost to procure such evidence was prohibitive.ecmc disputes barrett contention,pointing to ohio,which limits a patient copying costs for his medical records.ohio b limiting copying costs to two dollars and fifty cents per page for the first ten pages,cents per page for pages eleven through fifty,and twenty cents per page for pages and higher see also c requiring health care providers to impose reasonable copying costs in response to patient request for medical records.we agree with ecmc that the copying costs of medical records are reasonable costs that a debtor may bear in order to substantiate his claim of undue hardship.in any event,we note that other forms of corroborating evidence may,in this case,do corroborate a debtor claim of undue hardship based on illness.medical bills,letters from treating physicians,and other indicia of medical treatment aside from medical records or expert medical testimony may corroborate a debtor claim of undue hardship based on the debtor health.
we hold that the evidence in the record is sufficient to support the bankruptcy court finding that additional circumstances exist indicating that barrett current financial state is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period.first,barrett petition was supported by his testimony,which detailed his medical history and current state of health.because barrett received a master degree in health administration and attended medical school courses,barrett testified informatively and cogently about his medical history.barrett then testified about being diagnosed with avascular necrosis,describing with great detail the two surgeries performed on his right shoulder due to the avascular necrosis.barrett explained how his condition affects his health and prevents him from working,stating that he is constantly in great pain and that movement in his right arm is limited to moving a computer mouse.the bankruptcy court found barrett to be credible 
defendant does not challenge plaintiff testimony about his medical history and,indeed,defendant own exhibit,in the form of the letter from pohlman,verifies that plaintiff has been diagnosed and treated for stage iv hodgkin lymphoma and received the abvd chemotherapy treatment.there is also no doubt that plaintiff actually underwent the two surgeries on his right shoulder earlier this year nor is there any challenge to the fact that plaintiff is currently being prescribed heavy doses of pain medication.based upon plaintiff physical demeanor,this court finds it credible that plaintiff is in a great deal of pain at all times.even if plaintiff is not required to have the five or more surgeries that he currently anticipates,which he stated would have a likely recovery period of nine months each,the pain that plaintiff currently experiences is not likely to subside.as a consequence,this court finds it credible that plaintiff current health problems will likely continue for a significant period into the future and that such problems not only prohibit him from working full time at this time,but will likely prohibit him from obtaining employment into the foreseeable future.
the bankruptcy court,as the trier of fact,was competent to assess and credit barrett testimony,and such credibility determinations are traditionally afforded great weight.see otto niles in re niles,cir the bankruptcy judge was,of course,entitled to assess the credibility of the witnesses and to accept debtor testimony while rejecting creditor.faden insurance of am.in re faden,cir when a bankruptcy judge,after listening to all of the testimony,finds that a debtor shirked his responsibility to provide notice to his creditors,this court can not then usurp the role of the bankruptcy judge and mandate its own equitable relief.see also peveler united states,cir we are generally reluctant to set aside credibility determinations made by the trier of fact,who has had the opportunity to view the witness on the stand and assess his demeanor.
nevertheless,ecmc argues that the bankruptcy court erred in allowing barrett to testify about his avascular necrosis.we review the bankruptcy court decision to admit barrett testimony for an abuse of discretion.joiner,d sicherman diamoncut,in re sol bergman estate jewelers,wl,at.lexis,at cir,unpublished table decision.the bankruptcy court properly precluded barrett from testifying about his prognosis and the cause of his current ailments.the court did,however,allow barrett t
