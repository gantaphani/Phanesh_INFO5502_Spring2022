in,cce received a request for a zone from a frequent passenger who claimed to be allergic to animals.cce determined that the commodore lounge was the only area on the ferry where passengers could be effectively insulated from contact with animals and made in early,cce instituted a policy prohibiting all animals,including service animals,from the commodore lounge.
lockett is legally blind and uses a service animal,a guide dog,to assist her in travel and mobility.on september,she sought to purchase a ticket to travel on the ferry to catalina island in the commodore lounge.cce declined to sell lockett a ticket for the commodore lounge because it did not permit any animals,even guide dogs,in the commodore lounge.cce did sell lockett a general passage ticket and lockett traveled to catalina island and back to long beach in the main seating area.
cce changed its animal policy two weeks later to allow service animals in the commodore lounge.cce estimates that now service animals are brought into the commodore lounge once or twice a year.
on november,locket filed a complaint in the united states district court for the central district of california seeking damages and injunctive relief under the ada,certain california statutes,and common law.lockett stated that the experience of being denied a ticket to the commodore lounge was embarrassing and frustrating and humiliation sic.
in the fall of,the parties filed motions for summary judgment.on august,the district court entered an order denying lockett motion for summary judgment and granting cce motion for summary judgment.the district court rejected lockett contention that cce violated b a ii in failing to modify its policies to permit service animals into the commodore lounge it held that cce had provided lockett with different and separate accommodations as allowed by b a iii as a separate basis for granting cce summary judgment,the district court held that cce refusal to admit lockett service animal to the commodore lounge was permissible under,a,and c based on health and safety concerns.lockett filed a timely appeal.
as noted by the district court,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c,summary judgment is proper only where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.we review the district court grant of summary judgment for cce de novo.oregon paralyzed veterans of america regal cinemas,cir.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.at.
it is undisputed that lockett is a member of a protected class of disabled persons under.in light of the purposes of the ada,cce refusal to sell lockett a ticket to the commodore lounge can not be justified as a separate arrangement under b a iii.this subsection allows for a separate arrangement or facility when necessary to provide the individual with a good,service,facility,privilege,advantage,or accommodation,as effective as that provided to others.for this subsection to come into play,there must be a separate arrangement or facility,which was necessary for the disabled person,and was as effective as that for which it was a substitution.here,cce did not offer lockett a separate arrangement or facility,but relegated her to the general passenger area.thus,this subsection is not applicable.moreover,even if it were applicable,the general passenger area was not equivalent as effective as the commodore lounge.the record shows that some travelers were willing to pay a premium for a seat that reclines,early boarding,and being served a cookie and a drink.in other words,the commodore lounge is the equivalent of a first class section on an airplane.construing the subsection to allow the relegation of an individual with a disability to tourist class,or to the back of the airplane,on the rationalization that the individual was allowed to travel on the same plane would distort the letter and intent of the subsection.furthermore,even if it could be argued that there was a factual question as to whether the general passenger area was as effective as the commodore lounge,that question would be a matter for the jury,and could not be determined on summary judgment.cce relegation of lockett to the general passenger area was not a permissible accommodation under b a iii.
we recognize,however,that lockett request for passage in the commodore lounge created a dilemma for cce.its prohibition on animals in the commodore lounge was adopted in response to a passenger assertion of an allergy to animal dander.accordingly,cce employees had to decide on the spot whether to potentially expose passengers in the commodore lounge to dander or to ask lockett to ride in the general passenger area.we read as permitting cce to ask lockett to travel in the general passenger area while it investigated the matter 
this regulation provides that an individual can be denied an accommodation when the individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others.subsection b notes that direct threat means that the significant risk can not be eliminated by a modification of policies,practices,or procedures,or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services.subsection c states 
in determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others,a public accommodation must make an individualized assessment,based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence,to ascertain the nature,duration,and severity of the risk the probability that the potential injury will actually occur and whether reasonable modifications of policies,practices,or procedures will mitigate the risk.
applying the regulation to the situation presented in this case,it appears that cce was faced with a potential threat to the health and safety of others,and that the threat could not be eliminated by a modification of the policy.accordingly,cce had to make a reasonable judgment based on the available medical knowledge and objective evidence we hold that cce request that lockett accept passage in the general passenger area was a reasonable judgment under.
we hasten to note that this holding is limited to cce single determination made on september,and should not be read as suggesting that cce change in its policy to allow service animals in the commodore lounge was not compelled under th
