rozanna and charles csiszer sued the hospital and obstetrician that provided care to rozanna during the birth of their daughter,allison csiszer.the complaint alleged that negligent care during the delivery was the proximate cause of allison cerebral palsy.the jury returned a verdict for the defendants.the csiszers appeal,arguing that the district committed several errors in its conduct of the trial.we affirm.
throughout rozanna csiszer pregnancy,she was treated by physicians,including mary wren,who were on staff at wren barrow obstetrics and gynecology,pllc also called the center for women.on the morning of february,rozanna was examined during a prenatal visit by eric shultz,who noted decreased fetal movement and decreased amniotic fluid.shultz immediately admitted rozanna to baxter regional medical center to induce labor.rozanna remained in the care of shultz until approximately,at which time wren assumed rozanna care.nurse angie padgett came on duty around this same time and also attended to rozanna.
shultz had begun the administration of pitocin,a medication that stimulates uterine contractions,to rozanna that morning.wren continued the administration of pitocin and increased the dosage several times between and approximately.at approximately,wren first broached the possibility of delivering the baby by cesarean section.although the csiszers initially resisted the idea,when wren again recommended a at,because little progress had been made towards a vaginal delivery,the csiszers agreed.wren discontinued the administration of pitocin,and wren delivered allison by at on february.allison was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy.
the csiszers filed suit in january against wren,the center for women,and the medical center,alleging that their negligence and the negligence of nurse padgett who was not named as a defendant proximately caused allison condition.the csiszers claimed that wren and padgett negligently administered the pitocin,which resulted in the hyperstimulation of rozanna uterus,and deprived allison brain of oxygen during the second stage of labor.they further alleged that wren should have ordered a cesarean section and ceased administration of pitocin sooner than she did.the csiszers alleged that baxter regional medical center was vicariously liable for the acts of its employees and was independently liable for failing to provide adequate training and supervision to its medical personnel.the defendants responded that allison injury occurred before the labor and delivery,and that wren and padgett did not act negligently.
the case proceeded to trial before a jury.on the fifth day of trial,a juror was dismissed by the court after he waved to a woman whom he recognized in the gallery.on february,after nine days of trial,the jury unanimously found the defendants not liable for the damages claimed by the csiszers.the csiszers raise several alleged trial errors on appeal.
the csiszers argue that the outcome of the trial was tainted by the influence of a provision of arkansas law that was declared unconstitutional by the supreme court of arkansas after the conclusion of this trial.the provision reads any evidence of damages for the costs of any necessary medical care,treatment,or services received shall include only those costs actually paid by or on behalf of the plaintiff or which remain unpaid and for which the plaintiff or any third party shall be legally responsible.ann.b.
the district court denied the csiszers motion in limine urging the court to declare b unconstitutional under the arkansas constitution.a few months later,in johnson rockwell automation,the supreme court of arkansas made that declaration.the court held that b was a rule of evidence,and that the state legislature encroached on the authority of the judicial branch,in violation of the state constitutional separation of powers,when it enacted the section.id.at.
because the jury did not find any of the defendants liable for allison cerebral palsy,it did not reach the question of damages.the csiszers maintain that the statutory limitation on evidence relating to damages nonetheless affected the jury verdict,because of an assertion made by counsel for the medical center in final argument.counsel stated 
what you heard was that every single need she has has been met.she has received every medical treatment she has needed,every therapy she has needed.and every piece of equipment she has needed has been provided to her.plaintiffs counsel introduced that all of that for the last three years cost about.and all of the of the evidence you have heard is she will continue to have every one of her needs met regardless of the outcome of this case for the rest of her life.so the only thing that has been raised in that area that not met is that they need a to a year to hire someone to be in the home with them.and i want you to think about all of that because it,it goes into the credibility of the whole case.
the csiszers argue that b set up this argument,which implied to the jury that the csiszers were acting dishonestly by making a bad faith request for damages.this implication,the argument goes,unfairly influenced the jury against the csiszers and rendered the trial manifestly unfair.
the csiszers first raised this argument in a motion for new trial,which was denied by the district court.we normally review the denial of a motion for new trial under the abuse of discretion standard,vassar solem,cir,but the csiszers neither objected during the closing argument,nor moved for a mistrial.they sought no curative or remedial action before the case was submitted to the jury.raising an objection for the first time in a motion for new trial is not sufficient to preserve it.because the csiszers forfeited their objection,we review only for plain error.see diesel,lee,cir.
plain error is a stringently limited standard of review,especially in the civil context.id.internal quotation omitted.to obtain relief,a party must show that a clear or obvious error affected its substantial rights at trial.if those points are established,then we have discretion to correct the error if the appellant also demonstrates that the error seriously affected the integrity,fairness,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.rahn hawkins,cir.the csiszers can not make this showing.
in light of the arkansas court decision in johnson,the district court did err by limiting the presentation of evidence relating to damages based on b.and because we must consider the law at the time of appeal when reviewing for plain error,see johnson united states,the error is clear.but this error did not affect the csiszers substantial rights.the jury heard a large volume of evidence over the course of this trial the trial transcript is over pages long.we see no reasonable probability that the jury verdict on liability that the defendants were not negligent would have been different but for statements made in closing argument that the csiszers had not met their burden of proof on the amount of damages.to the contrary,the objectionable portions of the argument,as well as any evidence presented concerning the financial aspects of allison care and treatment,were rendered irrelevant by the jury verdict in the defendants favor on liability.the csiszers have not met their burden to show a plain error warranting relief.
the csiszers also challenge the district court denial of their motion in limine urging the court to declare invalid another provision of arkansas law.section of the arkansas code,like b,was enacted as part of the arkansas medical malpractice act.it provides 
in any action for medical injury,n o medical care provider shall be required to give expert opinion testimony against himself or herself as to any of the matters set forth in at a trial.however,this shall not apply to discovery.discovery information can be used at a trial as in other lawsuits.
ann.section,which is referenced in the challenged provision,sets forth the elements that a medical malpractice plaintiff must prove through expert testimony the csiszers characterize as a evidentiary privilege,and,citing johnson.rockwell automation,they argue that it violates the arkansa
