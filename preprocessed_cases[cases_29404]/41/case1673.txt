a jury convicted peter boesen of conspiracy to commit health care fraud in violation of and counts of health care fraud in violation of.the district court sentenced boesen to months imprisonment and three years of supervised release.boesen appeals the convictions,the sentence enhancements,and the order of restitution.the government the judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy count.
jurisdiction being proper under and,this court affirms in all respects except for the acquittal on the conspiracy count,and remands for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
boesen specialized in otolaryngology,the medical and surgical treatment of the ears,nose,and throat.in he established boesen specialists in otolaryngology,a clinic which billed private insurers as well as medicare and medicaid.boesen brother,james boesen,served as the office manager and administrator of the clinic.
the american medical association classifies medical procedures and tests in the manual current procedural terminology.the cpt codes are used for health insurance billing.the cpt code for nasal endoscopy with debridement is,the code for cholesteatoma removal is,and the code for otoacoustic emissions tests is.
by the boesen clinic was regularly billing payers for these three codes.in two private insurance companies,john deere healthcare,and wellmark blue cross and blue shield of iowa,contacted boesen about the frequency of his billing for these codes.by december boesen was no longer a participating provider with either insurance program.boesen later rejoined wellmark blue cross and blue shield of iowa as a participating provider on the condition that he obtain a second opinion before billing for certain procedures,including nasal endoscopy with debridement procedures.
the government alleged that between december and december the boesen clinic billed for procedures and tests that were not actually performed or that were medically unnecessary.the government charged boesen and his brother james with conspiracy to commit health care fraud,counts of fraudulent billing for cpt procedures,counts of fraudulent billing for cpt procedures,and seven counts of fraudulent billing for cpt tests.the government also sought forfeiture of.
a jury found both defendants guilty on all counts.the district court immediately granted james boesen motion for a judgment of acquittal on all counts,which this court reversed.united states boesen,cir.
the district court also granted boesen motion for acquittal on the conspiracy count.in the earlier appeal,this court reserved consideration of boesen acquittal on the conspiracy count until the district court ruled on all of boesen motions.id.at.
the district court eventually ruled on the remainder of boesen motions.the court denied the motions for a judgment of acquittal or for a new trial.the court did,however,grant boesen motion for a new trial on three of the cpt counts because the jury forms incorrectly identified the patient.
when determining the advisory sentencing guidelines range,the district court imposed a enhancement under united states sentencing guideline for obstruction of justice.the court calculated that boesen fraud caused a loss of,and imposed a sentence enhancement under.
boesen contends that his sixth amendment confrontation clause rights were violated prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair trial prejudicial statements by the district court deprived him of a fair trial the district court erred by failing to grant his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the cpt counts the court erred in determining the loss amount and the district court erred by applying a sentence enhancement under.
boesen contends that the district court violated his sixth amendment right to confront witnesses by barring the admission of dvds during his of witnesses in the government.the dvds,which boesen created in and after he was indicted,depicted him performing otolaryngological procedures without anesthesia on two patients named in the indictment.
the district court based its ruling on the fact that boesen created the dvds after he was indicted,and thus admitting the dvds into evidence during the government would allow boesen to testify without being subject to.once boesen took the witness stand in his own defense,the court admitted the dvds boesen made no attempt to recall government witnesses for after the dvds were admitted.
the sixth amendment to the united states constitution guarantees an accused the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi.the united states supreme court has emphasized that the confrontation clause guarantees an opportunity for effective,not that is effective in whatever way,and to whatever extent,the defense might wish.united states wipf,cir,quoting delaware fensterer,d per curiam.we review a district court decision to limit for an abuse of discretion,reversing only if there has been clear abuse of discretion and a showing of prejudice to the defendant.id.at.
the federal rules of evidence empower district court judges to control the mode and order of examining witnesses.b.boesen had an opportunity to all government witnesses.while the district court prevented boesen from introducing his dvds during the government,the court did not prevent boesen from introducing the dvds during the presentation of his own case.once the dvds were admitted,boesen was free to recall any witness boesen failure to do so is not an error of the trial court.a critical factor in determining whether the right to confrontation has been violated is whether defendant had other means available to obtain the same effect as the excluded inquiry.united states beckman,cir.
boesen also alleges prosecutorial misconduct.in particular,boesen claims that he was deprived of a fair trial because of improper comments in assistant united states attorney stephen closing argument and federal prosecutors possession of and reference at trial to iowa workforce development records concerning boesen income.this court reviews a district court denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion.united states,cir internal citation omitted.
to constitute a due process violation,the prosecutorial misconduct must be of sufficient significance to result in the denial of the defendant right to a fair trial.greer miller,d internal quotations and citations omitted.to determine whether misconduct has occurred,this court applies a test first,the prosecutor conduct or remarks must have been improper,and second,the remarks or conduct must have prejudicially affected the defendant substantial rights by depriving the defendant of a fair trial.united states eagle,cir internal citation omitted.in order to determine whether the defendant was deprived of a fair trial,we consider the following three factors the cumulative effect of the misconduct the strength of the properly admitted evidence of the defendant guilt and the curative actions,if any,taken by the district court.id.at internal citation omitted.
boesen first charge of prosecutorial misconduct concerns the final three sentences of assistant united states attorney closing argument.prosecutorial remarks during closing argument can be grounds for reversing a defendant conviction if they were improper and prejudicially affected the defendant substantial rights so as to deprive her of a fair trial.united states boone,cir internal citation omitted,cert.denied,d.in his closing,ausa stated 
if you reach the point that you feel in the honesty of your gut that you can go ahead and take that action,that beyond reasonable doubt.the government believes that considering all of the evidence that you have received,that having given due and careful deliberations in the interest of all of the people concerned about this case,you can reach in your gut that honest feeling that jim boesen and peter boesen are guilty of these crimes as charged.if you reach that honest feeling in your gut,you should convict these defendants.
boesen failed to object to ausa statements until after the case had been submitted to the jury.this court reviews for plain error and will reverse only in exceptional circumstances.eagle,at united states davis,cir internal citation omitted.
after reviewing ausa comments in the context of his closing argument,this court concludes that the comments do not warrant reversal of boesen convictions.prefaced his discussion of gut feelings by reading and discussing a portion of the reasonable doubt instruction the prosecutor focused the jurors attention on the word hesitate in the instructions,and his gut comments were directed at that term,not at misrepresenting the government burden of proof.true,this court has advised prosecutors to avoid trying to explain to the jury the meaning of beyond a reasonable doubt.united states drew,cir.here,however,the gut comments are explained by surrounding remarks,and the prosecutor and the district court repeatedly and accurately informed the jury of the government burden of proof.see united states kenyon,cir it is well established that not every impropriety of argument calls for a new trial or for a reversal of the judgment of conviction.internal quotations and citations omitted.
boesen second claim of prosecutorial misconduct arises from a question asked of government witness steve irwin.irwin,an accountant in the boesen clinic for over five years,had a detailed knowledge of the clinic finances.irwin previous testimony revealed that the clinic billed fewer cpt procedures after insurers raised questions about the clinic billing practices.
after by boesen,on ausa asked irwin whether he knew if boesen income declined after.when irwin said he did not know,ausa began to ask a question about work force numbers that showed a decline in boesen annual income by almost a million dollars.before ausa completed the question,boesen counsel objected,the district court sustained the objection,and moved to a different line of questioning.boesen moved for a mistrial after the jury left to deliberate.
boesen argues that asking the question was prosecutorial misconduct that prejudiced his substantial rights.in particular,boesen alleges that the government should never have had any knowledge of work force numbers since the income information provided to state authorities is privileged,and that the question was asked in bad faith.
this court first addresses the contention that federal prosecutors possession of information in iowa workforce development reports is prosecutorial misconduct.while iowa law does not expressly authorize federal prosecutors to access workplace development reports,the district court held that iowa code g implicitly authorizes such access.this court reviews a district court interpretation of a state statute de novo.am.growers ins.fed.crop ins,cir internal citation omitted.the long established plain language rule of statutory interpretation requires examining the text of the statute as a whole by considering its context,object,and policy.id.internal quotations and citation omitted.
boesen is correct that iowa law imposes confidentiality restrictions on workforce development records.iowa code b.however,section g refers to federal law enforcement officials use of workforce development records 
information subject to the confidentiality of this subsection shall not be directly released to any authorized agency unless an attempt is made to provide written notification to the individual involved.information released in accordance with criminal investigations by a law enforcement agency of this state,another state,or the federal government is exempt from this requirement.
id.g.while the statute does not expressly include the department of justice among the federal departments that are exempt from the confidentiality restrictions,section g exempts federal law enforcement officials from the statute notification requirements when they make use of the reports.
this court construes statutes to avoid rendering sections of statutes superfluous.united states stanko,cir internal citation omitted,cert.denied,d.even in the absence of an express exception,section g envisions the use of workforce development records by federal prosecutors.to interpret the statute otherwise would render section g superfluous because the legislature would not need to exempt federal law enforcement from the notification requirement if federal prosecutors had no authority to access the records in the first place.federal prosecutors did not act improperly by using boesen workforce development records.
beyond mere possession of the records,boesen also alleges prosecutorial misconduct based on ausa question to government witness irwin about work force numbers.the district court is in a far better position to measure the effect of an improper question on the jury than an appellate court which reviews only the cold record.united states hollins,cir internal quotations and citation omitted.
boesen is correct that the government did not introduce the workforce development reports into evidence and thus could not question irwin about them.however,boesen counsel immediately objected to this line of questioning,the district court sustained boesen objection,and ausa adopted a different line of inquiry.this court can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to grant boesen motion for a new trial based on prosecutorial misconduct.
boesen alleges that the district court erred by commenting on prayers for him at a local church.during the second week of trial judge gritzner expressed concern,outside the presence of the jury,that a juror might be inadvertently exposed to prayers at the church.judge gritzner did not advise defense counsel to take any particular action,but merely stated i call that to your attention because i think that a rather dangerous situation with regard to making sure that we have a fair trial.boesen did not make a contemporaneous objection to judge gritzner statement.
this court reviews allegations of inappropriate comments by a district court judge under plain error when the defendant does not object to the comments at trial.united states wilkinson,cir.we hesitate to disturb a judgment by reason of a few isolated,allegedly prejudicial comments of a trial judge.id.at internal quotations and citations omitted.in this instance,boesen was not prejudiced by judge gritzner comments made outside the presence of the jury.
boesen also contends that the district court erred by admitting into evidence government charts summarizing the clinic billings between and.boesen claims that these charts contained irrelevant evidence and were unfairly prejudicial.the admissibility of summary charts,graphs,and exhibits rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge,whose action in allowing their use may not be disturbed by an appellate court except for an abuse of discretion.united states green,cir internal quotations and citation omitted.
the contents of voluminous writings,recordings,or photographs which can not conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart,summary,or calculation.summary evidence is properly admitted when the charts fairly summarize voluminous trial evidence they assist the jury in understanding the testimony already introduced and the witness who prepared the charts is subject to with all documents used to prepare the summary.green,at internal quotations and citation omitted.
for a summary chart to be admissible under rule,it must also contain relevant information.relevant evidence includes evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.
the government summary charts were properly admitted under rule.the charts were relevant,summarizing background information on the clinic revenue stream,a central issue at trial.the charts assisted the jury comprehension of government witnesses testimony by demonstrating the significance of cpt and billings.finally,the special agent who prepared the summary charts was subject to extensive by boesen.
boesen also maintains that,even if the summary charts were technically admissible under rule,the district court should have excluded them because the unfair prejudice of the charts substantially outweighed their
