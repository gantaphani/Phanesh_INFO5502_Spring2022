the issue in this appeal is whether an employee,while suspended without pay,was actively at work and thus qualified to receive disability benefits under his employer erisa plan.the plan administrator said no.the district court also said no and dismissed the action on undisputed facts we exercise jurisdiction under.because the erisa plan does not provide the administrator discretionary authority to construe its terms,we review the prior construction of the plan de novo.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d.applying this standard,we affirm.
on wednesday january,defendant rinker materials corporation suspended plaintiff william pollett for three days without pay while rinker investigated an incident involving a broken conveyor belt and pollett alleged failure to properly respond.a year prior,rinker had suspended pollett for negligently operating a forklift.on friday january,pollett physician declared pollett unable to work due to numerous physical ailments.that same day,pollett notified rinker he was unable to work and provided rinker with his physician written assessment.following his three day suspension,pollett reported for work on monday february.pollett supervisor did not allow him to return to work.instead,the supervisor informed pollett that rinker was terminating his employment due to violations of company policy regarding plant safety.pollett subsequently applied for short term disability benefits under rinker erisa plan 
to qualify for short term disability benefits under the plan,an employee must be actively at work when he notifies his employer of a disability.under the plan,a n employer will be considered actively at work if he was actually at work on the day immediately preceding an excused leave of absence pollett argument is simple a suspension without pay equates with an excused leave of absence.according to pollett,his suspension thus qualifies him as an active employee because he was at work the day before rinker suspended him.
while novel,pollett argument is unpersuasive.certainly a suspension and excused leave create an absence from work.but to equate a suspension without pay with an excused leave defies common sense.a suspension without pay constitutes a unilateral penalty which an employer imposes upon an employee.in contrast,an excused leave is more akin to a bilateral understanding during which an employer grants an employee permission to be absent from work.during an excused leave the employee suffers no monetary or other penalty and all employment privileges remain intact an excused absence connotes a lack of punishment while a suspension implies the exact opposite.online dictionary defines suspend as to debar temporarily especially from a privilege.the same dictionary defines excuse as to grant exemption or release.com dictionary excuse.the plain meaning of the phrase suspended without pay denotes rinker barred pollett from employment and all its attendant privileges during the period of his suspension.
in interpreting a plan,the administrator must adhere to the plain meaning of its language as it would be construed by an ordinary person.morgan skf usa,cir.we have little difficulty concluding that an ordinary person would not view pollett suspension without pay as an excused leave of absence under the facts of this case we see no need to belabor the obvious.the judgment of the district court is 
relying on speculation and conjecture,and without citing any case law or other authority,the majority concludes that plaintiff is not eligible for disability benefits pursuant to an employee benefits plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.the majority bases this conclusion on its contention that plaintiff was not actively employed as required by the erisa plan because he was suspended at the time of his disability.there is simply no factual or legal basis for the majority conclusion.in the instant case,i would find that both the policy language and intent underlying the erisa plan,and the appropriate construction of ambiguous plan terms,compel a finding of eligibility.
since the majority opinion provides little by way of factual background,a more complete recitation of the facts is appropriate here.on december,plaintiff started working in defendant factory as a plant manager.on january,a conveyer belt which plaintiff was responsible for supervising malfunctioned and caused in damages.on that same day,plaintiff was reprimanded and suspended for three days pending an investigation of the incident.on january,while suspended,plaintiff was informed by his physician that he is not able to work because h e has coronary artery disease with persistent angina even after bypass surgery.that same day,plaintiff informed defendant of his condition and tendered to his supervisor pertinent medical documents.on february,plaintiff reported to work,as he was scheduled to do,at which time he was terminated as a result of the investigation conducted during his suspension.plaintiff thereafter applied for disability benefits,but his application was denied based on defendant interpretation of provisions set forth in the erisa plan.
