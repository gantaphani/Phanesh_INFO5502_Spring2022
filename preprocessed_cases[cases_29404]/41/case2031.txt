pamc,dba pacific alliance medical center,pamc appeals the district court order affirming the decision of the secretary of the department of health and human services secretary,which denied pamc its full medicare annual payment update for the fiscal year.pamc had failed to make a timely submission of specified data under the reporting hospital quality data for annual payment update rhqdapu program,and the centers for medicare medicaid services cms reduced pamc annual percentage increase by two percent as a result.the provider reimbursement review board board upheld cms decision,and the secretary declined to review the board decision we affirm.
background 
pamc is a general acute care hospital that was a duly certified provider of inpatient hospital services under the medicare program and participated in the rhqdapu program.pamc missed the deadline for submitting quality data regarding discharges for the fiscal year.the deadline was cst on november.pamc vendor,thomson reuters thomson,which was responsible for submitting pamc data,failed to do so until cst on november.both pamc and thomson acknowledged that pamc failure to meet the deadline was thomson fault.cms notified pamc that the failure to timely submit data would result in a two percent reduction of its market basket update.
pamc filed a request for reconsideration with cms,and contended that,among other things,it had been diligent,its filing was not very late,and any failure to meet the requirement should be excused because it was due to thomson error.cms denied the request on the basis that the failure to make a timely submission was due to vendor error,which is not a ground for reconsideration.
pamc appealed the denial of reconsideration to the board.after a hearing,the board affirmed cms denial of reconsideration.the board determined that pamc did not submit its quality data within the timeframe specified by the secretary and was,thus,subject to a two percent reduction in its annual payment update.the board observed that congress had given the secretary broad authority to implement the rhqdapu program and that the secretary had published program procedures in the federal register and on the qualitynet exchange website.the board explained that it lacked authority to award pamc equitable relief because pamc indisputably had failed to meet the applicable deadline and was ultimately responsible for the errors of its own vendor.in addition,the board determined that even assuming arguendo that the contract doctrine of substantial performance was applicable,pamc had not substantially complied with the doctrine requirements.
pamc sought review by the secretary,who declined to review the board decision.the board decision therefore became the final agency action subject to judicial review.
pamc sought review of the decision in the district court and contended that the board erred when it failed to grant pamc equitable relief and when it determined that pamc had not substantially complied with the rhqdapu program requirements.the district court held that neither the medicare statute nor agency regulations granted cms or the board authority to award equitable relief where,as here,a provider has missed the applicable deadline through its own fault or that of its vendor.the court also rejected pamc argument that the board erred by declining to apply the contract doctrine of substantial performance,and held that contract principles are inapplicable to the statutory and regulatory relationship between hhs and a medicare provider.this appeal followed.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and f.we have jurisdiction pursuant to u.
the district court review of the board decision,and our de novo review of its decision,are governed by the administrative procedure act,cmty.hosp.of monterey peninsula thompson,cir.under the administrative procedure act apa,an agency decision may be reversed if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.as the supreme court has held regarding a hospital claim to medicare reimbursement 
we must give substantial deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulations.our task is not to decide which among several competing interpretations best serves the regulatory purpose.rather,the agency interpretation must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.in other words,we must defer to the secretary interpretation unless an alternative reading is compelled by the regulation plain language or by other indications of the secretary intent at the time of the regulation promulgation.

discussion 
pamc bases its appeal on its claim that the department acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it refused to excuse pamc late filing of the required rhqdapu data by the admittedly applicable deadline cst on november.it claims a right to equitable relief or the benefit of the contract doctrine of substantial performance.in so doing,pamc appears to have forgotten the aphorism men must turn square corners when they deal with the government.rock island united states.as we will discuss further,the department has always insisted that the deadline for submitting data is a square corner,but pamc now seeks to make it round.it is not entitled to do so.
ultimately,the issues before us are not unduly complex,but a brief tour of the legal and regulatory structure is necessary.
under the medicare statute,the department reimburses health care providers for services provided to medicare patients.cms is charged with administering the medicare program.providers receive medicare reimbursement for inpatient hospital services through the prospective payment and receive an annual percentage update to their payments for inflation for the relevant period in this case,if a provider did not submit data that related to the quality of care furnished by the provider in a form and manner,and at a time,specified by the secretary,its applicable annual percentage increase under the pps was reduced by two percent.b b viii i ii d.data collection is mandated by the medicare prescription drug,improvement,and modernization act of,b,stat.those data are collected pursuant to the requirements of the rhqdapu program.see,may.the program purposes are to give hospitals the incentive to report on quality measures they have used,to improve providers services,and to educate consumers.see.
congress delegated broad authority to the secretary to promulgate rules governing the submission of quality data under the rhqdapu program.see b b viii ii each subsection d hospital shall submit data on measures selected under this clause to the secretary in a form and manner,and at a time,specified by the secretary for purposes of this clause.pursuant to that authority,the secretary promulgated a regulation implementing the statutory and has published instructions in the federal register and on the qualitynet exchange website setting forth the form and manner of data submission the regulation provides that in the case of a hospital that does not submit quality data on a quarterly basis to cms,in the form and manner specified by cms,the applicable percentage change is reduced by percentage points.d i b.thus,the full annual percentage increase is predicated on the successful submission of data to cms by the established deadline.see,t he data for each quarter must be submitted on time the full annual payment updates will be based on the successful submission of data to cms via the qio clinical warehouse by the established deadlines.
the secretary also created an administrative appeals process for the rhqdapu program.see.under this process,if cms determines that a hospital did not meet the statutory and regulatory requirements for submission of quality data,and the hospital disagrees with that determination,the hospital may seek reconsideration fr
