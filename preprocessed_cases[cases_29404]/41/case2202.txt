we must decide whether the statute of limitations in b of the federal tort claims act ftca,b,is jurisdictional and,in turn,whether courts can employ the doctrines of equitable estoppel or equitable tolling to extend the limitations period.we hold that the statute of limitations in b is jurisdictional and,consequently,that equitable doctrines that otherwise could excuse a claimant untimely filing do not apply.accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment,which dismissed this action.
factual and procedural history 
plaintiff michael burnell marley received treatment for prostate cancer at the puget sound healthcare system hospital.he alleges that he experienced complications resulting in physical injury.in february,he filed an administrative tort claim with the department of veterans affairs.
on october,the department of veterans affairs sent plaintiff a notice of final denial of his tort claim.the letter,addressed to plaintiff lawyer at the time,stated that plaintiff could file suit against the united states under the ftca.the notice informed plaintiff lawyer that any action must be initiated within months after the date of the mailing of this notice of final denial as shown by the date of this letter,that is,within six months of october.
in march,within that period,plaintiff hired new lawyers and filed a timely complaint for damages against the united states.on december,plaintiff new lawyers moved for leave to withdraw from representing plaintiff.the motion provided no reason for the request the district court granted the motion on january,and gave plaintiff notice that he was responsible for pursuing the action in accordance with the order setting trial date and related dates.
on january,long after the limitations period had passed,an assistant united states attorney ausa sent a letter to plaintiff,stating in part 
i was told by the staff in our tacoma office that you might be interested in dismissing your case.in case that still true,i taken the liberty of drafting a stipulation enclosed that would do that.if you not familiar with the legal terms involved,and in case you do want to consult another lawyer which is entirely your right,i briefly state my opinion as to what they mean.
this stipulation provides that your case would be dismissed without prejudice.that means you could in theory bring it again at a later date.the other option would be dismissing with prejudice,which would mean you could not bring it again.but please be aware that even if you dismiss now without prejudice,there may be other factors,such as statutes of limitations,that could limit or bar your ability to bring this case again.
plaintiff did not respond to that letter.on february,the ausa sent a letter to plaintiff,stating in part 
i have not heard from you since i sent that letter.i writing again because there are deadlines approaching in your case.for example,expert reports are due to be disclosed by april.if you intend to keep litigating your case,i would appreciate it if you could please let me know,so that i can work on it and meet my side of the deadlines.but if you do want to dismiss it,please send me the stipulation and i will go ahead and file it for you.
plaintiff then signed the stipulation and returned it in the,stamped envelope that the ausa had provided.on february,the stipulation and a proposed order dismissing the action were filed with the court.on february,the court dismissed the action without prejudice.
on march,sixteen days after dismissal of the first action,again represented by the lawyers who had filed the first a second action against the united states,which was essentially identical to the first one.the united states filed an answer and a motion to dismiss for failure to meet the deadline prescribed by b.
in considering the government motion,the district court examined documents outside the pleadings and,accordingly,construed the motion as one for summary judgment.according to the court,plaintiff raised no factual disputes.turning to the legal issues,the court ruled that plaintiff could not establish equitable estoppel because he was not ignorant of the time limit and because he could not demonstrate affirmative misconduct by the government.the court rejected plaintiff equitable tolling argument on the ground that he was not excusably ignorant of the limitations period.
plaintiff timely appealed from the resulting judgment,which dismissed the second action as untimely.
discussion 
the ftca provides that 
every civil action commenced against the united states shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.the action of any person under legal disability or beyond the seas at the time the claim accrues may be commenced within three years after the disability ceases.
a.the statute goes on to state,as relevant here 
a tort claim against the united states shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate federal agency within two years after such claim accrues or unless action is begun within six months after the date of mailing of notice of final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented.
plaintiff filed his first action within six months of the mailing date on the notice of final denial from the department of veterans affairs.but plaintiff voluntarily dismissed that action.plaintiff recognizes that,by the time he filed the second action,the period had run.he argues,though,that the january,letter misled him into thinking that he would be able to file suit on the same claim if the action were dismissed without prejudice.thus,he maintains,either equitable estoppel or equitable tolling should save his suit from dismissal.
as a threshold matter,we must decide whether we have jurisdiction over a claim that does not meet the deadlines contained in b.see sinochem int l malaysia int l shipping,d stating that a federal court generally may not rule on the merits of a case without first determining that it has jurisdiction.we conclude that we do not have jurisdiction and,therefore,can not apply the doctrines of equitable estoppel or equitable tolling that might otherwise allow plaintiff case to proceed.

in certain circumstances,however,a late filing may not be fatal,as a court may employ equitable doctrines to excuse a claimant tardiness.the supreme court recognized in john sand gravel united states,d,that equitable doctrines are available to extend statutes of limitations in many cases.most statutes of limitations,the court explained,seek primarily to protect defendants against stale or unduly delayed claims.id.when considering that kind of statute,courts have flexibility to toll the limitations period in light of special equitable considerations.id.
