sally reagan filed this qui tam lawsuit under the false claims act,et.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants,holding that the suit was barred by the act jurisdictional bar e a and,alternatively,that reagan claims failed on the merits.reagan appeals and we affirm.
the university park hospital uph facility is owned by the east texas medical center etmc,a subsidiary of the east texas hospital foundation east texas.the uph facility was built in the early as the cooperative project of mother frances hospital mother frances and east texas regional health care facilities et facilities.in january the texas health facilities commission issued a certificate of need con authorizing mother frances and et facilities to construct and operate uph.the con directed that the uph project costs must not exceed.moreover,the con directed that of the project costs be financed through the issuance of revenue bonds and that east texas contribute to the project.contrary to the con,however,east texas never contributed the million that it had promised and,instead,the project was financed through a bond issue of million.subsequently,uph recognized that the project costs were going to exceed the anticipated amount and,consequently,the con was amended to require the completion costs for the uph project not to exceed.finally,in uph was completed for a total cost of million.
uph leases its facilities from east texas at an annual cost of.uph also purchases other ancillary services from the east texas,maintenance,radiology,laboratory services,
in april sally reagan reagan was hired as the executive director of uph.reagan alleges that,during her tenure at uph she became suspicious of certain financial irregularities,namely false medicare reporting she further alleges that in may she was terminated because she began to investigate these irregularities 
following her termination,reagan reported her suspicions to the health care financing administration hcfa,the federal agency that administers the medicare program for the united states department of health and human services hhs.reagan also reported her suspicions to blue cross and blue shield of texas bcbs,the fiscal intermediary between the hcfa and individual medicare claimants in texas finally,reagan filed a lawsuit against uph,east texas medical center,and others in texas state court,alleging that she was terminated because she refused to go along with the defendants alleged illegal medicare reporting.
while the state court lawsuit was still pending,reagan filed the instant action,on behalf of the united states government,under the qui tam provisions of the false claims act,et,fca and the government chose not to intervene specifically,reagan alleged claims under a and of the act.
reagan qui tam complaint alleged false statements to the government in essentially three general categories.first,reagan claimed that uph misrepresented its compliance with the con requirements in reports filed with bcbs.second,she alleged that uph falsely certified that it was in compliance with applicable medicare regulations.specifically,reagan argued that uph did not pay reasonable rates for goods and services purchased from east texas,its parent,and failed to keep proper records of its actual expenditures.finally,reagan alleged that uph misstated its status as a related party to east texas and,as a result,received reimbursements to which it was not entitled the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees,holding that reagan qui tam suit was barred by the act jurisdictional bar e a and,alternatively,that reagan claims under a,and failed on the merits.
we must first address whether the district court properly dismissed reagan claims for lack of jurisdiction under the fca public disclosure bar,found at e.if the jurisdictional bar applies,then dismissal was proper and we need go no further.a challenge under the fca jurisdictional bar is necessarily intertwined with the merits and is,therefore,properly treated as a motion for summary judgment.united states ex.rel.laird lockheed martin eng g sci,cir citations and quotations omitted.

in general terms the fca permits certain suits by private parties on behalf of the united states against anyone submitting a false claim to the government.laird,at 
the district court held that reagan fca claims were barred under the public disclosure provision set forth in e a.under this provision 
no court shall have jurisdiction over an action based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing audit,or investigations,or from the news media,unless the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
this jurisdictional inquiry requires us to consider three questions whether there has been a public disclosure of allegations or transactions,whether the qui tam action is based upon such publicly disclosed allegations,and if so,whether the relator is the original source of the information.laird,at citing federal recovery services,crescent city,cir.the purpose of this jurisdictional bar is to accommodate the primary goals of the false claims act promoting private citizen involvement in exposing fraud against the government and preventing parasitic suits by opportunistic who add nothing to the exposure of fraud.laird,at citing united states ex rel.rabushka crane,cir.
under e,we first ask whether there has been a public disclosure of allegations or transactions.laird,at.the public disclosure jurisdictional bar applies where the allegations have been disclosed in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing audit,or investigations,or from the news media.e a in the instant case the district court held that reagan allegations had been publicly disclosed in three ways reagan state court lawsuit bcbs and hhs audits and investigations and documents procured by reagan pursuant to requests under the freedom of information act,et.
with respect to reagan state court lawsuit,it is clear that the allegations disclosed there were publicly disclosed.any information disclosed through civil litigation and on file with the clerk office should be considered a public disclosure of allegations in a civil hearing for the purposes of section e a and t his includes civil complaints.fed.recovery,at quoting united states ex rel.siller becton dickinson,cir.we will therefore move to the second method of disclosure at issue here,which requires more discussion 
with respect to the bcbs audits and the hfca investigation,the district court held that the information that formed the basis of reagan qui tam suit had been publicly disclosed through both the audits and the hfca investigation.specifically,the district court concluded that the bcbs audit was central to the issue of whether uph and etmc were related entities and that the hfca investigations resulted in public disclosures.thus,according to the district court,these audits and investigations put the government on the trail of the alleged fraud.
reagan argues that the bcbs audits and the hcfa investigation did not constitute a public disclosure within the meaning of e,because the reports did not disclose both the true state of facts and that the defendants represented the facts to be something other than what they were.see united states ex rel.ass of nurse anesthetists allina health,cir.the record fails to support this contention.the core of reagan complaint is that etmc and uph were related entities,so they should not have been reimbursed by medicare for anything other than the actual cost of the goods and services sold to one another.in cost reports submitted from to,uph claimed that it was not related to any east texas entity.in years before reagan came onto the conducted an audit of the uph cost report for fiscal year,precisely because it believed this characterization of the relationship to be false.based on this audit and another conducted in,bcbs determined the true state of uph and etmc were related reduced reimbursements for ancillary services and hospital lease payments by a total of approximately million.
reagan further argues that the information she later provided to bcbs and hcfa in can not be regarded as publicly disclosed,because to treat it as such would convert a statutory to filing of the alleged facts to the a jurisdictional bar.reagan disclosure to bcbs and hfca,however,is not the government disclosure required by e b.under the fca,a qui tam plaintiff,before filing suit,must voluntarily provide the relevant information to the united states attorney,fbi,other suitable law enforcement office,or the agency or official responsible for the particular claim in question.see united states ex rel.matthews bank of farmington,cir.the explicit terms of the act require that a copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses must be served on the government to give it the opportunity to intervene.b.the statutorily required government disclosure was thus made in september when reagan filed her initial complaint in this case.the bcbs audits and hfca investigations,on the other hand,were conducted before reagan initiated this lawsuit and were properly considered public disclosures 
we next turn to consider whether reagan foia requests also constitute a public disclosure.although this issue has not been considered by this court,it was addressed by the third circuit in united states ex rel.mistick hous.auth.of the city of pittsburgh,cir,where the court held that the disclosure of information in response to a foia request is a public disclosure under e a.mistick,at.the mistick court reasoned that the specific purpose of the foia was to make certain information available for public scrutiny.id.the court also found it persuasive that the supreme court had held that a foia request was a public disclosure for the purposes of the consumer product safety act,b.id.citing consumer product safety commission gte sylvania,d stating that a disclosure pursuant to the foia seem s to be most accurately characterized as a public disclosure within the plain meaning of the consumer product safety act.finally,the court concluded that the agency response to the foia request constituted an administrative report,which is an enumerated public disclosure under e a,because the response constituted official government action it is provides information and notification regarding the results of the agency search for the requested documents,it is a report.mistick,at.accordingly,we are persuaded by the reasoning of mistick and hold that the response to reagan foia request is an administrative report constituting a public disclosure under e a 
for all the reasons set forth above,we conclude that a public disclosure has occurred within the meaning of the fca.
we now turn to the next question of our jurisdictional inquiry whether reagan qui tam action is based upon the publicly disclosed allegations.laird,at.an fca qui tam action even partly based upon public allegations or transactions is nonetheless based upon such allegations or transaction s.fed.recovery,at quoting united states ex rel.precision koch,cir.
reagan qui tam action is certainly partly based indeed,in significant her state court complaint,the bcbs and hcfa investigations,and the responses she received from her foia requests,all publicly disclosed allegations.first,reagan state court lawsuit alleged that she was terminated from uph because she refused to become complicit in fraud and to aid and abet in criminal conduct when she refused to go along with the defendants alleged illegal medicare the same allegations at issue in this case.moreover,bcbs and the hcfa had investigated and reported on essentially the same allegations made by with the con and the rules regarding reimbursements for related reagan filed the instant lawsuit.finally,reagan attested that the information she obtained pursuant to the foia requests substantiated the allegations she made both in state court and her current claims under the fca.see fed.recovery,at holding that a qui tam plaintiff can not avoid the jurisdictional bar simply by adding other claims that are substantively identical to those previously disclosed in the state court litigation.
finally,because we have found that there has been a public disclosure,and that the instant action is based upon those disclosures,we do not have jurisdiction under e unless reagan is the original source of the information laird,at.the original source exception explicitly requires the satisfaction of a test the relator must demonstrate that he or she has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and the relator must demonstrate that he or she has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing his or her qui tam action.laird,at quoting e b.it is undisputed that reagan provided her information to the government before filing this qui tam action therefore,the relevant inquiry is whether she had direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based.laird,at.
under this standard,the relator is not required to have direct and independent knowledge of each false claim alleged in his complaint.laird,at instead,the relator is simply required to possess direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the publicly disclosed allegations are based.laird,at.
the plain meaning of the term direct requires knowledge derived from the source without interruption or gained by the relator own efforts rather than learned through the efforts of others.laird,at citing webster new international dictionary ed.the relator knowledge is considered independent if it is not derived from the public disclosure.see laird,at citing united states ex rel.findley employees club.ass of nurse anesthetists,at united states ex rel.mckenzie bellsouth,cir.under this approach,we are required to look to the factual subtleties of the case before us and attempt to strike a balance between those individuals who,with no details regarding its whereabouts,simply stumble upon a seemingly lucrative nugget and those actually involved in the process of unearthing important information about a false or fraudulent claim.laird,at.
our review of the qui tam claims made by reagan convinces us that the knowledge underlying these claims is not independent within the meaning of e b.we arrive at this conclusion because the knowledge is derived almost entirely from information that has been publicly disclosed.reagan knowledge of events surrounding the alleged with the con,as well as her knowledge of alleged misrepresentations regarding the amendment of the con,are based entirely on public records of testimony by east texas executives at the con hearings in the early.
the only matter in which the information proffered by reagan arguably is not derived entirely from public records implicates slightly the related entity status of uph and etmc.reagan states that she observed the invoices that etmc sent to uph each month for the building lease and ancillary services and that she knew from her experience as a hospital administrator that other hospitals paid less for similar services and facilities.reagan argues that based on this knowledge,and after her discharge from uph,she began piecing together fragments of documentation through foia requests,interviews,and review of documents in the state archives,ultimately concluding as indee
