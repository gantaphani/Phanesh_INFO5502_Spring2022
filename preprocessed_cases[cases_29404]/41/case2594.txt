nettie ann tsosie,an enrolled member of the navajo nation,died after an emergency room physician at a hospital operated by the indian health service ihs failed to diagnose that she was suffering from hantavirus.her husband,leonard tsosie,acting both in his personal capacity and as representative of the estate,along with nettie tsosie children,filed suit against the united states under the federal tort claims act ftca.they claimed that the treating physician was an employee of the united states under the ftca who negligently failed to diagnose the decedent condition.the district court dismissed the suit,finding that the treating physician was an independent contractor,not a federal employee,and thus the united states did not waive sovereign immunity under the ftca.in its dismissal,the district court also rejected the argument that the united states was equitably estopped from asserting the independent contractor defense.plaintiffs appealed.because we conclude that the treating physician was an independent contractor at the time of service,and that there is no basis to estop the united states from asserting that defense,we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm.
late in the evening of june,nettie tsosie sought emergency medical care from the gallup indian medical center gimc,a facility operated by the indian health service.she complained of diarrhea,vomiting,and malaise.the sole physician in the emergency room,obafemi opesanmi,performed a physical examination,and ordered blood work,and a stool sample.opesanmi,employed at gimc pursuant to a services contract,diagnosed tsosie with acute gastroenteritis,mild dehydration,and hypokalemia.after being treated,tsosie was prescribed several medications,and was released.
her symptoms growing only more severe,tsosie sought emergency medical treatment from rehoboth mckinley christian hospital,a private facility also located in gallup.rehoboth transferred tsosie to a hospital in albuquerque,and she there died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps.
leonard tsosie,nettie widower,also an enrolled member of the navajo nation,filed a negligence action against the united states as owner and operator of gimc under the federal tort claims act,b,et,alleging a failure to timely diagnose hps when nettie tsosie sought treatment at the emergency room of gimc.leonard tsosie was joined by nettie children and heirs,alberta capitan,larry tsosie,jimmie tsosie,and thomas tsosie.
in its motion to dismiss pursuant to.b and b or,in the alternative,for summary judgment pursuant to,the united states conceded that opesanmi care was substandard for purposes of their motions,but argued the district court lacked jurisdiction because opesanmi was merely an independent contractor,rather than a federal employee,and thus was not subject to the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity in response,tsosie took the position that opesanmi was not an independent contractor,and even if his employment were so construed,that the united states was estopped from denying that opesanmi was an employee by virtue of the special trust relationship between the united states and native americans.finally,tsosie claimed that congress expressed its intention that health care practitioners like opesanmi be afforded the protection of the ftca by passing the indian health care improvement act ihcia,et 
the district court granted the government motions in their entirety with respect to opesanmi status as an independent contractor.after further briefing,the district court granted the government other motion,finding that the special trust relationship between the united states and native americans did not estop the government from asserting an independent contractor defense and that was irrelevant to this case.tsosie appeals from both orders.

the ftca provides a limited waiver of sovereign immunity,allowing the united states to be sued for damages arising from torts committed by government employees acting within the scope of their employment.curry united states,cir quoting b.although employees of the government include officers and employees of federal agencies,independent contractors are not employees.id.at.as such,the ftca does not authorize suits based on the acts of independent contractors or their employees.id.
we have held that the critical question in determining whether an individual is a federal employee or an independent contractor for purposes of the ftca is whether the federal government has the power to control the detailed physical performance of the individual.duplan harper,cir.under this control test,we must determine whether the government supervises the individual operations.id.when the individual is a physician,however,we recognize that a physician must have discretion to care for a patient and may not surrender control over certain medical details.lilly fieldstone,cir.within these limits,our inquiry involves consideration of a number of factors,including 
the intent of the parties whether the united states controls only the end result or may also control the manner and method of reaching the result whether the person uses his own equipment or that of the united states who provides liability insurance who pays social security tax whether federal regulations prohibit federal employees from performing such contracts and whether the individual has authority to subcontract to others.
it is clear that the intent of the government and opesanmi was to establish an independent contractor relationship.opesanmi was working in the gimc emergency room pursuant to a services contract between the department of health and human area indian health service naihs and medical doctor associates,mda for provision of emergency physician services.under the indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract,the contract mda agreed to provide qualified physicians in their field of specialties to various naihs units.the contract required mda to provide professional medical services in both inpatient and outpatient settings,including emergency room physicians on an as needed basis.another contract provision required that patient care services were to be appropriate and timely in accordance with the standards of care established by recognized medical care organizations.
section a of the contract sets forth mda obligations to provide gimc with contract physicians.first,it clearly provides that the professional services rendered by the contract physicians are rendered in their capacity as independent contractors 
it is expressly agreed and understood that this is a nonpersonal services contract under which the professional services rendered by the contractor are rendered in his capacity as an independent contractor.
emphasis added.section a also makes clear that the second lilly factor for opesanmi being an independent contractor is met 
the government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided,but retains no control over professional aspects of the services rendered,including by example,the contractor professional medical judgment,diagnosis,or specific medical treatments.
emphasis added.given that opesanmi does not use his own tools or equipment,the third factor favors employee status,but unremarkably so when a physician shows up to work in today as an independent contractor or a no longer is likely to carry all relevant medical instruments in a black satchel.instead,it is expected that he will make full use of the hospital physical facilities during the course of his service.
factors four and five of lilly are also met by the contract.section a further provides that mda is required to provide medical malpractice coverage for all physicians working pursuant to the contract 
the contractor shall maintain during the term of this contract liability insurance issued by a responsible insurance carrier 
there is no dispute that mda in fact provided such coverage,and that mda assumed the duty of paying so
