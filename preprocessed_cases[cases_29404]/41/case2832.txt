the amendments to the food,drug,cosmetic act provide a period of marketing exclusivity to the first drug manufacturer that either successfully challenges a patent listed by the food and drug administration for an approved,branded drug and markets an approved generic version of that drug or prevails in litigation establishing that the patent is valid or not infringed.ranbaxy laboratories limited and ivax pharmaceuticals,the latter since acquired by teva pharmaceuticals,usa,applied for approval of drugs to compete with an approved drug manufactured by merck and challenged two patents covering it.thereafter,at merck request,the fda removed the challenged patents from the orange book,its listing of patents covering approved drugs,thereby depriving the generic manufacturers of an opportunity to have a period of marketing exclusivity.
ranbaxy and teva each filed a citizen petition asking the fda to relist the two patents.the fda denied the petitions because merck had not sued ranbaxy or teva for patent infringement.ranbaxy and teva then repaired to the district court,which entered a summary judgment for the plaintiffs,and the fda appealed.
we hold the fda requirement that a generic manufacturer patent challenge give rise to litigation as a condition of retaining exclusivity when a patent is delisted is inconsistent with the act,which provides that the first generic manufacturer to file an approved application is entitled to exclusivity when it either begins commercially to market its generic drug or is successful in patent litigation.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
before marketing a new branded drug,the manufacturer must file with the fda a new drug application nda,including evidence the drug is safe and effective and the identifying number and expiration date of any patent or patents covering the drug.a b.when it approves the nda,the fda must publish the patent information,id.b,c,which it does in approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations,better known as the orange book.
before marketing a generic drug,which is bioequivalent to a branded drug previously approved pursuant to an nda,the manufacturer may submit an abbreviated new drug application anda.unlike an nda,an anda need not contain evidence of the drug safety or efficacy.see j.each anda,however,must contain 
a certification with respect to each patent which claims a drug or a method of using a drug listed in the orange book for which the applicant is seeking approval under this subsection and for which information is required to be filed under subsection b or c of this section 
i that such patent information has not been filed,
ii that such patent has expired,
iii that such patent will expire on a specified date,or 
iv that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of the new drug for which the application is submitted.
id.j a vii.the act rewards the first manufacturer to file an approved anda containing the certification in paragraph iv by giving it a period of marketing exclusivity,which begins with the earlier of the applicant first commercial marketing of the generic drug or when the applicant prevails in a suit over infringement or the validity of the patents covering the branded drug.id.j b iii iv.
when a patent is removed from the orange book or,in the parlance of the agency is delisted,the fda by regulation requires the sponsor of the corresponding anda to delete its paragraph iv certification with respect to the delisted patent.a viii b.if no patent covering the branded drug remains listed,then the generic applicant must file a paragraph i certification,and the fda treats the anda as though it had never contained a paragraph iv certification.as a result,the generic applicant that was first to file an approved application does not get the period of exclusivity.see id.
merck,which marketed simvastatin under the brand name zocor,submitted to the fda information with respect to three patents covering the drug patent the patent,re the patent,and re the patent.teva and ranbaxy each filed an anda to market generic simvastatin.the two of which were eligible for a period of marketing exclusivity because they involved different contained a paragraph iv certification with respect to the and patents.with respect to the patent,ranbaxy and teva each filed a paragraph iii certification that it would expire in december.
merck,however,did not sue ranbaxy or teva for patent infringement based upon their paragraph iv certifications.instead,before their andas were approved,merck asked the fda to delist the and patents from the orange book,which the agency did in.consequently,under a viii b,ranbaxy and teva were required to delete the paragraph iv certifications from their andas and thereby lost their eligibility for a period of marketing exclusivity.ranbaxy and teva accordingly petitioned the fda to relist the and patents in the orange book,restore their period of exclusivity,and refrain from approving any other manufacturer anda for generic simvastatin until their period of exclusivity expired.
in a letter ruling denying the petitions,the fda said it had considered three possible methods of handling the request of a manufacturer with an approved nda to delist a patent.first,the fda could always delist the patent,but that could unfairly deny a period of marketing exclusivity to the generic manufacturer that would later be the first to file an approved anda by depriving it of the opportunity to prevail in patent litigation.second,it could refuse to delist the patent only if a generic manufacturer had filed an anda containing a paragraph iv certification with respect to the patent,but the agency rejected that possibility on the ground that eligibility for exclusivity does not vest with a patent challenge,that is,upon the filing of a paragraph iv certification.finally,the fda could delist a patent only if a generic manufacturer had filed an anda containing a paragraph iv certification with respect to the patent and the nda holder had not filed a lawsuit to contest the certification.the fda chose the last option on the ground that it best balanced,on the one hand,the effect of the incentive for a generic drug manufacturer to be the first to challenge a patent listed in the orange book and thereby introduce generic competition to a branded drug and,on the other,the loss of competition among generic manufacturers caused by the period of marketing exclusivity for the first to file an approved anda containing a paragraph iv certification.
ranbaxy and teva then brought this action in the district court,which held the fda delisting policy was inconsistent with the act because,by requiring the first generic manufacturer that filed a paragraph iv certification to remove that certification before its anda could be approved,it deprived the generic applicant of the opportunity to obtain a period of exclusivity pursuant to j b iv i by commercially marketing its drug.the court entered judgment for ranbaxy and teva and the fda appealed.
ii.analysis 
we review the fda interpretation of the act it administers under the analysis in chevron,nrdc,d.see teva pharm.indus.crawford,reviewing under chevron fda ruling on citizen petition.first,we ask whether the congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
ranbaxy and teva claim this case can be resolved at chevron step one.ranbaxy argues that j b iv on its face entitles the company to a period of marketing exclusivity,and teva contends the fda distinction between filers of paragraph iv certifications that are sued and those that are not has no basis in the act.
under the rubric of chevron step two,ranbaxy and teva argue the fda policy of delisting a patent in the absence of litigation is unreasonable
