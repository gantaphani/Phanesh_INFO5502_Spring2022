as the supreme court said in its recent pertinent decision in arbaugh y h,d this case concerns the distinction between two sometimes confused or conflated concepts jurisdiction over a controversy and the essential ingredients of a federal claim for relief.specifically,we are here called upon to decide whether the family medical leave act the fmla or the act definition of an eligible employee as not including those at a worksite having less than employees if the total number of employees within miles of that worksite is less than is a limit on the federal courts subject matter jurisdiction or instead is an essential ingredient of an fmla claim for relief.the supreme court holding in arbaugh that title vii limitation of the definition of employer to include only those having fifteen or more employees,was an element of a title vii claim for relief,and thus,compels the same answer here that is,the requirement is an element of the claim,not a limit upon the jurisdiction.consequently,we reverse the district court dismissal of the plaintiff fmla claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings upon whether the employer should be equitably estopped to pursue a employee coverage defense,whether the employer erroneous representation to the employee that she was an eligible employee under the fmla was made with reason to believe that she would rely upon it and whether she reasonably relied on it to her detriment.
the family and medical leave act of entitles eligible employees to take up to work weeks of unpaid leave annually for any of several reasons,including a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee subject to exceptions not applicable to this case,any eligible employee who takes leave under shall be entitled on return from such leave to be restored to the position of employment held when the leave commenced,or to be restored to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits,pay,and other terms and conditions of employment 
the act defines eligible employee as an employee who has been employed i for at least months by the employer and ii for at least hours of service with such employer during the previous period,excluding any employee who is employed at a worksite at which,or within miles of which,the employer employs less than employees an employer is defined as any person engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce who employs or more employees for each working day during each of or more calendar workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year.
the enforcement section of the act provides that any employer who interferes with or discriminates against the exercise of an employee rights shall be liable to any eligible employee affected for damages as specified by the act and for such equitable relief as may be appropriate,including employment,reinstatement,and promotion this section also expressly creates a right of action and provides for federal and state court jurisdiction 
an action to recover the damages or equitable relief prescribed may be maintained against any employer including a public agency in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees for and in behalf of a the employees or b the employees and other employees similarly situated 
background 
the,melissa minard,was employed by the,itc deltacom communications,at its baton rouge field sales office.in may,minard requested leave pursuant to the family medical leave act to undergo surgery to treat a serious medial condition.irc granted minard request for fmla leave in a written memorandum entitled request for family or medical leave,which specifically stated that she was an eligible employee under the family and medical leave act and that she had a right under the fmla for up to weeks of unpaid leave in a period.the memorandum also informed minard that her requested leave would be counted against her annual fmla entitlement minard took the granted leave,but on the day she was scheduled to return to work,itc terminated her employment rather than restoring her to her former or an equivalent position as required by the act.after its issuance of the memorandum,and after minard had taken leave and undergone surgery,itc discovered that minard was not an eligible employee under the act at the pertinent time because when she requested leave irc employed less than employees at or within miles of the worksite at which she was employed.minard filed suit under the fmla on february.itc answered that minard was not an eligible employee under the fmla.minard amended her complaint to contend,in the alternative,that itc is equitably estopped to deny that she was an eligible employee under the fmla when she requested leave,because she relied to her detriment upon irc representation that she was at that time an eligible employee under the act and therefore entitled to reinstatement upon returning from her medical leave.
itc moved for summary judgment,on the ground that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because on the date minard requested leave it employed less than employees within miles of the worksite where she was employed.minard opposed the motion with evidence attempting to show that the prescribed workforce exceeded employees at that time and,alternatively,that she had relied to her detriment upon itc representation that she was an eligible employee under the fmla and entitled to the requested leave and subsequent reinstatement.
the district court granted itc motion for summary judgment.without giving reasons the court terse written ruling stated 
the court finds that the defendant is not an employer within the meaning of the family and medical leave act of and that the act does not apply under the facts of this case.likewise,the court finds that the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply 
although the order states that the district court found that itc was not an employer under the act,we conclude that the court meant that minard was not an eligible employee under the act.the parties arguments and summary judgment evidence related to whether the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because itc employed less than employees within the prescribed worksite radius.thus,we interpret the district court ruling as implicitly determining that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because minard was not an eligible employee due to there being less than employees within a mile radius of her worksite on the day she requested leave.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same standard applicable to the district court ruling on the motion summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
jurisdiction 
the supreme court,in arbaugh y h corporation,dba moonlight caf√©,d recently clarified the distinction between the requirements for federal subject matter jurisdiction and the elements of a federal claim for relief.arbaugh involved an action under title vii of the civil rights act of,which makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate,inter alia,on the basis of sex the act jurisdictional provision empowers federal courts to adjudicate civil actions brought under title vii in a provision defining terms used in title vii congress limited the definition of employer to include only those having fifteen or more employees.the question presented was whether the numerical qualification contained in title vii definition of employer affected jurisdiction or,instead,delineated a substantive ingredient of a title vii claim for relief.
the case was tried to a jury,which returned a verdict for the plaintiff on her sexual harassment claim in the total amount of.after final judgment was entered on the verdict,the employer for the first time challenged the court subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that it had fewer than employees and therefore was not subject to suit under title vii.although recognizing that it was unfair and a waste of judicial resources,the trial court granted the motion to dismiss because it believed that the employee requirement was jurisdictional.
the supreme court rejected that categorization and held that the numerical threshold does not circumscribe jurisdiction.instead,the court explained,the requirement relates to the substantive adequacy of arbaugh title vii claim,and therefore could not be raised defensively late in the lawsuit,after y h had failed to assert the objection prior to the close of trial on the merits.
after analyzing title vii,the basic statutory grants of jurisdiction,and its principal decisions dealing with the dichotomy,the supreme court summed up its reasons and recognized a rule,as follows 
n either,nor title vii jurisdictional provision,f authorizing jurisdiction over actions brought under title vii,specifies any threshold ingredient akin to monetary floor.instead,the threshold appears in a separate provision that does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.zipes trans world airlines,d.given the unfair ness and waste of judicial resources,app.to pet.for cert,entailed in tying the requirement to jurisdiction,we think it the sounder course to refrain from constricting or title vii jurisdictional provision,f,and to leave the ball in congress court.if the legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute scope shall count as jurisdictional,then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.see da silva,at whether a disputed matter concerns jurisdiction or the merits or occasionally both is sometimes a close question.but when congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional,courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character 
applying that readily administrable bright line to the case,the court held that the threshold number of employees for application of title vii is an element of a plaintiff claim for relief,not a jurisdictional issue.
in light of the supreme court decision in arbaugh,we conclude that the definition section of the fmla which defines terms used in the statute,including the term eligible employee,is a substantive ingredient of a plaintiff claim for relief,not a jurisdictional limitation.accordingly,b ii which excludes from the term eligible employee any employee of an employer who is employed at a worksite at which such employer employs less than employees if the total number of employees employed by that employer within miles of that worksite is less than does not circumscribe jurisdiction.this threshold appears in the definitions section,separate from the jurisdictional section,and does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts given the unfairness and the waste of judicial resources entailed in tying the requirement to jurisdiction,we have been instructed to refrain from our own constrictions upon jurisdictional provisions resembling title vii,such as the fmla b ii,and to leave the ball in congress court.when congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional as it chose not to do in b ii,courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.applying the supreme court arbaugh bright line rule here,we conclude that the threshold number of employees for application of the fmla is an element of a plaintiff claim for relief,not a jurisdictional limitation.
since arbaugh was decided on february,two other circuits have recognized and applied its bright line to conclude that limiting or qualifying language in a federal statute other than title vii,separate from its jurisdictional section,that does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer to the jurisdiction of the federal courts,places no constriction upon the statute clearly designated jurisdictional provision subsequent to arbaugh,a third circuit applied arbaugh and held that title vii requirement is an element of the plaintiff claim,rather than a jurisdictional limitation 
for these reasons,we conclude that arbaugh has clearly rejected the conflicting view of the courts of appeals relied upon by itc that requirements in the fmla and other statutes are jurisdictional rather than simply an element of a plaintiff claim for relief moreover,in arbaugh itself,the court abrogated decisions by the fifth and sixth circuits treating the title vii requirements as jurisdictional while approving of appeals courts decisions reaching the opposite conclusion with respect to the americans with disabilities act as well as title vii 
equitable estoppel 
because the district court granted itc motion for summary judgment on the erroneous ground that the court lacked jurisdiction,its assumption that l ikewise,the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply must be rejected as having been based on the same legal error.therefore,because we have jurisdiction,we must address the equitable estoppel question,which minard put at issue in her amended pleadings and opposition to itc motion for summary judgment.after considering the arguments of the parties in light of the record,we conclude that whether itc should be equitably estopped to assert a employee coverage defense against minard depends upon the resolution of contested issues of material fact,requiring that we remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
the supreme court has recognized that,under federal law,e stoppel is an equitable doctrine invoked to avoid injustice in particular cases.in heckler,the court quoted and adopted the elements of estoppel set forth in of the restatement second of torts,as follows 
if one person makes a definite misrepresentation of fact to another person having reason to believe that the other will rely upon it and the other in reasonable reliance upon it does an act the first person is not entitled 
b to regain property or its value that the other acquired by the act,if the other in reliance upon the misrepresentation and before discovery of the truth has so changed his position that it would be unjust to deprive him of that which he thus acquired.restatement second of torts 
the court explained that the party claiming the estoppel must have relied on its adversary conduct in such a manner as to change his position for the worse.and,according to the court,that reliance must have been reasonable in that the party claiming the estoppel did not know nor should it have known that its adversary conduct was misleading 
the restatement,while requiring a definite misrepresentation,does not require any intent to deceive by the party to be estopped in the comment section,the restatement makes clear that estoppel is appropriate even where the one making the representation believes that his statement is true,and,moreover,it is immaterial whether the person making the representation exercised due care in making the statement.in adopting the restatement estoppel principles,the supreme court evidently intended that they should be read and applied in light of the restatement explanatory provisions.
accordingly,an employer who without intent to deceive makes a definite but erroneous representation to his employee that she is an eligible employee and entitled to leave under fmla,and has reason to believe that the employee will rely upon it,may be estopped to assert a defense of,if the employee reasonably relies on that representation and takes action thereon to her detriment 
applying the restatement principles of equitable estoppel adopted as federal law by the supreme court in heckler,we conclude that itc unintentionally made a definite misrepresentation to minard that she was an eligible employee under fmla at the time she requested leave that she reasonably relied upon that misrepresentation in taking leave and undergoing surgery for the protection of her health.itc strongly challenges,however,whether minard so relied to her detriment,contending that she would have been forced to undergo her surgery
