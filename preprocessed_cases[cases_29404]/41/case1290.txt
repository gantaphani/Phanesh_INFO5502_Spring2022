from until,john shepherd worked as a parts sales manager at autozone,a vehicle services company,in macomb,illinois.in,autozone terminated shepherd employment after keeping him on medical leave involuntarily for over a year.the equal employment opportunity commission filed this suit on shepherd behalf under the americans with disabilities act.the eeoc alleged that autozone violated the ada in three ways first,by failing to accommodate shepherd physical limitations from march until september second,by discriminatorily denying shepherd the opportunity to work after september and third,by terminating him in retaliation for filing charges against the company.the district court granted summary judgment for autozone on the first claim,finding that the eeoc had not shown that shepherd had a disability within the meaning of the ada as is required to demonstrate a failure to accommodate.a jury later ruled in favor of autozone on the discriminatory treatment and retaliation claims.the district court then denied the eeoc motion to alter the judgment and for a partial new trial.
the eeoc appeals only the district court grant of summary judgment on the claim.it argues that there are genuine issues of material fact whether shepherd had a disability and whether autozone therefore violated the ada by failing to reasonably accommodate shepherd known physical limitations.because we find that a reasonable jury could conclude that shepherd had a disability under the ada,we reverse and remand the case for further proceedings.
facts and procedural background 
john shepherd began working for autozone in april as a salesperson in autozone store in fort madison,iowa.in april,he was promoted to parts sales manager and transferred to the store in macomb,illinois,where he remained a parts sales manager until he was fired in.
as a parts sales manager,shepherd responsibilities included working closely with customers and engaging in manual tasks such as routine cleaning and maintenance of the store,stocking shelves,and moving merchandise.at each store,daily tasks were distributed randomly through a assignment system to the employees on duty,including the parts sales manager,though the store manager maintained discretion to tasks.
prior to his work at autozone,shepherd had sustained an injury to his back that limited his ability to carry out many activities requiring physical exertion.he experienced onsets of debilitating pain,referred to by the parties as,when carrying out tasks that required him to lift things or to twist or rotate his torso.during a,shepherd neck and back would swell and he would sweat profusely.headaches,which also could lead to vomiting,often accompanied the swelling.
beginning in,shepherd received medical treatment from marc katchen,who described shepherd impairment as myofascial tenderness,an intermittent condition caused by tightening of the muscles upon certain movements.the parties disagree about exactly when shepherd disclosed his condition to autozone management.shepherd supervisors knew about his condition no later than march,though they may have known as early as,the year he joined the company.
shepherd impairment led to his taking medical leaves of absence of one to three weeks in january,october,june,and march.when shepherd returned to work in july after his third leave of absence,he provided his supervisors with a medical evaluation prepared by katchen.the evaluation listed physical restrictions that katchen recommended for shepherd if he felt unwell.based on katchen recommendation that he avoid twisting his upper body,shepherd requested permission to refrain from mopping.although store managers terry wilmot and steve thompson knew of the restriction,they informally accommodated shepherd only some of the time.wilmot and thompson would sometimes mopping tasks from shepherd to other employees,though district manager steven smith pressured them not to give shepherd any preference.
after shepherd leave of absence from the end of march through the beginning of april,katchen again prepared a medical evaluation for shepherd autozone supervisors.the doctor recommended that shepherd never mop or buff the floor.when smith learned of this evaluation,he told shepherd that he would not be able to return to work with such a restriction.katchen then amended his prescribed restriction to allow shepherd to return to work,changing it from never to only occasionally.
on september,thompson instructed shepherd to mop the floor.shepherd injured himself while wringing out the mop and was again placed on medical leave.in december,shepherd underwent an independent medical examination in connection with a workers compensation claim then pending against autozone.the medical examiner found that shepherd september injury had resolved and that he could return to work with whatever restrictions were in place prior to his taking leave.on january,katchen also authorized shepherd return to work with increased medical restrictions,including a lift limit of ten to nineteen pounds,a limitation on time spent standing,and a prohibition on upper body twisting.despite these two medical evaluations,autozone did not allow shepherd to return to work,instead keeping him on involuntary medical leave until february,when the company discharged him.
the eeoc filed a complaint on shepherd behalf in the central district of illinois.pursuant to c,the parties consented to have their case decided by a magistrate judge.autozone moved for summary judgment on all of the eeoc claims.relevant to our review,autozone contended in its motion that the eeoc had not shown any failure to accommodate shepherd between march and september because it had not proved that he was disabled within the meaning of the ada.the district court agreed,finding that shepherd was not substantially limited in the major life activity of caring for himself prior to september and,as a result,could not be considered disabled under the ada.the court concluded that the eeoc was therefore unable to establish a claim during the relevant time,and granted autozone motion on that claim.the eeoc now appeals,arguing that disputed issues of fact exist as to whether shepherd was disabled within the statutory meaning 
discussion 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo and assess the evidence in the light most favorable to the eeoc as the party.fredricksen united parcel service,cir.we will affirm summary judgment if there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the party has raised a genuine issue of material fact.see anderson liberty lobby.
an employer violates the ada by not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability,unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business.b a see also eeoc sears,roebuck,cir in its motion for summary judgment,autozone argued that shepherd was not a qualified individual with a disability from march through september.though autozone acknowledged that shepherd suffered from an impairment throughout the relevant time,it contended that shepherd impairment did not constitute a disability as defined by the ada.autozone also asserted that even if shepherd were considered disabled,he could not,with or without reasonable accommodation,perform the essential functions of his position.finally,autozone contested the eeoc claim that it failed to provide shepherd a reasonable accommodation that he needed to perform the essential functions of his position.we do not reach the latter two issues.the district court did not proceed beyond a determination of whether shepherd was disabled,and the eeoc claim on appeal concerns only autozone treatment of shepherd and his condition from march through september.
autozone also argues on appeal that the eeoc was required to present medical testimony to prove that shepherd was disabled within the meaning of the statute.thus,we review whether the evidence would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that shepherd was disabled within the meaning of the ada,and within this analysis,we take up autozone assertion that medical testimony was required.
significant limits on personal care 
the ada defines disability as a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual b a record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment.see.the eeoc relies on subsection a,a physical impairment that substantially limits a major life activity,to argue that shepherd was disabled from march to september,because his condition substantially limited his ability to engage in the major life activity of caring for himself.
our role is not to decide whether shepherd was actually disabled under the ada.rather,we need decide only whether a rational jury,viewing any conflicting evidence in the light most favorable to the eeoc,could so decide.we believe it could do so easily.we focus on the two parts of the statute definition of disability first,the eeoc must demonstrate that shepherd impairment limited a major life activity,for which we examine the law and the evidence regarding shepherd ability to care for himself.see a.second,the eeoc must further show that his limitation on a major life activity was substantial.see id.we identify disputed issues of material fact with respect to both parts.
limitations on 
has long been recognized as a major life activity under the ada.the federal regulations adopted in the year following the passage of the act listed caring for oneself as a major life activity.see i.courts followed suit.see holt grand lake mental health center,cir recognizing as a major life activity under the ada regional economic community action program,city of middletown,cir providing examples of limitations on cehrs northeast ohio alzheimer research center,cir identifying caring for oneself as a recognized major life activity under the act dutcher ingalls shipbuilding,cir caring for oneself encompasses a broad range of normal activities related to daily living,including feeding oneself,driving,grooming,and cleaning home.
we ruled in nawrot cpc international,cir,that an employee inability to administer his own diabetes medication also amounted to a limitation on the major life activity of.likewise in brunker schwan home service,cir,we found that not being able to dress oneself appropriately constituted evidence of a limitation on the major life activity of.our application is consistent with the purpose of the ada to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate to combat disability discrimination.americans with disabilities act of,stat,see also ada amendments act of b,stat.at elaborating on a broad scope of protection intended by congress to be available under the original act sutton united air lines,stevens,dissenting noting that the ada was meant to serve a remedial purpose.the specific inclusion of caring for oneself in the amendments list of major life activities further supports this interpretation.see ada amendments act of a,stat.at,amending.
shepherd testified at his deposition that he needed assistance with dressing himself,brushing his hair,and bathing four or five days each week while he was working at autozone prior to september.he also recalled experiencing other difficulties since,including an inability to tie his shoes and the development of oral hygiene problems that resulted from his inability to care for his teeth properly.shepherd wife,susan shepherd,also testified that she had to assist him with personal care while he was working at autozone.according to her deposition testimony,she had to help shepherd with showering,putting on his pants and shoes,and brushing his hair and teeth before he stopped working for autozone.
there is some ambiguity in susan testimony regarding exactly when shepherd began having difficulty with certain personal tasks.though susan said she assisted him with his personal tasks before he stopped working for autozone,at other times in her may deposition,she testified that shepherd difficulties with these tasks began three or four years ago.for purposes of summary judgment,however,autozone removed much of the ambiguity in its own statement of undisputed facts filed to support its summary judgment motion.there,autozone stated shepherd has needed assistance with dressing himself,brushing his hair and bathing on a daily basis from approximately the year or to the present time s ince,shepherd wife has assisted him with washing his back s ince,shepherd has had difficulty brushing his teeth during his he would not be able to put on his own pants,his own shoes,brush his hair,or brush his teeth and,shepherd would not be able to wash his own hair,back or feet when having these.
these statements by autozone as well as the shepherds testimony could be understood to mean that shepherd limitations on his ability to care for himself began at any point during or immediately after.at the summary judgment stage,any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the party.it was the responsibility of the questioning attorney at the deposition to clarify the facts if the attorney intended to move for summary judgment on the basis of these answers.particularly here,where one of the key issues was the time period during which shepherd was affected by his through september,could have asked questions to try to get more specific answers from the shepherds.for the purposes of summary judgment,the testimony by susan shepherd was consistent with her husband testimony to the effect that shepherd was limited in caring for himself between march and september.
substantially limited 
we turn now to examine whether the facts support a conclusion that shepherd was substantially limited in caring for himself.we follow the supreme court reasoning in toyota motor manufacturing,kentucky,williams,such that our consideration of this term is guided first and foremost by the words of the disability definition itself.looking to webster dictionary and the oxford english dictionary,the court determined that substantially in the phrase substantially limits means considerable or to a large degree.at.this meaning of the term indicates that the ada precludes impairments that interfere in only a minor way with the performance of manual tasks from qualifying as disabilities.id.at.
the implementing federal regulation states a little more clearly that substantially limits means that an individual is 
i unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform or ii significantly restricted as to the condition,manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition,manner,or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.
j.the regulation provides that when determining whether a limitation is substantial,we consider t he nature and severity of the impairment t he duration or expected duration and t he permanent or long term impact,or the expected permanent or long term impact of the impairment.j see also williams,at looking to the regulation for guidance on the meaning of substantially limited hamm runyon,cir same.
we have already addressed the nature and severity of shepherd impairment in our description of the limitations he faced.the shepherds testified,and autozone did not dispute for purposes of summary judgment,that before shepherd went on leave in,he needed assistance with the most basic personal care tasks when a occurred.
with respect to the duration and impact of his impairment,susan testified that shepherd experienced a t least four to five times a week while he was still working at autozone.shepherd also testified that he needed assistance with his personal care maybe four or five days each week prior to september.as noted above,there were portions of the shepherds testimony that were less specific or that superficially appeared to contradict other portions,but for the purposes of our review,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.and again,autozone provided its own clarification in its list of undisputed facts accompanying its summary judgment motion.in addition to its statement that shepherd needed assi
