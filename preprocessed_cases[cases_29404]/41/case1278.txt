ii.discussion 
a.the tha action 
because the district court considered evidence outside the pleadings in its dismissal,we review the tha claim under the summary judgment standard.b mays buckeye rural,cir.we review a district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo.id.the district court should grant summary judgment if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
the tha,codified at ann,states 
there shall be no discrimination in the hiring,firing and other terms and conditions of employment of the state of tennessee or any department,agency,institution or political subdivision of the state,or of any private employer,against any applicant for employment based solely upon any physical,mental or visual handicap of the applicant,unless such handicap to some degree prevents the applicant from performing the duties required by the employment sought or impairs the performance of the work involved.
specialty argued that chandler case should be dismissed because the statute only applies to applicants and it is undisputed that chandler was not an applicant at the time of her discharge.the district court agreed,stating in its memorandum opinion 
the plain language of the statute indicates that it was designed to protect job applicants from discrimination by both public and private employers based upon any physical,mental or visual handicap.it also clearly prohibits handicap discrimination in hiring,firing and other terms of employment by state agencies.it does not appear to protect employees in private employment from handicap discrimination once they have been hired.no tennessee courts have addressed this question although one unpublished opinion from the tennessee court of appeals assumes without discussion that the act applies to a discharge situation involving a private employer.
after careful consideration of this interesting question,the court has decided not to follow the lead of this isolated opinion but to adhere to the actual wording of the statute.
at footnote omitted.
on appeal,specialty restates and refines its argument.even if the tha prohibits discrimination in the hiring,firing,and other terms and conditions of employees,it argues,the statute only covers discrimination against public employees because the disjunctive or of any private employer,against any applicant demonstrates legislative intent to cover only applicants in the private sector.def.brief at.
chandler argues that the tennessee supreme court decision in barnes goodyear tire rubber,decided after the district court disposed of her case,demonstrates conclusively that the tha applies to termination of a private employee.in barnes,larry barnes,an employee of goodyear,alleged he was laid off from his job due to a neurological disorder.goodyear did not challenge the applicability of the statute to barns claim instead it challenged the sufficiency of the evidence.see id.at.the tennessee supreme court assumed the statute was applicable and went on to clarify the appropriate framework for analyzing handicap discrimination under the tha.however,it did state in its decision that the tha prohibits an employer from terminating an employee for a perceived disability or handicap.see generally sutton united air lines,d.and that t he record supports a finding that the b
