this action was brought by samuel smith under the federal employers liability act fela,against his employer,union pacific railroad company,for injuries he allegedly suffered in connection with his work.in consolidated rail gottshall,d,the supreme court held that an employee may recover damages under fela for mental or emotional injuries only where the employee can show he was within a zone of danger of physical impact.we are required here to determine whether a railroad employee sleep disorder and accompanying physical and emotional maladies caused by his rotating work schedule with union pacific are compensable under fela.after reviewing the supreme court guidance provided in consolidated rail,we conclude that smith claims do not meet the required zone of danger test.consequently,we reverse the jury verdict in his favor.
samuel smith was employed by union pacific for many years,primarily working the day shift.due to a reorganization in april,smith was promoted into a corridor manager position.in this capacity,his schedule required him to work three day shifts,have three days off,and then work three night shifts.his schedule continued in this rotating manner until august,when he was promoted to manager of data integrity.
this new position brought with it yet another work schedule,this one consisting of a day shift for three days,and then three days off.shortly after beginning in this position,smith started to experience sleep problems and became severely depressed,even contemplating suicide.in november,smith took an extended leave of absence.after a short and unsuccessful attempt to return in april,he ended his employment with union pacific.
a year later,smith filed this suit against union pacific,alleging he was injured in the course and scope of his employment.smith complaint did not label the specific cause of action being stated,but alleged that union pacific was negligent in creating the rotating shift schedule required of him in the corridor manager position.his complaint further alleged that this negligence ultimately resulted in a sleep disorder which,in turn,caused physical and emotional injuries,anxiety attacks,depression,insomnia,as well as a lessening of his ability to work and function,including an exacerbation of his spinal injury.app.at.smith alleged his damages included lost wages,medical expenses and hospital care,and past and future pain and suffering.
union pacific moved for summary judgment under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,arguing that smith complaint amounted to a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress.citing consolidated rail,d,which held that employees who bring negligent infliction of emotional distress claims under fela must show they were within a zone of danger of physical impact to recover,union pacific asserted smith claim was not actionable.smith argued in opposition that his claim was a pure negligence claim for a physical injury,claiming that due to union pacific rotating shift schedule,his normal circadian sleep rhythms were destroyed,and as a result of sleep deprivation,he suffered serious depression,in addition to other physical problems.app.at.
in denying union pacific motion,the district court first rejected smith contention that consolidated rail was inapplicable because he did not label his claim as one of negligent infliction of emotional distress.the district court noted the supreme court concern with the nature of the injury rather than the label of the claim,and concluded that smith described in substance emotional and mental harm to which consolidated rail applied.nevertheless,the district court ruled as a matter of law that smith allegations were actionable under consolidated rail because they met the zone of danger test by focusing on the dangers inherent in requiring a work schedule that rotated between day and night shifts.accordingly,the court denied union pacific rule motion and allowed the claim to proceed to trial.
at the close of smith case,union pacific moved for judgment as a matter of law under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,again arguing that smith injuries were purely emotional and that his claim did not meet the requirements of the zone of danger test.the district court denied this motion for the same reasons it denied the earlier rule motion.it similarly denied union pacific renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all the evidence.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of smith,awarding him in damages.this award was reduced by fifty percent based on the jury finding that smith was also negligent for failing to complain to union pacific.union pacific moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial,asserting the same argument presented in its motions for summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law.these motions were denied,and union pacific appeals.
whether an employee claim satisfies the zone of danger test is a legal question,see consolidated rail,at,which we review de novo,see wilson union pacific,cir summary judgment,medlock ortho biotech,cir judgment as a matter of law.
section of fela provides for the railroad liability to its employees for injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers,agents,or employees of such carrier.the focus of fela is the negligence of the employer,not the mere fact that injuries occur.see consolidated rail,at.quoting ellis union pacific.
physical versus emotional and mental injuries 
in consolidated rail,the two plaintiffs brought suit under fela against their employer,consolidated rail corporation conrail,seeking damages for conrail negligent infliction of emotional distress.see consolidated rail,at.during their employment with conrail,the plaintiffs suffered emotional distress and resulting physical injuries.although smith contends consolidated rail is not applicable here because he is not asserting a claim for a negligent infliction of emotional distress,we are not persuaded.
we agree with the district court that the substance of smith injury is the focus of our inquiry in determining whether the zone of danger test applies.a close reading of consolidated rail reveals that the court focused on whether emotional injuries were generally compensable under fela,rather than upon the specific cause of action.see consolidated rail,at.issue requires determination of proper scope of recovery under fela for purely emotional injuries id.at.negligent infliction of emotional distress claim contemplates mental and emotional injury that is not directly brought about by a physical injury id.at.policy considerations on limiting recovery are based on fundamental differences between emotional and physical injuries id.at.courts place substantial limitations on the class of plaintiffs that may recover for emotional injuries and on the injuries that may be compensable.
the practical reality is that it may be difficult to draw a distinction between a physical and emotional injury given that emotional injuries are often accompanied by physical changes.creative lawyering can disguise what is in substance an emotional injury by pointing to the tangible bodily changes that accompany it.see,szymanski columbia transp,cir where plaintiff was assigned work with incompetent assistant on strenuous,job and subsequently suffered heart attack,he argued his injury was physical and the cause pure negligence,but court held he described emotional injury to which zone of danger test applied holliday,at noting that litigation has expanded limits of fela capriotti consolidated rail,court explicitly rejected plaintiff attempt to avoid zone of danger test by claiming his long hours and erratic work schedule exacerbated physical heart condition.for these reasons,we look to the substance of smith injury and the nature of union pacific conduct to determine whether smith must satisfy the consolidated rail test.
smith cites bailey norfolk western ry,to support his argument that a sleep disorder is a physical injury to which the zone of danger test does not apply.in that case,bailey challenged the railroad failure to provide adequate sleeping quarters where,as
