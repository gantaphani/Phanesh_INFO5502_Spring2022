john doe doe or petitioner appeals the district court order denying his motion to quash an administrative subpoena issued by the department of justice pursuant to a health care fraud investigation.doe,a podiatrist,is under investigation for an alleged kickback arrangement with two medical testing laboratories.the administrative subpoena,issued pursuant to the department of justice authority under of the health insurance portability accountability act hipaa,ordered doe to turn over a number of documents,including records relating to his professional education and ethical training personal and business financial records records evidencing any asset transfers by doe to his children and various patient files.
we affirm the district court order denying doe motion to quash the administrative subpoena and compelling compliance therewith.
background 
john doe,a podiatrist operating a clinic in the cleveland metropolitan area,is under investigation by the fbi and a federal grand jury for an alleged kickback arrangement with two medical testing laboratories.more specifically,it is alleged that doe received payments from these labs for referring his patients to them for medically unnecessary vascular and electrodiagnostic tests.the government alleges that these kickbacks were disguised as rental payments that the labs made to doe for the periodic use of one room in his clinic.the government has obtained documents through previous subpoenas evidencing lease agreements with the labs that show that,in less than three years,approximately was paid to doe for the use of a single room in his clinic for a few hours each month.by contrast,doe himself only paid about in rent for the entire office over that same period of time.the government claims that,based on information discovered thus far,doe may have aided one of the laboratories in submitting false claims approximating to various health care benefit programs.these programs paid approximately on the claims.
the government also has evidence from independent medical experts stating that one of the labs to which doe referred patients was performing a grossly excessive amount of electrodiagnostic testing.furthermore,the government has evidence that one of the medical conditions for which doe referred his patients for further testing could not have been accurately diagnosed by this lab technicians,as it required medically invasive and testing,testing which the ohio state medical board has concluded may not,under ohio law,be performed by technicians.
pursuant to the doj investigation,a series of subpoenas were issued to doe requesting various documents.in the first subpoena,issued august,the doj requested lease agreements between doe and the labs,any payments made to doe by any medical service provider,including laboratories,and information on tests performed on patients by any medical service provider.the second subpoena,issued may,requested information on various patients.the third subpoena,an administrative subpoena and the subpoena at issue in this case,was ordered pursuant to the doj authority under of the hipaa,which allows the attorney general or her designee to issue subpoenas requiring the production of records which may be relevant to a federal health care offense investigation.a a 
the administrative subpoena ordered doe records custodian to turn over a number of documents by august.the documents requested were divided into the following nine categories 
all professional journals,magazines,and newsletters subscribed to or received by doe from january through march 
copies of recent bank and other financial records showing the current location,amount,and value of all doe personal and health business assets,whether jointly or individually held 
copies of recent bank and other financial records showing the current location,amount,and value of all doe children assets insofar as those assets were provided or derived from the individual or jointly held assets of doe 
all documents and patient files evidencing doe referral of patients for certain electrodiagnostic tests after april,
all documents and patient files after january,evidencing doe referral of patients to a specific medical testing laboratory for certain diagnostic ultrasound tests 
complete academic transcripts and records from medical or podiatric school,as well as any other training 
all documents concerning the extent of doe continuing medical education,including a list and description of courses taken,credit hours earned,and any materials provided in those courses 
all documents concerning ethics,professional responsibility,and issues in doe custody and 
retained copies of federal,state,and local tax returns both for doe and any of his businesses from to the present.
joint appendix at.doe did not turn over these documents.instead,on august,doe filed in the district court a motion to quash the subpoena,or,in the alternative,to issue a protective order.in this motion,doe called the government latest document request unreasonably burdensome and questioned its relevance.at mem.in supp.of mot.to quash.
on october,following the government combined motion in opposition to doe motion to quash and countermotion to compel doe to comply with the subpoena,the district court denied doe motion to quash the subpoena and granted the government motion to compel compliance with the subpoena.the district court denied the motion to quash because the subpoena was issued within the authority of the attorney general,the records sought were relevant to the government fraud investigation,the materials were not already in the possession of the department of justice,and because the court process would not be abused by enforcement of the subpoena.at dist.order den.mot.to quash.
doe now appeals the denial of his motion to quash the administrative subpoena to this court.
ii.analysis 
we first take note of our jurisdiction to hear this appeal.although a party served with a subpoena typically can not appeal the denial of a motion to quash the subpoena until he has resisted the subpoena and been held in contempt,the supreme court has treated subpoenas issued by government agencies differently.in the case of administrative subpoenas,parties may immediately appeal district court orders enforcing these subpoenas,as the supreme court has deemed them to be,so far as the judiciary is concerned.cobbledick united states.see also james moore et,moore federal practice c.

a.the government motion to close oral argument to the public 
before proceeding to an analysis of the administrative subpoena at issue in this case,we briefly note that,ruling from the bench,we denied the government motion to conduct oral argument in a closed courtroom in this case.the government,concerned about revealing sensitive matters that could jeopardize its ongoing criminal investigation of other medical professionals and service providers,filed a motion,in advance of oral argument and unopposed by doe counsel,to close oral argument to the public.
while we deliberate in private,we recognize the fundamental importance of issu ing public decisions after public arguments based on public records.the political branches of government claim legitimacy by election,judges by reason.any step that withdraws an element of the judicial process from public view makes the ensuing decision look more like fiat,which requires compelling justification.union oil leavell,cir.to the extent the government believes that it must reveal sensitive information to the court as part of its argument,it can submit arguments in writing under seal in lieu of the in camera oral argument.new york times united states,d.
background on the enforcement of administrative subpoenas 
as noted in its heading,authorizes the attorney general or her designee to issue a dministrative subpoenas in f ederal health care investigations.doe claims that,by enforcing the doj administrative subpoena in this case,his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures has been violated.
this circuit has noted that a district court plays only a limited role in the enforcement of an administrative subpoena.markwood,at.all the district court must do in deciding whether to enforce an administrative subpoena is determine whether the administrative agency to which congress has granted the subpoena power,in this case the doj,has satisfied the statutory prerequisites to issuing and enforcing the subpoena,and determine whether the agency has satisfied the judicially created standards for enforcing administrative subpoenas.id.at.we first turn to the judicially created standards that must be met for an administrative subpoena to be enforced.
in oklahoma press publishing walling,one of the supreme court first major cases addressing the constitutionality of an administrative subpoena under the fourth amendment,the court created standards for the enforcement of administrative subpoenas that are still used today.in oklahoma press,the court held that a subpoena duces tecum for corporate records issued by the department of labor would comply with the constitution so long as the demand for documents 
is authorized by congress,is for a purpose congress can order,and the documents sought are relevant to the inquiry.beyond this the requirement of reasonableness,including particularity in describing the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized comes down to whether specification of the documents to be produced is adequate,but not excessive,for the purposes of the relevant inquiry.necessarily,this can not be reduced to formula for relevancy and adequacy or excess in the breadth of the subpoena are matters variable in relation to the nature,purposes and scope of the inquiry.
id.at.footnote and internal quotation marks omitted.put more succinctly in united states morton salt,another case involving a request for corporate documents,the court stated that an agency request for documents should be approved by the judiciary so long as it is within the authority of the agency,the demand is not too indefinite and the information sought is reasonably relevant.in other words,the agency request must be reasonable.
it is from the last major supreme court case on the issue,united states powell,d,that the basic language of the reasonable relevance test employed by this circuit emanates.in powell,the internal revenue service irs,suspecting tax fraud,issued an administrative summons requesting corporate tax records from the president of a corporation.powell argued that the irs could not use its summons power to require production of the records unless it could proffer some grounds for its suspicion that a fraud had been committed.the court disagreed,however,stating that the irs need make no showing of probable cause to suspect tax fraud unless the taxpayer raises a substantial question that judicial enforcement of the administrative summons would be an abusive use of the court process.id.at.a court process is abused if the summons is issued for an improper purpose,such as to harass the taxpayer or to put pressure on him to settle a collateral dispute,or for any other purpose reflecting on the good faith of the particular investigation.id.at.
the powell court was concerned that requiring the irs to show probable cause that a tax fraud had been committed would seriously hinder the agency ability to conduct these kinds of investigations.id.at.thus,rather than probable cause,the court held that all the irs need show to obtain judicial enforcement of a summons is that the investigation will be conducted pursuant to a legitimate purpose,that the inquiry may be relevant to the purpose,that the information sought is not already within the commissioner possession,and that the administrative steps required by the code have been followed.id.at.we still use this test today when examining administrative subpoenas.markwood,at.as this circuit has summarized,w hile the court function is neither minor nor ministerial when deciding whether to enforce an administrative subpoena,the scope of the issues which may be litigated in an enforcement proceeding must be narrow,because of the important governmental interest in the expeditious investigation of possible unlawful activity.id.at quoting ftc texaco.en banc,cert.denied,d other quotations omitted.
following powell and the precedent of this circuit,we hold that the doj need not make a showing of probable cause to issue an administrative subpoena under,nor does petitioner argue for such a standard on appeal.in in re subpoena duces tecum,cir,the court of appeals for the fourth circuit was the first circuit court to address administrative subpoenas issued under.as the fourth circuit explained,whereas the fourth amendment mandates a showing of probable cause for the issuance of search warrants,subpoenas are analyzed only under the fourth amendment general reasonableness standard.id.at.one primary reason for this distinction is that,unlike the immediacy and intrusiveness of a search and seizure conducted pursuant to a warrant,the reasonableness of an administrative subpoena command can be contested in federal court before being enforced.id.at.
unlike the fourth circuit,the district court in in re subpoena duces tecum was more troubled by the notion of simply applying the reasonable relevance standard to subpoenas issued under.in re subpoenas duces tecum,d.the district court discussed several cases,including one from this circuit,which it believed weighed in favor of applying a probable cause standard to administrative subpoenas used to further criminal,as opposed to civil,investigations we believe,however,that these cases are distinguishable from the facts in this case.
in abel united states,d,and united states phibbs,cir,cert.denied,d,two cases cited by the district court in in re subpoenas duces tecum,both the supreme court and this circuit spoke in favor of using the probable cause standard when analyzing administrative agencies efforts to obtain information pursuant to a criminal investigation.in both these cases,however,the courts were addressing administrative searches,as opposed to administrative subpoenas.abel,at.phibbs,at stating that,if an search and inspection is needed to execute an administrative subpoena,then a valid search warrant and a showing of probable cause is needed.meanwhile,in this case,the doj has simply requested documents from doe,a request which he has decided to challenge in federal court,as is his right.the immediacy and intrusiveness associated with a search are not present in the document request in this case,and thus the heightened requirement of probable cause is inapplicable here.
the district court in in re subpoenas duces tecum also cited to the supreme court decision in united states lasalle national bank,d,as a basis for applying a probable cause standard to an agency subpoena request in a criminal investigation.in re subpoenas duces tecum,d at.lasalle,however,is also distinguishable.although the supreme court in lasalle did hold that it would be unlawful for the irs to use its administrative subpoena power under solely to gather evidence for a criminal prosecution,the court decision was based not on constitutional considerations,but on congress failure to give the irs the statutory authority to use its subpoena power in this fashion.lasalle,at.in our case,on the other hand,congress has given the doj the express power to issue administrative subpoenas for all documents and things which may be relevant to its criminal health care fraud investigation.a a.the supreme court reasoning in lasalle is inapplicable to this case.
we agree with the fourth circuit that the reasonable relevance test should apply to administrative subpoenas under.both the supreme court and this circuit have long applied this test when reviewing administrative subpoena requests,and we see no convincing basis upon which to distinguish these binding precedents simply because this subpoena was issued pursuant to a criminal,as opposed to civil,investigation.
applying the law to the subpoena in this case 
following supreme court precedent on the enforcement of administrative subpoenas,this circuit has held that a subpoena is properly enforced if it satisfies the terms of its authorizing statute,the documents requested were relevant to the doj investigation,the information sought is not already in the doj possession,and enforcing the subpoena will not constitute an abuse of the court process.markwood,at.
as noted earlier,the administrative subpoena at issue in this case requested nine categories of documents.of these,two involve requests for the files of patients who were referred to outside labs for additional testing.doe no longer disputes the reasonableness of the government request for patient documents,however,and thus we will not address this aspect of the subpoena.see appellant reply br.at.of the remaining categories,four encompass documents related to doe professional education and the extent of his ethical training,two involve doe personal and business financial records,and the final request seeks those bank and other financial records of doe children showing any assets that were provided or derived from individual or jointly held assets of john doe.at.
we will now address whether the requirements for enforcing an administrative subpoena have been met in this case,focusing on each of the different categories of documents in turn.
does this subpoena comply with statutory requirements 
petitioner does not argue that this administrative subpoena fails to comply with the statutory requirements of.indeed,to do so would be difficult given the broad subpoena power that the statute gives to the attorney general and her designees.the provision states 
in any investigation relating to any act or activity involving a federal health care offense,the attorney general or the attorney general designee may issue in writing and cause to be served a subpoena requiring the production of any records including any books,papers,documents,electronic media,or other objects or tangible things,which may be relevant to an authorized law enforcement inquiry,that a person or legal entity may possess or have care,custody,or control.
a a.the code broadly defines a federal health care offense as a violation of,or a conspiracy to violate,a number of related offenses,including false statements relating to health care matters and health care fraud.a.a federal health care offense also encompasses a variety of general criminal violations,mail and wire fraud under and,if those violations relate to a health care benefit program.a.
section also requires that any subpoena issued describe the objects to be produced and allow a reasonable period of time for the items to be assembled.a.the subpoenaed party need not deliver any documents requested pursuant to more than miles from the place where it was served.a.
there is no dispute that the investigation at issue in this case relates to a potential federal health care offense.while doe does describe the subpoena as overly burdensome,at mem.in supp.of mot.to quash,he does not argue that the length of time given him to comply with the subpoena or the designated delivery location for the requested documents are beyond the scope of the authority granted in.instead,the primary point of contention in this case is whether the documents requested are relevant to the doj investigation of doe.because authorizes subpoena requests for documents which may be relevant to an authorized law enforcement inquiry,a a emphasis added,the question of the relevance of the documents requested is inherently a question of whether the doj had the statutory authority to issue this subpoena.nevertheless,because the second element of our test for determining the enforceability of an administrative subpoena focuses on the relevance of the documents to the agency investigation,we will address this issue under that heading.thus,aside from the question of relevance,we are confident that the doj has satisfied statutory requirements for issuing this administrative subpoena.
does the subpoena seek documents relevant to the doj investigation 
while we have no circuit precedent addressing the administrative subpoena relevance requirement as it relates to documents requested under,other administrative subpoena cases in this circuit,as well as supreme court precedent,hold that relevance should be construed broadly.first,we note that the language of indicates that the question of an administrative subpoena relevance is not a question of evidentiary relevance,but rather is simply a question of whether the documents requested pursuant to the subpoena are relevant to the health care fraud investigation being undertaken.a a.furthermore,in markwood,while we did not have to engage in a discussion of the relevance of the documents requested through the administrative subpoena,we did note often the deference that courts must show to the statutory authority of the administrative agency,stating that subpoenas should be enforced when the evidence sought by the subpoena is not plainly incompetent or irrelevant to any lawful purpose of the agency in the discharge of its duties.markwood,at quoting endicott johnson perkins.
in eeoc ford motor credit,cir,this court discussed the relevance requirement as it related to administrative subpoenas issued by the eeoc.following supreme court precedent,we explained that the term relevant in the statute authorizing the eeoc to issue administrative subpoenas had been construed broadly so as to allow the commission access to virtually any material that might cast light on the allegations against the employer.ford motor,at quotation omitted.we noted that this broad interpretation of relevance was influenced by congress intent that the eeoc have the authority to demand documents that it deemed relevant to its investigation.we stated,however,that,while relevance should be viewed broadly,because the court was given the duty of reviewing the agency decision to issue a subpoena,it did not simply have to accept the agency opinion as to what is and is not relevant to agency investigations.ultimately,we decided that,in reviewing whether an administrative subpoena should be enforced,we would weigh the likely relevance of the requested material to the investigation against the burden of producing the material.id.
as with the eeoc subpoena power,it appears clear,both from the language of the statute and from congress intent in enacting hipaa,that the doj subpoena power in investigating federal health care offenses is meant to be broad.section authorizes the attorney general or her designee to subpoena any records which may be relevant to an authorized investigation,thus illustrating the substantial scope of the subpoena power congress intended to give to the attorney general.a a emphasis added.
aside from the statutory language,other evidence of congress intent to grant the attorney general a broad subpoena power can be found in hipaa legislative history.one of the main legislative purposes of hipaa was to prevent health care fraud and abuse,at,reprinted in.as the house ways and means committee report stated in recommending that hipaa be passed 
in order to address the problem of health care cost inflation and make insurance more affordable,it is important to focus on key sources affecting levels of the underlying health care costs.two key sources of excessive cost are medical fraud and abuse,and the current medical paperwork burden.
according to the general accounting office gao,as much as percent of total health care costs are lost to fraudulent or abusive practices by unscrupulous health care providers.the gao reports that only a small fraction of the fraud and abuse committed in the health care system is identified and dealt with.federal funding for prevention,detection,and prosecutions of the perpetrators of health care fraud and abuse has not kept pace with the problem.coordination of the various law enforcement agencies at the federal and state levels has been insufficient,and law enforcement agencies agree that penalties for health care fraud and abuse should be increased.
at,reprinted in at.it is safe to assume that congress,in passing hipaa,recognized the serious problem that health care fraud had become,and that,through this
