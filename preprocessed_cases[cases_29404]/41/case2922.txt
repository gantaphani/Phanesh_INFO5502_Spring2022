in separate proceedings,petitioners jennifer and gary stone and petitioner scott hammitt sought compensation under the national vaccine injury compensation program for injuries to their children allegedly caused by the diptheria tetanus acellular pertussis dtap vaccine.the stones alleged that the administration of the dtap vaccine to their daughter amelia was a substantial cause of a seizure disorder from which she suffers,known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy smei hammitt made the same allegation with respect to his daughter rachel,who also suffers from smei.the same special master presided over both cases and determined that the petitioners failed to show entitlement to compensation because in both cases the evidence showed that a gene mutation present in both children was the sole cause of their injuries.the court of federal claims affirmed both decisions.
amelia stone was born on april,and received a dtap vaccination on august.the day after her dtap vaccination,amelia experienced a febrile seizure.she was treated at a hospital and released several days later.the special master and the trial court found that amelia suffered no brain damage as a result of the seizure.on september,amelia experienced a second febrile seizure.she was again treated at the hospital,and no evidence of brain damage was discovered.
amelia continued to experience seizures,both febrile and afebrile.at a on december,her doctor noted that i t appears now that amelia has a primary seizure disorder,but that her neurologic development has been appropriate.in october,amelia seizure disorder was diagnosed as smei.in january,genetic testing revealed that amelia has a de novo mutation in her gene.the records accompanying the results noted that t his finding is most consistent with this dna variant being associated with a severe phenotype smei or smeb rather than a mild or normal phenotype.
rachel hammitt was born on november.she received her second dtap,ipv,hepatitis b,hib,and pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations on march.that evening,rachel experienced a febrile seizure.she was treated at a hospital and released several days later.the special master and the trial court found that rachel suffered no brain damage as a result of that seizure.on april,rachel experienced a second seizure.she was again treated at the hospital and released several days later.
thereafter,rachel continued to experience intermittent seizures.records from her month on november,showed a diagnosis of epilepsy but reported normal growth and development.however,at her month checkup,rachel pediatrician recorded delayed verbal and gross motor development and recommended that she be evaluated for global developmental delays.genetic testing ordered on may,revealed that rachel has a mutation in her gene.the records accompanying the results stated that the mutation is associated with a severe phenotype smei or smeb rather than a mild or normal phenotype.at a appointment,a physician noted that rachel clinical course,eeg,and test are suggestive of smei.
the petitioners in both cases sought compensation under the national childhood vaccine injury act,to vaccine act,alleging that the dtap vaccination was a substantial cause of each child smei.the evidence submitted to the special master in both cases was largely the same,and much of it including key testimony for the respondent concerning the gene mutation was presented in a single consolidated hearing.marcel kinsbourne testified for the petitioners.he testified that in both cases the dtap vaccinations were a substantial contributing cause of the smei.he explained his theory of causation as follows the dtap vaccine s received by amelia and rachel caused each of them to have a fever that fever caused a prolonged seizure classified as a complex febrile seizure and that seizure damaged the brain,lowering the level of seizure propensity,thus facilitating further seizures.however,kinsbourne agreed that a trigger does necessarily have to have a further deeper impact,and he admitted that he had simply inferred that the children had suffered brain damage from the fact of their initial seizures.he agreed that there was no clinical manifestation of the inferred brain damage in either case.
in support of his theory,kinsbourne relied on a series of medical articles,which the special master did not find persuasive.some of the articles on which kinsbourne relied concerned the dtp vaccine,rather than the dtap vaccine.the special master found those articles unhelpful because neurological reactions to the two different vaccines do not occur with the same frequency,nor do they present the same relative risks.kinsbourne also relied on an article by berkovic et to support his theory.the special master,however,found that the berkovic article supported the respondent position,not kinsbourne theory,because the authors of that article did not find that vaccines are a trigger for encephalopathy as kinsbourne argued.instead,that article concluded that individuals with certain mutations in the gene seem to develop smei or smeb a related seizure condition whether or not they are immunized in the first year of life.we do not think that avoiding vaccination,as a potential trigger,would prevent onset of this devastating disorder in patients who already harbour the mutation.
in evaluating kinsbourne testimony and qualifications,the special master expressed concern regarding kinsbourne reliability as an expert witness due to the fact that kinsbourne has not maintained a hospital based clinical pediatric neurology practice since.the special master noted that kinsbourne testimony reflected his lack of recent clinical practice,and that h is testimony was highly generalized and lacked any grounding in practice.he also noted that kinsbourne does not publish,research,teach,counsel,attend meetings or conferences,or have any special training in the field of genetics.the special master concluded that t he fact that for the past years kinsbourne has not focused his practice,research,or teaching in the field of seizure disorders,and that kinsbourne has no expertise in the field of genetics significantly limited his ability to offer reliable,persuasive,and cogent testimony in this case.although the special master encouraged the petitioners to submit expert testimony from a geneticist,they declined to do so and relied solely on kinsbourne.
three experts testified for the respondent.in amelia stone case,michael kohrman and gerald raymond testified for the respondent.in rachel hammitt case,max wiznitzer and raymond testified for the respondent.the special master found the testimony of each of those witnesses to be helpful,but was particularly persuaded by raymond,who has a background in both pediatric neurology and genetics.in his opinions in both cases,the special master stated raymond knowledge and experience with neurology and clinical genetics is extensive.his essentially unrebutted testimony was very persuasive and was relied upon heavily in deciding this case.
raymond testified that the gene mutation was the sole cause of smei in both amelia and rachel.he testified at length as to how he reached that conclusion,beginning with the fact that smei is highly correlated with a mutation in the gene.all three of the respondent experts further testified that there was no evidence that either amelia or rachel suffered brain damage as a result of their initial febrile seizures.the respondent experts concluded that there was no evidence that the initial seizures contributed in any way to either child smei.
kinsbourne agreed that smei has a genetic bas is that is very powerful,but he contended that the pertussis vaccine caused fever,the fever triggered the seizure,and the seizure lasted a long time,thereby lowering each child seizure threshold.as summarized by the special master in the stone case,kinsbourne rebuttal essentially consisted of 
criticizing the testimony presented by raymond regarding the factors a geneticist analyzes in determining a relationship arguing that the gene mutation is not a reliable indicator of clinical outcome arguing that the scientific literature supports an environmental vaccine role in causation arguing that the vaccine was responsible for the first seizure,which was a complex febrile seizure,and complex febrile seizures damage the brain arguing that the special master prior rulings in two similar cases require a finding on behalf of petitioners and criticizing raymond qualifications.
after considering all the evidence,the special master concluded that neither amelia nor rachel was entitled to compensation.he determined that the respondent had demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the gene mutation was more likely than not the but for and substantial factor that caused the smei in both children.stone sec y of health human servs.stone i,hammitt sec y of health human servs.hammitt i.
the special master noted that the issue that ultimately must be resolved is whether respondent demonstrated that the mutation is the substantial causal factor,or in other words that the vaccine did not also play a substantial causal role in the children smei.stone i at hammitt i at.as to that question,the special master wrote that t here is simply no evidence that either child initial seizure caused any brain damage,or somehow affected the expression of her genetic mutation in such a way that caused her to develop smei or experience further seizures.stone i at hammitt i at.kinsbourne,the special master found,was unable to point to any evidence demonstrating that either child vaccination acted as anything more than a trigger to her initial seizure.stone i at hammitt i at.he was unable to point to any evidence that either child initial febrile seizure caused her injury,which when combined with her mutation was a substantial cause of her smei.stone i at hammitt i at.in rachel case,the special master stated that he found compelling raymond contrary testimony that based on the mutation in her gene,she was going to have smei,and that e xcept for her having a seizure with fever,the dtap vaccination had no significant role in the development of her having smei.hammitt i at.in amelia case,the special master stated that the evidence supported raymond opinion that the initial seizure was part of the normal progression of amelia smei,which was completely unrelated to the fact that she had an immunization that day.stone i at.accordingly,the special master concluded that in both cases the petitioners had failed to present evidence that the seizure caused injury to the child brain,and that the respondent had met the burden of proving a factor unrelated to the vaccination caused the children smei.stone i at hammitt i at.
on review in the court of federal claims,both reviewing judges remanded for further findings.the reviewing judge in the hammitt case concluded that the special master had not specifically stated whether the petitioners had presented a prima facie case and,if so,whether the respondent had proved that the gene mutation was the sole substantial factor in causing rachel smei.hammitt sec y of health human.the reviewing judge in the stone case concluded that the special master had not made an express determination that the genetic mutation was the sole cause of amelia smei.stone sec y of health human.
on remand,the special master wrote supplemental opinions in which he made specific findings on the issues identified in the remand opinions.in the hammitt case,the special master concluded that the petitioner had not made a prima facie case under the applicable standard,regardless of whether the evidence of the effect of the mutation was considered in assessing the prima facie case.he also concluded that,even if the petitioner evidence were sufficient to make out a prima facie case for compensation,the government had satisfied the requirements of the factors unrelated defense of section a b of the vaccine act,which provides that compensation will not be awarded if the special master finds that there is a preponderance of the evidence that the injury is due to factors unrelated to the administration of the vaccine.a b.
in the stone case,the special master wrote 
based upon raymond expertise and vastly superior testimony,kinsbourne unfortunately very weak testimony,the presence of genetic factors that when considered cumulatively by a geneticist enable the geneticist to opine to a genetic cause,and the absence of evidence that the complex febrile seizure actually injured the brain,the undersigned is convinced beyond any doubt that respondent proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the gene mutation was the sole cause and was principally responsible for the smei.
stone sec y of health human servs.stone ii,at.the special master made the same finding in the hammitt case,using nearly identical language.hammitt sec y of health human servs.hammitt ii,at.the reviewing judges of the court of federal claims affirmed the special master ruling in both cases.hammitt sec y of health human,fed.cl.june,stone sec y of health human.may.
the stones and hammitt filed separate appeals.we consider the two appeals together because of the substantial overlap of the evidence and issues in the two cases.
both the stones and hammitt argue that the special master erred by failing to apply the proper causation principles when analyzing the effect of the dtap vaccinations in causing the children smei.the petitioners argue that the special master should have applied the doctrine of superseding cause set forth in the second restatement of torts and that under that standard,they would have been entitled to compensation.
for cases involving injuries that do not fall within the vaccine injury table,a the socalled cases the petitioner has the burden to prove causation by a preponderance of the evidence.a a moberly sec y of health human,althen sec y of health human.to prove causation,a petitioner must show that the vaccine was not only a cause of the injury but also a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.shyface sec y of health human.we have held that the causation standard in vaccine act cases is to be applied consistently with the principles set forth in the second restatement of torts.walther sec y of health human,citing shyface,at.as noted,the statute further provides that a petitioner is not entitled to compensation if the special master or the court finds that the injury is due to factors unrelated to the administration of the vaccine.a b.
as special masters have observed in this and other cases,see,heinzelman sec y of health human,no,interpretations of the vaccine act have given rise to some confusion as to the order of proof regarding causation in cases.in particular,the question has arisen whether,in assessing whether a prima facie showing of causation has been made in an case,a special master may consider evidence of other possible causes for the injury in question,or whether evidence of other possible causes may be considered only in connection with the factors unrelated defense on which the government has the burden of proof.
our decisions support the commonsense proposition that evidence of other possible sources of injury can be relevant not only to the factors unrelated defense,but also to whether a prima facie showing has been made that the vaccine was a substantial factor in causing the injury in question.see,de bazan sec y of health human,the government,like any defendant,is permitted to offer evidence to demonstrate the inadequacy of the petitioner evidence on a requisite element of the petitioner.pafford sec y of health human,t he presence of multiple potential causative agents makes it difficult to attribute but for causation to the vaccination t he special master properly introduced the presence of the other unrelated contemporaneous events as just as likely to have been the triggering event as the vaccinations.indeed,in some cases a sensible assessment of causation can not be made while ignoring the elephant in the room the presence of compelling evidence of a different cause for the injury in question.walther,at where multiple causes act in concert to cause the injury,proof that a particular vaccine was a substantial cause may require the petitioner to establish that the other causes did not overwhelm the causative effect of the vaccine.therefore,the special master is entitled to consider the record as a whole in determining causation,especially in a case involving multiple potential causes acting in concert,and no evidence should be embargoed from the special master consideration simply because it is also relevant to another inquiry under the statute.see doe sec y of health human,de bazan,at shyface,at.the two related points that our cases make clear about factors unrelated evidence is,first,that a special master may not require the petitioner to shoulder the burden of eliminating all possible alternative causes in order establish a prima facie case,see doe,at walther,at,and second,that a special master may find that a factor other than a vaccine caused the injury in question only if that finding is supported by a preponderance of the evidence,walther,at.
in both of the cases before us,the special master found that the government had satisfied its preponderance burden under the factors unrelated defense.it is therefore unnecessary for us to address whether the special master was correct in holding,in the hammitt case,that the petitioner failed to make out a prima facie case of causation.
in pressing their legal theory of causation,the petitioners rely on sections and of the second restatement of torts.those sections deal with the issue of when intervening events constitute superseding causes that have the legal effect of breaking the causal connection between a defendant tortious act and a plaintiff injury.section reads as follows 
considerations important in determining whether an intervening force is a superseding cause 
the following considerations are of importance in determining whether an intervening force is a superseding cause of harm to another 
a the fact that its intervention brings about harm different in kind from that which would otherwise have resulted from the actor negligence 
b the fact that its operation or the consequences thereof appear after the event to be extraordinary rather than normal in view of the circumstances existing at the time of its operation 
c the fact that the intervening force is operating independently of any situation created by the actor negligence,or,on the other hand,is or is not a normal result of such a situation 
d the fact that the operation of the intervening force is due to a third person act or to his failure to act 
e the fact that the intervening force is due to an act of a third person which is wrongful toward the other and as such subjects the third person to liability to him 
f the degree of culpability of a wrongful act of a third person which sets the intervening force in motion.
section reads as follows 
extraordinary force of nature intervening to bring about harm different from that threatened by actor negligence 
an intervening operation of a force of nature without which the other harm would not have resulted from the actor negligent conduct prevents the actor from being liable for the harm,if 
a the operation of the force of nature is extraordinary,and 
b the harm resulting from it is of a kind different from that the likelihood of which made the actor conduct negligent.
the petitioners argue in both cases that the dtap vaccinations caused the children injuries and that the gene mutation was not a superseding cause of their seizure disorders under the restatement.they argue that the gene mutation can not be considered a superseding cause because in each case the dtap vaccination and the gene mutation acted together to cause the smei and that the gene mutation brought about harm identical in kind to the harm caused by the dtap vaccine an increased propensity or susceptibility to seizures.
the problem with that argument is that the petitioners assume the special master determined that the gene mutation was a superseding cause of the smei.that is not the case,however.to the contrary,the special master determined in both cases that the gene mutation was the sole,substantial cause,principally responsible for the smei.hammitt ii at stone ii at using substantially identical language.the special master concluded that the dtap vaccine played no role whatsoever in either child smei.stone i at there is simply no evidence that the initial seizure caused any brain damage,or somehow affected the expression of the genetic mutation in such a way that caused amelia to develop smei or experience further seizures.hammitt i at using substantially identical language.because the special master determined that the gene mutation was the sole cause of the children smei,he did not engage in a superseding cause analysis,nor did he need to.the superseding cause analysis presupposes that the first factor was causally related to the injury the analysis seeks to determine whether that causal relationship should be considered to have been superseded by subsequent events.that analysis has no role to play where,as here,the initial factor is found to have no causal relationship to the ultimate injury.
from their legal challenge,the petitioners move to taking issue with the special master factual findings that the vaccines played no role in causing either child smei.they contend that the special master should have found,as a factual matter,that in both cases the dtap vaccine resulted in an increased propensity to have seizures,which made the children more vulnerable to the onset of the seizure condition associated with their gene mutations.the problem with that argument is that the special master found that the only harm caused by the dtap vaccination in each case was the single,isolated,initial febrile seizure,which is not by itself a compensable injury.hammitt i at stone i at.the special master found that there was simply no evidence that the initial seizure caused amelia or rachel to develop smei or experience further seizures.hammitt i at stone i at.the seizure disorder,the special master found,was triggered by the gene mutation alone,and the initial febrile seizures did not result in any brain injury that caused,triggered,or rendered either child more susceptible to developing smei,hammitt ii at stone ii at.
the petitioners factual argument is unpersuasive in light of the applicable standard of review,which requires us to uphold the findings of the special master unless they are arbitrary or capricious.see porter sec y of health human.the stones rely on kinsbourne assertion that amelia suffered brain damage from the initial febrile seizures.his testimony to that effect,however,was not based on any evidence of a clinical manifestation of brain damage resulting from amelia initial seizure the respondent experts testified that the medical record contains no indication of brain damage or any other continuing effect from amelia initial febrile seizures.the special master found the respondent experts testimony on that issue to be more reliable than kinsbourne in view of their more extensive and more recent experience in the fields of pediatric neurology and genetics.the stones point to no clear error of fact committed by the special master,but simply contend that the special master was wrong to disregard the possibility that the initial febrile seizure had an effect on amelia susceptibility to seizures in the future.the special master findings on that issue were based on extensive expert evidence and can not be regarded as arbitrary and capricious.
the stones argue that the special master should not have credited raymond testimony because raymond is not an expert on the gene,amelia variant is novel and unstudied,kinsbourne testimony rebutted raymond theory,and raymond theory employs circular logic.none of those arguments undermines the special master findings that amelia initial febrile seizure did not have continuing effects and did not contribute to,trigger,or make her more susceptible to developing smei.
the special master found that raymond was extremely well qualified to testify as to the genetic cause of amelia smei.raymond is an associate professor in neurology at johns hopkins university and the director of neurogenetics at the kennedy kreiger institute.raymond specialty is neurogenetics,and he is board certified
