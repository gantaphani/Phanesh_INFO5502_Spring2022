this case stems from a tragic accident that has diminished michael kleiber capacity to work.admirably,kleiber attempted to return to work despite his injuries.unfortunately,he was unsuccessful.he sued his former employer,honda of america manufacturing,honda,alleging that it violated the americans with disabilities act ada,et,and related state statutes by failing to accommodate his disabilities.finding no evidence that kleiber could now perform any job at honda,the district court granted honda motion for summary judgment.we similarly find no evidence showing that kleiber was capable of working at honda,and accordingly must affirm the district court judgment.
background 
factual background 
michael kleiber began working in honda marysville,ohio plant in june.in november,he remained employed at honda as a production associate and was assigned to a repair position in the assembly department.his position required him to read inspection cards describing necessary repairs,to determine the method for performing the repairs,to implement fine motor skills in executing the repairs,and to drive cars across the shop floor.
kleiber injury and treatment 
on november,kleiber fell from a fence while performing yard work at his parents home and hit his head on a concrete surface.the fall left him with serious head injuries.kleiber remained hospitalized until january.during his hospitalization,kleiber was under the care of jerry mysiw,the director of the ohio state university head injury diagnostic clinic.after being discharged,kleiber continued to see mysiw every three to four months.
when first discharged,kleiber was unable to live independently,and he required ongoing physical,occupational,and speech therapy to overcome difficulties with attention span,thinking,and coordination.his physical therapy continued through august,at which time kleiber had progressed such that he was able to carry most items on level surfaces and had only some difficulties moving heavy objects up stairs.although he was no longer receiving physical therapy,kleiber occupational therapy sessions continued into.notwithstanding his therapy,kleiber failed two driving examinations in march and august.
kleiber attempts to return to work 
bvr assistance 
in late march,kleiber met with a counselor from the ohio bureau of vocational rehabilitation bvr,a state agency whose mission is to provide service leading to employment for ohioans with disabilities.in april,the bvr determined kleiber was eligible for its services and soon assigned rodney brandel,the bvr liaison with honda,to kleiber case.
brandel arranged for kleiber to undergo a neuropsychological to identify the cognitive limitations resulting from kleiber brain james arnett on august.arnett evaluation noted various limitations,including deficits in attention and concentration,including memory abilities and manual dexterity.arnett concluded that the evaluation revealed mild to moderate impairment of brain function,and that the deficits raise d questions about safety in the performance of high risk activities.joint appendix at report of neuropsychological evaluation at.he further noted that he could not predict whether kleiber attention and concentration deficits would be further compromised in a chaotic environment.
after receiving arnett evaluation,brandel met with arnett,kleiber,and kleiber parents on september,to discuss the results and kleiber prospects for returning to honda.based upon arnett evaluation,brandel did not expect kleiber to be able to return immediately to his former position at honda,nor did brandel believe that anyone else at the meeting had such an expectation.
communications with honda 
brandel began communicating with honda regarding kleiber limitations and his desire to return to work.on october,mysiw filled out a honda document labeled a work capacity form.on the form,mysiw indicated kleiber restrictions were,memory,attention,and that these issues require d supervision and possibly a job coach.at work capacity form.he also indicated that kleiber could not work in an environment featuring unrestricted heights,and stated that kleiber endurance was likely poor.id.sometime after october,brandel submitted the work capacity form to honda.
notwithstanding kleiber limitations,doug bigler,honda placement leader for the marysville plant,and cathy cronley,honda registered nurse,began to identify certain positions that they thought kleiber might be able to perform.these positions included the right rear beam tighten position in the assembly department,the front bumper install position in the assembly department,and processes in the paint department.at bigler aff.ultimately,honda determined that none of these positions were appropriate for kleiber because they required walking on uneven surfaces,working under substantial time pressures,and employing fine manual dexterity.
during this process,the honda representatives determined that they needed more precise information regarding kleiber limitations,so they scheduled a meeting with brandel.on october,brandel and joe roop,kleiber job coach from the bvr,met with several honda representatives to discuss kleiber prospects for returning to work.according to brandel,t he idea was to have the job coach work with honda staff to identify a suitable position to start.at brandel dep.at.kleiber did not attend this meeting.the honda contingent included bigler,cronley,and jean jackson,a disability and nurse.at the meeting,honda representatives indicated that the work capacity form did not provide enough information for them to identify job processes that kleiber could perform.consequently,honda representatives requested more specific information and asked that kleiber be evaluated by robert shadel at health partners,
further evaluations 
kleiber visited shadel on october,for a fitness for duty examination.in this examination,kleiber performance on a memory test revealed a significant memory deficit.at shadel aff.shadel also reviewed arnett earlier neuropsychological evaluation of kleiber and concluded that both evaluations were consistent and that there was no reason to expect significant improvement in kleiber condition in the future.id.consequently,shadel concluded that kleiber limitations in gait,balance,coordination,cognitive processing,and memory would substantially inhibit kleiber returning to work.he also expressed some reservations regarding kleiber ability to perform job functions involving lifting,carrying,and moving around in the factory environment.nonetheless,he ordered a functional capacity evaluation from health partners physical therapist sanford goldstein.
during the functional capacity evaluation,kleiber lost his balance while walking down a flight of stairs and tested inadequate for balance on level surfaces.at goldstein dep.based upon his examination,goldstein identified four underlying limitations safety issues resulting from decreased motor planning poor balance on level surfaces decreased grip strength and decreased finger dexterity.goldstein concluded that kleiber should not be assigned to jobs that require balance on uneven surfaces,fine motor and medium motor dexterity,or rapid cyclical work.at phys.work performance evaluation summary.however,when asked in deposition what constituted a rapid pace,goldstein was unable to answer.at goldstein dep.at.
after receiving goldstein functional capacity evaluation,shadel wrote a report regarding kleiber,dated november.shadel concluded that kleiber could not work independently needed to work where balance would not be at issue had to work in a position that allowed only light gripping and simple,slow hand movements due to his dexterity deficits and could not be placed in a job requiring multiple processes.additionally,shadel noted that any return to work would have to be gradual because kleiber endurance was likely poor and that it was impossible to predict how kleiber would function in a busy and noisy environment.
kleiber discharge from honda 
based upon shadel report and a thorough review of honda production work environment,honda placement committee determined that kleiber limitations precluded him from working as a honda production associate.at memo dated.consequently,and consistently with its policy of releasing employees who have been unable to work for twelve consecutive months,honda terminated kleiber employment effective november.randy moore,honda assistant manager for restriction placement,sent a letter to brandel on november,indicating that honda was unable to accommodate kleiber,and that it consequently terminated him.brandel responded on december with a letter reiterating the bvr willingness to continue working with honda on kleiber behalf,and requesting documentation of kleiber functional capacity evaluation and fitness for duty examination,as well as specific information regarding the jobs for which kleiber was considered.
procedural history 
on july,kleiber filed a discrimination charge against honda with the eeoc,which issued a letter on november.kleiber filed a complaint in the district court for the southern district of ohio on february.kleiber complaint alleged that honda discriminated against him on the basis of his disability,and asserted claims for violation of the americans with disabilities act by refusing to provide a reasonable accommodation,refusing to participate in the interactive process,and causing the breakdown of the interactive process violation of the ohio revised code prohibition of disability discrimination,ohio and discharge in violation of public policy as prohibited by ohio revised code.
in early october,both honda and kleiber filed motions for summary judgment.kleiber amended his complaint on november,but continued to pursue the same three claims.on february,the district court issued an order granting honda,and denying kleiber,motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in honda favor.the district court concluded that kleiber could not show that he was qualified for any position at honda,and therefore,he could not show that honda either failed to offer him a reasonable accommodation for,or terminated him because of,his disability.further,the district court concluded that because honda actions did not contravene ohio prohibition of disability discrimination,kleiber could not show that his termination would jeopardize that policy accordingly,the district court rejected his claim for violation of public policy.on march,kleiber timely filed his notice of appeal.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over kleiber ada claim,and supplemental jurisdiction over kleiber claims,id.a.we have jurisdiction over his appeal from the district court final judgment.id.
we review de novo a district court order granting summary judgment,dicarlo potter,cir,and will affirm a grant of summary judgment if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in reviewing the district court decision to grant summary judgment,we must view all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
iii.analysis 
on appeal,kleiber offers two arguments.first,kleiber argues that a genuine dispute of material fact exists as to whether there was an open position at honda for which he was qualified.second,he contends that honda denied him a reasonable accommodation by failing to participate in good faith in the informal,interactive process required to identify a suitable reasonable accommodation.these arguments both address honda alleged failure to offer kleiber a reasonable accommodation.
the ada prohibits discrimination because of disability against a qualified individual with a disability,a,and defines discrimination to include not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability,id.b a.the act further defines reasonable accommodation to include 
a making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities and 
b job restructuring,or modified work schedules,reassignment to a vacant position,acquisition or modification of equipment or devices,appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations,training materials or policies,the provision of qualified readers or interpreters,and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.
kleiber bases his discrimination claim upon honda failure to accommodate his disability.honda acknowledges that it did not accommodate kleiber disability but argues that no reasonable accommodation was possible because kleiber was not qualified for any position.as noted above,failing to make a reasonable accommodation falls within the ada definition of discrimination.accordingly,claims premised upon an employer failure to offer a reasonable accommodation necessarily involve direct evidence the failure to accommodate of discrimination bultemeyer fort wayne cmty,cir.this conclusion is consistent with the definition of direct evidence,for if the accepts the employee version of the facts,no inference is necessary to conclude that the employee has proven this form of discrimination.see jacklyn healthcare prods.sales,cir case defining direct evidence as that evidence which,if believed,requires the conclusion that unlawful discrimination was at least a motivating factor in the employer actions johnson kroger,cir case noting that direct evidence does not require the to draw any inferences to conclude that the defendant discriminated against the plaintiff.it is further consistent with our analysis in monette electronic data systems,cir,in which we noted that claims for fall within the category of cases in which the employer relies on the employee disability in its,and consequently are suitable for analysis under the framework.see also hoskins oakland county sheriff dep t,cir applying standard to claim for failure to accommodate.
when an ada plaintiff premises his claim upon direct evidence,we jettison the familiar mcdonnell douglas framework applicable in cases also called cases,and we analyze the claim under the following framework 
the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that he or she is disabled.the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that he or she is otherwise qualified for the position despite his or her disability a without accommodation from the employer b with an alleged essential job requirement eliminated or c with a proposed reasonable accommodation.the employer will bear the burden of proving that a challenged job criterion is essential,and therefore a business necessity,or that a proposed accommodation will impose an undue hardship upon the employer.
hedrick reserve care,cir,cert.denied,d.honda does not contest that kleiber is disabled.instead,the parties dispute centers on whether honda could reasonably accommodate kleiber disability by transferring him to a different c of the above framework.accordingly,to survive summary judgment,it is kleiber burden to submit evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether he is qualified for a position with a proposed reasonable accommodation.
failure to transfer kleiber to an open position for which he was qualified 
here,the accommodation kleiber sought was a transfer to a different position at honda.as noted above,a reasonable accommodation under the ada may include reassignment to a vacant position.b emphasis added.consequently,an employer has a duty under the ada to consider transferring a disabled employee who can no longer perform his old job even with accommodation to a new position within the c ompany for which that employee is otherwise qualified.burns,cir.however,this duty does not require employers to create new jobs or displace existing employees from their positions in order to accommodate a disabled individual.id.
first,we must determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether honda had a vacant position in october and november.honda maintains that no vacancy existed because each job process must be filled at all times for the production line to operate.appellee br.at.in o
