appellant lawrence chorosevic pursues this action on behalf of himself and others similarly situated,alleging that appellees improperly calculated secondary health benefits owed to him for services rendered in.the district denied class certification and granted appellees motion for summary judgment due to chorosevic failure to exhaust available administrative remedies.chorosevic argues that the district court erred by denying class certification,denying further class discovery,granting appellees motion for leave to file answers,and granting summary judgment.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
in,chorosevic received health insurance benefits through two employee welfare benefit plans a plan issued by blue cross and blue shield of missouri bcbs and a plan issued by appellee metropolitan life insurance company metlife known as the metlife choices plan the choices plan.chorosevic was eligible for coverage under the choices plan through his wife,diane,who was formerly employed by a wholly owned subsidiary of metlife.the plan administrator of the choices plan was metlife,and the claims administrator was appellee united healthcare insurance company united accordingly,metlife had full discretion in determining benefit eligibility,whereas united reviewed benefit decisions and had final authority on whether or not to pay a claim.
coordination of benefits,which occurs when a person has more than one source of reimbursement for health care expenses,is of central importance in this lawsuit.bcbs was chorosevic primary insurer,meaning that bcbs was obligated to pay first when chorosevic made a claim for medical benefits.the summary plan description spd for the choices plan included a provision for coordinating benefits,which the parties refer to as the come out whole method with a benefits reserve according to chorosevic,this method required the choices plan to credit the money that it saved by being the secondary insurer to a reserve,which could be used to reimburse a claimant for expenses during the applicable calendar year.
the spd also set forth procedures for submission of claims and appeals,stating in part participants wanting to dispute an adverse benefit determination,payment amount or plan interpretation that relates to the receipt of plan benefits or exercise of a current right available under the plan must file a claim within days of receipt of the adverse determination.united would review the benefits determination and issue a final decision within thirty days,unless a extension was needed.if united upheld a denial of benefits,a dissatisfied plan participant had sixty days from the notification letter date to submit a second appeal.after that period,no further administrative appeals were permitted under the spd.united was to review second appeals and determine benefits payable within thirty days.
chorosevic claims relate to medical services he received on june and august.for each of those services,the bcbs plan paid an amount and united determined that the choices plan owed nothing.consequently,chorosevic incurred expenses in the following amounts for services rendered on june,for services rendered on august,and for services rendered on august.for each benefits determination,united issued an explanation of benefits eob to chorosevic describing the appeals procedure,including the deadline for requesting review of the benefits determination.
on november,chorosevic wrote to united,disputing the determination of secondary benefits under the choices plan related to her husband claim.chorosevic complained that united was using the wrong preferred provider rates,which caused it to understate the amount that the choices plan saved by being a secondary benefits provider.chorosevic attached copies of the eobs from bcbs and united and the hospital bill showing due.she also addressed what she called a multiple coverage limitation credit,explaining that united saves money as the secondary carrier and that money should be used to pay any remaining charges in full,if the secondary carrier does not pay them.
united denied chorosevic appeal on december,concluding that chorosevic claim for benefits was processed correctly.the denial letter explained the procedure under the choices plan in a way that appears inconsistent with the method with a benefits reserve.the denial letter also notified chorosevic of his right to submit a second appeal of the adverse benefits determination,which he did not do.
on january,sharon bibby,a senior benefits specialist at metlife,sent a letter to chorosevic stating that united incorrectly processed the claim and that metlife directed united to pay chorosevic related to the claim the bibby letter.this payment,the parties agree,resolved the claim.the letter continued united is reviewing your other claims as well.we are also working with united to review and if necessary take corrective action regarding all of the metlife secondary claims processed by united.
on april,chorosevic wrote to bibby,detailing her belief that united improperly processed her husband claims in,and.she attached several eobs and requested reprocessing of any claims where united did not make payment since.additionally,chorosevic specifically addressed the issue of banked money and explained,during those years united saved a considerable amount of money as the secondary carrier for which i should not have incurred any expenses.metlife did not respond to the april letter.then,on may,chorosevic sent a letter to united requesting that united reprocess her husband claims and pay them out of the banked money account.she explained,since i was not aware that i could request reimbursement out of the banked money account,i am doing so now.fourteen days later,on june,and chorosevic commenced this litigation.
effective january,metlife amended the choices plan to change its method of coordinating secondary benefits to a method without a benefits reserve.the method is less favorable for plan members because the choices plan generally pays less secondary benefits and the money the plan saves by being a secondary insurer is not placed in a reserve for the member allowed expenses.chorosevic does not allege that appellees improperly processed benefits under the method,and therefore,this lawsuit concerns only the coordination of benefits prior to.
in august,united entered into a regulatory settlement agreement,which over thirty states have joined.the state of missouri joined the agreement by entering a memorandum of understanding with united in november.the settlement agreement identifies coordination of benefits as an area of review and requires united to reprocess claims,make restitution to past and present insureds,and make restitution with interest on underpaid claims.however,neither the settlement agreement nor the memorandum of understanding covers members of plans,such as chorosevic.
ii.procedural history 
the chorosevics filed their initial complaint in the southern district of illinois challenging united and metlife failure to pay secondary benefits due under the choices plan.they voluntarily dismissed that action in november.one month later,they filed their first complaint in this putative class action in the eastern district of missouri.with leave from the court,appellees filed their answers in april,asserting several affirmative defenses,including failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
in december,appellants filed a motion to certify a class consisting of all members of health plans controlled,underwritten,or administered by united where the applicable plan was a secondary insurer and included a provision using the method with a benefits reserve.the district court denied the motion for class certification in july,but permitted the chorosevics to engage in limited class discovery.in september,the district court again denied broader class discovery.
in october,the chorosevics filed their first amended complaint,asserting a claim to recover benefits under a b and claims for breach of fiduciary duty under a and.on april,upon review of appellees partial motion to dismiss,the district court dismissed the a claim for failure to state a claim and all claims by chorosevic for lack of article iii standing appellees did not file an answer to the surviving portion of the first amended complaint within ten days after the court order.
meanwhile,chorosevic submitted an amended motion to certify a class action.the newly proposed class consisted of all persons who used the choices plan as a secondary insurer from june,to january.in june,the district court denied class certification because the proposed class failed to satisfy the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure a and.
appellees failure to file an answer to the surviving portion of the first amended complaint during a hearing on a motion to compel in november.chorosevic counsel brought this omission to the district court attention,and appellees filed a motion for leave to file answers out of time,explaining that the omission was the result of an inadvertent oversight.despite chorosevic opposition,the district court granted appellees leave to file answers out of time.the court noted that it could not find that chorosevic suffered any prejudice from the delay and that defendant failure to answer was not a result of bad faith,but rather the result of excusable neglect.
chorosevic and appellees filed motions for summary judgment on the remaining claims in december.while the summary judgment motion was pending,chorosevic requested leave to file,in essence,a third motion for class certification based on newly discovered evidence that united incorrectly calculated secondary benefits for other plans with similar provisions.the district court denied the motion to reopen the class certification question,explaining that the new evidence did not cure the problems identified by the court in the two prior orders denying class certification.
the district court granted summary judgment for appellees on chorosevic remaining claims and denied chorosevic summary judgment motion.the district court concluded that chorosevic failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the choices plan barred his a b claim to recover benefits owed to him.with regard to chorosevic a claim for breach of fiduciary duty,the court noted an problem but held that chorosevic claim failed as a matter of law because he was essentially requesting an injunction to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money past due,which the supreme court disallowed under a in life annuity ins.knudson,d.
chorosevic appeals the district court orders granting summary judgment,granting appellees leave to file answers out of time,denying class discovery,denying class certification,and denying alteration of the orders denying class certification.
iii.summary judgment 
the district court granted summary judgment because of chorosevic failure to exhaust available administrative remedies under the choices plan.chorosevic contends that he exhausted his administrative remedies through the november letter to united,his remedies should be deemed exhausted due to united failures to follow its own appeals procedures,and the exhaustion requirement is inapplicable because further appeals would have been futile.exhaustion is a threshold legal issue we review de novo.kinkead bell.sickness accident disability benefit plan,cir.
exhaustion of administrative remedies 
where a claimant fails to pursue and exhaust administrative remedies that are clearly required under a particular erisa plan,his claim for relief is barred.layes mead,cir.exhaustion of available administrative remedies enables employers and plans to obtain full information about a claim for benefits,to compile an adequate record,and to make a reasoned decision,back danka,cir.the process is of substantial benefit to reviewing courts,because it gives them a factual predicate upon which to proceed.id.
chorosevic alleges that appellees violated the choices plan provision by failing to reimburse him for expenses from the benefits reserve,the money that the choices plan saved by being chorosevic secondary insurer instead of his primary insurer.the parties refer to this as the banked money issue.specifically,chorosevic contends that appellees owe him for services rendered in june and for services rendered in august chorosevic does not dispute that the deadline for appealing the denial of benefits expired on approximately february,for the claim and april,for the claim.as such,we turn to the correspondence prior to those dates.
chorosevic argues that the november letter from chorosevic to united satisfied the exhaustion requirement.in that letter,chorosevic detailed the charges her husband incurred for surgery on august,and specifically requested that united pay immediately.appellees,on the other hand,contend that this letter did not raise the banked money issue.appellees interpret the november letter as challenging united procedure of calculating the amount saved by using bcbs provider discounts instead of united provider discounts.chorosevic responds,and we agree,that chorosevic raised the banked money issue when she stated that united saves money as the secondary carrier and that money should be used to pay any remaining charges in full,if the secondary carrier does not pay them.the substance of the november letter is what matters,not whether chorosevic used the words,banked money.
nonetheless,the november letter does not overcome the exhaustion defense,because chorosevic did not appeal or even reference the claims that her husband now asserts in this lawsuit.it is that when exhaustion is clearly required under the terms of an erisa benefits plan,the plan beneficiary failure to exhaust her administrative remedies bars her from asserting any unexhausted claims in federal court.burds union pac,cir emphasis added see also wolf shopmen pension fund,cir section a of erisa does not require either issue or theory exhaustion it requires only claim exhaustion.the november letter explains in detail the in expenses and explicitly requests payment of in contrast,the letter does not reference,let alone describe,the or claims.indeed,the letter does not mention any other expenses or benefits that were improperly processed.furthermore,chorosevic attached the eob for claim but not the eobs for the and claims.in light of these facts,we conclude that the november letter did not put appellees on notice of the specific claims pursued in this and claims.as such,the november letter did not satisfy the exhaustion requirement with regard to the and claims.
the only other correspondence prior to the deadline was the bibby letter,in which bibby acknowledged that united should have paid the claim and stated that united is reviewing your other claims as well.without citing any authority or a legal theory for the court to apply,chorosevic argues that the bibby letter demonstrates that he exhausted his administrative appeals.he argues that the bibby letter flies in the face of appellee position that chorosevic needed to take additional steps to exhaust with respect to those other claims.
giving chorosevic the benefit of the doubt,we interpret his argument as a claim of estoppel.the principle of estoppel declares that a party who makes a representation that misleads another person,who then reasonably relies on that representation to his detriment,may not deny that representation.farley benefit trust life ins,cir.chorosevic argument fails as a matter of law because chorosevic has not offered any evidence that he relied on the bibby letter to his detriment.there is no indication that,but for bibby representations,he would have exhausted available administrative appeals,filed a second appeal within the limitations period.see gallegos sinai med,cir rejecting plaintiff estoppel claim because she has not shown that but for her insurer representations she would have filed an administrative appeal within the plan limitations period.brant principal life disability ins,cir unpublished per curiam stating that an equitable estoppel claim based on an erisa plan fiduciary misrepresentation requires evidence showing reasonable and detrimental reliance or extraordinary circumstances.as such,this is not a case where an insurance company or claims administrator misled a claimant into procedurally defaul
