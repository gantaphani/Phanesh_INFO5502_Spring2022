fernando and valerie chapa,individually and as guardians of dakota fuller dakota,sued the united states of america alleging that it was legally responsible,through its employees,for permanent injuries dakota suffered after being shaken by his biological father.the chapas alleged that three physicians at a united states military hospital,including richard garri,were negligent and caused dakota injuries.after a bench trial,the district court held that the two other physicians did not deviate from the generally recognized medical standard of care but that garri failure to review dakota medical records during an emergency room visit constituted a deviation from the medical standard of care.however,the district court held that garri deviation was not the proximate cause of dakota injuries and entered judgment in favor of the united states.the chapas only challenge the district court decision that garri deviation was not the proximate cause of dakota injuries.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
background 
dakota was born on august.medical personnel at ehrling bergquist hospital bergquist on the offutt air force base in nebraska treated dakota on six occasions between his birth and december.the chapas base this suit on four of these visits.on september,dakota parents brought him to the emergency department at bergquist after his mother accidentally gave him a overdose of sudafed.lyle vanderschaaf called the poison control center,observed dakota for two hours,and released him to his parents.on october,dakota parents took him for a routine.nurse practitioner lynn murphy inquired as to the cause of a small bruise on dakota forehead.his parents stated that most likely a toddler at dakota daycare inflicted the bruise.on october,dakota father brought him to the emergency department,claiming that he had jerked dakota by the left arm while trying to lift him.garri diagnosed dakota with nursemaid elbow.dakota father told garri that dakota had no medical history,and garri did not request dakota medical records.after an of dakota left arm did not detect any fractures,garri released dakota to his father.
on december,dakota father again brought dakota to the bergquist emergency department.upon his arrival at the hospital,dakota had no pulse and was not breathing.after the emergency department personnel resuscitated and stabilized dakota,they transferred him to children hospital of omaha children hospital.at children hospital,the physicians diagnosed dakota as having syndrome and determined that dakota suffered brain trauma the day before arriving at children hospital.as a result of these injuries,dakota has severe permanent brain damage,blindness and seizures.
in connection with the events of december,dakota father pled no contest to a charge of attempted felony child abuse and received eighteen months probation.fernando and valerie chapa,dakota grandparents,took custody of dakota upon his release from children hospital and later adopted him.in august the chapas filed a complaint against the united states under the federal tort claims act,et,for negligence,carelessness and medical malpractice for the failure of the bergquist medical personnel to diagnose and treat child abuse.
during a bench trial,john tilelli,the chapas expert medical witness,testified that,in his opinion,the care provided during all three of dakota visits to bergquist before the december,incident fell below the generally recognized medical standard of care.specifically,with respect to the treatment by garri,tilelli testified that all medical practitioners have a duty to review all medical data available to them,and garri deviated from this medical standard of care.donald uzendoski,the united states expert medical witness,testified that while a patient medical history must be obtained,there is generally no requirement to obtain the entire medical record when a patient visits the emergency department.
the district court also considered evidence concerning whether garri failure to review dakota records was the proximate cause of dakota injuries.vanderschaaf testified about the standard procedure for reporting suspected child abuse at bergquist.a physician normally contacts the family advocacy office family advocacy with his or her suspicions of child abuse.based on the severity of the report,family advocacy personnel either report to the emergency department immediately or schedule a consultation within one week.although the record does not reflect that tilelli ever worked with family advocacy,he testified based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty that reporting dakota previous injuries to family advocacy would have prevented his latest injuries and that if there had been effective intervention,dakota father more likely than not would not have shaken dakota on december.in addition,chapa testified that if she had known of dakota three hospital visits and had suspected child abuse,she would have done everything in her power to have taken care of him and sought custody of him.the district court,however,excluded chapa testimony,sustaining the united states relevance objection.
the district court held that all medical personnel who treated dakota acted within the generally recognized medical standard of care,with the exception of garri in connection with dakota elbow injury.the district court found that garri did not act within the medical standard of care when he failed to request and review dakota medical records which were located yards from the emergency department and which he could have retrieved in five minutes.given the ready accessibility of the records and the nature of the injury for which garri treated dakota,the district court found that garri deviated from the medical standard of care in that respect.
the district court then concluded that the chapas failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that garri failure to review dakota records was the proximate cause of dakota injuries because they did not present evidence that garri would have done anything beyond reporting any suspicion to family advocacy or that,if reported,family advocacy would have taken steps sufficient to prevent dakota injuries.without any testimony as to what course of action family advocacy would have taken after receiving a report from garri,the district court held that there was only wishful speculation as to whether any action by family advocacy would have prevented the injuries.finding that the chapas did not prove proximate cause by a preponderance of the evidence,the district court entered judgment for the united states.the chapas then filed a motion for a new trial or,in the alternative,to alter or amend the judgment,arguing that tilelli testimony satisfied their burden of proof.the district court denied this motion and reaffirmed its holding.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,the chapas argue that the district court erred in utilizing the but for test in its proximate cause determination and in concluding that the chapas did not satisfy their burden of proving proximate cause.because of this incorrect holding,the chapas argue that the district court improperly denied their motion for a new trial or,in the alternative,to alter or amend the judgment.we review a district court denial of this motion for an abuse of discretion.dairy farmers of,travelers ins,cir.an abuse of discretion will only be found if the district court judgment was based on clearly erroneous factual findings or erroneous legal conclusions.margolies mccleary,cir quotation omitted.for the following reasons,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the chapas motion.
proximate cause test 
when a plaintiff alleges professional negligence in a medical malpractice claim,he must demonstrate the generally recognized medical standard of care,that there was a deviation from that standard by the defendant,and that the deviation was the proximate cause of the plaintiff alleged injuries.snyder contemporary obstetrics gynecology,the plaintiff must prove each element by a preponderance of the evidence.id.since this appeal only concerns the district court determination that garri deviation from the generally r
