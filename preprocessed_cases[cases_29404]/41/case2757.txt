davila,who was a pilot employed by delta,injured his lower back in december,when he accidentally fell over a planter.he sought medical treatment for his injury,and was prescribed medication that disqualified him for flight duty.nonetheless,he asserts that he chose to undergo an faa physical examination on january,in an attempt to obtain a medical certificate,which was necessary to qualify him for a return to flight status.on may,the faa approved him for this certificate with the caveat that b ecause of your history of low back condition,operation of aircraft is prohibited at any time new symptoms or adverse changes occur or for hours after use of medication.
on july,davila informed delta of his flight eligibility.however,he said that he was still experiencing back problems and taking medication that prohibited him from piloting a commercial aircraft.accordingly,on august,delta approved him for disability payments for months.on february,these benefits were extended for two additional months,until april.on march,davila was reexamined by jose berrios,an aviation medical examiner,who found that he was not qualified for a medical certificate.based on this finding,delta payment of disability benefits continued past april.
davila alleges that on his own initiative he again sought a medical certificate from berrios on january.davila says that although he was found to be qualified,berrios told him that the certificate could not issue because of his previous denial and that the faa would need to approve and issue the certificate.importantly,davila asserts that instead of marking the space on the relevant form corresponding to the disposition no certificate for further evaluation,berrios secretary accidentally checked the box corresponding to has been issued medical certificate.delta,by contrast,says that the secretary checked this box because davila actually received the certificate.on june,the faa approved davila medical certification,but repeated its caveat concerning the operation of an aircraft during or periods of medication.however,davila asserts that he never physically received the certificate.he also says that his back problems and his attendant need for medication persisted.
davila adds that in this precise sequence of his voluntary pursuit of a medical certificate to the secretary typographical repeated,and that on october,the faa advised him that he was.davila asserts that he finally received a certificate on november,and that he notified delta of its issuance on november.
after receiving this notification,delta had davila examined by its own physician,michael berry,who found him to be qualified for flight status.however,berry further reported that davila had withheld from delta the fact that he had possessed a medical certificate since may.delta began an investigation into whether davila had defrauded it since that time,and deferred his reinstatement pending the conclusion of its inquiry.because he had not been restored to active flight status,davila filed a grievance with delta on august,the pay status grievance,but that grievance was denied on october.despite this denial,however,on may,delta settled the grievance and awarded davila back pay for the period between december,and may.within one hour following the parties agreement to this settlement,delta fired davila,justifying this action on the grounds that he had fraudulently obtained disability benefits since january.
davila filed a grievance pertaining to his termination on may,the discharge grievance,but this second grievance was denied on june.the following day davila appealed his discharge to delta system board of adjustment system board which ultimately found on april,that his firing was justified,as delta had submitted clear and compelling evidence that davila intentionally defrauded the company.after the system board issued its adverse ruling,davila petitioned the district court pursuant to q and to vacate its decision davila i,arguing that the board had ignored the settlement agreement.delta filed a motion to dismiss,which the court granted,reasoning that there are only limited grounds on which a rla arbitration award may be vacated,and that none of those circumstances were present.the district court then said that davila had presented no grounds that would support the jurisdiction of this court over this matter.davila appealed the order of dismissal to this court,and we issued a summary affirmance on the basis of the district court opinion.
subsequently,on july,davila filed an eeoc charge in which he alleged that his termination violated the ada.the eeoc dismissed davila charge on may,stating that it had been unable to find a violation.however,it did issue davila a right to sue letter.davila then filed this action in the state circuit court for the seventeenth judicial circuit,in and for broward county davila ii.he advanced one claim sounding in breach of contract,in which he asserted that his discharge violated the grievance settlement agreement,and a second claim that delta had violated the ada by firing him.delta promptly removed the action to the united states district court for the southern district of florida,and in lieu of an answer,moved that court to dismiss both of davila claims on res judicata and timeliness grounds.it also argued that davila breach of contract claim was preempted by the rla.the district court dismissed both claims,reasoning that they were precluded under the doctrine of res judicata 
the doctrine of res judicata,or claim preclusion,will bar a subsequent action if the prior decision was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction there was a final judgment on the merits the parties were identical in both suits and the prior and present causes of action are the same.jang united techs,cir quoting israel disc.bank,entin,cir.importantly,this bar pertains not only to claims that were raised in the prior action,see,but also to claims that could have been raised previously.trustmark ins.eslu,cir res judicata bars the filing of claims which were raised or could have been raised in an earlier proceeding quoting ragsdale rubbermaid,cir.in determining whether the prior and present causes of action are the same,we must decide whether the actions arise out of the same nucleus of operative fact,or are based upon the same factual predicate.in re piper aircraft,cir quotation omitted,cert.denied,tdy,kaiser aerospace,d.
on appeal,davila argues that res judicata does not bar either of his claims because the district court dismissal in davila i was not on the merits,as the court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute.in this vein,he says that the court lacked the power in davila ii to recharacterize its holding in davila i as having been on the merits.he also argues that his ada claim is not precluded because lacking a right to sue letter,he could not have brought this claim in davila i and it entails different elements than the breach of contract claim at issue in davila
