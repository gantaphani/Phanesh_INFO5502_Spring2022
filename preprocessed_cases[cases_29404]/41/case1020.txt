uneek lowe instituted this employment discrimination case against hamilton county department of job and family services hcjfs alleging race,age,and disability discrimination,as well as retaliation.the district court granted hcjfs summary judgment on lowe race and age discrimination claims,but denied hcjfs summary judgment on lowe disability discrimination and retaliation claims.hcjfs appeals the denial of summary judgment on these claims.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court denial of summary judgment.
background 
uneek lowe was hired by hcjfs as a medicaid eligibility technician on january.her main job duty was to determine the ongoing eligibility of medicaid beneficiaries.lowe has a history of depression and,in,was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.in may,lowe requested that hcjfs grant her reasonable accommodations for her disability.over the next two years,the relationship between lowe and hcjfs deteriorated as lowe clashed with her supervisors,received her first unfavorable performance review,took several leaves of absence pursuant to the family and medical leave act fmla,was twice transferred to new but similar positions,and became the subject of hcjfs disciplinary proceedings.finally,in a letter dated july,hcjfs terminated lowe while she was on fmla leave.
prior to her termination,on june,lowe filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging race and disability discrimination and retaliation.on november,the eeoc issued lowe a letter based on her complaint.on december,lowe filed an additional charge of discrimination with the eeoc,alleging retaliation following her initial complaint.she also filed an identical charge with the ohio civil rights commission,which she later withdrew.on february,lowe commenced this action pro se in federal district court based on her initial eeoc complaint and letter.on june,the eeoc issued a second letter to lowe,based on her second charge of discrimination.following her termination,lowe amended her complaint to include allegations regarding her termination and a number of additional claims.
hcjfs filed a motion to dismiss,or alternatively for summary judgment,arguing,in part,that it was an arm of the state of ohio entitled to eleventh amendment sovereign immunity on all of lowe claims.although the district court granted hcjfs summary judgment on a number of lowe claims,it concluded that hcjfs was not entitled to sovereign immunity and denied summary judgment on lowe disability discrimination and retaliation claims.hcjfs appeals the district court denial of summary judgment on these claims.hcjfs argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because it enjoys sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment lowe failed to exhaust the required administrative remedies and the district court erred in finding that lowe was qualified for her job as part of its determination that lowe had set forth a prima facie case of disability discrimination.
ii.analysis 
subject matter jurisdiction 
generally,the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not immediately appealable.however,we have jurisdiction over the district court denial of sovereign immunity to hcjfs under the collateral order doctrine.because sovereign immunity is an immunity from trial,not just a defense to liability on the merits,the denial of a claim of sovereign immunity is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine as a final decision,pursuant to.holy see,cir quoting keller cent.bank of,cir see also aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,we hold that states and state entities that claim to be arms of the state may take advantage of the collateral order doctrine to appeal a district court order denying a claim of eleventh amendment immunity.
we do not have jurisdiction over the other two issues raised by hcjfs on appeal because they do not fall under the collateral order doctrine nor are they inextricably intertwined with the issue of sovereign immunity.the small category of decisions that fall under the collateral order doctrine includes only decisions that are conclusive,that resolve important questions separate from the merits,and that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.swint chambers county comm n,citing cohen beneficial indus.loan.hcjfs arguments that lowe did not exhaust the required administrative remedies nor make out a prima facie case of disability discrimination do not meet these requirements and thus do not qualify for appellate review under the collateral order doctrine.therefore,we can review those issues at this interlocutory stage only if we exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction.
we decline to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over these two issues because they are not inextricably intertwined with the district court denial of sovereign immunity,and a review of these issues is not necessary to ensure meaningful review of the denial of sovereign immunity.see swint,at.this circuit has interpreted inextricably intertwined to mean that the resolution of the appealable issue necessarily and unavoidably decides the nonappealable issue.summers leis,cir quoting vakilian shaw,cir see,at exercising pendent appellate jurisdiction because the issue turned on the same determination of whether a foreign sovereign immunities act exception applied davenport causey,cir finding that the issue of municipal liability was inextricably intertwined with a determination because the municipality could be liable only if its employees committed a constitutional violation.but see.bell.climax,cir exercising pendent appellate jurisdiction because it would be a waste of judicial resources not to hear the other claims now even though the eleventh amendment claim can be resolved without resolving either of the other claims.whether hcjfs is an arm of the state has no bearing on the merits of the other issues raised by hcjfs,and we can meaningfully review hcjfs claim of sovereign immunity without addressing these issues.therefore,we do not exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over these issues and decline to address them further on appeal.see brotherton cleveland,cir declining to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over issue of liability when reviewing denial of eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.

eleventh amendment sovereign immunity 
the desire to protect the solvency and dignity of the states motivates the doctrine of eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.see hess port auth,ernst rising,cir en banc,at.the doctrine flows from the nature of sovereignty itself as well as the tenth and eleventh amendments to the united states constitution.ernst,at.however,it comes with a host of exceptions.id.one of the more prominent exceptions to the doctrine is that state instrumentalities that properly are characterized as political subdivisions,rather than arms of the state,are not entitled to sovereign immunity.see id.at.
lowe disability discrimination claims arise under title i of the americans with disabilities act ada,which prohibits certain employers from discriminating on the basis of disability.see.states are immune to suits for money damages under title i because congress exceeded its fourteenth amendment enforcement powers in enacting those provisions and therefore did not properly abrogate the states sovereign immunity from such suits.bd.of trs.of the of garrett,see also robinson of akron sch.of law,cir.however,political subdivisions of the states are not entitled to sovereign immunity from such suits.see garrett,at t he eleventh amendment does not extend its immunity to units of local government.these entities are subject to private claims for damages under the ada without congress ever having to rely on of the fourteenth amendment to render them so.citation omitted.
whether hcjfs is immune from suit thus turns on whether it is properly characterized as a political subdivision and thus not immune or an arm of the state and thus immune.in order to make this determination,we must evaluate four factors the state of ohio potential legal liability for a judgment against hcjfs the language employed by state courts and state statutes to describe hcjfs,as well as the degree of control and veto power which the state has over hcjfs whether state or local officials appoint hcjf s board members and whether hcjfs functions fall under the traditional purview of state or local government.see ernst,at citing hess,at.we conclude that hcjfs has not met its burden to show that it is entitled to eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.
state potential legal liability for judgment against the entity 
the state potential legal liability for a judgment against the defendant is the foremost factor to consider in our sovereign immunity analysis.ernst,at.in analyzing this factor,we focus our inquiry on the state treasury potential legal liability for the judgment,not whether the state treasury will pay for the judgment in that case.id.citing regents of the of cal.doe.hcjfs concedes that it will pay directly any judgment awarded to lowe.however,it contends that the state will reimburse it for any such damages because lowe primary job duties were to help administer state and federal benefits programs and her wages were funded largely through a system of state and federal reimbursement.hcjfs argues that this factor weighs in its favor based on this reimbursement theory.this argument is unavailing in two regards.first,it misconstrues the relevant inquiry,which is whether the state is potentially legally liable for a judgment against the entity seeking immunity,not whether the state or another party is obligated to reimburse or indemnify the entity for damages incurred.second,even if we were to accept hcjfs reimbursement theory as determinative,hcjfs has not met its burden to show that the state necessarily will reimburse it for damages awarded to lowe.thus,this factor weighs against a finding that hcjfs is an arm of the state.
hcjfs argument misses the analytic focus of this factor,which is the state potential legal liability for a judgment against the entity,not the state willingness or obligation to reimburse the entity for damages paid as a result of the judgment.hcjfs concedes that it would pay directly any judgment awarded to lowe,so its entire argument rests on a reimbursement theory.however,this line of argument is foreclosed by the supreme court analysis in doe.there,an employee brought a claim against the university of california,alleging that the university reneged on its promise to hire him to work at the lawrence livermore national laboratory,which the university operated pursuant to a contract with the federal government.doe,at.the ninth circuit denied the university eleventh amendment sovereign immunity because,under that contract,the federal government had indemnified the university from paying any damages that would have resulted from the suit.id.at.the supreme court reversed,emphasizing that it was a state legal liability for judgments against a state agency that was the important consideration,not the presence or absence of a third party undertaking to indemnify the agency.id.at.likening the federal government reimbursement of the university damages to liability insurance purchased by the university,the court found that it is the entity potential legal liability,rather than its ability or inability to require a third party to reimburse it,or to discharge the liability in the first instance,that is relevant.id.at.
the court determination that potential reimbursement from a third party was irrelevant to its sovereign immunity analysis cut in favor of granting sovereign immunity in doe,but it cuts against hcjfs here.in doe,the judgment would have been directly enforceable against the state,and the court held that reimbursement by the federal government did not change the fact that the state was the entity which was legally liable for damages.here,any judgment will be enforceable only against hcjfs,not the state of ohio.consistent with doe,that the state may reimburse hcjfs for these damages does not change the fact that hcjfs is the party legally liable for the judgment.the question of legal liability is paramount because it is an indicator of the relationship between the state and the entity asserting sovereign immunity.id.indeed,the doe court warned against convert ing the inquiry into a formalistic question of ultimate financial liability.id.because hcjfs is the entity that will pay directly any judgment awarded to lowe,this factor weighs against a finding that hcjfs enjoys state sovereign immunity see,at denying facility sovereign immunity and noting that because county,not state,would directly pay judgment against the entity,this important factor weighs against sovereign immunity.
further,even if we accepted hcjfs reimbursement argument,hcjfs has not carried its burden to show that the state actually will reimburse it for damages awarded to lowe.hcjfs argument rests heavily on the fact that lowe job duties related to the administration of state and federal public benefits programs.based on this,hcjfs contends that the state statutes related to the provision of these benefits require the state to reimburse it for any damages awarded to lowe,and points to two statutes in particular.
despite hcjfs strong assertions,however,it has not pointed to anything that demonstrates conclusively that a judgment in an employment discrimination suit would be reimbursable as either an administrative expense or public assistance expenditure under the ohio statutory scheme.hcjfs relies chiefly on two statutes to support its argument.first,hcjfs directs us to a statute which vests the authority to establish eligibility for medical assistance programs in county job and family services departments.see ohio.this statute also establishes that t he county shall be reimbursed for administrative expenditures and e xpenditures for medical assistance shall be made from funds appropriated to the department of job and family services for public assistance subsidies.id.
however,this reimbursement provision is subject to several other statutory provisions that hcjfs fails to address and which undermine its position.for example,hcjfs claim that these programs are funded fully by federal and state monies is undermined by a provision specifically providing for county contributions for these public benefits programs.see id.b.similarly,its claim that the state would be obligated to reimburse it is undermined by a provision providing a mechanism for the state to reject reimbursement claims that exceed a predetermined maximum amount.see id.hcjfs next cites to a statute that states that a ll moneys received by each county from the state,or from the federal government for public benefits programs shall be considered appropriated for the purposes for which such moneys were received.id.however,nothing in this statute indicates that such funds could be used by hcjfs for damages paid in an employment discrimination suit.indeed,hcjfs has provided no factual or statutory support for its contention that damages paid to lowe would qualify as either administrative expenses or public benefits expenditures thus,even if we were to accept the flawed reimbursement argument,hcjfs still would have failed to carry its burden on this factor 
indeed,in cases where a state instrumentality has been found to be entitled to sovereign immunity based on state liability for a judgment,much more concrete evidence of liability has been provided.in ernst,where a group of judges sued a state retirement system set up for judges and other statewide officials,this court found that michigan would be liable for a judgment against the retirement system because of a state statute that required the legislature to fund the retirement system with the amount of money needed to reconcile the estimated appropriation made in the previous fiscal year with the actual appropriation needed to adequately fund the retirement system for the previous fiscal year.ernst,at alterations in original quoting.comp.laws.the state constitution also treated this duty as a contractual obligation owed by the state to each retiree.id.quoting.const.in holmes marion county office of family children,cir,an case cited favorably by hcjfs,the seventh circuit held that an indiana county office was part of state government,rather than local government,and therefore entitled to state sovereign immunity.id.at.but in doing so,the court relied on state statutes that excepted personnel and administrative costs from the definition of child services and required all personnel and administrative costs for such offices to come exclusively from the state treasury.id.at.the court also relied on a state supreme court case that held that such offices were arms of the state.see id.at.in contrast,hcjfs has not demonstrated that ohio state treasury would be subject to potential legal liability if hcjfs did not have the money to cover the judgment.ernst,at quoting doe,at 
hcjfs has not met its burden to show that the state is potentially legally liable for a judgment against it,the foremost factor in determining whether it is entitled to eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.furthermore,as discussed below,the other three factors we must consider similarly weigh against finding that hcjfs is an arm of the state.
language referencing the entity and degree of state control over the entity 
this factor also weighs against hcjfs because county job and family services departments are referred to and treated as local entities in ohio statutes and case law and are controlled primarily by county boards of commissioners.in arguing that this factor weighs in its favor,hcjfs again focuses on the fact that the substance of lowe job duties dealt with state and federal statutes and regulations.however,hcjfs has not demonstrated how this translates into state control of hcjfs.indeed,hcjfs concedes that hamilton county controlled the time and place of lowe work and a page from hcjfs own website in the record refers to hcjfs as a department of hamilton county government.even more importantly,ohio statutes and case law consistently refer to and treat county job and family services departments as local bodies and do not demonstrate extensive and detailed control of these departments by the state.ernst,at.
the statutory framework clearly demonstrates that hcjfs and other such departments are treated as local entities and are controlled primarily by county governments.the statutes that establish and govern the county departments of job and family services fall under title iii of the ohio legislative code,entitled counties.see ohio hutsell sayre,cir noting that the university of kentucky was created under a chapter of the state legislative code entitled,in part,state universities and colleges,in support of finding that university enjoyed sovereign immunity.state law requires that i n each county there shall be a county department of job and family services,but grants the local board of county commissioners the authority to appoint the county director of job and family services.ohio.although state law prescribes a range of duties to the county departments,t he powers and duties of a county department of job and family services are,and shall be exercised and performed,under the control and direction of the board of county commissioners.id.b.
the county director of job and family services is given full charge of the department,u nder the control and direction of the board of county commissioners.ohio.the county director is empowered,with the approval of the board of county commissioners,to appoint various assistants,superintendents,and employees and fix their compensation.
ohio op.att y,wl,at ohio,second alteration in original holding that a board of county commissioners can authorize the county department of job and family services to enter into contracts relating to its family services duties and workforce development activities.indeed,the statutes establishing state funding of these county departments repeatedly reference the transfer of money directly to individual counties,rather than the departments themselves,which suggests that each of these entities is considered a part of the government of the county in which it operates.see ohio a ll moneys received by each county from the state id.t he county shall be reimbursed.
the fact that ohio statutes refer to entities like hcjfs as part of county government strongly weighs against affording hcjfs sovereign immunity.counties are quintessentially local bodies,not entitled to state sovereign immunity almost by definition.see doe,at ultimately,the question whether a particular state agency has the same kind of independent status as a county or is instead an arm of the state is a question of federal law.emphasis added.the supreme court has repeatedly refused to extend sovereign immunity to counties.this is true even when such entities exercise a slice of state power.ins.of chatham county,citations omitted quoting lake country estates,tahoe reg l planning agency,see also garrett,at t he eleventh amendment does not extend its immunity to units of local government,at holding that sovereign immunity does not extend to counties and similar municipal corporations quoting healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle.
moreover,in two different circumstances,the state supreme court has found that agencies like hcjfs should be treated as county,not state,agencies.in rankin cuyahoga county department of children and family services,ohio,the plaintiff sued a county department,its director,and one of its employees after a child was sexually abused while in the department custody.the state supreme court found that the department was entitled to governmental immunity under ohio immunity statute,not under the eleventh amendment.id.at citing ohio.the court specifically found that the department was a political subdivision.id.at.the court also noted that t he manifest statutory purpose of ohio immunity statute is the preservation of the fiscal integrity of political subdivisions.id.at first alteration in original quoting wilson stark county dep t of human,ohio see also brenner cuyahoga county dep t of children family,wl,at ohio,applying rankin to reverse denial of statutory governmental immunity.indeed,hcjfs seems to fall squarely under the definition of political subdivision given in the immunity statute a municipal corporation,township,county,school district,or other body corporate and politic responsible for governmental activities in a geographic area smaller than that of the state.ohio f.although county departments of job and family services are not contained in the list of political subdivisions included in the statute,see id,that list is and the statute includes in its list of governmental functions of political subdivisions t he operation of a job and family services department or agency,including,but not limited to,the provision of assistance to aged and infirm persons and to persons who are indigent,id.c m.
similarly,in lucas county department of job family services,ohio,the state supreme court addressed conflicting deadlines for filing an appeal of an agency decision.the court ruled that a county department of job and family services was a county agency,and not a state agency,and thus the shorter deadline applicable to county agencies applied to the department.id.at.in doing so,the court distinguished one statute that applied to entities considered arms of the government of the state,id.at quoting ohio a,and another statute that applied to political subdivisions such as counties,id.citing ohio.the court determined that the political subdivision statute was the law applicable to the county department.
it is clear that ohio law treats entities like hcjfs as local bodies,not arms of the state.moreover,local officials exercise greater direct control over hcjfs than does the state of ohio.accordingly,this factor weighs a
