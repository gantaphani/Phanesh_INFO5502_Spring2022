under the medicare act,a hospital classification as rural or urban may affect the amount of reimbursement that the hospital receives for providing medical services,as well as the hospital access to certain medical programs.but a hospital can reasonably be viewed as rural in some respects,it is situated in a rural area and attends to the needs of a rural population and urban in other respects,it needs to attract trained staff from nearby urban areas and to do so must pay urban wage rates.to accommodate this possibility,the medicare statute,through a complicated classification process,permits a hospital to be classified as urban for some purposes and rural for others.one such statutory provision,d e commonly referred to as part of section permits some hospitals that are geographically located in an urban area to be designated as rural f or purposes of this subsection,subsection d.they may be able to obtain certain benefits,such as easier access to a more favorable drug pricing program,that would not ordinarily be available to them if they were treated as urban.however,another provision of the same subsection d,specifically,d,creates a process by which a medicare geographic classification review board mgcrb can redesignate hospitals to a different area from that to which they have been otherwise designated,in order to receive a different wage reimbursement rate.the result is that a hospital that is classified as rural in order to obtain favorable drug pricing can contemporaneously apply to be designated to an urban area for wage reimbursement purposes.
notwithstanding these statutory provisions,in the secretary of health and human services the secretary issued a regulation,known as the reclassification rule,a iii,which provided that a hospital that has been reclassified from urban to rural under subsection d e may not thereafter receive an additional reclassification by the mgcrb for reclassification as urban under subsection d.because the regulation contravenes the plain language of the statute,it exceeds the secretary authority and must be held invalid,for the reasons stated below.
we begin,as we must,with the text of the statute.the medicare act title xviii of the social security act,et provides for hospitals to be reimbursed for serving medicare beneficiaries.see f bellevue hosp.ctr.leavitt,cir.hospitals reimbursements are calculated based on rates that are prospectively determined for a fiscal year,not on the hospitals actual costs.see d bellevue,at.to calculate these rates,the secretary first establishes a nationwide standardized rate for hospitals located in urban or rural areas.see d a d.hospitals are initially classified to urban or rural areas based on their geographical location.see d d.the secretary then multiplies the standardized rate by a wage index that accounts for geographical variation in costs.see d h,e.the wage index reflects the relationship between the local average of hospital rates and the relevant national average.see d h,e.
as initially promulgated,however,this reimbursement determination system yielded inequitable results for some hospitals,for example when a hospital in one area competed for the same labor pool as hospitals in a nearby,larger urban area but received a lower reimbursement based on its geographical area wage index.robert wood johnson.hosp.thompson,cir.therefore,congress in amended the medicare act to create the mgcrb.see,h codified at d.the mgcrb considers hospitals applications to change the hospital geographic classification for purposes of determining the hospital average standardized reimbursement amount or wage index.d c i.
pursuant to the medicare statute,see d d i,the secretary publishes guidelines for the mgcrb use in making reclassification decisions.see et.according to these guidelines,a hospital must generally meet three criteria to obtain an mgcrb reclassification.first,the hospital must demonstrate proximity to the area to which it seeks redesignation within miles for an urban hospital and miles for a rural hospital.see b.second,the hospital must show that its wages meet certain benchmarks relative to the wages of the area to which it seeks redesignation for an urban hospital and for a rural hospital.see d iv e.third,the hospital must demonstrate that its wages meet certain benchmarks relative to the wages of its existing classification area for an urban hospital and for a rural hospital.see d iii c.therefore,a hospital ability to reclassify through the mgcrb process may though need not be affected by its designation as urban or rural.
furthermore,a rural hospital is eligible to be treated as a rural referral center rrc pursuant to another provision of the medicare statute,see d c i.the rrc program was established to take into account the special needs of certain rural hospitals,such as institutions.see id.hospitals with rrc status are exempted from the proximity requirement of the mgcrb process,see a i,and any hospital that was ever an rrc is exempt from the requirement that its wages meet certain benchmarks relative to those of its existing classification area.see d i.
particularly relevant to this case is the fact that rrcs more easily qualify for preferable drug pricing.the drug discount program,enacted by section of the veterans health care act of,enables certain hospitals to buy covered outpatient drugs at favorable prices.since,a rural hospital that qualifies as an rrc may more readily access the drug discount program.patient protection and affordable care act,stat.specifically,a hospital disproportionate share adjustment percentage,which is based on the percentage of patients that a hospital serves,must generally be in order for a hospital to participate in the drug discount program,see a l ii but an rrc is eligible to participate in the drug discount program if its disproportionate share adjustment percentage is as low as,see a o.the classification of a hospital as an rrc which in turn requires the hospital to be classified as rural may therefore permit an otherwise ineligible hospital to participate in the drug discount program.and,any such hospital may retain its rrc status even after reclassification to an urban wage index area.medicare program geographical classification review board procedures and criteria,a hospital that is reclassified from a rural or other urban area only for purposes of the wage index is not considered urban for any other purpose than its labor market area designation.
while the mgcrb process provides a mechanism for or seek reclassification to areas with higher wage indices often,nearby urban areas,another amendment to the medicare statute permits certain hospitals geographically located in urban areas to be designated as rural for other purposes.this amendment was enacted in as section of the medicare,medicaid,and schip balanced budget refinement act of.section section a,the provision of section most here at issue,is codified at d e and reads in full 
a in d d is amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph 
e i for purposes of this subsection,not later than days after the receipt of an application in a form and manner determined by the secretary from a subsection d hospital described in clause ii,the secretary shall treat the hospital as being located in the rural area as defined in paragraph d of the state in which the hospital is located.
ii for purposes of clause i,a subsection d hospital described in this clause is a subsection d hospital that is located in an urban area as defined in paragraph d and satisfies any of the following criteria 
i the hospital is located in a rural census tract of a metropolitan statistical area as determined under the most recent modification of the goldsmith modification,originally published in the federal register on february.
ii the hospital is located in an area designated by any law or regulation of such state as a rural area or is designated by such state as a rural hospital.
iii the hospital would qualify as a rural,regional,or national referral center under paragraph c or as a sole community hospital under paragraph d if the hospital were located in a rural area.
iv the hospital meets such other criteria as the secretary may specify.
both sides in the instant litigation agree that this subsection in the statement f or purposes of this subsection,the secretary shall treat the hospital as being located in the rural area refers to d,which also contains the description of the mgcrb process.see d.
the conference report accompanying the legislation enacting section states,in relevant part,that section 
p rovides that a hospital in an urban area may apply to the secretary to be treated as if the hospital were located in a rural area of the state in which the hospital is located.hospitals qualifying under this section shall be eligible to qualify for all categories and designations available to rural hospitals,including sole community,medicare dependent,critical access,and referral centers.additionally,qualifying hospitals shall be eligible to apply to the medicare geographic reclassification review board for geographic reclassification to another area.the board shall regard such hospitals as rural and as entitled to the exceptions extended to referral centers and sole community hospitals,if such hospitals are so designated.
after section was passed,the secretary expressly recognized that this section might create an opportunity for some urban hospitals to take advantage of the mgcrb process by first seeking to be reclassified as rural under section and receiving the benefits afforded to rural hospitals and in turn seek reclassification through the mgcrb back to the urban area for purposes of their standardized amount and wage index and thus also receive the higher payments that might result from being treated as being located in an urban area.in response,the secretary promulgated the regulation challenged in the instant case the reclassification rule,which states,in relevant part,that a n urban hospital that has been granted redesignation as rural under the regulation implementing section can not receive an additional reclassification by the mgcrb based on this acquired rural status for a year in which such redesignation is in effect.see,a iii.in other words,a hospital that has been designated as rural pursuant to section a section hospital may not be reclassified by the mgcrb,unless it first cancels its rural status for the fiscal years for which it seeks reclassification.see.
against this background,we turn to the facts of this case,which are essentially undisputed.plaintiff lawrence memorial hospital lawrence is an acute care hospital located in new london,connecticut.lawrence geographic location for medicare reimbursement purposes was originally designated as part of the norwich new london,connecticut urban area.on july,lawrence sought reclassification under section from an urban to a rural hospital,as well as additional designation as an rrc.on august,the relevant authority,namely,the centers for medicare and medicaid services cmms,granted both of lawrence requests,and lawrence was recognized as a rural hospital effective july.immediately thereafter,however,on september,lawrence applied to the mgcrb,seeking reclassification for wage reimbursement purposes to the nassau suffolk,new york urban area,which had a higher wage index.since the grant of such request would seemingly violate the reclassification rule promulgated by the secretary,lawrence,on october,filed the instant action in the district court,seeking a preliminary injunction to enjoin the defendants consisting of the secretary,the administrator of cmms,and the chairman of the mgcrb from applying the secretary reclassification rule to lawrence mgcrb application.
on december,the district court denied lawrence motion for a preliminary injunction.consequently,on december,lawrence requested cancellation effectively under protest of its rural status under section.the request was approved on december,and the cancellation of rural status had the additional effect of cancelling lawrence rrc status.because lawrence disproportionate share adjustment factor for the purposes of the drug discount program is greater than the threshold for rrcs but less than the general threshold,lawrence thus became ineligible to participate in the drug discount program.on january,the mgcrb,having found that lawrence met all the relevant criteria,see supra,approved lawrence application to be reclassified to the nassausuffolk,new york urban area.
having thus been deprived by virtue of the reclassification rule of its eligibility to participate in the drug discount program,lawrence filed an amended complaint on march,seeking a declaration that the secretary regulatory scheme violates the medicare act and the administrative procedure act a permanent injunction,an order of mandamus,or both,prohibiting the secretary and other officials from applying the reclassification rule to any future mgcrb applications by lawrence and a permanent injunction,an order of mandamus,or both,ordering the secretary and other officials to consider plaintiff a to be reclassified to the nassau suffolk urban area and b to be a rural hospital and an rrc in june,both parties moved for summary judgment.on december,the district court granted the defendants motion and entered judgment in favor of defendants.
the district court provided the reasons for her ruling in a memorandum issued on december.the district court noted that t here do not appear to be any genuine issues of material fact here and determined that the parties disagreement over the proper interpretation of section would be analyzed under the framework set out by chevron,natural res.def.council.the district court reasoned that under chevron step,she held,requires the court to consider whether congress has clearly spoken in section as to whether the secretary is required to treat hospitals with acquired rural status as rural for the purposes of an application to the mgcrb for geographic classification,lawrence memorial hosp.burwell,wl,at,the statutory text was ambiguous,because section does not discuss the intersection of redesignation and geographic reclassification under the medicare act and does not address the standards by which the mgcrb should evaluate a hospital eligibility for geographic classification.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in so holding,the district court rejected lawrence argument that the statutory language was unambiguous and that any alleged ambiguity was definitively resolved in lawrence favor by the conference report accompanying section.having instead concluded that the statutory text was ambiguous,the district court moved to chevron step two according deference to the secretary interpretation of the statute,as well as to the claim that the secretary regulation was arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act.the district court concluded that the secretary made a deliberate,logical,and considered decision based on a permissible construction of the statute and upheld the contested regulation.on january,lawrence filed a timely notice of appeal.
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment by the district court de novo.see allianz ins.lerner,cir.at issue in the instant case is the secretary interpretation of the medicare statute set forth in the secretary reclassification rule,a iii.as the district court correctly held,challenges to an agency interpretation of a statute that it administers are reviewed within the framework of chevron.step one of chevron analysis requires the court to determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.as for step two,i f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.at this stage,an agency regulation warrants deference unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,at.similarly,in reviewing agency actions under the administrative procedure act,a court asks whether the agency action was arbitrary,capricious,
