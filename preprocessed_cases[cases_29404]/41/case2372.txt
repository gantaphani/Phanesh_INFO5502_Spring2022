seven oregon residents and the oregon advocacy center collectively the plaintiffs appeal the district court order dismissing their action against oregon state health officials,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.their appeal presents an issue of first impression for this circuit whether certain provisions of the medicaid act,a and a,create individual rights enforceable under section.
the seven individual plaintiffs,who are seniors and disabled individuals,had received home and services as an alternative to medicaid institutional nursing facility services.they lost their medicaid eligibility,however,when the oregon department of human services the department scaled back the state medicaid program in the face of a budget crisis.plaintiffs sued officials in the department under section in federal district court.the individual plaintiffs alleged that they required the level of care that entitles them to nursing facility services under the medicaid act.they further alleged that the department actions violated both section a,which requires states to provide nursing facility services to eligible individuals,and section a,which requires states to use reasonable standards in setting medicaid eligibility.
the district court granted the department motion to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure frcp b,concluding that the medicaid act provisions in question do not create individual rights enforceable through section.in dismissing the case,the court also denied plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint.
plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of their complaint and the denial of leave to amend.we have jurisdiction under,and we hold that section a creates an individual right enforceable under section.we also hold that section a does not create such an individual right.we do not reach the question of the district court denial of leave to amend.the district court is thus affirmed in part,and reversed in part.we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
backgrounda.the medicaid framework 
medicaid is a cooperative program with the purpose of enabling each state,as far as practicable under the conditions in such state,to furnish medical assistance on behalf of individuals,whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.states choosing to participate in the program,such as oregon,must develop a medical assistance plan meeting the approval of the federal secretary of health and human services the secretary.see id.a participating state receives federal reimbursement for medical assistance that it renders under its approved plan.see id.
the medical assistance provided by a state plan must include certain minimum services to all individuals who are financially eligible.see a a identifying the seven subsections of a that describe the minimum services.among the services that must be provided are nursing facility services other than services in an institution for mental diseases for individuals years of age or older.a a.the medicaid act defines a nursing facility as an institution primarily engaged in providing skilled nursing care,rehabilitation services,or regular care and services above the level of room and board available only in institutions.see c referring to a for definition a.
a state plan must also provide reasonable standards for determining eligibility for and the extent of medical assistance under the plan,a,and must include necessary safeguards to assure that eligibility for services is provided in a manner consistent with simplicity of administration and the best interests of the recipients.a.
a related provision of medicaid is the home and community based services services waiver program.a services waiver permits a state plan to include as medical assistance certain home and services rendered to individuals who otherwise would require nursing facility care that could be reimbursable under the state plan.see c.a waiver program must include a method for assessing whether possible service recipients need inpatient hospital services,nursing facility services,or services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally ill.c b.the implementing regulations for c provide that a state may terminate its waiver at any time upon notice to the recipients and secretary.see.a waiver may also be modified at any time,subject to the secretary approval.see.
oregon services waiver 
oregon initiated its services waiver program in.the waiver included the client assessment and planning system,whereby the state classified eligible individuals into service priority levels based on medical need the levels number from one to eighteen,with level one reflecting the most urgent medical need oregon uses a single set of criteria for determining eligibility,whether services are in nursing facilities or community based the original waiver provided care to all individuals assessed at levels one through seventeen.the department also made services available to any person eligible for institutional nursing care,leading to a large reduction in the services that had to be provided at nursing facilities.
more recently,however,oregon has eliminated coverage for some service levels,purely to cut state spending.on january,due to budget difficulties,the department submitted a proposed waiver modification to eliminate eligibility for individuals in service levels fifteen to seventeen.the secretary approved the modification.on february,the department successfully requested another modification the elimination of eligibility for individuals in levels ten to fourteen.the oregon legislature subsequently restored funding through august,for service levels ten and eleven,and restored levels ten through thirteen for the budget.current oregon regulations reflect these limitations,providing that only those individuals in levels one through thirteen are eligible for services 
under oregon cutbacks,individuals who are deemed ineligible for nursing facility or services can not challenge the state decision to eliminate eligibility of a service level,but may challenge only their placement into their particular service level.oregon estimated that elimination of levels fifteen through seventeen affected individuals in settings and individuals in nursing facilities.the elimination of levels ten through fourteen was projected to terminate services for individuals in settings and individuals in nursing facilities.
court proceedings 
on february,plaintiffs filed a complaint against the department in federal district court for the district of oregon on march,before the department had responded,plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint.the amended complaint set forth five claims for relief plaintiffs are appealing only the district court dismissal of the first three of these claims.the first claim alleged that the department withdrawal of eligibility violated,inter alia,a,which requires that state medicaid plans provide nursing facility services to eligible individuals.the second claim alleged that the department actions violated,inter alia,a reasonable standards requirement.the third claim alleged that the department violated a by assessing plaintiffs medical need for nursing facility services using agents who lacked the necessary professional qualifications and training and who employed subjective and inaccurate judgments.
on april,the department moved to dismiss the claims under frcp b.on november,the magistrate judge filed a report that recommended granting the motion.on december,plaintiffs filed objections to the magistrate judge findings and recommendations.they stated that they were entitled to an opportunity to amend the complaint,identifying two ways in which their amended complaint might be amended further.first,to avoid any misperception that plaintiffs were alleging a right to services,rather than nursing facility services,plaintiffs stated that they could emphasize more strongly that they assert a statutory right to nursing facility services.second,plaintiffs stated they could add causes of action under the supremacy clause.
on june,the district court entered a judgment and order that granted the department b motion.the district court adopted the findings and recommendations of the magistrate judge.in the order,the district court also denied plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint.the court noted that plaintiffs already had amended their complaint and that the opposing parties could suffer significant prejudice from plaintiffs amendment at this stage in the litigation,after the extensive briefing and arguments that have been presented.in addition,the court noted the apparent futility of amendment under the binding authorities as presently interpreted.the district court entered final judgment against plaintiffs on june.plaintiffs timely filed a notice of appeal on july.
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court decision to grant a motion to dismiss pursuant to frcp b.asw oregon,cir.we accept as true all facts in the complaint and construe them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.id.a claim should be dismissed only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can establish no set of facts under which relief could be granted.pacheco united states,cir.
statutory analysis 
it may be helpful to provide a brief explanation of the applicable law for determining whether a particular federal statute can be enforced through a private right of action under section.under section,persons are liable if they act under color of law to deprive individuals of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.in wilder virginia hospital ass n,the supreme court allowed a section action by health care providers to enforce a reimbursement provision of the medicaid act requiring reasonable and adequate payment,holding that the provision explicitly conferred specific monetary entitlements upon the plaintiffs,d,superseded on other grounds by statute as discussed in alaska dep t of health soc.servs.ctrs.for medicare medicaid,cir the wilder court explained that the provision required the state plan to provide for reimbursement to facilities and that the intent to benefit such facilities was unmistakable.id.at.
in suter artist,the court distinguished wilder and found no section right for parents and children who sued under the adoption assistance and child welfare act of,because reasonable efforts to keep children out of foster homes imposed only a rather generalized duty on the state and conferred no individualized rights,d.the suter court explained that wilder term reasonable and adequate was accompanied by sufficiently detailed guidance to a court that it could be judicially enforced.suter,at.by contrast,the statutory term in suter,reasonable efforts,provided no such guidance and thus a court could not readily ascertain the outlines of the alleged right.id.at.suter has been since limited as a bar to finding a section right congress responded to the opinion by enacting the suter fix,which blocks any medicaid act provision from being deemed unenforceable by an individual merely because the provision contains state plan requirements 
in,the supreme court established the current test for determining whether a particular federal statute can be enforced through a private right of action under section.blessing freestone,d.the blessing test requires that congress intended the statutory provision to benefit the plaintiff that the asserted right is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence and that the provision couch the asserted right in mandatory rather than precatory terms.id.at.if the provision meets this test,then there is a presumption that it is subject to private enforcement under section.id.at.the presumption is rebutted,however,if congress expressly or impliedly foreclosed enforcement under section an implied foreclosure occurs if congress created a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement.id.
the supreme court clarified the first prong of the blessing test in gonzaga university doe,d.in gonzaga,the court held that congressional intent to benefit the plaintiff must be shown by statutory language phrased in terms of the persons to be benefited.id.at.quoting cannon of chicago,d.a nything short of an unambiguously conferred right will not support a action.gonzaga,at.the court explained that section was intended to enforce rights as opposed to benefits or interests,the latter two being too broad or vague for judicial enforcement.id.to create enforceable rights,the statutory provision in question must focus on individual rights to benefits,rather than only the aggregate or systemwide policies and practices of a regulated entity.see id.at.as exemplars of statutory provisions that create section rights,the court discussed title vi of the civil rights act of and title ix of the education amendments of,both of which use the wording n o person shall be subjected to discrimination.id.at.
existence of a private right of action 
as a threshold matter,we accept as true plaintiffs statement that those individuals assessed at levels one through seventeen need nursing facility services.see asw,at.plaintiffs medical need may indeed be more than a fact the magistrate judge found that p laintiffs are individuals whose serious medical problems and cognitive limitations require that they either be cared for in a nursing facility or receive an equivalent level of care in community settings.
section a creates a private right of action 
according to section a,a state plan for medical assistance must provide for making medical assistance available,including at least the care and services listed in paragraphs through of section a of this title,to all individuals meeting specified financial eligibility standards.a.
in holding that this statutory provision creates a right enforceable by section,we join five federal circuit courts that have already so held no circuit court has held that section a does not create a section right.
our initial inquiry under the first prong of blessing is whether section a reveals a congressional intent to create an individualized right.we hold that it does.significantly,the provision is phrased in terms of the individuals benefited.see gonzaga,at.stating that a statute must be so phrased to create a section right.gonzaga cited text from titles vi and ix,n o person shall be subjected to discrimination,as language conferring a section right.id.at.in the instant appeal,the relevant phrase is a state plan must provide for making medical assistance available to all individuals.emphasis added.this language is unmistakably focused on the specific individuals benefited it provides for medical assistance to all individuals who meet eligibility requirements.the wording of section a is similar to the statutory provision we examined in price city of stockton each grantee shall provide for reasonable benefits to any person which we held requires that benefits be provided to particular persons and evinces a clear intent to create a federal right,cir per curiam 
there is strong support for this reading of section a in holdings by the third and fifth circuits,and we endorse these courts reasoning.in sabree ex rel.sabree richman,the third circuit noted that it is difficult,if not impossible,as a linguistic matter,to distinguish the import of the relevant medicaid act language a state plan must provide from the no person shall language of titles vi and ix,cir.the court observed that the individual focus of section a is unmistakable.id.the third circuit convincingly noted that the focus of section a is on the individual protected,rather than on the entity.id.
in ex rel.dickson hood,the fifth circuit similarly held that section a features precisely the sort of language identified in gonzaga as critical to demonstrating a congressional intent to establish a new right,cir according to the fifth circuit,the only potentially material difference between section a and the language of titles vi and ix is that section a requires state action under a medical assistance plan.id.however,the fifth circuit cited section,the suter fix,to establish that this provision in section a is not unenforceable merely because it requires action under a state pla
