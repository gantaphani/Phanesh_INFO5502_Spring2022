backgrounda.the msp statute 
prior to,medicare generally paid for medical services whether or not the medicare beneficiary also was covered by another health plan.see fanning united states,cir citing social security amendments of,b,stat.the msp statute,which was enacted in to reduce federal health care costs,makes medicare the secondary payer for medical services provided to medicare beneficiaries whenever payment is available from another primary payer.see united states insurers insolvency fund,cir citing,at,reprinted in,see also glover liggett group,cir.
to that end,the msp statute prohibits medicare from making any payment to a beneficiary for medical expenses if payment has been made,or can reasonably be expected to be made promptly as determined in accordance with regulations under an automobile or liability insurance policy or plan including a plan or under insurance.insurers insolvency fund,at quoting b a i.should medicare determine that the primary insurer has not paid and that no prompt payment reasonably can be expected from the primary insurer,however,medicare may pay the beneficiary up front,but such payment is conditioned on medicare right to reimbursement in the event that a primary plan later pays or is found responsible for payment of the item or service.see id.citing b b 
to facilitate recovery of these conditional payments,the msp i provides for a government action against any entity responsible for payment under a primary plan,b b iii ii subrogates the united states to the rights of a medicare beneficiary to collect payment under a primary plan for items already paid by medicare,b b iv the united states shall be subrogated to the extent of payment made under this subchapter for such an item or service to any right under this subsection of an individual or any other entity to payment with respect to such item or service under a primary plan,and iii creates a private cause of action with double recovery to encourage private parties to bring actions to enforce medicare rights,b a there is established a private cause of action for damages which shall be in an amount double the amount otherwise provided in the case of a primary plan which fails to provide for primary payment or appropriate reimbursement in accordance with paragraphs and a.the present case implicates only the private cause of action provision.
united seniors lawsuit 
on august,united seniors filed the instant action against five major tobacco companies in massachusetts federal district court,demanding reimbursement for all medicare costs incurred since and also alleging that the tobacco companies were liable for the tort of battery.plaintiff complaint does not allege that any of its members are medicare beneficiaries who were treated for injuries,but simply invokes the provision set forth in b a.plaintiff contends that b a is available to any person who seeks to force a primary insurer to reimburse costs to medicare,not only to affected medicare beneficiaries.
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on three grounds i united seniors,which does not allege that any of its members were medicare beneficiaries treated for illnesses,possesses neither article iii nor statutory standing to maintain a b a reimbursement suit ii united seniors was in privity with the losing plaintiff in glover,at see supra note,and consequently is collaterally estopped from relitigating the defendants reimbursement obligations to medicare and iii united seniors failed to allege that defendants financial responsibility for unreimbursed medicare costs had been established previously by judgment,compromise,waiver,nor by a release from the beneficiaries of their insurance claims against the companies,nor by any other comparable means.on august,the district court dismissed the united seniors complaint on the third ground alone,citing the rationale in glover.united seniors,wl,at 
discussion 
the defendants article iii and argument,which calls into question our jurisdiction,rests on federal rule of civil procedure b.the federal courts are required to determine whether article iii jurisdiction exists prior to proceeding to the merits of the case.see united states union bank for sav,cir citing steel citizens for better env t,d see also davignon clemmey,cir holding that an appellate court remains free to bypass problematic jurisdictional issues provided those issues do not implicate the article iii case or controversy requirement dubois united states dep of,cir accord in re olympic mills,cir noting that we have an obligation to inquire sua sponte into our jurisdiction over the matter citation omitted.we review de novo the district court implicit legal conclusion that it had jurisdiction to determine the merits of the complaint,see hulsey,cir,and conclude that united seniors lacks article iii standing.
article iii standing requirements are expressed in a familiar algorithm a plaintiff must demonstrate a concrete and particularized injury in fact,a causal connection that permits tracing the claimed injury to the defendant actions,and a likelihood that prevailing in the action will afford some redress for the injury.me.people alliance natural res.def.council mallinckrodt,cir citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.united seniors,suing in its capacity as a nonprofit taxpayer advocacy group to vindicate the fiscal integrity of the medicare program,utterly fails to meet this standard,in that it does not allege that it represents any particular medicare beneficiary who received unreimbursed medicare payments for treatment of injuries.see id.noting that an association has article iii standing only if its individual members would have standing to sue in their own right osediacz city of cranston,cir w ith certain narrow exceptions not implicated here,taxpayers,as such,lack generalized standing to challenge the constitutionality of governmental action.citing frothingham mellon.
in order to overcome this fatal defect,united seniors argues that congress sought to create a qui tam action in b a.see.agency of natural res.united states ex rel.stevens,d holding that qui tam plaintiffs have article iii standing because they sue as partial assignees of the united states claims against defendants.we find no evidence of such congressional intent.
there presently is no right to bring a qui tam action,which is strictly a creature of statute.see id.at.action now,roberts plating,cir.qui tam is an abbreviation for qui tam pro domino rege quam pro seipso,which literally means he who as much for the king as for himself.qui tam provisions first became popular in thirteenth century england.they permitted private individuals to bring suit on behalf of the king and served as a supplement to official law enforcement.united states ex rel.karvelas,cir citation omitted.for example,the false claims act fca,et,a typical and qui tam action,provides that a person may bring a civil action for the person and for the united states.b emphasis added.although the government remains the real party in interest in a qui tam prosecution,karvelas,at,qui tam statutes like the fca authorize private individuals to sue on behalf of the federal government and were intended to aid the government in discovering fraud and abuse by unleashing a posse of ad hoc deputies to uncover and prosecute frauds aga
