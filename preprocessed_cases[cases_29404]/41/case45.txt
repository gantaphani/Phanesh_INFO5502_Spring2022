background 
the act originally defined metropolitan area to be an area referred to in the surveillance report of the centers for disease control and prevention as a metropolitan area.see also id.d explicitly adopting the definitions for the subsection relevant to ponce.when congress enacted this definition,the cdc used the office of management and budget omb delineations of geographical metropolitan statistical areas msas in its surveillance reports.see ctr.disease control,health human,surveillance report.accordingly,the practical effect of the manner in which congress defined metropolitan area was to require hhs to use as its metropolitan areas under the act the msas developed by omb,unless and until cdc started using some other definition in its surveillance reports.and cdc has in fact continued to use omb msas in its surveillance reports.see,ctr.disease control,health human,surveillance report july hereinafter,surveillance report ctr.disease control,health human,surveillance report.
for its own purposes,omb has delineated the boundaries of msas under various names since the.see standards for delineating metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas,june,hereinafter msa standards.omb standards for arriving at the delineations and the msas themselves are published decennially in the federal register.see revised standards for defining metropolitan areas in the,hereinafter,msa standards.the delineations are issued according to omb general statutory mandate to develop and oversee the implementation of governmentwide sic policies,principles,standards,and guidelines concerning a statistical collection procedures and methods b statistical data classification c statistical information presentation and dissemination.e see also d overlapping,similar statutory mandate.
omb has made it clear that it developed the msas to be used solely for statistical purposes and they might not be suitable for allocating funding.msa standards at the cdc,though,does not make the ryan white act funding decisions.nor did it select omb msas to be used for that purpose.the cdc uses the msas as they were intended for the purpose of gathering statistics.it did so before and when the act was enacted and there is no hint in the act at all that the cdc needed to set aside its own purposes in selecting how to define metropolitan areas.
under omb delineation used by cdc in its report and,thus,used by hhs to award part a grants in fiscal year,puerto rico was divided into four metropolitan areas the combined metropolitan area of san juan,which includes of the island communities,and three other metropolitan statistical areas,one of which is comprised of ponce and five other communities.as thus delineated,ponce initially qualified as eligible to receive funding under the act.in,however,congress raised the eligibility requirements enough so that ponce number of aids cases no longer rendered it eligible.nevertheless,for a decade ponce continued to receive funding as if it were eligible based on a grandfathering provision included in the legislation.d,as amended by ryan white care act amendments of,d,stat,amended.
in congress removed the grandfathering provision,but ponce still managed to receive funding under the category of transitional grant area s.ryan white treatment modernization act of,stat,codified in part at amended.a transitional grant area is defined as a metropolitan area for which there has been reported to and confirmed by the director of the centers for disease control and prevention a cumulative total of at least,but fewer than,cases of aids during the most recent period of calendar years id.under the current amended statute,a metropolitan area ceases to be eligible as a transitional grant area if,in each of three consecutive years,it fails to have more than and less than reported aids cases in the preceding five years,id.c a i,and fails to have a cumulative total of at least living aids cases in the most recent calendar year id.c a ii,b see generally county of nassau leavitt,cir.
in the legislation,and then as refined in the legislation,congress also froze the boundaries of the metropolitan areas to be used by hhs.ryan white amendments of.for metropolitan areas that received funding as eligible areas in,the boundaries of such metropolitan area shall be the boundaries that were in effect for such area for fiscal year,c,while for metropolitan areas that become eligible areas after fiscal year,the boundaries of such metropolitan area shall be the boundaries that are in effect for such area when such area initially receives funding,id.c.the amendments,however,did not so directly dictate which year boundaries should be used for metropolitan areas like ponce that were no longer eligible areas for funding under a,but were instead receiving funding as transitional areas under.hhs nevertheless applies the same approach to transitional areas all of which were once eligible areas,and supports this consistent approach by appealing to administrative convenience and continuity of care,noting that acting otherwise would lead to overlapping eligible and transitional areas and confound congress scheme.ponce offers no rejoinder to this conclusion 
by fiscal year,the number of cumulative aids cases and the number of living aids cases within the ponce metropolitan area as delineated in the omb msa had dropped enough for a long enough period of time that hhs notified ponce that it no longer qualified for transitional funding ponce thereupon filed this lawsuit,arguing that hhs must expand its delineation of ponce boundaries to include three additional and that,as thus expanded,ponce would have enough aids cases to continue to qualify.in support of this argument,ponce presented the report of a management consultant,who opined that defining ponce boundaries in that manner would be consistent with omb standards.
sympathetic to ponce request,the district court concluded that hhs acted arbitrarily and capriciously in employing the msas to define the metropolitan area of ponce because hhs has no records that would demonstrate this was a rational exercise of deliberative decision making.ponce,d at quoting associated fisheries of,daley,cir.the district court also decided that hhs methodology for defining metropolitan areas in puerto rico was unfair and discriminatory because hhs used boundaries for metropolitan areas in new england that were different from the omb msas.id.at.the court issued an order requiring hhs to develop a new definition of the ponce metropolitan area that would more adequately address the factors that the district court believed needed to be addressed.id.at.
ii.analysis 
while a court might,we assume,order relief if hhs refused to use the boundaries congress told it to use,there is in this legislative scheme no license for a court to tell hhs not to use what congress said to use those boundaries that were in effect for such area for fiscal year,t
