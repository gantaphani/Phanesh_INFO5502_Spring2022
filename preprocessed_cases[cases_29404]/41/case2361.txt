in this appeal we must resolve issues arising from the employment discrimination action brought against pacific bell telephone company pacbell by a former service technician,joshua liam josephs.after the jury rendered a verdict for josephs on his claim alleging that pacbell decision to deny him reinstatement violated the americans with disabilities act of,et.ada,and the california fair employment and housing act,cal.gov t code feha,the district court entered judgment against pacbell.pacbell now appeals on grounds that the district court erred in failing to grant it judgment as a matter of law or a new trial.pacbell also contends that the district court made two erroneous evidentiary rulings and two errors in jury instructions.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm the judgment.
background 
in late,josephs applied for a service technician position with pacbell.service technicians perform unsupervised,telephone installation or repair.josephs had been employed for ten years in a similar position with cox communications.josephs checked no in answer to pacbell employment application question,have you ever been convicted of,or are you awaiting trial for a felony or misdemeanor he was hired for the position in january.
under california penal code c,pacbell is authorized to obtain the detailed criminal history of employees who will have unsupervised access to customers homes.after josephs had been working for approximately three months,pacbell obtained his criminal history.following some initial internal confusion as to the contents of the report,pacbell determined that josephs had been arrested in for attempted murder and was found not guilty by reason of insanity,and that josephs had been convicted in for a misdemeanor battery on a police officer.
pacbell suspended josephs pending further investigation.it confirmed the charge of attempted murder,the finding of not guilty by reason of insanity,and the misdemeanor conviction.pacbell also learned that josephs had been committed to and had spent two and years in a california state mental hospital between and,then spent six months in a mental health facility,was released from parole on july,and had changed his name following his release.
josephs immediate supervisor at pacbell,steve maches,testified at trial that during the suspension he had recommended josephs be restored to his position because josephs was performing well and would probably be an asset to pacbell.however,maches also testified that his supervisor,robert shive,told him that shive wanted to eliminate the possibility of having someone in the business that had an emotional dysfunction that might cause this type of behavior.ultimately,pacbell notified josephs on april,that he was discharged due to fraudulent entries on your application,in that you attempted to withhold information concerning his sic past and that this was a willful attempt,and a direct violation of pacbell code of conduct,which is not tolerated by long term employees as well as newly hired ones.
josephs filed a grievance with pacbell seeking reinstatement of his employment.pacbell collective bargaining agreement with the service technician union provided for a grievance process.linda sexton,the union representative,testified at trial that at step i,she was told that the reason for josephs termination was his failure to disclose his misdemeanor conviction and name change.she testified that during step ii,jeff smith,general manager for the san diego labor force,expressed concerns about employing someone with josephs background to work in people homes because he might go off on a customer.sexton suggested that josephs be given a different job at pacbell,such as a splicer,which did involve customer contact.smith responded by stating people can still walk by,and that under the advisement of legal,they were not going to bring someone like that back they had an image to uphold.sexton asked smith whether josephs could have his misdemeanor conviction expunged and be reinstated,as had happened with other pacbell employees.smith did not answer.
josephs misdemeanor battery conviction was expunged a month before the step iii grievance proceeding.sexton testified that she told augie cruciotti,a pacbell attending the step iii proceeding,of the expungement and argued that josephs should be treated similarly to an employee who had been reinstated after his conviction was expunged.cruciotti distinguished josephs situation,stating several times that,unlike the other employee,josephs had spent time in a mental ward,and that pacbell could not afford to have people out there who had been released from a mental institution.after the final step iii meeting,on november,cruciotti denied reinstatement with no opportunity to reapply.
administrative proceedings 
on november,josephs went to the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc office and completed paperwork to file a charge of discrimination.he was told by an eeoc employee,ron holmes,to have his attorney contact the eeoc after he retained counsel.holmes did not file a charge of discrimination on behalf of josephs nor did he refer josephs case to the california department of fair employment and housing dfeh.after josephs retained counsel in february,counsel unsuccessfully attempted to contact holmes.in april,counsel was informed by the eeoc raul green that holmes had retired without processing josephs paperwork,but that his complaint would be considered filed as of november.josephs filed a complaint with dfeh on april.
the complaint filed with the eeoc describes josephs april termination,but not the grievance process.however,josephs supporting affidavit,also filed with the eeoc,describes pacbell refusal to reinstate him.the complaint filed with dfeh alleges that josephs was terminated because of a mental disability but does not discuss pacbell refusal to reinstate him.both the dfeh and eeoc issued josephs notices without further investigation.
district court proceedings 
josephs then brought this action claiming unlawful termination of employment and unlawful refusal to reinstate in violation of the ada and feha based on allegations that pacbell both terminated and refused to reinstate him because they regarded him as mentally disabled.at trial,josephs introduced,over the objection of pacbell,evidence of the statements made by smith and cruciotti during his grievance proceedings and evidence of pacbell treatment of three other employees who,like josephs,had been terminated for failure to disclose prior criminal convictions on their employment applications but,unlike josephs,had been reinstated or offered a conditional reinstatement.one employee had a conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to sell,one had a petty theft conviction,and one had a felony domestic violence battery conviction.
josephs testimony at trial detailed his mental health problems leading up to the attempted murder and commitment to the state mental hospital,his treatment and recovery,and his employment with cox communications and pacbell.of josephs focused on whether his mental health problems were caused by illegal drug use and whether he had intentionally lied on his pacbell application.josephs also introduced his autobiography into evidence,which had been written during his stay in the state mental hospital and described his childhood and mental illness.josephs had provided pacbell employees a copy of the autobiography during the grievance proceedings.
pacbell lawyer,karen haubrich,testified at trial that she believed that somebody who has attempted to kill another individual should not be in a service technician position.while she testified that she had discussed this belief with smith as she advised him during the step ii grievance process,she did not discuss with him whether josephs,in particular,should be employed in a position with unsupervised access to customers homes.haubrich testified that she and smith had discussed the fact that josephs was properly terminated for failure to reveal the conviction or his name change on his employment application.according to haubrich testimony,when she advised cruciotti during the step iii grievance process,their discussions focused primarily on josephs lack of honesty in his application.
on,haubrich admitted looking up and discussing with various pacbell employees news coverage of josephs release from the state mental hospital.this material included newspaper reports,introduced at trial,that josephs had been under psychiatric care and counseling at the hospital and had been a mentally disordered offender.
as framed by josephs and pacbell in closing arguments,the determinative issue before the jury was whether pacbell refused to reinstate josephs because it regarded him as having a mental illness that might result in future acts of violence or because of the violent acts he had previously committed.
the jury was instructed that to render a verdict for josephs on his claim for discrimination in the reinstatement process,it had to affirmatively answer four questions 
did pacific bell regard plaintiff as having a mental disorder at the time of his termination or 
did pacific bell regard plaintiff as having a mental disorder which substantially limited his ability to work in a broad range of jobs 
was plaintiff a qualified individual who could satisfy the requisite skill,experience,education,and other requirements of the service technician position 
did pacific bell refuse to agree to reinstate plaintiff in the grievance settlement process because of his regarded as disability 
the district court further instructed the jury that a n employer may take into account a past history of violence in making hiring decisions.the district court also gave two mixed motive jury instructions 
jury instruction 
the third element plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence is that the plaintiff regarded as disability was a motivating factor in the defendant decisions to terminate to not reinstate the plaintiff.
a motivating factor is something that moves the will and induces action even though other matters may have contributed to the taking of the action.
jury instruction 
it is not necessary for the plaintiff to prove that the plaintiff regarded as disability was the sole or exclusive reason for the defendant decision,but,plaintiff must prove that defendant would not have made the same decision but for the plaintiff regarded as disability.
pacbell objected to the instruction as given,arguing that it should be followed by an instruction that even if you find regarded as disability was a motivating factor,the employer will not be liable for the termination if it proves by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have terminated plaintiff for other reasons anyway.
during its deliberations,the jury asked for clarification of the phrase because of in question,did pacific bell discharge plaintiff because of his regarded as disability the jury stated we are struggling to determine if because of is to be interpreted as the sole reason or is it possible to be combined with other factors as we reach ourdecision of yes or no.the district court referred the jury to jury instruction,stating that the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff regarded as disability was a motivating factor in the factor that moves the will and induces and determines the action,even though other matters may have contributed to the taking of the action.
the jury determined by special verdict that pacbell termination of josephs was nondiscriminatory.however,the jury determined that pacbell refused to reinstate josephs because it regarded him as mentally disabled in violation of the ada.the jury awarded josephs compensatory damages.on april,pacbell moved for judgment as a matter of law and a new trial.the district court denied the motions,and pacbell timely appealed.
judgment as a matter of trial 
pacbell contends that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because a claim for discriminatory refusal to reinstate is not separately actionable under the ada or feha josephs had not exhausted administrative remedies with respect to his reinstatement claim and the evidence was insufficient to support the jury findings that josephs condition was covered by the ada,that this condition limited a major life activity,and that josephs was qualified for the position of service technician.
claim for discriminatory refusal to reinstate 
pacbell argues that,under collins united air lines,cir,a plea by an employee to be reinstated simply seeks to redress the original termination and is,therefore,not separately actionable.this is an issue of law that we review de novo.harper seafoods,cir.
collins is distinguishable from the facts of josephs claim because new elements of unfairness,not existing at the time of the original violation,attached to denial of reemployment.inda united air lines,cir.here,josephs asserted and the jury found that pacbell denial of reinstatement was based on just such a new element of unfairness,the perception that he was mentally ill.while inda involved a denial of reemployment,rather than a failure to reinstate,its holding is not limited to a particular employment action.
therefore,we join the first,third,fourth,tenth,and eleventh circuits and expressly recognize discriminatory failure to reinstate as a separately actionable claim.see eeoc city of norfolk police dep t,cir samuels raytheon,cir eeoc hall motor transit,cir burnam amoco container,cir per curiam poolaw city of anadarko,cir.
exhaustion of administrative remedies 
pacbell argues that josephs did not exhaust the administrative remedies for his claim for refusal to reinstate because equitable tolling is not applicable to josephs eeoc claim and josephs dfeh charge,which was timely filed within a year of his dismissal and his eeoc claim both failed to mention refusal to reinstate.this court reviews for abuse of discretion the district court decision to apply equitable tolling.see leong potter,cir.whether a plaintiff has exhausted required administrative remedies is a question of law,reviewed de novo.see bankston white,cir.
equitable tolling 
an individual plaintiff must first file a timely eeoc complaint against the allegedly discriminatory party before bringing an ada suit in federal court.see eeoc farmer,cir.because california is a deferral state,the claim must be filed within days of the claimed event of discrimination.e.the filing of a timely charge of discrimination with the eeoc is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to filing suit,but is a requirement subject to equitable tolling.see zipes trans world airlines,d.
equitable tolling is available when an eeoc representative misleads the plaintiff concerning his claim.see rodriguez airborne express,cir.such relief may be granted to a plaintiff who 
diligently pursued his claim was misinformed or misled by the administrative agency responsible for processing his charge relied in fact on the misinformation or misrepresentations of that agency,causing him to fail to exhaust his administrative remedies and was acting pro se at the time.
while josephs eeoc claim was not filed within days of his termination,these factors all favor the application of equitable tolling to the eeoc claim.josephs diligently pursed his claim by going to the eeoc office shortly after his termination.he was pro se at the time and was misled by the eeoc representative,holmes,who told josephs that he needed to retain counsel before filing a claim.following the advice of holmes,josephs retained counsel,but by the time the eeoc responded to counsel inquiries,the time for filing the claim had expired.
pacbell argues that josephs affidavit,which describes his dealings with the eeoc,is a statement that can not form the basis for equitable tolling.we rejected an identical argument in rodriguez affidavits are cognizable so long as they state facts based on personal knowledge and are not too conclusory.id.
therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in applying equitable tolling to the filing of josephs eeoc complaint.
exhaustion of reinstatement claim 
we construe charges filed before the eeoc and the dfeh liberally.see stache int l union of bricklayers allied craftsmen,cir.subject matter jurisdiction extends over all allegations of discrimination that either fell within the scope of the eeoc actual investigation or an eeoc investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.maui police dep t,cir quoting farmer,at.
in couveau american airlines,cir per curiam,we held that a wrongful termination claim was encompassed in a charge,stating that the termination is unquestionably like or reasonably related to the allegations of discrimination in the refusal to reinstate charge internal quotation marks omitted.here,josephs claim is similarly unquestionably related to his termination claim.the same employer allegedly refused to reinstate josephs for the same discriminatory reason that allegedly caused his termination.any administrative investigation of his termination claim would have necessarily encompassed the grievance proceeding.thus,josephs exhausted his claim for discriminatory refusal to reinstate.
sufficiency of the evidence to support the judgment 
pacbell challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury findings that josephs condition was covered by the ada,that his condition limited a major life activity,and that josephs was qualified for the position of service technician.
we review de novo the district court denial of a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.see white ford motor,cir,amended by cir.we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving,draw all reasonable inferences in that party favor.see reeves sanderson plumbing,d.the test applied is whether the evidence permits only one reasonable conclusion,and that conclusion is contrary to the jury verdict.see pavao pagay,cir.
under the ada an employee is considered disabled if he is regarded by his employer as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.a c.an individual falls within this definition if his employer mistakenly believes that a person has a n impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.sutton united air lines,d.
the term mental impairment is not defined in the ada.see.ada regulations however,recognize that mental impairments are included within the term disability,and indirectly define this phrase to include a ny mental or physiological disorder,such as emotional or mental illnesses.g h.
here,josephs claimed that pacbell regarded him as suffering from a mental illness that might result in future acts of violence.while it is true,as pacbell argues,that the california court determination of legal insanity does not necessarily mean that josephs suffered from a mental impairment covered by the ada,the jury considered more than josephs criminal record and court documents.it heard evidence that pacbell employees considered josephs unemployable because he had spent time in a mental ward and might go off on a customer.it considered newspaper reports that pacbell reviewed and discussed during the grievance proceedings,which included statements that josephs was a mentally disordered offender who had been under psychiatric care.the jury read josephs autobiography,as had pacbell employees,which detailed his mental instability before his stay in the mental hospital.thus,the jury had ample evidence to support its finding that pacbell regarded josephs as having a mental impairment covered by the ada.
the jury found that pacbell regarded josephs mental disorder as substantially limiting his ability to work in a broad range of jobs.under the ada,when the major life activity that is substantially limit ed is working,the employee must be regarded as unable to work in a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training,skills and abilities.j i.the jury heard evidence that pacbell considered josephs unfit for any job with the company.maches testified that his supervisor told him the company wanted to eliminate the possibility of employing someone such as josephs.when the union representative proposed that josephs be offered a position that did not involve unsupervised access to customers homes,pacbell rejected the suggestion because people can still walk by.this evidence amply supports the jury finding that pacbell viewed josephs as having a mental disability that substantially limited him in the major life activity of working.
pacbell final argument challenges the jury finding that josephs was qualified for the service technician position.pacbell asserts that josephs past violent acts made him unqualified for the position.the jury heard maches testimony that josephs was performing well on the job and that maches considered him a potential asset to the company.josephs testimony detailed his past successful employment as a service technician,and the jury heard other evidence of josephs ten years of experience performing a similar job with another company.while pacbell counsel testified that it was her belief that someone who attempted to kill another person should not be in a service technician position,pacbell introduced no evidence of written company policy prohibiting employment of persons who had committed violent acts.in fact,the jury heard evidence that pacbell had reinstated one service technician who had a felony domestic violence conviction.finally,in making its determination that josephs was qualified,the jury was instructed that an employer may take into account a past history of violence in making hiring decisions.the evidence simply does not compel a conclusion that,in the eyes of pacbell,josephs was not qualified for the service technician position because of his past violent acts.
evidentiary rulings 
pacbell challenges two of the district court evidentiary rulings.we review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion and will not reverse absent some prejudice.cassino reichhold,cir.pacbell first argues that the district court erred when it admitted into evidence statements made during josephs grievance proceeding,asserting that this ruling violated federal rule of evidence and federal labor policy.
rule states in pertinent part 
evidence of furnishing or offering or promising to furnish,or accepting or offering or promising to accept,a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise a claim which was disputed as to either validity or amount,is not admissible to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim or its amount.evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations is likewise not admissible.
because the purpose of rule is to encourage the compromise and settlement of existing disputes,and the grievance proceeding did not concern josephs discrimination claim,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the statements made by pacbell employees see cassino at.
pacbell also contends that the district court should not have admitted evidence of three other employees grievance settlements because these employees circumstances were not nearly identical to josephs situation.in a discrimination case,a showing that the employer treated similarly situated employees more favorably than the plaintiff is probative of the employer discriminatory motivation.vasquez county of los angeles,cir.i ndividuals are similarly situated when they have similar jobs and display similar conduct.id.each of the three employees at issue in this appeal meets this standard.like josephs,each was a service technician,failed to reveal prior criminal conviction on the employment application,was terminated,and participated in the grievance process.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting into evidence their employment history and grievance settlements.see id.
jury instructions 
pacbell argues that the jury instructions were erroneous in two respects.in evaluating jury instructions,this court considers the charge as a whole to determine whether it is misleading or misstates the law and will not reverse a judgment because of an erroneous instruction if the instructions fairly and adequately cover the issues.cassino,at.
pacbell first argues that the district court gave only the first part of the mixed motive instruction,imposing liability if
