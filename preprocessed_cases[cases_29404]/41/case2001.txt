order and amended opinion 
civil rights 
the panel affirmed the district court dismissal of an action for lack of parens patriae standing but remanded with instructions to dismiss without prejudice.
plaintiffs are six states seeking to block enforcement of california laws and regulations prescribing standards for the conditions under which chickens must be kept in order for their eggs to be sold in the state.plaintiffs sought to block the laws before they took effect.the panel held that the plaintiffs failed to establish parens patriae standing because they failed to articulate an interest apart from the interests of private egg producers,who could have filed an action on their own behalf the allegations about potential economic effects of the challenged laws,after implementation,were necessarily speculative and the allegations of discrimination were misplaced because the laws do not distinguish among eggs based on their state of origin.the panel further held that the district court did not err by denying leave to amend because plaintiffs would be unable to assert parens patriae standing in an amended complaint.
the panel held that because in theory,plaintiffs could allege facts that might support standing,the complaint should have been dismissed without prejudice.
the opinion filed november,and published at,is amended by the opinion filed concurrently with this order.no further petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc may be filed.
graber,circuit judge 
california enacted laws and regulations prescribing standards for the conditions under which chickens must be kept in order for their eggs to be sold in the state.plaintiffs are six states,which sued to block enforcement of those laws and regulations before they took effect.we agree with the district court that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this case as parens patriae.we also hold that the district court did not err in denying plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint.but because the action should have been dismissed without prejudice,we affirm but remand with instructions to dismiss the action without prejudice.
in the general election,california voters adopted proposition,which enacted new standards beginning on january,for housing farm animals within california including,as relevant here,hens.cal.health safety code.under proposition,hens may not be confined for the majority of any day in a manner that prevents them from a lying down,standing up,and fully extending their limbs and b turning around freely.id.a violation of these standards is punishable by a fine or imprisonment of days in county jail,or both.id.
in,california legislature adopted assembly bill,which mandated,also beginning on january,that a shelled egg shall not be sold or contracted for sale for human consumption in california if the seller knows or should have known that the egg is the product of an hen that was confined on a farm or place that is not in compliance with animal care standards set forth in proposition.cal.health safety code.therefore,all eggs sold in california must comply with proposition.in,the california department of food and agriculture promulgated regulations,including salmonella prevention measures and minimum cage sizes for hens,all of which also carried an effective date of january.cal.code regs.tit,d.
on february,the state of missouri filed a complaint in the eastern district of california,asking the court to declare and california code d collectively the shell egg laws invalid,as violating the commerce clause or as preempted by federal statute,and to enjoin california from enforcing the laws.plaintiffs then filed their first amended complaint the complaint,joining the states of nebraska,oklahoma,alabama,and kentucky and the governor of iowa as additional plaintiffs.the humane society of the united states and the association of california egg farmers intervenors moved to intervene as defendants,which the court allowed.defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction intervenors filed their own,similar motions.the district court granted the motions to dismiss,with prejudice.the court concluded that plaintiffs lacked standing as parens patriae,held that their claim was not justiciable,and denied leave to amend as futile.plaintiffs timely appeal.
parens patriae standing 
states asserting parens patriae standing must meet both the basic requirements of article iii standing and the unique requirements of that doctrine.table bluff reservation wiyot tribe philip morris,cir.to establish article iii standing,an injury must be concrete,particularized,and actual or imminent fairly traceable to the challenged action and redressable by a favorable ruling.clapper amnesty int l usa,internal quotation marks omitted.in a parens patriae case,there are two additional requirements.first,the state must articulate an interest apart from the interests of particular private parties,the state must be more than a nominal party.alfred snapp son,puerto rico ex rel.barez snapp.second,t he state must express a interest.id.on de novo review,habeas corpus res.ctr.dep t of justice,cir,we conclude that plaintiffs have not met the first requirement.we therefore need not,and do not,reach the second part of the test,nor do we reach the issue of ripeness.
there are no definitive limits on the proportion of the population of the state that must be adversely affected.snapp,at.but more must be alleged than injury to an identifiable group of individual residents.id.t he indirect effects of the injury must be considered as well in determining whether the state has alleged injury to a sufficiently substantial segment of its population.id 
concerning the parties,the complaint alleges missouri farmers produced nearly two billion eggs in and generated approximately million in revenue for the state nebraska is one of the top ten largest egg producers in the united states alabama is one of the top fifteen largest egg producers in the united states kentucky farmers produced approximately billion eggs in and generated approximately million in revenue for the state oklahoma farmers produced more than million eggs in and generated approximately million in revenue for the state and iowa is the number one state in egg production,iowa farmers produce over billion eggs per year,and t he cost to iowa farmers to retrofit existing housing or build new housing that complies with would be substantial.
the laws forc e plaintiffs farmers either to forgo california markets altogether or accept significantly increased production costs just to comply.that is,plaintiffs egg farmers must choose either to bring their entire operations into compliance or else simply leave the california marketplace.t he necessary capital improvements would cost plaintiffs farmers hundreds of millions of dollars,and,without access to the california market,supply would outpace demand by half a billion eggs,causing the price of eggs as well as egg farmers margins to fall throughout the midwest and potentially forc e some missouri producers out of business.the same goes for egg producers in nebraska,alabama,oklahoma,kentucky,and iowa.
in short,the complaint alleges the importance of the california market to egg farmers in the plaintiff states and the difficult choice that egg farmers face in deciding whether to comply with the shell egg laws.the complaint contains no specific allegations about the statewide magnitude of these difficulties or the extent to which they affect more than just an identifiable group of individual egg farmers.snapp,at.
plaintiffs advance several theories to demonstrate an interest apart from the interests of particular private parties and an effect on a sufficiently substantial segment of the population.id.first,plaintiffs allege harm to their egg farmers.second,plaintiffs argue that the shell egg laws will cause harmful fluctuations in the price of eggs.finally,plaintiffs allege that they will suffer discrimination from the shell egg laws.for the reasons that follow,none of these theories establishes standing.
alleged harm to egg farmers 
alleging harm to the egg farmers in plaintiffs states is insufficient to satisfy t
