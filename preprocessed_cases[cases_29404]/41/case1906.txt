gerald pecoraro pecoraro appeals the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of the diocese of rapid city diocese,arguing the district court erred in concluding his claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.finding no error,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
in,pecoraro,then a resident of omaha,nebraska,was placed by his parents in the custody of sky ranch for boys,sky ranch,located in south dakota.at that time,father donald murray father murray served as executive director of sky ranch.the diocese appointed father murray as the sky ranch director,and allegedly directed and controlled father murray actions as director.
pecoraro alleges father murray sexually assaulted him on three occasions during and while pecoraro resided at sky ranch twice in south dakota at sky ranch,and once while taking pecoraro to chicago,illinois.after the third alleged incident of sexual abuse,pecoraro and two other minor residents of sky ranch informed a sky ranch counselor of father murray actions.the counselor then reported the matter to the bishop of the diocese.after some investigation by the diocese,sky ranch closed,and pecoraro returned to his home in omaha.
in early,pecoraro was arrested by omaha police for joyriding and was sent to the nebraska state training school nsts in kearney,nebraska.pecoraro remained there until june,when,just before pecoraro scheduled release,father murray contacted nsts,informed nsts officials sky ranch had,and requested custody of pecoraro.father murray flew the sky ranch airplane to kearney,obtained custody of pecoraro,flew with pecoraro to an omaha,and then took pecoraro to a ranch in wyoming and later to a private home in south dakota.months later,when father murray strongly encouraged pecoraro to enlist in the united states marine corps,pecoraro refused and fled south dakota.
pecoraro eventually returned to omaha.over the next thirty years,he abused drugs and alcohol,attempted suicide,and developed psychological and personality disorders.in approximately january,following the public revelation of the catholic church sexual abuse scandals,pecoraro concluded father murray sexual assaults caused pecoraro mental illness and psychological disorders.
in february,pecoraro brought suit in the united states district court for the district of nebraska against the diocese,sky ranch,and the sky ranch foundation,foundation,alleging the defendants were vicariously liable for the sexual abuse inflicted on pecoraro by the then deceased father murray.in september,the district court dismissed pecoraro complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendants and for improper venue.on august,this court affirmed the dismissal of the diocese,but held the district court had personal jurisdiction over sky ranch and the foundation and venue was proper in the district of nebraska.pecoraro sky ranch for boys,cir pecoraro i.the case was remanded,and in september,following the parties settlement agreement,pecoraro,sky ranch,and the foundation filed a stipulated motion to dismiss the action with prejudice.the district court granted the motion.
on november,pecoraro filed a suit in the united states district court for the district of south dakota against the diocese,again alleging the diocese vicarious liability for the sexual abuse inflicted by father murray.the diocese moved for summary judgment,arguing pecoraro action was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in south dakota codified law sdcl.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the diocese,holding the limitations period set forth in section,rather than the limitations period set forth in sdcl,applied to pecoraro cause of action the limitations period was not equitably tolled during the pendency of pecoraro previous suit against the diocese and the limitations period was not tolled pursuant to sdcl because pecoraro was not mentally ill.
pecoraro appeals,arguing the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the diocese because the statute of limitations set forth at section governs pecoraro cause of action,the limitations period was equitably tolled and did not expire before the filing in south dakota,and pecoraro mental illness tolled the limitations period.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
our standard of review is a familiar one.we review de novo a grant of summary judgment,applying the same standards as the district court.woodland joseph ryerson son,cir.summary judgment for the diocese is proper if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to pecoraro and giving pecoraro the benefit of all reasonable inferences,shows there are no genuine issues of material fact and the diocese is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see,mayer nextel,cir.
b.the governing statute of limitations 
south dakota substantive law,including its statute of limitations,governs this diversity action.see erie tompkins.larsen mayo med,cir.the construction and application of a statute of limitations present questions of law,subject to de novo review.stratmeyer stratmeyer,citations omitted.
pecoraro contends the district court erred in applying the statute of limitations set forth in sdcl,entitled time limit on civil action arising out of sexual abuse of child,which provides 
any civil action based on intentional conduct brought by any person for recovery of damages for injury suffered as a result of childhood sexual abuse shall be commenced within three years of the time the victim discovered or reasonably should have discovered that the injury or condition was caused by the act.
id.emphasis added.pecoraro argues his cause of action is governed by the statute of limitations set forth at sdcl,entitled statute of limitations for sex offenses,which provides,any action for damages under shall be commenced within six years of the time the plaintiff knew,or had reason to know,of any injury caused by violations of.id.emphasis added.section defines sex crimes for purposes of sections through,and includes,among other crimes,rape,sexual contact with a child under sixteen,sexual contact with a person incapable of consenting,kidnapping a minor,indecent exposure,and solicitation of a minor.
citing peterson burns,pecoraro claims under south dakota law,if two statutes of limitations conflict with each other,the statute providing the longer limitations period applies.with little explanation,pecoraro then argues the limitations period in section applies to any injury caused by violations of all sex crimes defined in section.thus,according to pecoraro,the jury should determine whether father murray committed any of the section sex crimes,and whether pecoraro claim therefore is timely under the limitations period.
such an interpretation is unsupported by the law.pecoraro reliance on peterson is misplaced.after the peterson court noted the general rule regarding conflicting statutes of limitations,the court recognized the rule does not apply when the two statutes can be harmonized.peterson,at.because the limitations period in section and the limitations period in section apply to different types of claims,the two statutes can be harmonized.see id.on its face,section provides the limitations period for certain offenses,including an action for damages for violations of section.however,section specifically indicates it is defining sex crimes for purposes of sections through,which address the requirements pertaining to the registration of convicted sex offenders.see meinders weber,referring to sections to as south dakota sex offender registration laws.the registration requirement is triggered by a conviction for one of the enumerated sex crimes in sdcl.thus,a ny punishment flowing from the sex offender registration statutes comes from a failure to register,not from the past sex offense.id.at citing state cook,ohio,emphasis added.pecoraro did not allege father murray was a convicted sex offender who failed to register.contrary to pecoraro assertions,the limitations period in section does not apply to his cause of action.
our conclusion that the applicable statute of limitations is the limitations period in section comports with decisions
