in late,defendant chronimed holdings bought northland pharmacy from plaintiff james dicello.chronimed paid dicello twelve million dollars up front and promised additional cash if northland earnings over the next year hit a benchmark.the parties agreed to arbitrate any dispute over the calculation of northland earnings and all issues having a bearing on such dispute.
when chronimed later informed dicello that it would not pay the added cash because northland earnings failed to reach the benchmark,dicello sued,claiming that chronimed owed the additional payment because the earnings target would have been met had chronimed operated the business as the contract promised.chronimed promptly moved the district court to compel arbitration,but the district court held that chronimed waived that contractual right through its conduct.because we disagree,and because we find that dicello claims fall within the scope of the contract arbitration clause,we vacate and remand with instructions to compel arbitration.
in the early,dicello,through his company,jpd,opened northland medical pharmacy in columbus,ohio.as a specialty pharmacy,northland differed from the average drugstore in that it specialized in selling drugs and injectable therapies needed to treat chronic,complex diseases such as cancer and multiple sclerosis.after twenty years of growth,northland sales in exceeded twenty million dollars.
around that time,northland caught the eye of chronimed holdings,which operates a national network of specialty pharmacies.seeking to augment its network,chronimed entered into talks with dicello to purchase northland.
in october,the parties struck a deal.principally in exchange for twelve million dollars,chronimed acquired full ownership of northland.but chronimed did not want dicello to merely turn over the keys and leave,taking with him his valuable operations expertise.instead,it negotiated an employment agreement that kept dicello at northland for two years after the sale.dicello agreed to help run northland until the end of and planned to transition to an informal role afterwards.
to align their interests during dicello holdover tenure,and as part of arriving at a fair purchase price,chronimed agreed to pay dicello an additional purchase price payment based on northland earnings.specifically,chronimed promised dicello that if northland before interest,taxes,depreciation,and million,dicello would receive the excess.to ensure dicello a fair shot at earning the additional payment,chronimed also committed to maintaining northland prior business and employment practices,as well as expanding investment in some areas.
the mechanics of the contract worked as follows chronimed promised to promptly calculate northland earnings at the end of.it was to then send dicello its ebitda calculation for the year,accompanied by financial statements,supporting documents,and an audit certificate.if dicello disagreed with chronimed calculation,he had the right to lodge an objection within fifteen days,setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for his disagreement.at that point,the parties would undertake a effort to resolve the dispute.if dicello continued to disagree with chronimed calculation of northland ebitda,the parties agreed to refer the dispute,and all related issues,to an accounting referee the accounting firm kpmg.
relations between the parties soured soon after the sale.dicello chafed at chronimed operating decisions that he felt hurt northland performance and his ability to earn the additional payment.for example,dicello believed that chronimed reduction of northland sales and marketing budget,in violation of its promise to increase it,crippled his push to boost profits.
at year end,chronimed notified dicello that million in ebitda,by its short of the earnings target.using the arbitration procedure set forth in b of the purchase agreement,dicello objected to chronimed calculation,complaining that chronimed depressed northland earnings by shortchanging some aspects of the operations and poor.
chronimed response letter to dicello of july,disputed his allegations and took the position that his objection failed to contest the company ebitda calculation in sufficient detail.see purchase agreement b requiring dicello objection to be set forth in reasonable detail.nonetheless,the company invited dicello to meet to discuss this matter with a view toward an amicable resolution.
a few days later,dicello sued chronimed,demanding an accounting plus damages,claiming breach of contract,promissory estoppel,and unjust enrichment.chronimed moved the district court to stay the suit and compel arbitration.the district court denied that request,finding that chronimed waived its right to invoke arbitration by its july response letter to dicello.with a stay from the district court,chronimed now appeals the denial of its motion.see authorizing immediate appeals from denials of motions to compel arbitration.
although the district court decision grounded on waiver assumed that this dispute is arbitrable,our de novo review requires that we first confirm arbitrability,determining whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties and that the specific dispute falls within the substantive scope of the agreement.javitch first union,cir citing at t techs.commc ns workers of,d.
the purchase agreement at b reads 
if sellers dicello and family representative disagrees with buyer chronimed calculation of the company northland ebitda,sellers representative shall advise the buyer in writing in the event buyer and sellers representative are unable to resolve such dispute within business days after delivery of the objection notice such dispute shall be submitted to,and all issues having a bearing on such dispute shall be resolved by the accounting referee the accounting referee resolution of such dispute shall be final,conclusive and binding on the parties.
because the parties agree this is a valid arbitration agreement,we need answer only one arbitrability question do dicello claims against chronimed fall within the agreement scope 
seeking to avoid arbitration,dicello urges us to answer no.as he sees it,b covers only disputes over chronimed actual calculation of northland earnings,not complaints regarding failed contractual commitments to maximize earnings,including chronimed failing to reasonably maintain the staffing of the company and to hire an additional salesperson to support the growth of northland pharmacy.purchase agreement,annex iv.because his claims do not center on chronimed math,dicello argues that arbitration is inappropriate.
we would find dicello argument convincing,except that b covers not only disputes over chronimed ebitda calculation,but also all issues having a bearing on such dispute.given the structure of the parties agreement,that extra language is pivotal.all of dicello claims seek but one thing the additional purchase price payment.the right to receive that additional payment hinged solely on chronimed bottom ebitda calculation.to the extent that chronimed business practices depressed northland ebitda,as dicello alleges,those practices ha d a bearing on chronimed ebitda calculation.fairly read,the arbitration provision encompasses dicello complaints,as well as those focused on pure accounting issues.while we agree that this interpretation is not the only plausible one,the law requires us to resolve ambiguity concerning the scope of arbitrable issues in favor of arbitration.ncr korala,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.because we can not say with assurance that the arbitration clause here does not cover the claims dicello complaint raises,we must agree with chronimed that this dispute is arbitrable.masco zurich am.ins,cir.
having decided that dicello claims fall within the scope of the parties agreement to arbitrate,we turn to his alternative argument to avoid the arbitration clause chronimed waived its right to invoke arbitration.we read dicello waiver posture as having two distinct prongs chronimed failed to satisfy a contractual precondition to arbitration and chronimed conduct frustrated dicello efforts to arbitrate their dispute.
