harry howe appeals from an order of the district court affirming the commissioner of social security denial of his application for disability insurance benefits.after careful review of the record,we affirm.
on november,howe,at the time a iron worker,was injured on the job when a bucket of iron rods struck him on the head and shoulder.he was taken to the emergency room and was diagnosed with cervical,thoracic,and lumbosacral spine strains.howe received conservative medical treatment after his injury,including pain medication,a lumbar corset,chiropractic care,and physical therapy,and he also participated in a program.results from a functional capacity assessment fca conducted on may and,indicated that howe was capable of performing light work but should be allowed to alternate among standing,sitting,and walking positions should not lift any weight overhead and should be allowed adequate time to complete tasks requiring u pper extremity coordination.app.at.on may,howe was released to return to work with these restrictions.
howe continued to complain of pain and underwent additional treatment,including a lumbar epidural injection,a subscapular bursa injection,and parathoracic nerve blocks.on september,an conduction study of howe upper extremities indicated cervical radiculopathy and bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.app.at.results from a second fca conducted on november and,again indicated that howe was capable of performing light work.the second fca stated that howe had an adequate ability to kneel,sit,and walk but need ed to vary his position frequently that he was unable to safely lift or reach weighted overhead and that he worked at an overall slow to moderate pace,pacing himself effectively to allow maximum tolerance.app.at.on december,johnson,howe treating physician,released howe to return to work subject to the limitations noted in the november fca and with the additional limitation that howe not perform repetitive hand motions because of his carpal tunnel syndrome.
between november and march,howe was seen four times by roski,a neurosurgeon,who did see anything that he would consider from a surgical standpoint for howe carpal tunnel syndrome,and who suggested that howe work on an aggressive conditioning therapy program.app.at.on february,howe was examined by another neurologist,cullen,who noted that howe had received a considerable level of rehabilitative treatment without significant improvement.cullen concluded that howe was not disabled,however,and suggested that howe attend a chronic pain rehabilitation program.
johnson saw howe on march,at which time howe reported that his pain had decreased by fifty percent after he began taking prozac.when howe later reported an increase in his pain,johnson learned that howe had stopped taking prozac,claiming that he could not afford it.when howe resumed taking the medication,his pain symptoms again decreased.in march,johnson reported that howe condition had not worsened,that he was tolerating his pain,and that he should wear his wrist splints more consistently.
on november,howe underwent a consultative examination conducted by chithambo,who confirmed howe chronic neck,thoracic,and back pain.chithambo notes indicate that howe reported that his pain was alleviated by prozac,but that he had discontinued the prescription due to its cost.
in december,johnson examined howe and noted that he continued to complain of chronic neck pain but that howe had normal strength,intact sensation,and normal reflexes.he also noted that howe carpal tunnel symptoms had improved.in november,johnson stated that howe prognosis had not changed in the year since he had last seen howe.
on august,howe filed an application for disability insurance benefits,alleging a disability onset date of december,due to nerve and muscle damage in his cervical,thoracic,and lumbar spine.the commissioner denied howe application for benefits.howe sought review before an administrative law judge alj,who conducted a hearing and found that howe suffered from the severe impairments of cervical thoracic radiculopathy,chronic pain syndrome,mild bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome,and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.the alj ultimately determined,however,that because these impairments did not reach severity,howe was not entitled to benefits.the social security administration appeals council denied review,thus rendering the alj decision final.howe then sought review in the district court,which reversed the alj decision and remanded with instructions to give appropriate weight to johnson opinion that howe suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome and to include such a restriction in the hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert ve.
the alj held a supplemental hearing and again concluded that howe was not disabled and thus not entitled to benefits.the appeals council denied howe request for review.howe again sought review in the district court,arguing that the alj decision was not supported by substantial evidence and that an outright award of benefits was appropriate.in response,the commissioner filed a motion requesting that the district court remand the case to an alj for additional development of the record.over howe objection,the district court granted the commissioner motion.although the court concluded that substantial evidence support ed the alj findings with regard to any limitations attributable to carpal tunnel syndrome,the court instructed the alj to adequately address howe credibility regarding his stated need to change positions frequently,and to work at a slow pace.order of june,at.
after a third hearing,this time before a different alj,howe application for benefits was again denied.again,the appeals council declined review.for the third time,howe sought review of the alj decision in the district court.on august,the district court affirmed the denial of benefits.howe appeals,and we affirm.
while we review de novo a district court decision affirming the denial of disability insurance benefits,nicola astrue,cir,i t is not the role of this court to reweigh the evidence presented to the alj or to try the issue s de novo,loving dep t of health human,cir.instead,we review the alj decision to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole,that is,whether evidence was presented that a reasonable mind would find adequate to support the alj conclusion.id.in making this determination,we consider both evidence that supports the alj decision and evidence that detracts from it.stormo barnhart,cir.if substantial evidence supports the alj decision,we will not reverse it merely because substantial evidence would have supported a contrary outcome or because we might have decided the case differently in the first instance.id.
howe first argues that the alj failed to give controlling weight to the medical opinions of his treating physician,johnson.specifically,howe argues that the alj improperly evaluated the evidence regarding howe need to alternate among sitting,standing,and walking positions to work at a slow pace and to avoid repetitive hand motions.while the opinion of a treating physician is entitled to substantial weight,it is not conclusive because the record must be evaluated as a whole.charles barnhart,cir.moreover,a treating physician opinion is afforded less deference when the medical evidence in the record as a whole contradicts the opinion.haggard apfel,cir.
considering the record before us as a whole,we conclude that the alj assigned the proper weight to johnson opinions.the november fca stated that howe was capable of performing light work.the fca also noted that howe major strengths included his sitting,standing,and walking tolerance,but stated that howe should be permitted to alternate positions frequently.app.at.in a december letter releasing howe to return to work,johnson specifically adopted these limitations and recommended an additional limitation on repetitive hand motions.
the alj asked the ve a hypothetical question adopting the limitations described in the november fca.the ve was asked to assume an individual of howe age,education,work experience,and combination of impairments who
