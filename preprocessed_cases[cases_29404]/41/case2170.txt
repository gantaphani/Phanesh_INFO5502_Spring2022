kris indergard indergard appeals a summary judgment in favor of corporation gp in her action for damages under the americans with disabilities act ada and oregon disability law.gp argues that there was no error in the district court,and that indergard failed to exhaust administrative remedies under the ada.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
indergard worked at gp wauna mill facility from december,until february.on december,she took medical leave to undergo surgery for and related injuries to her knees.she remained on medical leave until march,when her orthopedic surgeon,randall ketzler,authorized her return to work,but with permanent restrictions.gp policy required employees to participate in a physical capacity evaluation pce before returning to work from medical leave,and gp so informed indergard.
gp contracted columbia rehabilitation columbia,an independent occupational therapy provider located in washington state,to conduct the pce.cory blickenstaff,a physical therapist at columbia,visited the gp facility and conducted a job analysis for the consumer napkin operator position,which was indergard position prior to her medical leave,and for the napkin adjuster position,which was the next position for which indergard was entitled to bid under the collective bargaining agreement.blickenstaff interviewed employees who worked in these positions,and identified the physical demands of the positions,including amount of weight an employee was required to lift,carry,push,pull,and hold,and the type of movements the positions required.
among the lifting requirements that blickenstaff identified were a pound individual lift and carry for the consumer napkin operator position and a pound lift for the napkin adjuster position.in light of these requirements,columbia determined that indergard permanent restrictions prevented her from participating in the pce.indergard met with gp supervisors and challenged the lifting requirements in the job analyses,alleging that they were inaccurate based on how the jobs were actually performed.blickenstaff prepared a supplemental memorandum intended to clarify the requirements,but the job analyses were not revised.
on october,indergard provided gp with a note from ketzler that removed the permanent restrictions he had previously identified.gp then scheduled her to participate in the pce.vicky starnes,a occupational therapist at columbia,conducted the pce at columbia office on november and.
on the first day of the pce,starnes recorded indergard medical history and subjective reports of her current pain level and use of medication,alcohol,tobacco,and assistive devices.starnes recorded indergard weight,height,blood pressure,and resting pulse.she observed indergard gait,balance,and posture.she measured the range of motion in indergard arms and legs,and compared the results to normal limits.starnes palpated indergard knees and looked for edema in her legs,and performed manual muscle testing,recording the results of indergard hip flexors,knee extensors and flexors,bilateral internal and external hip rotation,and straight leg raises.
next,starnes measured indergard ability to lift various amounts of weight from floor to waist,waist to chest,and chest to overhead,and evaluated indergard body mechanics during the lifts.she then measured indergard ability to carry increasing amounts of weight over a set distance,and her grip strength over varying grip widths.she measured indergard static strength to determine her ability to lift,push,and pull in various postures,and compared indergard results to norms adopted by the department of health and human services.indergard then performed a job simulation task,which required her to lift and pour five gallon buckets filled with pounds of sand.starnes then tested indergard ability to place nuts and bolts in a box while kneeling with her vision obscured,and observed indergard ability to climb stairs,stand,sit,kneel,squat,and crawl.indergard walked on a treadmill for twenty minutes at a mile per hour pace,and pushed a weight sled.finally,starnes recorded details about indergard vision,communication,cognitive ability,hearing,attitude,and behavior.
the second day of the pce included similar tests.starnes measured and recorded indergard heart rate after she performed the treadmill test,and noted that she required increased oxygen and demonstrated poor aerobic fitness.starnes concluded that indergard was unable to perform the pound lift and carry that blickenstaff had identified as a requirement of the napkin operator position,or the pound lift that blickenstaff identified as a requirement for the napkin adjuster position.starnes recommended that indergard not return to work,and forwarded the results of the pce to ketzler,who agreed with starnes assessment.the lifting requirements that the pce indicated indergard could not meet were those that she had previously contested as inaccurate.
gp then informed indergard that she could not return to either position,and that no other positions were available for which she was qualified.on february,gp terminated her employment pursuant to a provision in the collective bargaining agreement that allowed gp to terminate employees who had been on leave for more than two years.indergard filed a union grievance,which was denied,and filed a joint complaint with the eeoc and boli.the administrative investigation found no substantial evidence to support her claims.she received right to sue letters,and filed this action.
indergard alleged various claims of disability discrimination under the ada and oregon disability law.relevant to this appeal,she alleged that gp misrepresented the essential job functions of the position in which she had worked prior to going on medical leave,forced her to participate in the pce without an objectively reasonable basis for doing so,and refused to allow her to return to employment after the pce.in her first claim for relief,indergard alleged that the pce was improper and discriminatory,and that gp relied on the pce to remove deny her return to employment.she also raised other claims under the ada,including that gp treated her in a disparate,discriminating and harassing manner because she was disabled,had a record of disability or was perceived as disabled,and that gp failed to engage in the interactive process.she sought relief in the form of loss of income,and in damages.
gp moved for summary judgment,and indergard response abandoned all claims except those alleging that the pce was an improper medical examination and that gp discriminated against her because of a perceived disability or record of disability.gp reply argued that the pce was not a medical examination,and that it therefore did not violate the ada.it further argued that even if the pce was a medical examination,it was and consistent with business necessity,and therefore expressly allowed by the ada.see d a 
the magistrate judge agreed with gp that the pce was not a medical examination.because the magistrate judge determined that the pce was not a medical examination,he concluded that gp had not violated d a and that it was entitled to summary judgment.in the interest of providing a thorough analysis,however,the magistrate judge analyzed gp business necessity defense.noting that the standard to establish business necessity is quite high,the magistrate judge found that although gp had a reasonable basis to request the pce,it would not be entitled to summary judgment on the basis of the business necessity defense because gp failed to show that the pce was limited to the essential functions of indergard prior positions.the magistrate judge,however,decided that gp was nonetheless entitled to summary judgment because the pce was not a medical examination.
indergard filed objections,but the district court adopted the findings and recommendation in full and granted gp motion for summary judgment.this appeal followed 
discussion 
i.the district court erred in holding that the pce was not a medical examination under the ada 
under the ada,an employer may not require a current employee to undergo a medical examination unless the examination is shown to be and consistent with business necessity.d a.this section applies to all employees,whether or not they are disabled under the ada.fredenburg contra costa county dep t of health,cir.the implementing regulations impose the same restriction,but state that an employer may make inquiries into the ability of an employee to perform functions.c.c.thus,we must determine whether the pce was a medical examination under the ada or simply an inquiry into whether indergard was capable of performing the functions of the positions she was qualified to return to after her medical leave.
regulatory guidance indicates that the pce was a medical examination 
neither the ada nor the implementing regulations define the term medical examination,and case law interpreting this provision is limited.agency guidance on the issue,however,is more detailed.although agency guidance documents are not controlling upon courts by reason of their authority,they do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.meritor sav.bank vinson,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also christensen harris county,d stating that interpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines are entitled to respect only to the extent that they have the power to persuade internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the interpretive appendix to c states,in relevant part,that t his provision permits employers to make inquiries or require medical examinations fitness for duty exams when there is a need to determine whether an employee is still able to perform the essential functions of his or her job.pt,app.c.the interpretive appendix to a also contemplates the use of p hysical agility tests,which are not medical examinations and so may be given at any point in the application or employment process.id.at app.a.the appendix further states that physical agility tests must be given to all similarly situated applicants or employees regardless of disability,and notes that if the test screen s out or tend s to screen out an individual with a disability the employer would have to demonstrate that the test is and consistent with business necessity and that performance can not be achieved with reasonable accommodation.id.
eeoc enforcement guidance draws a further distinction between medical examinations and physical agility tests.it defines a medical examination as a procedure or test that seeks information about an individual physical or mental impairments or health.enforcement guidance on inquiries and medical examinations,available at http hereinafter eeoc enforcement guidance.it provides the following seven factors to be considered in determining whether a test is a medical examination 
whether the test is administered by a health care professional 
whether the test is interpreted by a health care professional 
whether the test is designed to reveal an impairment of physical or mental health 
whether the test is invasive 
whether the test measures an employee performance of a task or measures physiological responses to performing the task 
whether the test normally is given in a medical setting 
whether medical equipment is used 
id.the eeoc enforcement guidance states that although in some cases a combination of factors may be relevant to the determination of whether a test is a medical examination,in other cases,one factor may be enough to determine that a test or procedure is medical.id.it then provides a list of tests considered medical examinations,including blood pressure screening and cholesterol testing and tests that measure muscle strength and motor function.id.
the eeoc enforcement guidance states that certain tests are generally not medical examinations,including 
physical agility tests,which measure an employee ability to perform actual or simulated job tasks,and physical fitness tests,which measure an employee performance of physical tasks,such as running or lifting,as long as these tests do not include examinations that could be considered medical,measuring heart rate or blood pressure.
id.emphasis added.
single factors establish that the pce was a medical examination 
in light of the agency guidance,indergard argument that the pce was a medical examination is convincing.as noted above,the pce included range of motion and muscle strength tests,and starnes measured indergard heart rate and recorded an observation about her breathing after the treadmill test.each of these tests is within the eeoc description of tests that are considered medical examinations.the test heart rate measurement and notation regarding indergard increased oxygen intake and demonstration of poor aerobic fitness weigh heavily in favor of considering the pce a medical exam,particularly because starnes had already noted that indergard was able to walk for minutes at mph on treadmill without increased antalgic behavior or objective findings of pain complaints noted.had starnes observations ended there,it might be appropriate to characterize the treadmill test as a test that measured indergard performance of a physical task.measuring indergard heart rate and recording observations about her breathing and aerobic fitness,however,was not only unnecessary to determine whether she could perform the task,but is also the kind of examination that the eeoc enforcement guidance identifies as inappropriate to include in a physical agility or fitness test.
gp argument that anything less than a genuine exercise stress test is not a medical examination distorts the eeoc enforcement guidance and is not.furthermore,to the extent that gp attempts to rely on the magistrate judge conclusion that indergard blood pressure and heart rate were measured as an overall precaution before beginning testing rather than to measure indergard physiological response to the performance portion of the pce,we emphasize that her heart rate was taken both before and after the treadmill test,and we note that although it might be a prudent medical procedure to take these physiological measurements,including them in the report provided to gp was unnecessary for the purpose of determining whether indergard was physically capable of performing her job duties.
application of the test establishes that the pce was a medical examination 
the eeoc enforcement guidance identifies seven factors as relevant to determining whether a test is a medical examination,and at least four weigh in indergard favor.first,although starnes is not a medical doctor,she is a licensed occupational therapist.nothing in the eeoc enforcement guidance indicates that the term health care professional should be limited to only doctors,and at least one district court has found that the fact that a pce was administered by a business specializing in physical therapy,and not a medical doctor,makes it no less medical than a nurse taking one blood pressure or an emergency medical technician administering care to a patient on the way to the hospital.medlin rome strip steel,d.
second,not only did starnes administer the pce,but she interpreted indergard performance and recommended that she not return to work.furthermore,starnes submitted the test results to ketzler,indergard treating orthopedic surgeon,who indicated his agreement with starnes recommendation.this distinguishes the pce from a test where,for example,a supervisor or other employee might observe the employee physical ability to perform job tasks.
third,although the pce was ostensibly intended to determine whether indergard could return to work,the broad reach of the test was capable of revealing impairments of her physical and mental health,particularly in light of starnes recording indergard subjective reports of her current pain level,use of medication and assistive devices,and communication,cognitive ability,attitude,and behavior.
the fourth factor weighs in gp favor,as the pce does not seem to have been invasive.the fifth factor,however,benefits indergard because starnes recorded her heart rate and breathing pattern after the treadmill test,and indergard muscle pain and stiffness after the f
