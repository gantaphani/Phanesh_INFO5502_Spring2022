the parties to this lanham act suit are manufacturers of an oral laxative the chemical name of which is polyethylene glycol.schering,the plaintiff,sells its version under the trade name miralax.miralax is an drug.the four defendants sell the generic version of the drug under its chemical name except that defendants kremers and schwarz also use the name glycolax,but their version may be sold only if it is prescribed.
miralax was originally a prescription drug too.after the patent on it expired,the food and drug administration approved defendants andas abbreviated new drug applications,which authorized them to sell a generic version of the drug.later the fda approved an version of miralax but required that the label contain a warning to use for no more than days.constipation that lasts longer than that may be symptomatic of a serious medical condition,so a consumer who wants to use a laxative longer should do so under a doctor supervision.
the food,drug,and cosmetic act requires that the labeling of the generic drug be the same with immaterial exceptions as that of the original pioneer drug,as it is called,which in this case was the version of miralax.j a v a.and if the generic drug is approved for use as a prescription drug,the label of the generic drug must bear,at a minimum,the symbol rx only.b a.the labels of the defendants generic versions of miralax do bear that symbol.the generic drug must also though again with immaterial exceptions be bioequivalent to the pioneer drug and have the same active ingredients,route of administration,dosage form,and strength.j a see eli lilly medtronic,d andrx pharmaceuticals,elan,cir.there is no contention that the defendants drugs fail to satisfy these requirements.
section a b of the lanham act,a b,under which this suit was brought,forbids the use of any false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which in commercial advertising or promotion,misrepresents the nature,characteristics,or qualities of the seller or another person goods there is no exemption for labels.
schering argues that the labels,shown below,on the containers for the polyethylene glycol sold by the two principal defendants,breckenridge and paddock,are false.the labels of the other two defendants generics are similar,but the briefs focus on breckenridge and paddock.the labels say that polyethylene glycol is sold only by prescription,whereas in fact,since miralax by definition does not require a prescription,not all polyethylene glycol may be sold only by prescription.the statement in the label is repeated in the patient information that is included in the container in which the product is sold the package insert,which is deemed a part of the labeling of the product.
paddock and breckenridge labels 
although many prescription drugs are sold to the consumer in a plastic vial or other container supplied and relabeled by the pharmacist,polyethylene glycol,whether sold by schering or by the defendants,is sold to the consumer in its original container.this means that no one will see the labels on the defendants product unless a physician has written a prescription for it,although one might see the label in an advertisement for the product.and should the patient condition change,so that he did need to use a laxative for more than seven days,he might be unaware that he could switch to an version of the laxative that had been prescribed for him.
the fda is conducting a proceeding to determine whether the defendants drugs are misbranded now that there is an version of the drug.and because the food,drug,and cosmetic act does not permit both and versions of the same drug to be sold at the same time,b opportunity for hearing on a proposal to withdraw approval of prescription polyethylene glycol abbreviated new drug applications,fda,the proceeding encompasses the issue of whether there is a meaningful difference between the pioneer drug and the generic drug or whether they are really the same drug.advance notice of proposed rulemaking,circumstances under which an active ingredient may be simultaneously marketed in both a prescription drug product and an drug product,fda.the defendants argue that they are different drugs because their version is not subject to the warning.
if the fda determines that they are the same,the result will be that the generic drug can no longer be sold,but even if it determines that they are different,it may decide that the labeling of the generics has to be changed.a drug is misbranded within the meaning of the food,drug,and cosmetic act if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular,a,and schering argues that the defendants labels occlude,in the mind of the consumer,the existence of its version of the drug.but maybe the fda does care whether the labeling of the generic products obscures the existence of an equivalent maybe all it cares about is that the labeling leads consumers to use the product safely,an objective that conceivably can be achieved just by making sure that doctors and pharmacists are accurately informed about the drug that they are prescribing,which of course is not the version.it is not obvious that the goal of protecting consumers is furthered by making sure that they are aware of the existence of an equivalent,and,if it is not,there would be no conflict between the fd c act and the lanham act.but we do not know,and see no need to guess while the misbranding proceeding is wending its way through the fda.
the director of the office of generic drugs in the fda center for drug evaluation and research wrote the defendants that their products are misbranded because the label says rx only even though polyethylene glycol can also be sold without a miralax.the letters are not final agency action.to rescind approval of the sale of a drug because of misbranding,the fda must provide the manufacturer with due notice and opportunity for hearing to the applicant.e.the agency is proceeding on that path,but no hearing has yet been scheduled,nor has the agency even decided whether a hearing will be has as yet merely provided the participants with an opportunity to request a hearing.opportunity for hearing on a proposal to withdraw approval of prescription polyethylene glycol abbreviated new drug applications,supra.
the district court dismissed the suit without prejudice,suggesting that schering could refile it if and when the fda decided that the defendants drugs were indeed misbranded.schering has appealed,arguing that no reasonable trier of fact could fail to conclude that the terms rx only and a prescription only laxative,which appear on the labels of the defendants drugs,are literally false and therefore violate the lanham act irrespective of the fd c act.and so it asks us to enter judgment in its favor rather than remand the case for evidentiary proceedings.the defendants have,contending that the suit should be dismissed with prejudice because schering has no possible claim under the lanham act.they argue that a finding by the fda that their products are not misbranded will mean that they are not falsely advertised,while if the agency finds that the product is misbranded they will of course change the labeling to whatever the agency orders.this is an argument about mootness rather than about the merits,and not a good one,since it is merely speculation concerning what the defendants would do in response to a finding by the fda of misbranding.
the defendants further suggest that the fact that the suit was dismissed without prejudice deprives us of appellate jurisdiction.the suggestion is made rather halfheartedly because they are strong for their,which argues that the dismissal should have been with prejudice.making a dismissal without prejudice can be challenged by the winner the defendant because a litigant has a significant interest in the preclusive effect of a judgment in its favor.disher information resources,cir labuhn bulkmatic transport,cir technologies,astechnologies.but the challenge can be mounted only if the dismissal is appealable.we have an independent duty to determine our jurisdiction,so the defendants lack of enthusiasm for a dismissal of the appeal is not a ground on which we can disregard the issue.
there is no general rule that dismissals without prejudice are nonfinal orders and therefore nonappealable under they were,dismissals for want of jurisdiction would not be appealable,and of course they are.south austin coalition community council sbc communications,cir.the typical case in which such a dismissal is nonfinal is a dismissal on the basis of an error that the judge expects will be corrected by the filing of an amended complaint.the judge thus has not finished with the case,and appeal would therefore be premature.hoskins poelstra,cir furnace board of trustees of southern illinois university,cir ordower feldman,cir borelli city of reading,cir per curiam willis,bnsf railway,cir.but when the case does end in the district court,the dismissal is ripe for appeal even if a similar case may be filed in the future because the dismissal was without prejudice.united states wallace tiernan.south austin coalition community council sbc communications,supra,at gray county of dane,cir ohio river carrillo,cir per curiam lichoulas city of lowell,cir de tie orange county,cir linn chivatero,cir.
we grant that some opinions suggest that unless the plaintiff will be unable to bring a further suit in federal court perhaps because the statute of limitations has run,a dismissal without prejudice is not appealable,doss clearwater title,cir mostly memories,for your ease only,cir.but the holdings of those cases as distinct from their inessential to the holdings are consistent with the proposition that a dismissal without prejudice is appealable unless the reason for the dismissal is an easily fixable problem for the dismissals in those cases were found to be appealable even though they were without prejudice.likewise in south austin we concluded that there was nothing tentative about the district court dismissal no one is trying to achieve an interlocutory appeal without meeting the statutory requisites.this case has come to a close in the district court.at.ohio river held that though the dismissal order contemplates that appellant may eventually refile its admiralty complaint,the court,by dismissing the action,has terminated its jurisdiction over the original complaint.this is enough to render the order appealable.at.and in lichoulas,at,the court pointed out that dismissals for lack of ripeness are appealable,citing bateman city of bountiful,cir,even though they are likely to be refiled at some future the district judge in our case said he was dismissing it because it was unripe for decision.
in short,only if the defect that required dismissal is immediately curable is the dismissal nonappealable though we are unclear why schering did not ask for a preliminary injunction,the denial of which would have been appealable even if the dismissal was not,a.a dismissal without prejudice that is conclusive in practical effect is certainly appealable,as held in american states ins.capital associates of jackson county,cir,but a dismissal without prejudice is not rendered unappealable merely by its not preventing the suit from being refiled.
the judge did not stay the suit pending action by the fda,as he might have done,cheyney state college faculty hufstedler,cir landis north american.cardozo,american states ins.capital associates of jackson county,supra,at tice american airlines,cir,by analogy to the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.united states western pacific,d in re starnet,cir arsberry illinois,cir.such a stay would not have been appealable unless its practical effect was to end,not merely interrupt,the judicial proceeding,as in moses cone memorial hospital mercury construction,d.the stay issued in cone was in favor of a proceeding,the final judgment in which would operate as res judicata in the federal proceeding.the court held that a stay is appealable if it has the same effect as a dismissal that would be appealable for it is the effect of a judicial order,rather than what the judge calls it,that matters in determining appealability.
primary jurisdiction,as we explained in the arsberry case,sometimes involves reference of an issue to an agency that has exclusive jurisdiction to resolve it.if the issue is dispositive and its resolution by the agency is reviewable in another court,the case will never return to the referring court and therefore a stay of the initial judicial proceeding to permit the reference would have the same effect as a dismissal.but as we noted earlier,it is unclear whether that will be the result when the fda completes its misbranding proceeding.
we turn at last to the merits.we can set aside the letters from subordinate officials of the fda the letters are not final agency action binding on the district court,as there has been no final agency action,let alone action that has been or could be judicially reviewed.we can also set aside any argument that the defendants drugs are misbranded because they are labeled prescription are prescription drugs,so their labels have to say that,even if a close substitute miralax is not.schering tacitly concedes this,and just argues that the labels need a disclaimer indicating that not all drugs of which polyethylene glycol is the active ingredient require a prescription.
nor do we think that just because the provision of the lanham act on which schering suit is based is intended to protect competitors from the effects of false advertising or labeling,while the misbranding provision of the food,drug,and cosmetic act is intended to protect the consumers of drugs,sandoz pharmaceuticals,cir,there can be no conflict between the statutes,hence no occasion for delaying this litigation to allow the fda to weigh in.a disclosure required to protect a competing seller might mislead a consumer,in which event the drug would be mislabeled and could not be sold,so that the seller concern with unfair competition would be moot it would have no competitor because there would be no competing product.the case would be like smithkline beecham consumer healthcare,watson pharmaceuticals,cir,where copyright law would have forbidden a manufacturer of a generic drug to copy the pioneer manufacturer labels,but failing to copy them would have violated the requirement of the fd c act that the label of a generic drug be the same as the pioneer label,and so would have precluded generic manufacturer from legally marketing its product.the court resolved the conflict by allowing the fd c act labeling requirement to trump copyright law.see also zenith electronics exzec,vornado air circulation systems,duracraft,cir.
courts try to give as much effect to both statutes as possible,and in that vein schering argues that the fd c act should be interpreted to forbid the defendants to make a disclaimer that would cure the misrepresentation upon which schering lanham act suit is predicated.but schering has been coy about what it thinks the disclaimer should say,and its coyness makes us doubt that this is a matter that can be resolved intelligently without a decision by the fda.at argument schering lawyer seemed to concede that if the defendants labels said paddock polyethylene glycol,rx only and breckenridge polyethylene glycol,rx only,it would be content.its briefs do not propose a wording,however,and we hesitate to hold a lawyer to a concession made in the heat of oral argument in response to questions from the bench.
we can imagine the fda worrying that the wording that schering lawyer suggested at the argument would make some consumers think that only paddock or only breckenridge polyethylene glycol is prescription only,or would make consumers wonder whether the two brands might be chemically different products.the fda should be given a chance to opine on the proper labeling before a lanham act suit is filed,sandoz pharmaceuticals,supra,at compare alpharma,pennfield oil,cir,since it has more experience with consumers understanding of drug labels than judges do.alpharma,in contrast,was a case in which the complaint under the lanham act was simply that the defendant had said that the fda had approved its drug for a number of uses for which it had not been approved.evaluating such a charg
