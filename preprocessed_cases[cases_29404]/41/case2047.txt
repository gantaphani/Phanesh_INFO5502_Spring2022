the california legislature enacted senate bill to ban mental health providers from engaging in sexual orientation change efforts soce with patients under years of age.two groups of plaintiffs sought to enjoin enforcement of the law,arguing that sb violates the first amendment and infringes on several other constitutional rights.
in welch brown,the district court ruled that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their first amendment claim and that the balance of the other factors tipped in their favor thus,the court granted a preliminary injunction.in pickup brown,the district court ruled that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits of any of their claims and denied preliminary relief.the losing parties timely appealed.we address both appeals in this opinion.
although we generally review for abuse of discretion a district court decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction,we may undertake plenary review of the issues if a district court ruling rests solely on a premise as to the applicable rule of law,and the facts are established or of no controlling relevance.gorbach reno,cir en banc quoting thornburgh am.coll.of obstetricians gynecologists,d.because those conditions are met here,we undertake plenary review and hold that sb,as a regulation of professional conduct,does not violate the free speech rights of soce practitioners or minor patients,is neither vague nor overbroad,and does not violate parents fundamental rights.accordingly,we reverse the order granting preliminary relief in welch and affirm the denial of preliminary relief in pickup.
factual and procedural background 
sexual orientation change efforts soce 
soce,sometimes called reparative or conversion therapy,began at a time when the medical and psychological community considered homosexuality an illness.soce encompasses a variety of methods,including both aversive and treatments,that share the goal of changing an individual sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual.in the past,aversive treatments included inducing nausea,vomiting,or paralysis providing electric shocks or having an individual snap an elastic band around the wrist when aroused by erotic images or thoughts.even more drastic methods,such as castration,have been used.today,some treatments use assertiveness and affection training with physical and social reinforcement to increase sexual behaviors.other treatments attempt to change gay men and lesbians thought patterns by reframing desires,redirecting thoughts,or using hypnosis,with the goal of changing sexual arousal,behavior,and orientation.american psychological association,appropriate therapeutic responses to sexual orientation.the plaintiff mental health providers in these cases use only treatments.
in,homosexuality was removed from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.shortly thereafter the american psychological association declared that homosexuality is not an illness.other major mental health associations followed suit.subsequently,many mental health providers began questioning and rejecting the efficacy and appropriateness of soce therapy.currently,mainstream mental health professional associations support affirmative therapeutic approaches to sexual orientation that focus on coping with the effects of stress and stigma.but a small number of mental health providers continue to practice,and advocate for,soce therapy.
senate bill 
senate bill defines soce as any practices by mental health providers that seek to change an individual sexual orientation,includ ing efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions,or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.cal.bus.b.soce,however,
does not include psychotherapies that a provide acceptance,support,and understanding of clients or the facilitation of clients coping,social support,and identity exploration and development,including sexual interventions to prevent or address unlawful conduct or unsafe sexual practices and b do not seek to change sexual orientation.
id.b.a licensed mental health provider use of soce on a patient under years of age is considered unprofessional conduct,which will subject that provider to discipline by the licensing entity for that mental health provider.id.
importantly,sb does not do any of the following 
prevent mental health providers from communicating with the public about soce 
prevent mental health providers from expressing their views to patients,whether children or adults,about soce,homosexuality,or any other topic 
prevent mental health providers from recommending soce to patients,whether children or adults 
prevent mental health providers from administering soce to any person who is years of age or older 
prevent mental health providers from referring minors to unlicensed counselors,such as religious leaders 
prevent unlicensed providers,such as religious leaders,from administering soce to children or adults 
prevent minors from seeking soce from mental health providers in other states 
instead,sb does just one thing it requires licensed mental health providers in california who wish to engage in practices that seek to change a minor sexual orientation either to wait until the minor turns or be subject to professional discipline.thus,sb regulates the provision of medical treatment,but leaves mental health providers free to discuss or recommend treatment and to express their views on any topic.
the legislature stated purpose in enacting sb was to protect the physical and psychological of minors,including lesbian,gay,bisexual,and transgender youth,and to protect its minors against exposure to serious harms caused by sexual orientation change efforts.cal.legis.serv.ch,n.the legislature relied on the well documented,prevailing opinion of the medical and psychological community that soce has not been shown to be effective and that it creates a potential risk of serious harm to those who experience it.specifically,the legislature relied on position statements,articles,and reports published by the following organizations the american psychological association,the american psychiatric association,the american school counselor association,the american academy of pediatrics,the american medical association,the national association of social workers,the american counseling association,the american psychoanalytic association,the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry,and the pan american health organization.
in particular,the legislature relied on a report created by a task force of the american psychological association.that report resulted from a systematic review of the scientific literature on soce.methodological problems with some of the reviewed studies limited the conclusions that the task force could draw.nevertheless,the report concluded that soce practitioners have not demonstrated the efficacy of soce and that anecdotal reports of harm raise serious concerns about the safety of soce.
procedural history 
plaintiffs in welch include two soce practitioners and an aspiring soce practitioner.plaintiffs in pickup include soce practitioners,organizations that advocate soce,children undergoing soce,and their parents.all sought a declaratory judgment that sb is unconstitutional and asked for injunctive relief to prohibit enforcement of the law 
in welch,plaintiffs moved for preliminary injunctive relief,arguing that sb violates their free speech and privacy rights.they also argued that the law violates the religion clauses and is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad under the first amendment.
the welch court held that sb is subject to strict scrutiny because it would restrict the content of speech and suppress the expression of particular viewpoints.it reasoned that the fact that the law is a professional regulation does not change the level of scrutiny.the court granted preliminary relief because it determined that the state was unlikely to satisfy strict scrutiny,plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction,the balance of the equities tipped in their favor,and the injunction was in the public interest.because the district court granted relief on their free speech claim,it did not reach plaintiffs other constitutional challenges 
in pickup,plaintiffs moved for preliminary injunctive relief,arguing that sb violates the first and fourteenth amendments by infringing on soce practitioners right to free speech,minors right to receive information,and parents right to direct the upbringing of their children.they also argued that sb is unconstitutionally vague.
the pickup court denied plaintiffs motion because it determined that they were unlikely to prevail on the merits of any of their claims.it reasoned that,because the plain text of sb bars only treatment,but not discussions about treatment,the law regulates primarily conduct rather than speech.applying the rational basis test,the court ruled that plaintiffs were unlikely to show a violation of the soce practitioners free speech rights or the minors right to receive information.as for vagueness,the court ruled that the text of the statute is clear enough to put mental health providers on notice of what is prohibited.finally,the court ruled that sb does not implicate parents right to control the upbringing of their children because that right does not encompass the right to choose a specific mental health treatment that the state has reasonably deemed harmful to minors.
discussion 
free speech rights 
at the outset,we must decide whether the first amendment requires heightened scrutiny of sb.as explained below,we hold that it does not.
the first step in our analysis is to determine whether sb is a regulation of conduct or speech.two of our cases guide our decision national association for the advancement of psychoanalysis california board of psychology,cir naap,and conant walters,cir.
in naap,at,psychoanalysts who were not licensed in california brought a first amendment challenge to california licensing scheme for mental health providers.the licensing scheme required that persons who provide psychological services to the public for a fee obtain a license,which in turn required particular educational and experiential credentials.id.at.the plaintiffs alleged that the licensing scheme violated their first amendment right to freedom of speech because the license examination tested only certain psychological theories and required certain training plaintiffs had studied and trained under different psychoanalytic theories.id.at.we were equivocal about whether,and to what extent,the licensing scheme in naap implicated any free speech concerns.id.at we conclude that,even if a speech interest is implicated,california licensing scheme passes first amendment scrutiny.emphasis added id.at although some speech interest may be implicated,california contentneutral mental health licensing scheme is a valid exercise of its police power emphasis added.we reasoned that prohibitions of conduct have never been deemed an abridgement of freedom of speech merely because the conduct was in part initiated,evidenced,or carried out by means of language.see id.at ellipsis in original quoting giboney empire storage ice.and,importantly,we specifically rejected the argument that because psychoanalysis is the talking cure,it deserves special first amendment protection because it is pure speech.id.at.we reasoned t he key component of psychoanalysis is the treatment of emotional suffering and depression,not speech.that psychoanalysts employ speech to treat their clients does not entitle them,or their profession,to special first amendment protection.id.internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.
nevertheless,we concluded that the communication that occurs during psychoanalysis is entitled to constitutional protection,but it is not immune from regulation.id.but we neither decided how much protection that communication should receive nor considered whether the level of protection might vary depending on the function of the communication.given california strong interest in regulating mental health,we held that the licensing scheme at issue in naap was a valid exercise of its police power.id.at.
we went on to conclude that,even if the licensing scheme in naap regulated speech,it did not trigger strict scrutiny because it was both content neutral and viewpoint neutral.id.at.we reasoned that the licensing laws did not dictate what can be said between psychologists and patients during treatment.id.further,we observed that those laws were not adopted because of any disagreement with psychoanalytical theories but for the important purpose of protecting public health,safety,and welfare.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we again concluded that the laws were a valid exercise of california police power.id.
in conant,at,we affirmed a district court order granting a permanent injunction that prevented the federal government from revoking a doctor dea registration or initiating an investigation if he or she recommended medical marijuana.the federal government had adopted a policy that a doctor recommendation of marijuana would lead to revocation of his or her license.id.at.but the government was unable to articulate exactly what speech the policy proscribed,describing it only in terms of speech the patient believes to be a recommendation of marijuana.id.at.nevertheless,the demarcation between conduct and speech in conant was clear.the policy prohibited doctors from prescribing or distributing marijuana,and neither we nor the parties disputed the government authority to prohibit doctors from treating patients with marijuana.id.at.further,the parties agreed that revocation of a license was not authorized where a doctor merely discussed the pros and cons of marijuana use.id.at emphasis added.
we ruled that the policy against merely recommending marijuana was both content and.id.at.it was because it covered only speech that include d discussions of the medical use of marijuana,and it was because it condemn ed expression of a particular viewpoint,that medical marijuana would likely help a specific patient.id.we held that the policy did not withstand heightened first amendment scrutiny because it lacked the requisite narrow specificity and left doctors and patients no security for free discussion.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
we distill the following relevant principles from naap and conant communications about medical treatment receive substantial first amendment protection,but the government has more leeway to regulate the conduct necessary to administering treatment itself psychotherapists are not entitled to special first amendment protection merely because the mechanism used to deliver mental health treatment is the spoken word and nevertheless,communication that occurs during psychotherapy does receive some constitutional protection,but it is not immune from regulation.
because those principles,standing alone,do not tell us whether or how the first amendment applies to the regulation of specific mental health treatments,we must go on to consider more generally the first amendment rights of professionals,such as doctors and mental health providers.in determining whether sb is a regulation of speech or conduct,we find it helpful to view this issue along a continuum.
at one end of the continuum,where a professional is engaged in a public dialogue,first amendment protection is at its greatest.thus,for example,a doctor who publicly advocates a treatment that the medical establishment considers outside the mainstream,or even dangerous,is entitled to robust protection under the first amendment just as any person is even though the state has the power to regulate medicine.see lowe sec,d white,concurring where the personal nexus between professional and client does not exist,and a speaker does not purport to be exercising judgment on behalf of any particular individual with whose circumstances he is directly acquainted,government regulation ceases to function as legitimate regulation of professional practice with only incidental impact on speech it becomes regulation of speaking or publishing as such,subject to the first amendment command that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech,or of the press.robert post,informed consent to abortion a first amendment analysis of compelled physician speech,when a physician speaks to the public,his opinions can not be censored and suppressed,even if they are at odds with preponderant opinion within the medical establishment.bailey huggins diagnostic rehab,holding that the first amendment does not permit a court to hold a dentist liable for statements published in a book or made during a news program,even when those statements are contrary to the opinion of the medical establishment.that principle makes sense because communicating to the public on matters of public concern lies at the core of first amendment values.see,snyder phelps,d speech on matters of public concern is at the heart of the first amendment protection.internal quotation markets,brackets,and ellipsis omitted.thus,outside the relationship,doctors are constitutionally equivalent to soapbox orators and pamphleteers,and their speech receives robust protection under the first amendment.
at the midpoint of the continuum,within the confines of a professional relationship,first amendment protection of a professional speech is somewhat diminished.for example,in planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania casey,d,the plurality upheld a requirement that doctors disclose truthful,nonmisleading information to patients about certain risks of abortion 
all that is left of petitioners argument is an asserted first amendment right of a physician not to provide information about the risks of abortion,and childbirth,in a manner mandated by the state.to be sure,the physician first amendment rights not to speak are implicated,but only as part of the practice of medicine,subject to reasonable licensing and regulation by the state.we see no constitutional infirmity in the requirement that the physician provide the information mandated by the state here.citations omitted emphasis added.outside the professional relationship,such a requirement would almost certainly be considered impermissible compelled speech.wooley maynard,d holding that a state could not require a person to display the state motto on his or her license plate.
moreover,doctors are routinely held liable for giving negligent medical advice to their patients,without serious suggestion that the first amendment protects their right to give advice that is not consistent with the accepted standard of care.a doctor may not counsel a patient to rely on quack medicine.the first amendment would not prohibit the doctor loss of license for doing so.conant mccaffrey,no.c wha,wl,at,order unpublished see also shea bd.of med.exam rs,d,the state obligation and power to protect its citizens by regulation of the professional conduct of its health practitioners is well settled t he first amendment does not insulate the verbal charlatan from responsibility for his conduct nor does it impede the state in the proper exercise of its regulatory functions.citations omitted post.at w hen a physician speaks to a patient in the course of medical treatment,his opinions are normally regulated on the theory that they are inseparable from the practice of medicine.and a lawyer may be disciplined for divulging confidences of his client,even though such disclosure is pure speech.see,in re isaacson,state bar court of california,case o,wl,at,unpublished noting prior suspension of bar license for failure to preserve client confidences.thus,the first amendment tolerates a substantial amount of speech regulation within the relationship that it would not tolerate outside of it.and that toleration makes sense when professionals,by means of their licenses,form relationships with clients,the purpose of those relationships is to advance the welfare of the clients,rather than to contribute to public debate.lowe,at white,concurring one who takes the affairs of a client personally in hand and purports to exercise judgment on behalf of the client in the light of the client individual needs and circumstances is properly viewed as engaging in the practice of a profession.
at the other end of the continuum,and where we conclude that sb lands,is the regulation of professional conduct,where the state power is great,even though such regulation may have an incidental effect on speech.see id.just as offer and acceptance are communications incidental to the regulable transaction called a contract,the professional speech is incidental to the conduct of the profession.most,if not all,medical treatment requires speech,but that fact does not give rise to a first amendment claim when the state bans a particular treatment.when a drug is banned,for example,a doctor who treats patients with that drug does not have a first amendment right to speak the words necessary to provide or administer the banned drug.conant,at noting the government authority to ban prescription of marijuana.were it otherwise,then any prohibition of a particular medical treatment would raise first amendment concerns because of its incidental effect on speech.such an application of the first amendment would restrict unduly the states power to regulate the medical profession and would be inconsistent with the principle that it has never been deemed an abridgement of freedom of speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated,evidenced,or carried out by means of language,either spoken,written,or printed.giboney,at.
senate bill regulates conduct.it bans a form of medical treatment for minors it does nothing to prevent licensed therapists from discussing the pros and cons of soce with their patients.senate bill merely prohibits licensed mental health providers from engaging in soce with minors.it is the limited reach of sb that distinguishes the present cases from conant,in which the government policy prohibited speech wholly apart from the actual provision of treatment.under its police power,california has authority to prohibit licensed mental health providers from administering therapies that the legislature has deemed harmful and,under giboney,at,the fact that speech may be used to carry out those therapies does not turn the prohibitions of conduct into prohibitions of speech.in fact,the welch plaintiffs concede that the state has the power to ban aversive types of soce.and we reject the position of the pickup plaintiffs asserted during oral argument that even a ban on aversive types of soce requires heightened scrutiny because of the incidental effect on speech here,unlike in conant,at,the law allows discussions about treatment,recommendations to obtain treatment,and expressions of opinions about soce and homosexuality.
we further conclude that the first amendment does not prevent a state from regulating treatment even when that treatment is performed through speech alone.as we have already held in naap,talk therapy does not receive special first amendment protection merely because it is administered through speech.at.that holding rested on the understanding of talk therapy as the treatment of emotional suffering and depression,not speech.id.internal quotation marks omitted first emphasis added.thus,under naap,to the extent that talk therapy implicates speech,it stands on the same first amendment footing as other forms of medical or mental health treatment.senate bill is subject to deferential review just as are other regulations of the practice of medicine.
our conclusion is consistent with naap statement that communication that occurs during psychoanalysis is entitled to constitutional protection,but it is not immune from regulation.id.certainly,under conant,regulation of communication about treatment must be closely scrutinized.but a regulation of only treatment itself whether physical medicine or mental health treatment implicates free speech interests only incidentally,if at all.to read naap otherwise would contradict its holding that talk therapy is not entitled to special first amendment protection,and it would,in fact,make talk therapy virtually immune from regulation.id.
nor does naap discussion of content and viewpoint discrimination change our conclusion.there,we used both a belt and suspenders.in addition to holding that the licensing scheme at issue was a permissible regulation of conduct,we reasoned that even if california licensing requirements implicated first amendment interests,the requirements did not discriminate on the basis of content or viewpoint.id.at.but here,sb regulates only treatment,and nothing in naap requires us to analyze a regulation of treatment in terms of content and viewpoint discrimination 
because sb regulates only treatment,while leaving mental health providers free to discuss and recommend,or recommend against,soce,we conclude that any effect it may have on free speech interests is merely incidental.therefore,we hold that sb is subject to only rational basis review and must be upheld if it bear s a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest.id.at.
according to the statute,sb advances california interest in protecting the physical and psychological wellbeing of minors,including lesbian,gay,bisexual and transgender youth,and in protecting its minors against exposure to serious harms caused by sexual orientation change efforts.cal.legis.serv.ch,n.without a doubt,protecting the of minors is a legitimate state interest.and we need not decide whether soce actually causes serious harms it is enough that it could reasonably be conceived to be true by the governmental decisionmaker.naap,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the record demonstrates that the legislature acted rationally when it decided to protect the of minors by prohibiting mental health providers from using soce on persons under the legislature relied on the report of the task force of the american psychological association,which concluded that soce has not been demonstrated to be effective and that there have been anecdotal reports of harm,including depression,suicidal thoughts or actions,and substance abuse.the legislature also relied on the opinions of many other professional organizations.each of those organizations opposed the use of soce,concluding,among other things,that homosexuality is not an illness and does not require treatment american school counselor association,soce therapy can provoke guilt and anxiety american academy of pediatrics,it may be harmful national association of social workers,and it may contribute to an enduring sense of stigma and american psychoanalytic association.although the legislature also had before it some evidence that soce is safe and effective,the overwhelming consensus was that soce was harmful and ineffective.on this record,we have no trouble concluding that the legislature acted rationally by relying on that consensus.
plaintiffs argue that the legislature acted irrationally when it banned soce for minors because there is a lack of scientifically credible proof of harm.but,under rational basis review,w e ask only whether there are plausible reasons for the legislature action,and if there are,our inquiry is at an end.romero ochoa holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
therefore,we hold that sb is rationally related to the legitimate government interest of protecting the wellbeing of minors 
expressive association 
we also reject the pickup plaintiffs argument that sb implicates their right to freedom of association because the first amendment protects their choices to enter into and maintain the intimate human relationships between counselors and clients.
first,sb does not prevent mental health providers and clients from entering into and maintaining therapeutic relationships.it prohibits only practices that seek to change an individual sexual orientation.cal.bus.b.therapists are free,but not obligated,to provide therapeutic services,as long as they do not seek to change sexual orientation.
moreover,the relationship is not the type of relationship that the freedom of association has been held to protect.the supreme court decisions have referred to constitutionally protected freedom of association in two distinct senses.roberts jaycees,d.the first type of protected association concerns intimate human relationships,which are implicated in personal decisions about marriage,childbirth,raising children,cohabiting with relatives,and the like.id.at.that type of freedom of association receives protection as a fundamental element of personal liberty.id.at.the second type protects association for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the first amendment speech,assembly,petition for the redress of grievances,and the exercise of religion.id.at.plaintiffs in pickup claim an infringement of only the first type of freedom of association.
although we have not specifically addressed the relationship in terms of freedom of association,we have explained why the relationship is not protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment the relationship between a client and psychoanalyst lasts only as long as the client is willing to pay the fee.even if analysts and clients meet regularly and clients reveal secrets and emotional thoughts to their analysts,these relationships simply do not rise to the level of a fundamental right.naap,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.because the type of associational protection that the pickup plaintiffs claim is rooted in personal liberty,jaycees,at,and because we have already determined that the relationship does not implicate the fundamental rights associated with relationships,naap,at,we conclude that the freedom of association also does not encompass the relationship.
we next hold that sb is not void for vagueness.
it is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.grayned city of rockford,d.nevertheless,perfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict expressive activity.ward rock against racism,d.u ncertainty at a statute margins will not warrant facial invalidation if it is clear what the statute proscribes in the vast majority of its intended applications.cal.teachers ass state bd.of,cir quoting hill colorado,d.a defendant is deemed to have fair notice of an offense if a reasonable person of ordinary intelligence would understand that his or her conduct is prohibited by the law in question.united states weitzenhoff,cir internal quotation marks omitted.but,if the statutory prohibition involves conduct of a select group of persons having specialized knowledge,and the challenged phraseology is indigenous to the idiom of that class,the standard is lowered and a court may uphold a statute which uses words or phrases having a technical or other special meaning,well enough known to enable those within its reach to correctly apply them.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
although the pickup plaintiffs argue that they can not ascertain where the line is between what is prohibited and what is permitted for example,they wonder whether the mere dissemination of information about soce would subject them to discipline the text of sb is clear to a reasonable person.it prohibits mental health providers from engaging in practices that seek to change a minor patient sexual orientation.cal.bus.a reasonable person would understand the statute to prohibit only mental health treatment,including psychotherapy,that aims to alter a minor patient sexual orientation.although plaintiffs present various hypothetical situations to support their vagueness challenge,the supreme court has held that speculation about possible vagueness in hypothetical situations not before the court will not support a facial attack on a statute when it is surely valid in the vast majority of its intended applications.hill,at internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,considering that sb regulates licensed mental health providers,who constitute a select group of persons having specialized knowledge,the standard for clarity is lower.weitzenhoff,at.indeed,it is hard to understand how therapists who identify themselves as soce practitioners can credibly argue that they do not understand what the ban on soce prohibits.
neither is the term sexual orientation vague.its meaning is clear enough to a reasonable person and should be even more apparent to mental health providers.in fact,several provisions in the califo
