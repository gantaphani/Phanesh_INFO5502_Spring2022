enrique andreu and sonia andreu the andreus,on behalf of their son,enrique andreu enrique,appeal the judgment of the united states court of federal claims affirming a special master decision denying their petition for compensation under the national childhood vaccine injury act of,to vaccine act.see andreu sec y of health human,wl.july,court of federal claims decision ii.because we conclude that the special master decision is inconsistent with althen secretary of health human services,and capizzano secretary of health human services,we reverse and remand.
background 
enrique was born on september,he was a baby,born after an uneventful pregnancy.on october,when he was eight weeks old,enrique was inoculated with the diphtheria,pertussis and tetanus dpt vaccine.prior to this vaccination,enrique was developing normally,although he had an ear infection and cold just prior to the time he was vaccinated.
enrique cried a great deal throughout the evening of october.jesus gutierrez,enrique,testified that on the next day,november,enrique left hand jumped for approximately one minute.enrique,eric andreu,also testified that he noticed enrique arm making shaking movements on november,and november.on the evening of november,enrique father observed enrique unusual arm movements.the next day,the andreus took enrique to his pediatrician,who also observed enrique arm movements.the pediatrician informed the andreus that these movements were seizures,and arranged for enrique to be taken to miami children hospital mch.at the hospital,enrique temperature was recorded at degrees,and he was admitted for evaluation.see andreu sec y of health human,claims lexis,at,vaccine court decision i.while at mch,enrique underwent a emission computed tomography spect scan of his brain,which was markedly abnormal,showing hyperfusion,or increased blood flow,in the right precentral gyrus area.id.at.when a brain magnetic resonance imaging mri was performed two hours later,the results were normal.id.enrique was started on medication and released from the hospital on november.
on december,following his discharge from the hospital,enrique was evaluated by trevor resnick,a pediatric neurologist.resnick noted that enrique continued to exhibit normal neurological development,but advised the andreus that he should not receive further pertussis vaccinations.id.at.
enrique experienced another seizure in february.he remained until october,when he was hospitalized with febrile seizures.id.at.over the next month,enrique continued to have seizures,which began with jerking arm movements and then became generalized.id.at.
by january,enrique seizures had become intractable and uncontrolled by medication.court of federal claims decision ii,wl,slip op.at.in july,an interdisciplinary team determined that enrique had an iq of and exhibited significant language and developmental delays.see vaccine court decision i,claims lexis,at,wl.
the andreus initiated their vaccine act claim on october,alleging that the dpt vaccine enrique received on october,caused his seizure disorder.on december,the andreus submitted a letter from marcel deray,enrique treating physician,who stated 
enrique is a patient i have followed since.he has an encephalopathy and seizures.there has been no neurological cause found for his encephalopathy and no other explanation other than the dpt immunization given to him when he was an infant.
enrique case was assigned to special master richard abell,who held an onset hearing to determine the date of enrique first seizure.the special master found gutierrez,enrique,to be a man of great personal dignity and honor,and based upon his testimony,determined that enrique first seizure occurred on november,the day after he received the dpt vaccination.the case was subsequently transferred to special master denise vowell.
on november,the andreus filed an expert report from carlo tornatore,a neurologist.tornatore opined that the dpt vaccination that enrique received on october,resulted in an acute encephalopathy and seizures secondary to the direct toxicity of the components in the pertussis vaccine.according to tornatore,the dpt vaccine contains pertussis toxins and endotoxins,which can cross the barrier,causing overstimulation of the nerves and supporting cells of the brain and provoking seizures.in support of his theory,tornatore cited six articles showing that the pertussis toxin can be used to induce excitotoxicity in the brains of animals.in addition,tornatore noted that persons infected with the pertussis virus can experience encephalopathy and seizures and that this infection is actually in some ways reproduced by the vaccination.
in contrast,the government expert,joel herskowitz,asserted that enrique seizure disorder was not caused by the dpt vaccine he received.herskowitz emphasized that the medical literature does not support the occurrence of afebrile focal seizures as a consequence of a dpt immunization.in addition,although he acknowledged that tornatore theory of causation was biologically plausible,vaccine court decision i,claims lexis,at,wl,he asserted that if there had been an assault to the brain from the pertussis toxin,he would expect to see neurological symptoms other than those enrique experienced.for example,herskowitz would expect that enrique would have experienced generalized,as opposed to focal,seizures,and that he would have had a bulging fontanel and a change in personality and behavior in the period immediately following the vaccination.upon questioning from enrique counsel,however,herskowitz acknowledged that it was reasonable to assume that anything that can cause a devastating injury to the brain can also cause a smaller amount of brain injury in a smaller area of the brain.
on august,the special master issued a decision denying enrique compensation.on march,however,the court of federal claims reversed.the court held that tornatore expert report and testimony,standing alone,would meet the capizzano requirements for recovery of compensation.andreu sec y of health human,wl,court of federal claims decision i.the court also noted,however,that t he question of a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that enrique vaccination was the reason for the injury is a matter of dispute between the expert opinion expressed by tornatore and herskowitz testimony that enrique clinical picture does not match that to be expected from tornatore postulated series of events following administration of the pertussis vaccine on october.id.at.accordingly,the court ordered the special master to reevaluate the evidence and,to the extent possible,obtain the testimony of enrique treating physicians.id.at.in the court view,testimony from enrique treating physicians would be most helpful in establishing whether or not enrique seizure disorder was the result of the dpt vaccine he received.id.at.
on remand,the special master issued a subpoena compelling enrique treating physicians,deray and resnick,to testify.both doctors testified at a hearing held on april,in miami,florida.resnick was asked by counsel for the government why he recommended that enrique receive no further pertussis vaccinations.he responded that although he was surmising,he thought he had made this recommendation because there was a concern over the relationship with the immunization,and i felt it would be safer for him not to have the pertussis,because there was a concern about a reaction.
resnick also testified that y ou can see seizures within hours of a vaccination,often in association with a fever,and that has been quite frequently reported epidemiologically.he asserted,however,that the pertussis vaccine could provoke a seizure in a child who was n ot behaving normally or really irritable even in the absence of a fever.he further noted that in some instances temperature is measured,so that to conclude that a seizure provoked by the dpt vaccine must be related to a fever is somewhat unfair.in addition,resnick agreed that in enrique case no one knows whether the first seizure was febrile or afebrile.
deray testified that it was still his opinion that there is no other explanation for enrique seizure disorder and encephalopathy other than the dpt vaccination.deray explained that there were two reasons that he had concluded that there was a causal connection between the vaccination and enrique malady.first,although deray could identify a cause for seizures in to percent of his patients,doctors,despite extensive testing,had never found anything else to explain enrique seizures.second,since the seizures occurred soon after the vaccination,enrique history would be consistent with the dpt immunization causing seizures.
in addition,deray asserted that whether enrique initial seizures were febrile as opposed to afebrile would not influence his opinion that the dpt vaccine caused enrique seizure disorder.in response to a question from the special master asking whether there was anything in either the spect scan or the mri suggesting that the dpt vaccine caused enrique seizures,deray replied that whether or not the scans were normal does help us either way you can have a normal mri for the rest of your life and have brain damage.on may,the special master issued a decision,again rejecting the andreus claim for compensation under the vaccine act.see andreu sec y of health human,wl.may,vaccine court decision ii.she concluded that the andreus failed to meet their burden to show a logical sequence of cause and effect between enrique october,dpt vaccination and his seizure disorder,noting that w hatever theoretical allure the andreus excitotoxin theory regarding the cause of seizures may have,the weight of the scientific and clinical evidence adduced here does not support pertussis toxin as the cause of enrique afebrile seizures.id.at.
on appeal,the court of federal claims affirmed,concluding that the special master decision to deny compensation was not arbitrary or capricious.although the court noted that even the government expert did not dispute the biologic plausibility of tornatore theory of causation,the court stated that the clinical evidence of record concerning enrique seizures does not show the extent of initial injury sufficient to validate the andreus medical theory of dpt causation.court of federal claims decision ii,wl at.
the andreus then timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction under f.
discussion 
in reviewing an appeal from a judgment of the court of federal claims in a vaccine act case,we apply the same standard of review as the court of federal claims applied to the special master decision.capizzano,at.while we owe no deference to either the special master or the trial court on questions of law,we review the trial court factual findings for clear error.althen,at citations omitted.
childhood vaccinations,though an important part of the public health program,are not without risk.because vaccines often contain either killed bacteria or live but weakened viruses,they can cause serious adverse effects.terran sec y of health human.in enacting the vaccine act,congress recognized that w hile most of the nation children enjoy great benefit from immunization programs,a small but significant number have been gravely injured,sess,reprinted in.it was also acutely aware that the traditional tort system had proven ineffective in providing redress for individuals because it resulted in lengthy delays,high transaction costs,and sometimes no recovery.lowry sec y of health human,see,at,at noting that the civil tort system was inadequate to compensate those individuals whose futures had been destroyed by a injury and whose mounting expenses must be met.on the other hand,the persistent threat of tort claims caused pharmaceutical companies to consider abandoning this field of therapy to the detriment of all concerned.see,at,at.accordingly,congress created a federal compensation scheme under which awards were to be made to persons quickly,easily,and with certainty and generosity.id.at,at.
the vaccine act provides two separate mechanisms to obtain benefits table claims and causation in fact claims.in a table claim,a claimant who shows that he or she received a vaccination listed in the vaccine injury table table,and suffered an injury listed in the table within a prescribed period is afforded a presumption of causation.c c i see pafford sec y of health human.had enrique been born one year earlier,the andreus may well have been able to establish that he suffered a table injury,with its attendant presumption of causation.prior to march,a residual seizure disorder following a dpt vaccination was considered a table injury.see terran,at see also liable sec y of health human,claims lexis,at,wl,before,if a previously person exhibited any significant symptoms of neurologic injury,including seizures,within three days of a dpt vaccination,and then went on to suffer from a chronic neurologic disorder,such person chronic disorder would likely be found to be presumptively,pursuant to the table.under current law,however,a residual seizure disorder no longer qualifies as a table injury.see.
because the andreus can not avail themselves of the table method of establishing causation,they must show that enrique seizure disorder was caused in fact by the dpt vaccine he received.see capizzano,at.in althen,we set forth a test for establishing causation in fact 
concisely stated,a claimant burden is to show by preponderant evidence that the vaccination brought about her injury by providing a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury and a showing of a proximate temporal relationship between vaccination and injury.if a claimant satisfies this burden,she is entitled to recover unless the government shows,also by a preponderance of evidence,that the injury was in fact caused by factors unrelated to the vaccine.
at quotation marks omitted.
the andreus argue that they satisfied all three prongs of the althen test by setting forth what even the government expert agreed was a biologically plausible theory explaining how toxins in the whole cell pertussis vaccine could cause seizures,providing unequivocal testimony from enrique treating physician that the dpt vaccine caused enrique seizure disorder,and establishing a medically appropriate temporal connection between enrique dpt vaccination and his first seizure.we agree.
three fundamental errors infected the special master decision to deny enrique compensation.first,the special master incorrectly determined that the testimony of enrique treating physicians was insufficient to establish a logical sequence of cause and effect between the dpt vaccine enrique received on october,and the seizure he experienced one day later.second,she imposed upon the andreus an elevated evidentiary burden,requiring them to submit conclusive proof in the medical literature linking afebrile seizures to components in the pertussis vaccine.finally,the special master erroneously determined that enrique clinical picture precluded a finding that his seizure disorder was caused by an injury to the brain from the dpt inoculation.
testimony from treating physicians 
there is no dispute that the andreus met the first and third prongs of the althen test.the first prong was satisfied because tornatore,the andreus expert,presented a biologically plausible theory establishing that toxins in the pertussis vaccine can cause seizures court of federal claims decision ii,wl at.likewise,the third prong was satisfied by the striking temporal relationship between the dpt vaccine enrique received on october,and the seizure he experienced one day later.see court of federal claims decision i,wl at an acceptable temporal relationship has been established between the vaccination and the injury.
if a claimant satisfies the first and third prongs of the althen standard,the second prong can be met through medical opinion testimony.capizzano,at.such testimony is quite probative since treating physicians are likely to be in the best position to determine whether a logical sequence of cause and effect show s that the vaccination was the reason for the injury.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted see also althen,at noting that the vaccine act provides for the use of medical opinion as proof of causation zatuchni sec y of health human,relying heavily on the testimony of treating physicians in concluding that vaccine act causation had been established.
here,the testimony of deray,the pediatric neurologist who has treated enrique since,was sufficient to establish a logical sequence of cause and effect between the dpt vaccine enrique received on october,and the seizure he experienced the next day.deray stated unequivocally that he believed that the dpt inoculation caused enrique seizures,and explained that there were t wo things which caused him to reach this conclusion.first,although he was able to identify a cause for seizures in to percent of his patients,deray had found no than the dpt explain the seizures that enrique experienced.see liable,claims lexis,at,wl a claimant was entitled to compensation where she experienced a seizure shortly after her dpt vaccination and doctors,despite extensive testing,had failed to identify any other cause for her chronic neurologic disorder.second,enrique history was consistent with the dpt immunization causing seizures,in the sense that it occurred within three days of the shot.see capizzano,at a treating physician may rely on the close temporal proximity between a vaccine and an injury in concluding that there is a logical sequence of cause and effect between the vaccine and the injury.
the testimony of resnick,the admitting neurologist at the time of enrique initial hospitalization at mch,was not as unequivocal as that of deray,but,read as a whole,also supports a causal connection between the dpt vaccine and enrique november,seizure.resnick testified that y ou can see seizures within hours of a vaccination,often in association with a fever,and that has been quite frequently reported epidemiologically.resnick acknowledged,however,that the pertussis vaccine can provoke seizures even in the absence of a fever in situations where a child is really irritable or n ot behaving normally.he further asserted that it is unfair to focus on whether or not a child has a fever at the time of a seizure because sometimes temperature is measured at that time.
resnick acknowledged,moreover,that in,shortly after enrique was released from mch,he had advised the andreus that enrique should receive no further pertussis vaccinations.resnick testified that although he was just being conservative,he made this recommendation because there was a concern over the relationship of the seizures with the immunization,and i felt it would be safer for enrique not to have the pertussis,because there was a concern about a reaction.a treating doctor recommendation to withhold a particular vaccination can provide probative evidence of a causal link between the vaccination and an injury a claimant has sustained see capizzano,at,t he chief special master erred in not considering the opinions of the treating physicians who concluded that the vaccine was the cause of the claimant injury and who had recommended that she receive no future hepatitis b inoculations.kelley sec y of health human,relying on treating doctor recommendation to withhold future tetanus vaccinations as evidence of causation almeida sec y of health human,wl,claims lexis,at,finding causation under the vaccine act where a claimant had an afebrile seizure on the evening she received a dpt vaccination and her doctors ordered the elimination of the pertussis component from future shots.
ii.conclusive proof in the medical literature 
the special master likewise erred in requiring that the andreus provide conclusive evidence in the medical literature linking afebrile seizures to the dpt vaccine.the andreus expert witness,tornatore testified that it was his opinion that enrique pertussis vaccination of october,resulted in an acute encephalopathy and seizures secondary to the direct toxicity of the components in the pertussis vaccine.as the special master acknowledged,tornatore theory of causation is premised on the unassailable position that the dpt vaccination enrique received contained pertussis toxin and endotoxin.vaccine court decision i,claims lexis,at,wl at.these toxins and endotoxins,according to tornatore,are capable of crossing the barrier very quickly,irritating the nerves and supporting cells of the brain.when the nerves of the brain become irritated,they produce excess electricity,provoking seizures furthermore,if nerves of the brain are injured they can die and form scars,and this area of scarring can lead to an ongoing seizure disorder.in tornatore view,the symptoms enrique crying on the evening of the vaccination coupled with a seizure the next perfectly with his theory that the toxins in the pertussis vaccine can cross the barrier fairly quickly,resulting in subsequent neurological damage.
herskowitz,the government lone expert witness,did little to cast doubt on tornatore theory of causation.to the contrary,he did not dispute the biologic plausibility of tornatore medical theory,court of federal claims decision ii,wl at,and acknowledged that the pertussis toxin can cause neurotoxicity and neurological symptoms.the special master refused to credit tornatore theory of causation,however,on the ground that numerous medical studies that failed to find a relationship between afebrile seizures and dpt vaccination.vaccine court decision ii,wl,at.as a preliminary matter,we note that whether the dpt vaccine can cause afebrile seizures is a matter of considerable debate.see almeida,claims lexis,at,wl finding a causal relation between the dpt vaccine and afebrile seizures.indeed,as noted previously,resnick,the physician who treated enrique soon after his seizure disorder began,agreed that the pertussis vaccine can provoke seizures in a child who is n ot behaving normally even in the absence of fever.deray,likewise,asserted that whether the initial seizure was febrile or afebrile would not change his opinion that the catalyst for enrique seizure disorder was the dpt vaccine he received on october.
furthermore,there is a real question as to whether enrique first seizure was febrile or afebrile because enrique temperature apparently was not taken at the time of his initial seizure,we have no way of knowing whether it was elevated or not.herskowitz,the government expert,testified that a febrile seizure could occur in a child who had a temperature just one degree above normal thus,it is quite possible that enrique had a fever in the period immediately after his vaccination,but that this fever went either unnoticed or unreported by his family members.indeed,when enrique was taken to the hospital on november,his temperature,recorded at degrees,see vaccine court decision i,claims lexis at,wl,was slightly elevated.given that enrique temperature was still slightly elevated at the time he reached the hospital,one might well presume that he had an even higher temperature at the time of his initial seizures.
even assuming arguendo that enrique initial seizure was afebrile,however,the special master erred in requiring conclusive evidence in the medical literature linking the dpt vaccine to afebrile seizures.requiring epidemiologic studies or general acceptance in the scientific or medical communities impermissibly raises a claimant burden under the vaccine act and hinders the system created by congress,in which close calls regarding causation are resolved in favor of injured claimants.capizzano,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.in althen,for example,we determined that a clamant was entitled to recover even where her theory linking the tetanus vaccine to a central nervous system injury involved a sequence hitherto unproven in medicine.at.likewise,in knudsen,we held that the fact that epidemiological evidence pointed to a virus,rather than the dpt vaccine,as the trigger for a child encephalopathy was insufficient to preclude recovery.knudsen sec y of health human,the bare statistical fact that there are more reported cases of viral encephalopathies than there are reported cases of dtp encephalopathies is not evidence that in a particular case an encephalopathy following a dtp vaccination was in fact caused by a viral infection present in the child and not caused by the dtp vaccine.i n a field bereft of complete and direct proof of how vaccines affect the human body,a paucity of medical literature supporting a particular theory of causation can not serve as a bar to recovery.althen,at capizzano,at see daubert merrell dow,d i n some instances but innovative theories will not have been published some propositions,moreover,are too particular,too new,or of too limited interest to be published.
prior to althen,special masters applied the stevens test to determine whether a vaccine caused a claimant injury.see stevens sec y of health human,claims lexis,wl.this test required p roof of confirmation of medical plausibility from the medical community and literature in order to establish causation.id.at,wl.in althen,however,we expressly rejected the stevens test,concluding that requiring objective confirmation in the medical literature prevents the use of circumstantial evidence and negates the system created by congress through the vaccine act.at.here,however,the special master resurrected the defunct stevens test in an effort to discredit tornatore theory of causation.
the special master framed her rejection of tornatore theory of causation under the rubric of a credibility determination.see vaccine court decision ii,wl at.while considerable deference must be accorded to the credibility determinations of special masters,see bradley sec y of health human,this does not mean that a special master can cloak the application of an erroneous legal standard in the guise of a credibility determination,and thereby shield it from appellate review.a trial court makes a credibility determination in order to assess the candor of a fact witness,not to evaluate whether an expert witness medical theory is supported by the weight of epidemiological evidence.see lampe sec y of health human,plager,dissenting noting that the issue is not one of credibility when a highly qualified expert presents a biologically plausible theory linking a claimant injury to the dpt vaccine.
iii.standards for assessing medical literature and epidemiological evidence 
although althen and capizzano make clear that a claimant need not produce medical literature or epidemiological evidence to establish causation under the vaccine act,where such evidence is submitted,the special master can consider it in reaching an informed judgment as to whether a particular vaccination likely caused a particular injury.see daubert,at.noting that one factor in assessing the reliability of expert testimony is whether the theory espoused enjoys general acceptance within a relevant scientific community.althen makes clear that a claimant theory of causation must be supported by a reputable medical or scientific explanation.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted see also knudsen,at requiring a sound and reliable medical or scientific explanation.the assessment of whether a proffered theory of causation is reputable can involve assessment of the relevant scientific data.medical literature and epidemiological evidence must be viewed,however,not through the lens of the laboratorian,but instead from the vantage point of the vaccine act preponderant evidence standard 
the standard of proof required by the vaccine act is simple preponderance of evidence not scientific certainty i t is not plaintiff burden to disprove every possible ground of causation suggested by defendant nor must the findings of the court meet the standards of the laboratorian.
bunting sec y of health human,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
in medical research,attribution of causation is typically not made until a level of very near achieved.liable,claims lexis,at,wl emphasis in original.in contrast,determination of causation in fact under the vaccine act involves ascertaining whether a sequence of cause and effect is logical and legally probable,not medically or scientifically certain.knudsen,at emphasis added bunting,at.here,the andreus submitted data from the national childhood encephalopathy study nces,one of the most significant studies to date of the adverse effects of dpt vaccination,showing that the dpt vaccine is linked to neurological injury as well as data from a study of large populations of vaccinated children,which showed that although the increased risk of afebrile seizures was not as dramatic as the increased risk of febrile seizures in the period following dpt vaccination,it was still almost double that found in the control group.they likewise submitted data from animal studies showing that the pertussis toxin can cause neurological damage in addition,they provided data demonstrating that those actually afflicted with known as whooping cough can experience seizures and their expert,tornatore,explained that this infection is actually in some ways reproduced by the vaccination.see vaccine court decision i,claims lexis,at,wl discussing a report from the institutes of medicine indicating that central nervous complications,which include but are not limited to seizures,occur in to percent of those afflicted with pertussis.the medical literature submitted by the andreus does not establish with scientific certainty that the dpt vaccine caused enrique malady,but it is an integral part of the circumstantial evidence linking the vaccine to his seizure disorder.
iv.enrique clinical picture 
we also disagree with the special master determination that enrique clinical picture was inconsistent with a toxic injury to the brain from the pertussis vaccine.herskowitz,the government expert witness,acknowledged that the pertussis antigen can cause neurotoxicity.vaccine court decision i,claims lexis,at,wl.he further acknowledged that children actually afflicted with pertussis can develop neurological symptoms.id.at,wl.herskowitz asserted,however,that if components in the pertussis vaccine had caused an injury to enrique brain,he would expect to see symptoms such as a bulging fontanel and an immediate change in personality and behavior.furthermore,he testified that the pertussis toxin would be unlikely to confine itself to a small area of the brain,and thus he would expect to see generalized seizures,instead of the focal seizures enrique initially experienced.
in response to questioning from enrique attorney,however,herskowitz acknowledged that if the pertussis vaccine could cause a devastating encephalopathy,it could also cause a smaller amount of brain injury in a smaller area of the brain.notably,herskowitz did not assert that it would be impossible for the pertussis toxin to injure one area of enrique brain while at the same time leaving other areas unscathed.
neither the special master nor the court of federal claims is to be seen as a vehicle for ascertaining precisely how and why the dpt vaccine sometimes destroy s the health and lives of certain children while safely immunizing most others.knudsen,at.by the same token,neither tribunal is to be seen as a vehicle for ascertaining why the dpt vaccine might immediately cause a devastating brain injury in one child and a more modest initial injury in another.the government does not dispute that whatever caused enrique first seizure also led to his subsequent seizure disorder.see court of federal claims decision i,wl at it is agreed by all concerned that whatever caused the seizures commencing on november,is also the cause for all subsequent seizure activity.the pivotal issue,therefore,is whether the dpt vaccine triggered enrique initial seizure.although herskowitz asserted that he would expect to see a more devastating initial brain injury,he did not establish that toxins from the october,dpt vaccination could not have caused the focal seizure enrique experienced on the following day.thus,his testimony,standing alone,is insufficient to discredit tornatore theory of causation.
likewise,the fact that enrique met developmental milestones for a period after his initial seizures is not inconsistent with tornatore postulated mechanism of causation.presumably,enrique initial seizures,which were relatively brief,had little impact on his neurological development,but subsequent seizures,which became intractable and u
