in this case,a federal jury found that the defendant properties a residence and proceeds seized from a bank account were subject to civil forfeiture.specifically,the jury found that each property derived from the proceeds of a health care fraud and money laundering scheme committed by mert kivanc the son of turan and duygu kivanc claimants.claimants,who own the properties,unsuccessfully contested the properties forfeiture before the district court.
on appeal,claimants contend that the district court erred by denying their motions to dismiss,to permit remote testimony,and for judgment as a matter of law.claimants further argue that the district court mistakenly prohibited the admission of certain documents and refused to give their proposed jury instructions.for the reasons below,we affirm the district court various rulings.
the federal bureau of investigation fbi first began investigating kivanc,a physician who operated a medical practice in falls church,virginia,in april,after receiving a report from a former patient that kivanc was controlled substances.this former patient alleged that kivanc prescribed her whatever drugs she wanted without performing a physical exam or medical tests.in october,kivanc was indicted for distributing and conspiring to distribute controlled substances.the government has not,however,arrested kivanc because in november,he fled the united states for turkey.
on october,in the course of the fbi investigation of kivanc alleged illegal distribution of prescription drugs,fbi agent aaron weeter interviewed two of kivanc former employees and learned of a health care fraud scheme involving remicade,a relatively expensive antibody drug that is infused into the vein to control certain autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
in,the fbi began investigating the allegations of kivanc remicade health care fraud scheme.fbi agents interviewed kivanc former employees and patients,analyzed his billing,supply,and bank records,and discovered evidence indicating that kivanc had engaged in a scheme to defraud his patients health care benefit programs through several methods of fraudulent remicade billing.khoa nguyen kivanc former medical assistant who pled guilty to conspiring to distribute controlled at trial that he and kivanc employed four main methods of fraudulent remicade billing billing for more remicade than the patients actually received billing for remicade infusions when the patients received a less expensive steroid medication billing for remicade infusions when the patients did not receive any infusions and billing for remicade paid for by other patients health care benefit programs.in april,kivanc was indicted for health care fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud based on the remicade scheme.
colleen seres,an fbi forensic accountant who reviewed documents related to kivanc investigation,testified at trial that during the period of november,through october,of kivanc remicade billing was for remicade supply that he did not possess.seres calculated that kivanc fraudulently collected at least in remicade billings from seven health care benefit programs.seres traced in fraudulent remicade payments to kivanc medical practice business account ending in at wachovia bank wachovia business account.
claimants originally purchased the residential property at university drive,fairfax,virginia defendant real property in.in september,claimants transferred defendant real property to kivanc for.the same day,kivanc obtained a mortgage on the property.in february and march,kivanc wrote a series of five checks totaling approximately from his wachovia business account to pay the mortgage loan.seres testified that she traced these five checks to remicade proceeds.shortly after kivanc made these payments,the mortgage was paid in full as evidenced by a certificate of satisfaction dated april.
in february,kivanc hired a construction contractor,michael daughtry,to completely renovate defendant real property.kivanc approved daughtry renovation design,and daughtry submitted the bills for the renovation project to kivanc.
on may,while the renovation project was ongoing,kivanc executed a deed transferring defendant real property back to claimants for.daughtry testified that he did not know that kivanc sold defendant real property to claimants in may,and he did not even meet claimants until the fall of.kivanc continued to pay daughtry for the renovation project in person until late october,just before kivanc fled to turkey.from that point forward,kivanc brother paid daughtry with checks drawn on kivanc business account.claimants moved into defendant real property sometime in.
seres testified that kivanc paid a total of approximately for the renovation project via a series of checks written from his wachovia business account.kivanc paid approximately of that amount after the deed transferring the property to claimants was recorded on june.
between november and may,kivanc also wrote four checks totaling to his father,turan,from his wachovia business account.seres traced these four checks to remicade payments.further,seres traced one of these checks dated january,and in the amount of from its date of deposit into claimants bank account through july,when the united states marshals service seized the remaining from claimants bank account ending in at pnc bank defendant bank account.
on june,the government filed a verified complaint for forfeiture in rem against defendant real property alleging that it was subject to forfeiture pursuant to a a and c as property derived from health care fraud proceeds and involved in money laundering.on august,the government filed an amended complaint adding defendant bank account.claimants filed a verified claim of interest for both properties.
claimants then filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that the statute of limitations barred the action.the district court denied that motion.
claimants also filed motions to permit turan and kivanc to testify at trial remotely from turkey.in support of turan motion,claimants submitted two letters from turan doctor in turkey stating that his health prevented him from traveling to the united states,and the government submitted an opposing letter from an american doctor.the district court denied both motions 
the government filed a motion in limine to admit kivanc statements against his interest into evidence at trial.claimants opposed the motion and argued that if the court admitted kivanc statements,federal rule of evidence should permit them to introduce an affidavit filed by kivanc and a letter kivanc wrote to his attorney.the district court conditionally granted the government motion but denied claimants request to introduce kivanc affidavit and letter.
the case was tried before a jury in february in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia.at the close of the government evidence and all of the evidence,claimants moved for judgment as a matter of law under rule,which the district court denied.additionally,the district court rejected some of claimants proposed jury instructions,including their theory of the case instruction and proportionality instruction as applied to money laundering.
the jury returned a verdict in the government favor,finding that the government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that kivanc conspired to commit health care fraud and committed money laundering,that the defendant properties derived from health care fraud proceeds,and that the defendant properties were involved in concealment and transactional money laundering.the district court entered judgment accordingly,and claimants appealed.
on appeal,claimants contend the district court erred by denying their motion to dismiss denying their motions to permit turan and kivanc to testify remotely admitting kivanc hearsay statements yet prohibiting the admission of kivanc affidavit and letter to his attorney failing to give their requested jury instructions and denying their rule motion for judgment as a matter of law.
claimants first contend that the district court erred by denying their motion to dismiss because the statute of limitations barred the action.
in an appeal from an in rem civil forfeiture proceeding,we review a district court factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.united states undetermined amount of currency,cir.the district court determination of when the government discovered an alleged underlying offense and the related triggering of the statute of limitations under is a factual determination reviewed for clear error.united states in currency,cir.
the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that may be raised in a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.dean pilgrim pride,cir.under section,the government has five years after the time when the alleged offense was discovered to initiate forfeiture proceedings.united states minor,cir.courts apply a known or standard to section,meaning that an offense is discovered when the g overnment discovers or possesses the means to discover the alleged wrong,whichever occurs first,at see also united states james daniel good prop.titled in name of james daniel good,cir.
claimants argue that the government first discovered kivanc general health care fraud in april thus,the limitations period expired before the complaint was filed in june.the government contends that although it discovered kivanc overprescribing of controlled substances in april,the remicade health care fraud is a separate offense that the government discovered only in october.the district court agreed with the government and denied claimants motion to dismiss.
claimants characterize kivanc health care fraud as a single,continuing offense and cite in support of their argument.in,the sixth circuit concluded that a forfeiture action was because even though the government seized currency from relatively recent bingo operations,it had discovered the illegal gambling operation more than five years before filing the forfeiture action.at.the court emphasized that the statute of limitations runs from the date of discovery of an offense and noted that the government can not disregard its discovery of earlier occurring offenses in preference for later offenses which would produce a more favorable timeline.id.emphasis in original.
but involved a single,continuing offense the illegal operation of a gambling business whereas here,kivanc committed multiple,separate offenses.see united states suffield terrace,skokie,cir distinguishing because each incident of smuggling illegal cigars into the country constitutes a new,separate offense for section purposes.when there is a continuing course of conduct with multiple,distinct underlying crimes that independently could support forfeiture of the same property,the limitations period starts afresh with each new offense.id.at.thus,a court may adjudicate a forfeiture action as long as one underlying offense is not,even if the statute of limitations has run on the remaining offenses.id.
the record in this case shows that kivanc committed at least two separate offenses.see id.at.
regarding the first offense,the government began investigating kivanc in april after the drug enforcement agency interviewed kivanc former patient kimberly maxwell.maxwell alleged that kivanc overprescribed controlled substances to her,including several pain medications such as hydrocodone,oxycodone,and methadose,without a medical exam and billed her insurance for services that she never received.maxwell did not allege that kivanc prescribed,administered,or billed her insurance for remicade.
regarding the second offense,the fbi became aware of the remicade fraud on october,after agent weeter interviewed two of kivanc former employees who specifically mentioned the remicade infusion scheme.prior to that date,the fbi was investigating kivanc illegal distribution of prescription drugs,but was not aware of anything related to remicade.
we conclude that the remicade health care fraud was a new alleged offense for purposes of section.see id.at.the fact that the government separately indicted kivanc for each crime supports our conclusion the government charged kivanc with nineteen counts of distributing and conspiring to distribute controlled substances under a and in october and later,in april,indicted kivanc for the distinct crimes of counts of health care fraud and conspiring to commit health care fraud under and based on the remicade scheme.the government based its civil forfeiture action not on kivanc overprescribing of controlled substances,but specifically on the remicade health care fraud.because the government filed its complaint in this case within five years of its discovery of the remicade scheme in october,the district court correctly denied claimants motion to dismiss based on the statute of limitations.
claimants next argue that the district court erred by denying their motions to permit turan and kivanc to testify remotely from turkey.
this court reviews a district court rulings regarding the presentation of evidence for abuse of discretion.united states ford,cir.the same standard applies to rulings regarding the use of remote testimony.palmer valdez,cir thornton snyder,cir.federal rule of civil procedure governs the taking of testimony at trial and states that f or good cause in compelling circumstances and with appropriate safeguards,the court may permit testimony in open court by contemporaneous transmission from a different location.a.
claimants argue that they showed good cause and compelling circumstances for turan to testify remotely because of his poor health.specifically,claimants cite two letters from turan turkish physician stating that turan should not travel long distances due to his medical conditions,which include kidney stones,hypertension,and fainting.but the government provided an opposing letter from an american doctor who concluded that turan medical conditions did not prevent travel.
the magistrate judge reviewed the competing letters and heard arguments regarding the importance of turan testimony.the magistrate judge then denied claimants motion to permit turan remote testimony,noting that i do see anything in this case that would lead me to believe that he can not travel.the district court affirmed that decision,concluding that the magistrate judge did not clearly err by weighing the benefit of live testimony against the dueling expert reports regarding turan health and any inconvenience of international travel.given these facts,we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion by denying claimants motion to permit turan to testify remotely 
claimants also contend that they showed good cause and compelling circumstances for kivanc to testify remotely from turkey.at the hearing on claimants motion,their attorney argued that even though the government subpoenaed kivanc and indicted him on criminal charges,kivanc was unwilling to come back to the united states but would testify remotely.these facts do not amount to good cause or compelling circumstances to testify remotely.as the district court noted,allowing kivanc to testify remotely under these circumstances would make a mockery of our system of justice.accordingly,we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion by denying claimants motion.
claimants next argue that the district court erred by admit ting hearsay statements against kivanc interest and by prohibiting the admission of two documents under rule.we will not overturn such evidentiary rulings absent an abuse of discretion.united states hedgepeth,cir.and if an evidentiary ruling is found to be erroneous,we review the error for harmlessness.
we first consider whether the district court abused its discretion by admitting hearsay statements against kivanc interest.
federal rule of evidence generally prohibits the admission of statements offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted.see also.c defining hearsay.federal rule of evidence lists several exceptions to rule,including statements against interest,which are admissible if the declarant is unavailable as a witness.b.a statement against interest is a statement that 
a a reasonable person in the declarant position would have made only if the person believed it to be true because,when made,it h
