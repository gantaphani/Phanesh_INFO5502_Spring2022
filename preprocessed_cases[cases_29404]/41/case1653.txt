scott medhaug medhaug applied to the social security administration ssa for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income collectively,benefits.after a hearing,the administrative law judge alj denied medhaug claim,finding medhaug retained the ability to perform his past relevant work.the ssa appeals council declined to review the alj decision.medhaug appealed to the district court which reversed the alj and awarded benefits.the commissioner of social security commissioner now appeals the district court judgment asserting the district court erred in finding the commissioner decision was not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole,and even if the commissioner decision were not supported by substantial evidence,the district court erred by awarding benefits,rather than remanding to the agency for further consideration.we conclude the commissioner decision was supported by substantial evidence,and we affirm the alj.
background 
medical history 
medhaug first injured his back while serving in the united states army during the first persian gulf war.medhaug sustained the injury when he stood up from a sitting position while carrying full gear.in,medhaug received a medical discharge from the military as a result of his back condition.
medhaug began seeking treatment from the department of veterans affairs medical center vamc in may when medhaug first reported to the vamc,medhaug explained he had a history of back pain and associated leg pain,which had gotten worse over the past two years.medhaug underwent an mri which revealed l umbar spondylosis with disc bulges and mild neural foraminal narrowing but no frank nerve root impingement or central canal stenosis.medhaug was provided steroid injections at the vamc pain clinic,and was prescribed oral pain medications.
medhaug returned to the vamc in november,and reported he was a ble to work,but he was in constant pain from his back condition.medhaug stated he took oral pain medication and limited his activity when the pain was severe.losing weight helped reduce the back pain.medhaug continued to seek treatment from the vamc over the next year.
in july,medhaug was seen at the vamc,and he reported his pain was at a level four out of ten,and extensive physical activity with lifting aggravated the pain.medhaug also stated mild exercise made him feel better,and he engaged in such exercise at home.medhaug received another mri,and the radiologist reviewing the mri concluded medhaug had degenerative disc disease in vertebrae through,and mild right neural foraminal narrowing from through.the radiologist also found l eft paracentral disk protrusion from through,which contributed to some mild central canal narrowing.medhaug pain was treated with steroid injections,and medhaug continued to take oral pain medications when needed.
in october,medhaug returned to the vamc for treatment,reported his pain was at a level four,and stated he continued to exercise at home,which made him feel better.medhaug indicated his last steroid injection lasted for two months.he began to experience pain again in the third month,but was satisfied with the result.vamc clinicians provided medhaug with another steroid injection and continued medhaug prescription pain medications.during the visit,medhaug was in no apparent distress and was ambulating without any problems.the following month,medhaug called the vamc and reported he had not experienced any pain relief as a result of the last steroid injection.on december,medhaug left a message with the pain clinic indicating his pain was still not under control.later that month,on december,medhaug contacted the vamc and reported he was experiencing constant back pain at a level of seven or eight.medhaug explained he had not experienced any pain relief after the last steroid injection,he had difficulty standing and sitting,and his pain was interfering with his ability to sleep.
on january,medhaug was provided another steroid injection.during the visit,medhaug complain ed of dull,aching pain present over the lower back in an axial distribution with occasional sic pain extending into the thigh and numbness down the right leg.the clinician noted medhaug ambulate d unassisted with a normal gait.medhaug called the vamc on january,and stated he did not experience any relief from the steroid injection.medhaug insisted the pain had become more severe over the last few days and the pain was impacting his ability to sleep and engage in activity.
the pain clinic referred medhaug for a psychology consult,and on march,medhaug attended a psychological interview.during the interview,medhaug indicated he had chronic lower back pain which interfered with his sleep,and lifting exacerbated his pain.however,medhaug reported he took tylenol and a muscle relaxant when the pain was most severe,which would help him sleep.medhaug expressed his belief that he needed surgery,but was denied surgery because his pain was not bad enough.the staff psychologist assessment noted,medhaug insistence on a medical cure for his lower back pain raises questions about his receptiveness to alternative approaches to pain management.however,the approach of psychology helping patients cope with chronic pain was addressed with medhaug and he was provided with a pain meditation tape and advised to return.
medhaug returned to the vamc psychology department on march,for psychotherapy.medhaug insisted his current approaches to dealing with both his pain and his insomnia are the only realistic options available to him.while medhaug acknowledged chronic pain may be a lifelong reality for him,he dismissed the idea of using psychological pain management techniques.medhaug and the staff psychologist agreed further psychological treatment was not indicated.
on may,medhaug returned to the vamc pain clinic and reported continued lower back pain occasionally extending to his thigh and right leg.once again,the clinician noted medhaug ambulate d unassisted with a normal gait.medhaug was prescribed a new medication.at a appointment on august,medhaug reported the trial medication did not help him much.the clinician recorded medhaug was in no apparent distress and ambulat ed unassisted.
on or about june,medhaug contacted the vamc and requested vamc staff send information to child support recovery services stating medhaug was disabled.a nurse practitioner notified medhaug that he would only be disabled if he could not perform the duties of any job.medhaug angrily responded that he could do any job,such as physical labor.the nurse practitioner explained that in order to be considered disabled,medhaug needed to be unable to perform the duties of any job,even those which would not require physical labor.
medhaug received another mri on september.this mri revealed m ild degenerative changes,but n o significant change when compared to prior study.medhaug attended a appointment on october,and reported his back pain was not stable and the medication was controlling the pain.medhaug also noted the p ain was keeping him up all the time,but h e ha d taken some muscle relaxants and those help ed.on october,medhaug called the vamc,indicated he increased his pain medication,and the increased dosage was working.
on november,the vamc conducted of medhaug spine.the showed s light anterolisthesis of in relationship to,and m ild to moderate spondylosis of the lumbar spine.a resident physician reviewed medhaug latest mri and,and reported mild degenerative changes,no significant neural compression,and no instability.the resident physician recommended nonsurgical management,and a supervising physician agreed.
the vamc continued to treat medhaug with various prescription pain medications and occasional steroid injections over the next several years.medhaug continued to complain of similar pain,sometimes indicating the pain was controlled through medication and steroid injections,and other times reporting the pain was not controlled.medhaug final mri in this record was conducted on november.this mri appears to demonstrate findings similar to medhaug previous mri however,the radiologist did not expressly compare the mri with previous images,making the results difficult for us to compare.medhaug treatment did not change.
application for benefits 
on august,medhaug applied to the ssa for disability benefits.medhaug claimed his disability began on november,the same date he was laid off as a laborer for an electric company for reasons unrelated to his injury.in his disability report,medhaug indicated,after he was laid off and became disabled,he worked as a computer technician for nine months,as a taxi cab driver for four months,and as a laborer at a manufacturing company for less than one month,with some of the positions overlapping.
to support his claim for disability benefits,medhaug submitted a letter from william iverson iverson,medhaug treating physician,which was dated october.this letter stated 
scott medhaug is a patient under my care at the vamc in iowa city.he has chronic back pain and has suffered with it for more than years.he has several disc bulges on his latest mri.w hile severe enough to cause him pain and limitation,nothing can be done surgically at this time.
he has constant daily back pain,which severely limits his activity.he is unable to bend,lift or stand for any long period of time.he also can not sit for a long period of time without getting up to move around due to the pain.in addition,his sleep is severely limited with the pain.he does not sleep regular hours and often times falls asleep any time during the day when the pain wears him out.based on these problems,it is almost impossible for him to hold a full time job.he is also limited in many of the available jobs as well.
during oral argument,medhaug counsel indicated he was not sure if iverson letter was drafted to support medhaug disability claim or to notify child support enforcement authorities medhaug was limited in his ability to work.
as part of his claim for disability benefits,medhaug received a psychological evaluation by glenn haban haban on october.haban noted medhaug gait was somewhat slow,but steady,and h is sitting posture was relaxed,without obvious pain behaviors.haban concluded,t he mental status examination was suggestive of an adjustment disorder with depressed mood,but medhaug mental state did not limit medhaug ability to do work related activities.
the iowa disability determinations services evaluated medhaug application for disability benefits on two separate occasions,once during an initial review,and again upon reconsideration.during the evaluation and reevaluation process,multiple professionals reviewed medhaug medical records.jan hunter,concluded there was evidence showing medhaug had mild degenerative disc disease,unassociated with any neurosensory defect,and doubted the credibility of medhaug complaints of pain and significant limitations due to the absence of objective findings on physical examination supportive of this degree of restriction.wilson wilson agreed and questioned the contents of iverson letter because medhaug current exams were essentially normal as medhaug ha d good strength,sensation and gait and medhaug was also able to do current activities of daily living without any assistance.the first psychologist to review medhaug records found medhaug impairments not severe and opined medhaug suffered from adjustment disorder with depressed mood,but found this disorder resulted in only mild restrictions on medhaug daily activities.a second clinical psychologist,upon reconsideration of medhaug claim,agreed with these findings without further explanation.
medhaug application for benefits was denied initially on december,and again after reconsideration of his claim on february.medhaug filed a timely written request for an administrative hearing on march.
administrative proceedings and subsequent litigation 
on august,medhaug administrative hearing was held by video teleconference.the hearing lasted minutes.medhaug did not have counsel present at the hearing.the alj informed medhaug of his right to have counsel present,and offered to continue the hearing to allow medhaug an opportunity to seek counsel,but medhaug declined.
during the hearing,medhaug testified he has a bachelor of arts in studies in religion.medhaug testified he was in pain all the time,which prevented him from sleeping,and from doing a lot of things.medhaug explained his pain was caused by deteriorated disks and herniated disks in his back.medhaug reported the vamc had recently conducted nerve damage testing,and the results demonstrated medhaug did not have any nerve damage.medhaug indicated he tries to do all of his own chores,such as cleaning,shopping,and cooking,and he occasionally mows the lawn when he is feeling really well.when the alj asked medhaug how much weight medhaug could lift,medhaug reported it was very painful to pick up his daughter.medhaug also stated he could pick up a bag of dog food,but it would be very painful and he would suffer later.medhaug reported he could lift an gallon of milk without pain,but lifting a case of pop would cause him a lot of pain.
medhaug reported he could only sit for a couple of hours before he needed a ten to fifteen minute break to walk around,but the big problem would be getting out of the chair,not necessarily the time sitting.medhaug also claimed he could stand for a half an hour or more,and approximately three weeks before the hearing,medhaug walked a total of four miles to and from church.medhaug further testified the steroid injections he was receiving helped relieve some of his pain.when asked how he supported himself,medhaug stated he was working as a school bus driver,five days a week,for two to three hours in the morning,and then again for two to three hours in the afternoon.however,medhaug testified he often took days off when he was in pain,and if they knew at work how much medication he was taking,they would dismiss him.medhaug had been working in that capacity since october.medhaug also testified he received disability support and compensation from the.
a vocational expert also testified at the hearing.the alj presented the vocational expert with a hypothetical,asking whether a man with a college education and medhaug past work history,with a diagnosis of degenerative disk disease,who was limited to lifting twenty pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently,and further limited to being on his feet a total of two hours per day,with only occasional balancing,stooping,crouching,kneeling,crawling,or climbing,could perform medhaug past relevant work.the vocational expert stated such a person could work in medhaug previous positions as a c omputer operator,user support analyst,and taxi driver.the alj then presented the vocational expert with a second hypothetical,asking if the same person described above would be employable if he required two absences per month and two or more unscheduled breaks per day.the vocational expert replied in the negative.
the alj denied medhaug application,finding medhaug was not disabled under the ssa.medhaug appealed his claim to the ssa appeals council,and the appeals council declined to review the alj decision,making the alj decision the final decision of the commissioner.medhaug sought judicial review of the commissioner decision.the district court reversed the commissioner denial of benefits,finding the alj did not give sufficient weight to the opinion of medhaug treating physician and medhaug own subjective complaints of pain,and erred in raising a question as to whether medhaug restricted work activities were for child support or vocational rehabilitation reasons.without further explanation,the district court declared the alj decision was not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole,and concluded medhaug was unable to engage in substantial gainful activity.the district court awarded disability benefits without remanding to the ssa for further consideration.the commissioner appeals the district court reversal and award of benefits.
