kathleen coleman appeals the district court judgment affirming the denial of her application for disability insurance benefits under the social security act.the district court concluded the denial of benefits by the commissioner of the social security administration ssa was supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.finding the ssa development of the record inadequate,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
in her application for disability benefits,coleman alleged she was disabled due to a back injury,degenerative disc disease,leg pain,and a latex allergy.the ssa denied her application and coleman sought review by an administrative law judge alj.after holding a hearing in september,the alj determined coleman retained the ability to perform sedentary work as long as that work provided no exposure to extreme temperature changes or toxic fumes,and no stooping,kneeling,crawling,or squatting.the alj also found coleman had a limited ability to deal with the public,maintain attention,and concentrate due to moderately severe pain.given these restrictions,the alj determined coleman could not perform her past work but could perform a significant number of jobs which exist in iowa such as a document preparer or a table worker,making her ineligible for disability benefits.review of the alj decision was denied by the ssa appeals council,making it the final decision of the commissioner.although describing the disability determination as a very close call,app,the district court affirmed the commissioner final decision.on appeal,coleman contends the district court committed reversible error because the commissioner gave improper weight to medical opinions in the record,failed to include her severe latex allergy and need to frequently alternate between a standing and seated position in determining her residual functional capacity rfc,and improperly discounted her subjective complaints of nearly constant severe pain and sensitivity to latex exposure.
we review de novo the district court decision upholding the commissioner denial of disability benefits.bowman barnhart,cir.our review is limited to a determination of whether the decision of the alj is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.g ramirez barnhart,cir.substantial evidence is less than a preponderance,but enough so that a reasonable mind might find it adequate to support the conclusion.johnson apfel,cir.but t he substantial evidence test employed in reviewing administrative findings is more than a mere search of the record for evidence supporting the commissioner findings.gavin heckler,cir.substantial evidence on the record as a whole requires a more scrutinizing analysis.id.quoting smith heckler,cir.in reviewing the administrative decision,t he substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.universal camera nlrb,quoted in gavin,at.
in general,the claimant bears the burden of proving his or her entitlement to disability insurance benefits under the social security act.a thomas sullivan,cir.but if the commissioner finds the claimant can not return to her past relevant work,the burden of production shifts to the commissioner,who must show the claimant retains the ability to perform other kinds of jobs which exist in substantial numbers in the national economy.see harris barnhart,cir nevland apfel,cir.the evidence must show the claimant has the ability to perform the requisite physical acts day in and day out,in the sometimes competitive and stressful conditions in which real people work in the real world.mccoy schweiker,cir en banc,abrogated on other grounds,d.
coleman first contends the alj improperly weighted the medical opinions of john piper,john birkett,charles bahn,and thomas graham in determining her rfc.we review the propriety of the weight afforded each opinion below.
piper opinion.the alj gave great weight to piper opinion.piper was a treating specialist whose opinion is generally entitled to more weight.hensley barnhart,cir.in june,piper stated 
i have had the opportunity to look at coleman functional capacity evaluation.it appears that it was a valid study,and therefore i have released her to work according to the restrictions detailed in that functional capacity evaluation,which are for sedentary work.
at emphasis added.whether a claimant can work sedentary work is a question for a vocational expert,not a medical source.see medical source opinions on issues reserved to the commissioner,soc.sec.rul.hereinafter ssr july,wl,at adjudicators must not assume that a medical source using terms such as sedentary and light is aware of our definitions of these terms.the judgment regarding the extent to which an individual is able to perform exertional ranges of work goes beyond medical judgment regarding what an individual can still do.in this case,there is no way to know what restrictions within sedentary work piper intended since the residual functional capacity evaluation he relied on in releasing her to work is not in the record.therefore his opinion does not aid in resolving whether coleman needs to alternate positions,and if so,how frequently,or to what extent,if any,her latex allergy limits her ability to work.
the ssa regulations provide 
recontacting medical sources.when the evidence we receive from your treating physician or other medical source is inadequate for us to determine whether you are disabled,we will need additional information to reach a determination or a decision.to obtain the information,we will take the following actions.
we will first recontact your treating physician or other medical source to determine whether the additional information is readily available.we will seek additional evidence or clarification from your medical source when the report from your medical source contains a conflict or ambiguity that must be resolved,the report does not contain all the necessary information,or does not appear to be based on medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.we may do this by requesting copies of your medical source records,a new report,or a more detailed report from your medical source,including your treating source,or by telephoning your medical source.in every instance where medical evidence is obtained over the telephone,the telephone report will be sent to the source for review,signature and return.
e emphasis added see snead barnhart,cir precedent confirms that the alj bears a responsibility to develop the record fairly and fully,independent of the claimant burden to press his case to discover evidence which might alter the outcome of the disability determination.here,the alj neglected her duty to resolve the ambiguity in piper work release opinion through further inquiry.as a result,the district court erred in not remanding the case to the ssa for further development of the medical record.specifically,the district court should have directed the ssa to attempt to locate the residual functional capacity assessment relied on and referenced by piper in his june opinion,submit interrogatories to piper to determine what functional restrictions he believed were appropriate as part of the june work release.
birkett opinion.the alj rejected birkett opinion,finding it not in accord with the evidence.at.birkett opined in july that coleman could not perform competitive work because she would need to be very careful about the type of environment she would be working in due to latex allergy and severe back problems.at.the ssa does not dispute coleman had an anaphylactic reaction to latex during an attempted back fusion surgery,as a result of which she spent two days in the intensive care unit.further,physicians described her latex allergy as severe.at graham during the surgical procedure she suffered a severe reaction to latex at birkett s he was found to be dramatically allergic to latex and had a severe reaction.on december,francisco peralta,an allergy and immune system specialist,stated prior to coleman undergoing a latex allergy test,i would strongly recommend a environment until we ascertain the true nature of the patient problems.at emphasis added
