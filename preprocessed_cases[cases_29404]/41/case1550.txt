this appeal from the dismissal of a suit seeking an order to arbitrate requires us to consider the intersection of class actions,arbitration,and colorado river abstention.underlying the appeal is a dispute between a group of affiliated corporations cigna for short and physicians,hospitals,and other providers of health care with which cigna,an administrator of employee plans,has contracts for the provision of health care to the participants in the plans.under these managed care contracts,as they are known,cigna reimburses its contract partners for the services that they provide in fulfillment of its obligations to participants in the plans that it administers.the providers claim that after making these contracts cigna installed a computer program for calculating the amount it owed them that has resulted in systematic underpayment,in breach of their contracts.
in may the providers filed a class action in an illinois state court against cigna which cigna wanted to but could not remove to federal court because one of the named plaintiffs was a citizen of texas,as is one of the cigna affiliates named as defendants.however,many of the contracts contain an arbitration clause,and in july,just days after the end of the period for providers to opt out if they wanted from the state court suit,cigna filed suit in federal district court against the named plaintiffs in the state court suit minus the texas physician and the rest of the class.it based federal jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship and sought an order under section of the federal arbitration act title of the to compel arbitration of all disputes arising under contracts with members of the class that contain an arbitration clause.these are not all the disputes between cigna and the class.a number of the contracts we do know how many do not contain an arbitration clause.but some or all of the providers that had such contracts may have received from cigna a document called program requirements that,cigna argues,grafted an arbitration clause onto the contract.because the arbitrability of the disputes under these contracts would have to be determined on a basis,cigna argues that the arbitrability of those disputes can not be decided in a class action and so must be resolved by the state court.cigna position is inconsistent,since the suit in the state court,the suit in which it concedes that the issue of the arbitrability of these other disputes must be resolved,is itself a class action.however that may be,a few days after filing its federal class action suit cigna moved the state court to order arbitration of the arbitrable disputes not encompassed by the federal suit.
in january the district judge dismissed the suit on the basis of the abstention doctrine created by colorado river water conservation district united states,d,precipitating this appeal.by this time,because the state court judge had refused to stay the proceedings before him pending the resolution of cigna federal suit,cigna had produced hundreds of thousands of contracts in response to the providers discovery requests and these contracts were being held in a document depository in belleville,illinois,the site of the state court.cigna was particularly disturbed by the state judge refusal to stay discovery of the merits of the contract disputes it argues that discovery with respect to any dispute that is arbitrable is the business of the arbitrators.but at least the state judge did say that he had not by denying the stay intended to prejudge the issue of arbitrability.
the providers position on that issue is unclear,but clearly they are not yet prepared to concede that all their contractual disputes,or even all that arise out of contracts that contain an arbitration clause,are arbitrable.the issue of arbitrability is at present before the state judge with briefs due this month.
a federal court is authorized to stay proceedings in a lawsuit before it because parallel proceedings are pending in another court,either federal or state.moses cone memorial hospital mercury construction,d will calvert fire ins,d plurality opinion finova capital ryan helicopters,cir burns watler,cir.it should not dismiss the proceedings before it,however.see selmon portsmouth drive condominium ass n,cir,and cases cited there.that would be illogical the fact that a parallel case,especially one brought by the opposing party,is pending says nothing about the merits or propriety of the suit in the abstaining court.logic aside,a stay permits the federal court to retain jurisdiction in case the state court action does not meet its anticipated end.a stay has the additional advantage of bringing the case back before the same federal judge if a determination is needed as to the preclusive effects of the state judgment or decisions.lumen construction,brant construction,cir.in light of these considerations,the providers counsel was right to concede at the argument of the appeal that the district judge order should be reformed from a dismissal to a stay.laduke burlington northern,cir attwood mendocino coast district hospital,cir see also tice american airlines,cir.we note parenthetically that had the district judge stayed the suit rather than dismissing it,we would still have had appellate jurisdiction because a stay of the federal suit pending resolution of the state suit would mean that there would be no further litigation in the federal forum the state court judgment on the issue would be res judicata.moses cone memorial hospital mercury construction,supra,at see also in re kozeny,cir per curiam schall joyce,cir general reinsurance,cir.
abstention in favor of a parallel proceeding in another court is disfavored,because it deprives the plaintiff of his choice of forum in the likely event that,as just noted,the effect of abstention is to make the decision in the parallel proceeding res judicata in the proceeding that has been stayed.see also evans transportation scullin steel,cir.but there is no hard and fast rule as to when abstention is proper or improper,moses cone memorial hospital mercury construction,supra,at,and the close relation between the decision to abstain and normal docket control a district judge is routinely required to decide how fast to move particular cases along makes it appropriate to give at least some weight to the judge decision to abstain.id.at.will calvert fire ins,supra,at.sverdrup edwardsville community unit school district,cir burnett physician online,cir.
cigna points out that no federal appellate court has ever upheld a decision to abstain in a suit seeking an order to compel arbitration.the reason may just be,however,that such decisions are rare.in re mercury construction,cir en banc,aff.under the name moses cone memorial hospital mercury construction,supra ferrari north america,crown auto dealerships,kmw,wl.apart from a handful that have been reversed,we have found only five green tree financial holt,pepsico oficina central de asesoria y ayuda tecnica,lexington ins.reliance ins,civ,wl,at.june,globale selcke,c,wl,at,ernst,potlatch.it is not as if any appellate court had held that abstention is never appropriate in a suit to compel arbitration.none has.cigna cites we care hair development,engen,cir,a case much like this,it is that there was no issue of abstention.the only issue was whether the federal court had jurisdiction to compel arbitration notwithstanding the parallel proceeding in the state court.we held that it did,but this holding obviously would not have precluded abstention,which presupposes jurisdiction,had abstention been sought.in services,edgewater hospital,and cir,we explicitly left open the issue presented by this appeal.
cigna principal argument against abstention,as distinct from its futile invocation of inapposite authority,is that the providers state court suit was an effort to derail its contractual right to arbitration.it points out that federal courts will not permit a party to a contract to circumvent an arbitration clause by commencing litigation in a state court.in re mercury construction,supra,at.but what exactly is circumvention in this context the right to arbitrate arguably conferred by the parties con
