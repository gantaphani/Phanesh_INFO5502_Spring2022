background 
speciale worked for hcsc as a senior account executive from june through november.hcsc is an independent licensee of blue cross,and as an employee,speciale was covered by the program,entitling her to benefits if she should ever become disabled the program is administered by the national employee benefits committee nebc of blue cross.the nebc delegated responsibilities for the program to the national employee benefits association neba,which in turn assigned the authority to determine claims to the medical review committee.
speciale job was hectic she was required to respond constantly to problems and emergencies with clients or brokers and spent nearly half of her time traveling to meetings.her job required movement,talking,and listening,as well as climbing stairs and lifting up to pounds from either the floor or table level.she was also required to work overtime seven or more times per month.
speciale medical history 
although her job could be considered stressful for the average person in good health,speciale suffered from a number of medical conditions that made her position even more difficult.she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in,and her symptoms,though initially manageable,began to worsen in.kevin snydersmith,her physician,recorded in september of that speciale complained of severe back pain,as well as pain and numbness in her left shoulder and leg.snydersmith did not think all of her symptoms were explained by the fibromyalgia,so he diagnosed her with chronic pain syndrome.he noted that her job is fairly intense and she had used most of her sick days because of her medical problems.
snydersmith diagnosis of chronic pain syndrome set in motion treatment and diagnostic regimes that ultimately resulted in speciale application for disability benefits on april.in october snydersmith noted that speciale was on at least four different medications and also received shots of toradol once or twice per month to control her pain.that same month speciale met with rheumatologist ann winny,who spoke at length with speciale and believed her symptoms were progressively worsening.speciale mentioned she might take time off from work to see if the stress of her job was the cause of her deterioration.winny believed the symptoms were due to fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndrome but did not rule out the possibility of multiple sclerosis ms.
speciale met with brian on november.after evaluating her symptoms and a recent mri of the brain,he believed she was suffering from some form of demyelinating disease and wanted her to have a lumbar puncture to further investigate this possibility.reiterated his suspicions in february when speciale came into his office and reported that she was dizzy and tired,suffered extreme back pain,and had difficulty walking.thought this could be explained by an exacerbation of a demyelinating disease but noted that speciale had an appointment with boris vern,head of the multiple sclerosis clinic at the university of illinois,for testing.reported to blue cross on march that speciale could not work due to her severe pain and fatigue and her return to work was indefinite pending the outcome of testing by vern.tests conducted on march indicated that speciale sensory symptoms are overshadowed and probably colored by her chronic pain,which seems to be of myofascial origin.vern thought that ms could be a possibility but that it was not strongly supported by the available lab studies.
while under the care of,speciale continued to see snydersmith.in,he provided her with a quad cane to ease her walking difficulties.his notes reveal that speciale was suffering from frequent,painful kidney stones.she was put on various medications,including vicodin,and at one point was admitted to the emergency room for pain control and hydration.in february snydersmith referred speciale to physiatrist dennis keane.after an initial consultation,keane wrote that speciale symptoms were somewhat alleviated after a vacation to arizona however,she still experienced a great deal of pain in her back that often radiated down her left leg.he seemed to assume that speciale suffered from ms because she used a quad cane to help her slightly unsteady gait from her he reexamined speciale in early june and found her to be doing dramatically better after being placed on oral steroids.
despite vern doubts,speciale other doctors believed she was suffering from symptoms related to wrote on may that he doubted fibromyalgia accounted for her problems because she has had it for years and it has not caused the symptoms of which she was more recently complaining.less then a month later he wrote i feel her clinical picture is most compatible with multiple sclerosis.i do not see her improving enough at this time to return to work.snydersmith supported this diagnosis and found her symptoms were likely due to developing winny agreed that speciale is probably disabled at this point because her ms makes it difficult for her to walk.
although speciale symptoms were serious,the tentative diagnosis of ms turned out to be inaccurate.snydersmith told blue cross nurse sue majewski on august that the lumbar puncture did not confirm ms and the diagnosis was simply fibromyalgia that had been worsening in recent months.he could not predict how long speciale could stand or walk each day as he no longer managed her case keane had taken over treatment of her pain.
speciale application for disability benefits was reviewed in august by richard blonsky,blue cross senior medical consultant.blonsky filled out a physician recommendation form and noted that there was no clear evidence of he went on to state that speciale suffered from fibromyalgia for years and had worked,making this a very marginal case.he also noted the lack of confirmatory findings and that the record contained a lot of subjective complaints.he concluded i am not totally convinced of her disability.were there any,performance issues blonsky reevaluated speciale file on september,this time confirming she did not have ms and reaffirming his previous finding that she was not disabled.indeed,keane had responded to an inquiry from the mrc by pointing out that speciale suffered from back pain,leg spasms,weakness,and fatigue.even so,he told the mrc that speciale was physically capable of performing sedentary and jobs.
procedural history 
the mrc informed speciale of its decision to deny her benefits application on october.it noted that snydersmith,and winny all believed speciale had ms when they said she was disabled,but it was not known whether the negative lumbar puncture would change their opinions.further,the committee noted that keane believed she could work with some limitations such as changing positions frequently and his opinion carried weight because of his specialty in pain management.the letter also stated that the mrc conducted a vocational analysis,which revealed at least six career opportunities in the surrounding area that would pay a comparable salary while still accommodating speciale restrictions.
speciale timely appealed the denial of b
