background 
factual background 
american eagle,a commercial airline carrier regulated by the federal aviation administration faa and the department of transportation dot,employs pittari as a flight attendant.because flight attendants are responsible for the safety of airline passengers and must think clearly and quickly in emergency situations,the faa classifies this position as a safety sensitive position.a safety sensitive position features job functions that may impact the safety of the public,an employee,or the employee.the essential functions of a flight attendant position include being able to handle and provide effective leadership in emergency situations assess situations quickly deal with disorderly,sick,or injured passengers determine whether to initiate emergency procedures memorize the location of emergency equipment methodically apply emergency procedures and evacuate passengers from an aircraft rapidly.
in june,pittari informed american eagle medical department medical by letter he was taking the medication neurontin.rosalyn beaty beaty,a medical staff physician,acknowledged receiving pittari letter,but took no action to prohibit pittari from working as a flight attendant.
in april,pittari submitted a request for intermittent leave under the family and medical leave act fmla to obtain treatment for depression and anxiety.american eagle policy mandates disclosure of all medications taken by employees in order for medical to determine whether a flight attendant is fit for duty.in compliance with this policy,william mccollum mccollum,pittari physician,informed american eagle of pittari medications,which included neurontin,baclofen,and provigil.medical became concerned these medications,specifically neurontin and baclofen,could impair pittari cognitive ability to perform the duties of pittari position as a flight attendant.
based on its concerns about pittari possible cognitive impairment,american eagle arranged for pittari to take a microcog screening test microcog on june.moreault moreault,an independent psychologist,reviewed pittari microcog results.in moreault opinion,the test indicated a ability to think,process information,and reason generally and abstractly.additionally,the test revealed stress,fatigue,or anxiousness might further compromise pittari reaction time.moreault also concluded pittari skills might prove challenging,particularly during emergency situations.
on june,after reviewing pittari microcog results,medical placed pittari on temporary work restriction from duties.both mccollum and pittari agreed,as of june,based upon the microcog results,american eagle had legitimate concerns about allowing pittari to work as a flight attendant.pittari understood if his cognitive abilities improved,american eagle would return him to his former position.despite being restricted from working as a flight attendant,pittari was capable of performing other roles,such as gate agent,ticket agent,and baggage handler,or other duties,such as directing passengers in need of assistance,or performing administrative or secretarial computer work.however,pittari never worked in these capacities.
on july,mccollum notified american eagle by letter he had changed pittari medications and pittari was ready to be retested.on july,pittari took a second microcog,the results of which indicated little or no change from the initial test.after the second microcog,moreault recommended a more complete assessment to ensure pittari could work as a flight attendant.on august and,pittari underwent a neuropsychological evaluation,performed by gene chambers chambers.on october,at pittari request,chambers sent medical a letter stating although pittari suffered a cognitive impairment that was the result of a trauma pittari incurred while working for american eagle,pittari currently had the mental capacity to perform as a flight attendant,particularly because he had performed the job repetitively in the past.however,because medical was still concerned about pittari response to potential unique emergency situations rather than repetitive functions,medical maintained pittari job restrictions and requested a copy of chambers neuropsychological assessment of pittari.
on october,medical received chambers report,which indicated pittari had a mild to moderate range of impairment,resulting in low processing speed and deficits,as well as impaired mental flexibility,judgment,and mental efficiency.medical did not believe the report assessment and recommendations correlated with chambers earlier letter,and therefore declined to remove pittari work restriction.
in december,in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement between american eagle and the association of flight attendants,pittari requested a binding medical evaluation.on january and,ronald mcinroe mcinroe,a clinical neuropsychologist,evaluated pittari and concluded pittari was fit for duty as a flight attendant.in mcinroe opinion,pittari cognitive function had improved since chambers evaluation.mcinroe concluded either pittari medications were controlling his condition or pittari no longer needed the medications.in a letter dated february,mcinroe opined pittari was able to perform the essential functions of a flight attendant and he was fit for duty as of january.medical released pittari to return to work as a flight attendant on february,after receiving mcinroe report and letter.

approximately four months before trial,american eagle made an offer of judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure in the amount of,inclusive of prejudgment interest,attorney fees,and costs.pittari did not accept the offer of judgment.
following a jury trial,the jury returned a verdict in pittari favor on the ada claim and in american eagle favor on the fmla claim.the jury awarded pittari in actual damages and in compensatory damages.after the district court entered judgment on the jury verdict,pittari moved to recover his attorney fees and costs,and american eagle filed an application for costs under rule.the district court denied american eagle application and granted pittari motion,awarding pittari in attorney fees and in costs,including in expert witness fees.this appeal followed.
