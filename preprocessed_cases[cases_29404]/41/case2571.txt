george ochoa was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death in.see ochoa state.with the denial of his first federal habeas petition still under review on appeal,he now seeks to challenge his sentence on the basis that he is mentally retarded and hence ineligible for the death penalty under atkins virginia,d.he contends he is entitled to proceed on this new claim for two reasons because his first habeas action has not been finally resolved,the claim is not second or successive for purposes of b and thus may be brought without need of this court authorization under the statute and if such authorization is necessary,he has made the prima facie showing,required by b c,that his claim satisfies the conditions for proceeding on a second or successive habeas petition under the provision in b a.after review of ochoa motion to proceed on the atkins claim,we ordered formal briefing and oral argument we now hold that the pendency of an appeal from the denial of a first petition does not obviate the need for authorization of newly raised claims,but that ochoa has made the prima facie showing required for authorization to proceed under b a.
ochoa first habeas petition was denied in.he appealed that disposition to this court,but,following the supreme court decision in atkins,he returned to state court to pursue an atkins claim while his first habeas appeal was abated.unlike defendants tried after atkins,who can raise the issue of mental retardation in their initial criminal prosecution,see blonner state,discussing procedure for resolving atkins defense,ochoa had to pursue his claim in the context.on the basis of preliminary evidentiary proceedings,the oklahoma court of criminal appeals ordered a trial on the issue of ochoa mental retardation,which ultimately resulted in the denial of his atkins claim.see ochoa state,cert.denied,d.the procedural and substantive adequacy of that proceeding is contested,but that is beyond the scope of our consideration here.with his state remedies exhausted,ochoa filed his motion for leave to pursue habeas relief under atkins.
before turning to the issues raised by that motion,we emphasize that ochoa falls within a narrow category of habeas petitioners.obviously only those facing the death penalty may even invoke atkins.and atkins reflects one of the rare instances in which the supreme court has announced a new rule of constitutional law that it has also expressly made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review finally,ochoa was not only convicted before atkins but had also filed and been denied relief on his first habeas petition by that time.our decision today authorizes the pursuit of a second or successive petition in light of this unique combination of circumstances.
the need for b authorization 
ochoa argues as a threshold matter that authorization under b is unnecessary so long as his first habeas action has not been finally adjudicated on appeal.he relies on a second circuit case,whab united states,cir,for this proposition.no other circuit has followed whab,and we decline to do so.while this court has not addressed the precise procedural argument made here,it is clearly precluded by general principles in our case law addressing various attempts to circumvent b requirements,particularly following the supreme court decision in gonzalez crosby,d deeming.b motion that interjects new claims into habeas action a second or successive petition under b.
in united states nelson,cir,we held that a request to add new claims after the district court has adjudicated a habeas action must be preceded by a motion to vacate under rule b and that,per gonzalez,b applies to the rule b motion as if it were a second or successive petition.see also united states pedraza,cir holding effort to raise new claim by motion under rule e is likewise equivalent of second or successive petition under b.consistent with nelson,ochoa may pursue his atkins claim only by securing authorization through a motion under b.any other procedure used to raise the new claim,however ostensibly associated with his initial habeas action,is properly deemed such a motion.
ochoa emphasizes that in nelson,unlike here,no appeal was pending in the first habeas action when new claims were raised by motion.but this procedural circumstance has nothing to do with the relevance of nelson to our analysis.the point is that b authorization is required whenever substantively new claims are raised procedural associations with prior habeas matters must not obscure the fact that the petitioner is really pursuing a second or successive petition.given this basic point,nothing in gonzalez,nelson,or our other cases suggests that whether a rule b motion or other procedural vehicle may be used to circumvent b depends on the incidental fact that an appeal is or is not pending from the underlying habeas proceeding 
the approach advocated by ochoa would greatly undermine the policy against piecemeal litigation embodied in b.multiple habeas claims could be successively raised without statutory constraint for as long as a first habeas case remained pending in the system.if the proper treatment of proceedings in habeas,carefully explained in gonzalez to prevent procedural circumvention of b,left open an exception this broad,that point would have been made explicit in the statute or,at least,in the supreme court primary decision implementing the statute.
we conclude that ochoa atkins claim is second or successive within the meaning of b.accordingly,we turn to his alternative argument that his claim satisfies the conditions for authorization under b a.
second or successive authorization under b a 
the state concedes that ochoa atkins claim satisfies the conditions stated in b a,the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable.nevertheless,the state opposes authorization because,it contends,ochoa prima facie showing under b c must also include a preliminary demonstration of mental retardation that he has not made.we find no basis in the plain language and functional structure of the statute to expand our gatekeeping role to include such a merits review.having satisfied the conditions in b a,ochoa is entitled to proceed on his atkins claim in the district court.
merits review under b a b c 
section b c directs the appellate court to determine whether the petitioner has ma d e a prima facie showing that his application satisfies the requirements of this subsection.emphasis added.this statutory mandate does not direct the appellate court to engage in a preliminary merits assessment.rather,it focuses our inquiry solely on the conditions specified in b that justify raising a new habeas claim,the claim relies on a new rule of law made retroactive on collateral review by the supreme court,b a,or involves new facts clearly and convincingly showing that,but for the alleged constitutional error,no reasonable jury would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense,b b.the conditions in b a,with which we are concerned,look solely to temporal issues relating to the availability of the constitutional authority invoked,not to any assessment regarding the strength of the petitioner case 
nor is the authorization process structured to suggest an inquiry beyond the conditions specified in b.the typical authorization proceeding is an ex parte matter,with little if any factual record,that is to be,if denied in thirty days.these parameters indicate a streamlined procedure with a narrow focus on a fixed set of and easily assessed criteria,which would be disrupted by engaging the manifold merits issues raised by potentially complex,constitutional claims.moreover,the authorization process is assigned to an appellate court,whose institutional role ordinarily excludes and of the sort implicated,for example,in the state demand that we make a determination in the first instance whether ochoa is in fact mentally retarded.the distribution of judicial responsibility reflected in the plain language of the which the appellate court makes an expedited assessment of whether a new habeas claim falls w
