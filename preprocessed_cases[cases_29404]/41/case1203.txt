the plaintiffs are seventeen current and former nurse practitioners nps employed by the department of veterans affairs va at the cleveland veterans affairs medical center vamc in brecksville,ohio.the plaintiffs brought suit against the va under the equal pay act epa,d et,alleging that,as predominantly female nps,they are paid at a lower rate than the predominantly male physician assistants pas for performing jobs of equal skill,effort,and responsibility under similar working conditions.plaintiff laura also brought a claim under title vii,et.although the district court held that plaintiffs had established a prima facie case of wage discrimination under the epa,it granted summary judgment to the va because it concluded that the va had established its affirmative defense that a factor other than sex,the separate pay scales,was responsible for any sexually discriminatory difference in pay.we agree with the district court conclusion that plaintiffs established a prima facie case under the epa,but because we conclude that plaintiffs have raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding the reason for the pay differential between predominantly female nps and predominantly male pas,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendant and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
facts and procedural history 
the cleveland vamc consists of two hospitals and thirteen clinics in northeast ohio,and its facilities treat almost veterans per year.within the vamc medical system,nurse practitioners and physician assistants are medical practitioners who provide care to veterans.within the cleveland vamc,nurse practitioners are over female,and physician assistants are over male.nps are registered nurses rns with advanced training and are required to have a master degree.the va functional statement for an np requires that a candidate be certified as a nurse practitioner by the american nursing association and be licensed by the state as a registered nurse.an outgrowth of the historically profession of nursing,nps have traditionally been female.pas,in contrast,are not required to have a bachelor or master degree.pas must have graduated from an approved allied health program,where they are trained in patient assessments,histories and physicals,treatments,and technical skills.the va functional statement for a pa requires a minimum of two years of working experience either as a pa or in a similar primary healthcare provider position.if hired after,a pa must be certified by the national commission of certification of physician assistants.as a profession,pas find their roots within the military,where they were historically trained in a technical field to assist physicians.traditionally pas have been male.
nps and pas working at the vamc and other va hospitals are compensated according to pay scales,codified in two different statutory frameworks.nps and other nurses are paid on a nursing pay scale,as outlined by the nurse pay act of.the nurse pay act creates a nurse locality pay system,which ensures that the va is not a pay leader in a given local market,but that its nurses are paid competitively.d e.the system contains five grade levels nurse v and a range of basic pay for each.in order to maintain competitive pay for va nurses,the nurse pay act authorizes facility directors to adjust rates of pay for covered positions to amounts comparable to the corresponding positions in the local labor market,so long as adjustments do not exceed the highest beginning rates for corresponding positions.a nurse starting salary is determined by the nursing professional standards board npsb,and a nurse or supervisor can later request that the npsb adjust an individual placement on the pay scale to reflect a promotion or higher educational degree.most nps at the cleveland vamc are categorized as nurse iii on the locality pay system,which as of meant a top pay rate of annually.some nps are categorized at the lower nurse ii rate,which in had a top pay rate of annually.
pas are paid according to the general schedule gs pay scale established in.each pa is classified as associate,full,intermediate,senior,or chief pay grades,depending upon that individual education,experience,and assignment complexity.a pa starting pay is determined by the medical professional standards board mpsb based upon experience,qualifications,and credentials.the mpsb also considers subsequent special adjustments based upon a pa experience and advancement.assuming their performance is satisfactory,both nps and pas receive regular step increases within their pay grade and cost of living adjustments as authorized by congress.
congress has enacted several statutory provisions that afford va officials the discretion to increase the rate of pay for va health care professionals when necessary.under title,the secretary of veterans affairs may increase the basic pay of va personnel where necessary to provide competitive pay,achieve adequate staffing,and to recruit personnel with specialized skills,particularly those who hold skills that are especially difficult or demanding.b.the nurse pay act also includes a provision that authorizes the va to increase the rate of pay for nurses as needed.while normally the maximum rate of basic pay for a grade is percent of the minimum rate of basic pay for that grade,c states that if the secretary determines that a higher maximum pay rate is necessary with respect to any grade in order to recruit and retain a sufficient number of personnel,the secretary may increase the pay up to a maximum ratio of percent.
in,the cleveland vamc adopted a special pay scale for pas because it was having problems recruiting local candidates for pa positions.pas working at the vamc have continued to receive pay at this special scale since,despite the fact that there has not been a recruitment or retention problem for pas in recent memory.william montague,the current director of the cleveland vamc,testified that the vamc has not experienced any difficulty recruiting or retaining pas since his tenure began in.nevertheless,montague has continued to certify to the va that it remains necessary to pay pas on an increased pay scale in order to ensure adequate staffing and competitive pay.
in,plaintiff laura learned that her colleague greg mcdonald,a pa,was earning more money for performing the same duties than she did in her role as an np.and mcdonald worked,and like other nps and pas at the vamc,often covered for one another while on the job.found this pay differential particularly disturbing because she and another np had actually trained mcdonald to do his job at the vamc.sought redress within her chain of command she went before her superiors asking that as an np she be paid at a rate equivalent to a pa,and cited evidence that other va facilities had special pay scales for nps that accomplished wage parity between the two positions.when she brought her complaint to director montague,he stated that he was not here to cure the social ills of society,joint appendix at dep.at montague dep.at recalling conversation and stating he does not deny using similar phrase,but that was a nurse,and that was why the pay difference existed.in august,filed an administrative complaint with the eeoc,arguing that the pay differential between pas and nps violated the epa.an evidentiary hearing was held in,and in june,an administrative law judge rejected claim,stating that she had not established a prima facie case under the epa.
in september,and eighteen other nps filed this suit alleging violations of the epa and title vii.plaintiffs allege that they are predominantly female whereas pas are predominantly male,that as nps they perform jobs of equal skill,effort,and responsibility as pas,that as nps they are higher educated and have received more training than pas,and that they are paid less than pas.plaintiffs argue that the va decision to continue paying pas on the special pay scale while at the same time refusing to create a special pay scale for nps has resulted in illegal wage discrimination.even though pas perform substantially equal work to nps,defendants pay them on a special pay scale which plaintiffs allege enables pas to earn up to more per year than similarly situated nps.plaintiffs point to va employee mary knowles,who is both an np and a pa,but who chooses not to invoke her greater educational qualifications as an np because under the existing pay schemes she earns more money working as a.
the va answered the complaint and filed a motion to dismiss in june.in september,the district court denied defendant motion to dismiss,and discovery ensued.in october,the va filed a motion for summary judgment,and in november,plaintiffs filed a motion to strike portions of the va memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment as well as an opposition to defendant summary judgment motion.on june,the district court issued an order requesting information from the parties about the special pay rate for pas.the district court was concerned that the va contention that it could place the nps on a special salary scale only if a recruitment and retention problem existed was a pretext for sex discrimination.the parties filed supplemental briefs on the issue.on july,the district court granted the va motion for summary judgment,denied the plaintiffs motion to strike,and entered judgment for the.the district court held that the plaintiffs had established a prima facie violation of the epa,and proceeded to consider whether the va had proven any of its asserted affirmative defenses.
in its motion for summary judgment,the va contended that the two separate pay scales,not sex,was the cause of any pay differences between the nps and pas at the vamc.the va argued that these separate pay scales meet three of the four affirmative defenses under the epa a seniority system,a merit system,and any other factor other than sex.see d.the district court agreed that the different pay scales constituted a factor other than sex finding that an affirmative defense had been proven such that no genuine issue of material fact remained,the district court granted summary judgment for the va on both the epa and title vii claims.seventeen of the plaintiffs then filed a timely appeal.

plaintiffs equal pay act claims 
plaintiffs prima facie case under the epa 
the epa prohibits employers from paying an employee at a rate less than that paid to an employee of the opposite sex for performing equal work.see d.in order to establish a prima facie case of wage discrimination under the epa,plaintiffs must show that an employer pays different wages to employees of opposite sexes for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill,effort,and responsibility,and which are performed under similar working conditions.corning glass works brennan,d quoting d.jobs need not be identical in order to be considered equal work under the epa.shultz wheaton glass,cir,cert.denied,d.whether a job is substantially equal for purposes of the epa is determined on a basis and resolved by an overall comparison of the work,not its individual segments.odomes nucare,cir orderlies and nurses aides perform substantially equal work.

the district court concluded that plaintiffs had established a prima facie case of wage discrimination in violation of the epa because they presented sufficient evidence such that a reasonable jury could conclude that the positions of np and pa were fungible at the cleveland vamc,and that a pa performing substantially equal duties as an np would earn more money.the va argues that the district court erred in this conclusion,and urges us to affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on the ground that plaintiffs can not demonstrate a prima facie epa case.the va attack on plaintiff prima facie case is.first,the va argues that nps and pas do not perform substantially equal work,and second,that plaintiffs have not identified appropriate male comparators that earn more.after carefully analyzing the parties arguments and the record,we affirm the district court conclusion that plaintiffs have met their prima facie burden.
the district court properly rejected the va argument that the jobs of nps and pas are not substantially equal because nps possess greater education and skill.while differences in skill,effort,or responsibility might be sufficient to justify a finding that two jobs are not equal if the greater skill,effort,or responsibility has been required of the higher paid sex,such differences do not justify such a finding where the greater skill,effort,or responsibility is required of the lower paid sex.a.the va argument that pas and nps do not perform substantially equal work is also belied by the record,which compels the conclusion that the two positions are fungible at the cleveland vamc.we agree with the court of federal claims that evidence that the positions being compared are fungible can support a prima facie case under the epa.allison,finding that plaintiffs had established a prima facie case because the va advertised for either nps or pas to fill open positions and the chief np for one section had authored a memo to the va chief of staff stating that the two groups had similar responsibilities.although the va repeatedly asserts in its brief that the positions at the cleveland vamc are not substantially equal,there is undisputed evidence in the record that the defendant considers the positions to be fungible.
in his testimony before the administrative law judge,ted parran,the medical director of the veterans addiction recovery center,explained that he works with and supervises both nps and pas.he agreed that the two jobs involve similar skill,effort,and responsibility,and explained that when a position is open it is advertised as a middle level practitioner to be filled either by an np or a.when looking to fill these practitioner positions,parran stated,w e do consider whether it a physicians assistant or a nurse practitioner as an issue of qualification.at parran test.at.
in addition to parran,several other vamc employees other than plaintiffs also testified that for hiring purposes,the cleveland vamc regards nps and pas as fungible.sondra marcum,chief nurse executive and associate director for patient and nursing services,testified that the basic duties of both jobs at the vamc can be performed by either nps or pas.the cleveland vamc,like the portland veteran facility involved in allison,advertised open positions as seeking either an np or a.allison.at.rebecca everett,human resources specialist at the cleveland vamc,testified that most of the vacancy announcements that she has posted have stated that the position could be filled by either a pa or an np.everett agreed that np and pa mcdonald were doing the identical job.furthermore,based upon her conversations with vamc managers,everett understanding of the two positions at the vamc is that either profession can do what is typically done by most physician assistants and nurse practitioners.at everett dep.at.
judy trepkowski,a vamc human resources specialist,stated that at no time in her current position could she recall a job listing that was specifically for an np or a pa,rather than both.trepkowski testified that at the vamc,nps and pas have similar skills and perform similar functions.hiring of nps and pas is an interdisciplinary situation where a person from either background would be acceptable to do the work at that time.at trepkowski dep.at.when the va is interested in having a person who has a broader educational background and a broader basis,a job posting may specifically request that applicants be nps.at marcum dep.at.
despite this overwhelming evidence that the cleveland vamc employed nps and pas interchangeably,the va cites beall curtis,to support its claim that nps and pas do not perform substantially equal work at the vamc.in beall,an epa claim brought by nps was rejected on the ground that the plaintiffs failed to establish that their jobs as nps were substantially equal to a more recently hired and male.in that case,however,the pa being paid a higher wage possessed certain skills that the nps did not,particularly in the area of management of trauma,and his experience with trauma meant that he had different job duties and greater responsibilities than the plaintiffs in that he could take night call in rotation with physicians.id.at.the va,however,has never argued nor has it presented any evidence to suggest that pas have different duties or more responsibility than do nps within the cleveland vamc,and the va conceded at oral argument that there is nothing that a pa can do that an np can not do.on the contrary,nps are more highly educated,and discovery produced compelling evidence that nps and pas perform similar jobs at the vamc.the district court conclusion that plaintiffs established that nps and pas at the vamc perform substantially equal work was proper.
next,the va argues that plaintiffs can not identify appropriate male comparators who are paid more,which the va claims is fatal to plaintiffs prima facie case.the va asserts that complete gender diversity is needed between the comparison classes to satisfy the requirements and thus,because approximately of nps are male and of pas are female,the plaintiffs have failed in their obligation to show an appropriate male comparator.citing corning glass works,at,which stated that a few women among the higher paid groups did not negate an epa claim,the district court correctly rejected this argument and determined that whether a policy affects both male and female employees to such an extent that an epa claim would be invalid is a question of fact.we agree that complete diversity between plaintiffs and comparators is not required to state a prima facie case under the epa.as the supreme court stated in corning glass works,to permit a company to escape that equal pay obligation by agreeing to allow some women to work in the male dominated position at a higher rate of pay as vacancies occurred would frustrate,not serve,congress ends.id.at.see also allison.at holding that a group of predominantly female nps at the portland,oregon va produced evidence that they performed substantially equal work as the predominantly male pas for less pay in violation of the epa peters,at holding that the text of the epa does not require diversity between the classes arthur college of benedict,d,stating that the epa does not require perfect diversity between the comparison classes,but when the challenged policy affects both men and women equally,there can be no epa violation.the fact that a small minority of the vamc pas are female and a small minority of nps are male is not fatal to plaintiffs epa claim.
the va also argues that plaintiffs attempts to identify male comparators who earn more money for doing substantially equal work are insufficient.the district court rejected this claim,citing the undisputed testimony by numerous va employees that nps and pas are interchangeable and the plaintiffs statistical evidence that pas are paid more than nps for performing the same duties.plaintiffs have presented two types of comparator evidence an individual comparator for each plaintiff and statistical evidence of pay disparities between nps and pas and as well as evidence that women receive lower compensation than do men for each year of additional experience under the existing pay scales.we now consider whether this comparator evidence is adequate to meet plaintiffs prima facie burden.
in determining whether a comparator is appropriate for the purposes of an epa claim,our focus is on actual job requirements and duties,rather than job classifications or titles.see brennan county,cir.a plaintiff establishes a prima facie epa case by comparing the jobs held by the female and male employees,and by showing that those jobs are substantially equal,not by comparing the skills and qualifications of the individual employees holding those jobs.miranda b b cash grocery store,cir citation omitted.because the comparison at the prima facie stage is of the jobs and not the employees,only the skills and qualifications actually needed to perform the jobs are considered.id.factors like education and experience are considered as a defense to an employer liability rather than as part of a plaintiff prima facie case.id.at citation omitted.
each of the plaintiffs has identified a specific male pa who she alleges is performing substantially equal work but who is receiving higher pay for his work.appellant br.at.although one plaintiff who happens to be male receives only less than his pa counterpart,the disparity is significantly higher for all the other plaintiffs,with several earning over less per year than her comparator male.the va asserts that these comparators are inappropriate,and suggests ways in which several of the male comparator employees may differ from plaintiffs.the va claims that in selecting their comparators,plaintiffs have not adequately accounted for employees duties,departments,or years of experience in current position.the va improperly focuses upon alleged differences between employees,rather than the jobs they perform,and also overstates the plaintiffs burden of showing a comparator at the prima facie stage.the text of the epa may not be brushed with such a demanding gloss as to suggest that plaintiffs prima facie case fails because each one has not identified one specific individual who constitutes a perfect male comparator.wheatley wicomico county,cir emphasis added.moreover,whether two positions are substantially equal for epa purposes is a question of fact for the jury.see tomka seiler,cir i t is for the trier of fact to decide if there is a significant enough difference in responsibility to make the jobs unequal,abrogated on other grounds,burlington,ellerth,d.when we compare the jobs performed by nps and pas,we conclude that the district court was correct in holding that plaintiffs have identified more highly paid male comparators.the record does not suggest that the comparator pas hold jobs that require different skills or qualifications,but on the contrary,the va own employees agree that the duties of the two positions are interchangeable.
in addition to identifying male comparators,plaintiffs have also produced statistical evidence that the predominantly male pas are paid more than the predominantly female plaintiffs for performing substantially equal work.rosen,the plaintiffs statistical expert,concluded that vamc pas are paid an amount that is statistically significantly higher than what is paid to nps,and that this pay disparity can not be explained by working experience either within the va or outside or by differences in educational attainment.despite the fact that the vamc nps are better educated than their pa counterparts,the pas earn on average per year more than nps at the vamc.according to rosen,this pay disparity is in contrast to a survey of salaries paid in the cleveland area,which indicates that nps are typically paid more than pas.the pay disparity between nps and pas is even greater at the upper ends of the pay scale,with the top rates for pas in being some more than the top rates for nps.thus,under the existing pay scheme,with pas receiving pay under a special gs pay scale and nps receiving pay under the standard nursing pay scale,female employees are not being compensated in the same way as their male counterparts for each additional year of experience rosen concluded that the va current pay scheme is economically discriminatory against the predominantly female nps.
the va argues that it was improper for the district court judge to consider this statistical analysis as evidence of a prima facie epa violation.we disagree,and we affirm the district court conclusion that this statistical evidence of a disparity in pay supports plaintiffs prima facie case.we have previously held that an epa plaintiff can rely upon statistical evidence of a disparity in pay when establishing a prima facie epa case.see kovacevich kent state,cir considering plaintiff statistical research showing disparities in merit awards and top as part of the combination of evidence that created a genuine issue of material fact on plaintiff epa claim.applying kovacevich to this case,we hold that plaintiffs properly presented statistical evidence of a pay disparity in conjunction with individual comparator evidence in order to meet their prima facie burden.see also marist college,cir holding that plaintiff,who identified a specific male comparator,can also compare herself to a statistical composite of comparable male employees in order to establish epa liability as well as to calculate damages.
the va has not presented any evidence to show that the jobs performed by the comparator pas differ in content to those performed by plaintiffs.instead,the record before us indicates that an overall comparison of the work of nps and pas,as attested to by the va own human resources and supervisory personnel,is substantially equal.we must believe the evidence presented by the nonmovant s,and draw all justifiable interferences in their favor.cotter,at citing plant morton int l,cir.
as the movant for summary judgment,the va has failed to show that a reasonable juror could not find that plaintiffs established their prima facie case.buntin,at.the district court conclusion that a reasonable jury could determine that the positions of np and pa at the cleveland vamc were fungible and that a pa performing substantially the same duties as an np would earn more money is sound.we affirm the district court holding that plaintiffs have established a prima facie epa violation.
defendant affirmative defense of a factor other than sex 
once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie epa violation,a defendant bears both the burden of persuasion and production on its affirmative defenses.see buntin,at stating that an epa defendant always bears the burden of persuasion regarding the affirmative defenses,and that a plaintiff bears the burden of producing evidence of pretext solely where a reasonable jury viewing the defendant evidence could find only for the defendant on the issue of the affirmative defense see also eeoc delaware dep t of health and soc,cir stating that a defendant has the burden of persuasion,not merely the burden of production,on its affirmative defense.the equal pay act was intended as a broad charter of women rights in the economic field and sought to overcome the belief in women inferiority and to eliminate the depressing effects on living standards of reduced wages for female workers and the economic and social consequences which flow from it.bence detroit health,cir quoting shultz american can,cir.the equal pay act is broadly remedial,and it should be construed and applied so as to fulfill the underlying purposes which congress sought to achieve.corning glass works,at.
we have therefore held that the equal pay act exception that a factor other than sex can be an affirmative defense does not include literally any other factor,but a factor that,at a minimum,was adopted for a legitimate business reason.eeoc penney,cir quotation omitted.t he burden of proving that a factor other than sex is the basis for a wage differential is a heavy one.brennan,at.u nless the factor of sex provides no part of the basis for the wage differential,the requirements for the defense are not met.id.emphasis added quotation omitted.in order to survive a defendant motion for summary judgment,the epa plaintiff need not set forth evidence from which a jury could infer that the employer proffered reason for the wage differential is pretextual.buntin,at.rather,as the party who bears the burden of persuasion,the defendant who makes a motion under rule c must demonstrate that there is no genuine issue as to whether the difference in pay is due to a factor other than sex.id.at citing eeoc romeo,at.thus the district court grant of the va motion for summary judgment can be upheld only if the record shows that the va established the defense so clearly that no rational jury could have found to the contrary.id.at quotation omitted.
the district court held that the distinct salary programs that govern the pay of nps and pas was a factor other than sex,and that the va had met its burden of proof on this defense with such compelling evidence that no genuine issues of material fact remained.we do not agree that the va has established this defense so clearly.because we conclude that the va has failed to demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact about whether a factor other than sex produced the pay differential between pas and nps,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to the.
the va urges us to apply precedent from other courts that have held that a distinct salary program can serve as a factor other than sex defense to an epa claim where the individual receiving the higher salary under the salary program has appropriate background and experience to explain the pay differential.in these cases,the factor other than sex defense established has been a sort of hybrid between the seniority and merit defenses.in these instances,the more male employee was found to have greater experience or qualifications for the job,or to hold greater job responsibilities.the va has not demonstrated that such differences between pas and nps exist at the cleveland vamc.
in eeoc aetna ins,cir,the fourth circuit held that aetna decision to pay a newly hired male insurance underwriter more than existing female underwriters was attributable to the existence of two distinct salary programs and was explained by his experience and background,two considerations which were not.id.at.similarly,in girdis eeoc,the district court found no epa violation where a male eeoc employee received higher pay than female employees due to the good faith operation of bona fide,acceptable government employment programs and the court determined that the male was qualified for his higher salary by his experience and background.id.at emphasis added.in this case,however,the va can not claim,based on the record before us,that the experience and background of pas qualify them to receive higher pay than nps with equivalent years of medical experience.the va reliance upon aldrich randolph central school district,cir,is also misplaced.in aldrich,the second circuit held that a job classification system could serve as a defense to wage discrimination claims only when the employer proves that the job classification system resulting in differential pay is rooted in legitimate differences in work responsibilities and qualifications for th
