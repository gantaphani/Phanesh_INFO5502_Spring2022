this is an appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment to defendant singing river hospital systems singing river on plaintiff brenda gowesky gowesky ada claims for workplace harassment and employment discrimination.a see also flowers reg l physician servs,cir.gowesky has not created a material fact issue concerning whether she was regarded as disabled by her employer after undergoing successful treatment for hepatitis c infection nor has she surmounted the evidentiary burden concerning harassment or an adverse employment decision.we affirm the summary judgment.
on february,while attending a patient in the emergency room of ocean springs hospital owned by singing river,gowesky was accidentally exposed to the hepatitis virus.on march,she informed dwight rimes,administrator of the ocean springs hospital,that she had tested positive.she ceased active work at the hospital several days later march,but maintained staff privileges and continued to attend monthly staff meetings.this practice persisted for the next two years,even as she underwent chemotherapeutic treatment for her infection.
on february,following one of these meetings,gowesky informed rimes that the virus had gone into remission and that she wanted to return to work at the end of may,following her upcoming carpal tunnel surgeries.gowesky testified in deposition that 
rimes told me that he was sure that i could work in the emergency department with this hepatitis c,that he was going to the hospital attorneys to find out if i could work and he said i would have to do some refresher courses,that i would have to get clearance from physicians,and he wanted clearance from schiff because the local physician was acceptable.i had to make sure that i was having any more problems with my hands,i have to have weekly blood draws.
gowesky further asserts that rimes s aid to me not only that he did think that i could work in the emergency room with hepatitis c,that he would go to a dentist with hepatitis c and he would not let me suture his child.
at this time,she also spoke with john weldon,director of emergency medicine at ocean springs hospital and her immediate supervisor,who,she alleges,threatened her and told her that,if she returned to work,she would have to guarantee that there would be no problems,that she would be able to do the work,and that she would not be infectious.he further questioned gowesky on whether she knew of any other emergency room physicians with hepatitis 
at a staff meeting on march,weldon gave gowesky a copy of the emergency room staffing schedule for the months of june,july,and august she was slated to return to work on june.
between this meeting and her scheduled return date,gowesky underwent her two surgeries march and april and reaffirmed her commitment to resume her duties.in a letter dated march,gowesky told rimes that she would indeed attend a refresher class and provide a letter from her physician confirming her ability to resume work.
in the meantime,singing river had been engaged in corporate restructuring.one feature of the plan involved the transfer of emergency room staffing responsibilities from singing river hospital systems to the emergency room group,erg.september was the anticipated transfer date.on or about may,singing river gave each of the emergency room physicians in its employ at ocean springs a formal termination notice.as with other emergency room physicians,gowesky received this release from singing river and a promise a future employment from erg.
gowesky receipt of this notice appears to have marked a low point in her relationship with rimes and weldon.in february,she was surprised by their imposition of conditions upon her return and offended by their comments over the following four months she claims to have engaged in numerous other conversations in which they made other offensive remarks and in may she thought they fired her.upset by this apparent indignity,she telephoned rimes to tell him that she objected to her dismissal.her suspicion was,however,unfounded.she did not report to work on june.a letter from her attorney followed on july,in which he stated that gowesky would not return to work,as,on august.
contrary to singing river expectations,the corporate restructuring was still in limbo when the emergency room staffing contracts expired at the end of august.for the entire month of september,ocean springs hospital emergency room physicians worked without contract.at the start of october,however,when it appeared that the transition was not imminent,ocean springs hospital offered all of its emergency room physicians interim contracts.upon consummation of the corporate transition in february,these physicians received permanent contracts from erg.gowesky did not enter into either contract.
gowesky filed her complaint against singing river on june,alleging gender and discrimination.the district court granted singing river motion for summary judgment on march.gowesky now appeals only the district court disposal of her ada claims.

iii.discussion 
gowesky brings two claims to the court.she alleges that she was the victim of workplace harassment and employment discrimination.a common element to both claims is that the plaintiff be disabled.before addressing her claims individually,this court will consider this threshold requirement to both.
gowesky was not regarded as disabled 
gowesky does not assert that,as a result of her hepatitis c infection,she was disabled,in a conventional sense,under the ada.as defined by the act,a disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.americans with disabilities act of,a.the ability to engage in gainful employment is one such activity.see regulations to implement the equal employment provisions of the americans with disabilities act,i.
the ada definition of disability does,however,permit suits by plaintiffs who,though not actually disabled per a,are nonetheless regarded as having such an impairment.c.this court,citing the applicable regulations,has set out the manner in which one might establish such a claim 
one is regarded as having a substantially limiting impairment if the individual has an impairment which is not substantially limiting but which the employer perceives as constituting a substantially limiting impairment has an impairment which is substantially limiting only because of the attitudes of others toward such an impairment or has no impairment at all but is regarded by the employer as having a substantially limiting impairment.

gowesky alleges that,though not disabled under subsection a,she was regarded as disabled by her supervisors under subsection c.this is evidenced,she argues,by their questions and remarks regarding her ability to return to work in the emergency room.
with her assertion this court can not agree.at most,the comments cited by gowesky question her fitness to practice emergency room medicine,a professional calling in which routine exposure to blood and bodily fluids might allow the hepatitis c virus to spread.the supervisors remarks,no matter how uninformed,do not suggest gowesky was otherwise unable to work as a doctor in
