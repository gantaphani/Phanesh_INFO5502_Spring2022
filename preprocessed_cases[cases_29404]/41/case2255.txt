this appeal under the americans with disabilities act ada requires us to consider the intersection of a qualification standard and the business necessity defense.united parcel service ups imposes a department of transportation dot hearing standard on all drivers,even though the dot standard is federally mandated only for vehicles.a class of ups employees and applicants who can not meet the dot hearing requirement challenges ups policy under title i of the ada,the california fair employment and housing act feha,cal.gov t code,and the unruh civil rights act unruh act,cal.
bates accepts,as he must,that ups may lawfully exclude individuals who fail the dot test from positions that would require them to drive vehicles,vehicles exceeding a gross vehicle weight rating gvwr of pounds.see albertson,kirkingburg,d.bates contends,however,that ups may not lawfully exclude individuals from consideration for positions that involve vehicles whose gvwr is less than pounds.
after a bench trial on liability,the district court found ups liable on all of bates claims,enjoined ups from using the blanket qualification standard,and required individualized assessment of candidates for the driver positions.the court founded its analysis on the framework of international brotherhood of teamsters united states,d.in determining whether ups met its asserted business necessity defense,the district court looked to our earlier decision involving ups drivers,morton united parcel service,cir.morton imported into its ada analysis concepts from both the traditional title vii business necessity defense to disparate impact claims and the bona fide occupational qualification bfoq standard from title vii disparate treatment challenges to a proscribed classification.
we granted rehearing en banc to consider the contours of a claim that an employer safety qualification standard discriminates against otherwise qualified persons with disabilities,see a,b,and the showing required of an employer to successfully assert the business necessity defense to use of such qualification under a.because this case involves a facially discriminatory qualification standard,we conclude that the teamsters protocol is inapplicable.in addition,we morton to the extent that it imposes a bfoq standard under the ada,as the plain language of the ada does not support such a construction.because the district court considered this case under the framework of teamsters and morton,we vacate and remand for further proceedings.we do not consider the merits of the feha claim because the pertinent feha law has changed since the district court issued its decision.finally,following our decision in bass county of butte,cir,we reverse the district court finding that ups violated the unruh act.
background 
ups and drivers 
ups drivers deliver and pick up packages for ups in the familiar brown ups trucks.ups employs more than employees in the united states,over of whom are drivers.
when an opening for a driving position becomes available,ups contacts the individual in that ups center with the highest seniority who has bid on such a position if that person is not interested,ups moves down the list in descending seniority order until it finds an interested employee.the applicant must satisfy several requirements,which vary from district to district,but generally include having completed an application being at least years of age possessing a valid driver license and having a clean driving record.once the seniority threshold and other prerequisites to employment are met,all applicants for a driver position must pass both ups road test and the dot physical examination required of drivers of commercial vehicles over pounds.ups has a policy of hiring only drivers who can satisfy dot standards.
at issue in this appeal is the hearing standard that is part of the dot physical.an individual satisfies the dot hearing standard if he 
f irst perceives a forced whispered voice in the better ear at not less than feet with or without the use of a hearing aid or,if tested by use of an audiometric device,does not have an average hearing loss in the better ear greater than decibels at hz,hz,and hz with or without a hearing aid when the audiometric device is calibrated to american national standard formerly asa standard.
b.according to the district court,the standard requires that potential drivers not only hear the sounds made but understand the words spoken.
unlike ups,which requires drivers of all package cars to pass the dot physical,the dot imposes this standard only for those driving vehicles with a gvwr of at least pounds.see a.a gross vehicle weight rating is the actual weight of the vehicle plus any cargo capacity.as of october,ups fleet contained vehicles,of which vehicles had a gvwr of less than pounds.the gvwr of the lighter vehicles ranged from to pounds,with the majority of these vehicles weighing pounds.by way of comparison,automobiles,which include passenger cars,sport utility vehicles,light trucks and minivans,average pounds 
proceedings in the district court 
in november,the district court certified a nationwide federal class on the ada claim that includes t hose persons throughout the united states who i have been employed by applied for employment with ups at any time since june,up through the conclusion of this action,ii use sign language as a primary means of communication due to a hearing loss or limitation,and iii allege that their rights have been violated under title i of the ada on account of ups policies and procedures.the federal class was certified under federal rule of civil procedure b to seek primarily injunctive and declaratory relief.as part of its findings and conclusions,the district court modified the composition of the class on the driving issue to include only those individuals who failed or would fail the dot hearing test.see.c c an order certifying an action as a class action under rule c may be altered or amended before final judgment.
phase one of the bifurcated bench trial was conducted over several weeks in the spring and fall of.at the close of bates evidence,ups moved pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c for judgment on partial findings.ups argued that its invocation of the dot hearing standard is lawful because bates failed to show that any class member meets the dot standard and thus failed to show that any class member satisfies the essential functions of the job,or that any reasonable accommodation exists that would permit class members to pass the dot hearing test.in the alternative,ups moved to decertify the class pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c and d,contending that bates failed to show that there is an adequate class representative,or proposed substitute,who is otherwise qualified for a ups driver position or has been injured by ups use of the qualification standard.
following phase one of the trial,the district court issued detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law.the district court found that bates satisfied his prima facie case based upon a combination of two factors first,ups policy operated as a blanket exclusion of deaf individuals,and second,at least one named plaintiff,babaranti oloyede,and at least one class member,elias habib,were qualified individuals with a disability with standing to sue under the ada by virtue of having satisfied all prerequisites for the driving position other than the dot hearing requirement.the court further concluded that bates did not have the burden to establish at that stage that any plaintiffs were qualified in the sense that they were capable of driving safely.accordingly,the district court denied ups motions for judgment under rule c and to decertify the class.
critical to its ruling,the district court next found that,under morton,ups failed to satisfy its burden under the business necessity defense.thus,the court reasoned,ups categorical exclusion of individuals who do not meet the dot hearing requirement violates the ada and,accordingly,the feha and the unruh act as well.the district court entered an injunction requiring ups to cease using the dot hearing standard to screen applicants for driver positions with respect to vehicles weighing pounds or less and to perform an individualized assessment of applicants that meet the threshold qualifications,other than the hearing standard.upon ups motion,the district court stayed all further proceedings pending ups interlocutory appeal.
jurisdiction 
ups interlocutory appeal of the order granting a permanent injunction falls squarely within the scope of a,which grants us jurisdiction over i nterlocutory orders of the district courts granting injunctions.our review of the permanent injunction properly includes review of the merits of the district court determination of liability.smith vulcan iron works,long bureau of economic analysis,cir per curiam,vacated on other grounds,d.review is particularly appropriate in cases like this one,in which the appeal is taken from a permanent,rather than preliminary,injunction,and t he district court has completed its consideration of the liability issue,retaining jurisdiction only for an accounting of damages.marathon oil united states,cir.
we likewise have jurisdiction to consider the district court denial of ups rule c motion for judgment on partial findings or,in the alternative,for class decertification under rule c and d,because the district court determinations as to both motions are inextricably intertwined with the permanent injunction.paige california,cir reviewing class certification order under a because order was inextricably intertwined with permanent injunction granting relief marathon oil,at reviewing summary judgment and partial dismissal under a where orders were inextricably bound up with findings and conclusions in support of permanent injunction.
ii.article iii standing 
the district court did not grapple with the article iii standing issue,apparently because ups did not raise a standing challenge below but instead framed its challenge as one to bates failure to prove his prima facie case.standing is a threshold matter central to our subject matter jurisdiction.we must assure ourselves that the constitutional standing requirements are satisfied before proceeding to the merits.united states hays,d casey lewis,cir.
in a class action,standing is satisfied if at least one named plaintiff meets the requirements.see armstrong davis,cir.the plaintiff class bears the burden of showing that the article iii standing requirements are met.see id.at.as we know from the passages in lujan,standing requires that the plaintiff suffered an injury in fact,one that is sufficiently concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical,the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct,and the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d quotation marks and citations omitted.standing must be shown with respect to each form of relief sought,whether it be injunctive relief,damages or civil penalties.friends of the earth,laidlaw envt l servs.toc,d.here,only liability and equitable relief were at issue in the district court,not damages.thus,we consider only whether at least one named plaintiff satisfies the standing requirements for injunctive relief.
the standing formulation for a plaintiff seeking prospective injunctive relief is simply one implementation of lujan requirements.the plaintiff must demonstrate that he has suffered or is threatened with a concrete and particularized legal harm,lujan,at,coupled with a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar way.city of los angeles lyons,d.as to the second inquiry,he must establish a real and immediate threat of repeated injury.littleton,d.p ast wrongs do not in themselves amount to a real and immediate threat of injury necessary to make out a case or controversy.lyons,at.however,past wrongs are evidence bearing on whether there is a real and immediate threat of repeated injury,at.in addition,the claimed threat of injury must be likely to be redressed by the prospective injunctive relief.graham fed.emergency mgmt.agency,cir recognizing that p laintiffs need not demonstrate that there is a guarantee that their injuries will be redressed by a favorable decision but only that a favorable decision is likely to redress their injuries quotation marks and citation omitted.
although the district court did not make explicit findings on standing,it made detailed findings on relevant and analogous issues sufficient to support standing.w e will affirm standing unless those findings are clearly erroneous.armstrong,at.based on the district court findings regarding named plaintiff barbaranti oloyede,we conclude that he and class member elias habib satisfy the standing requirements with respect to injunctive relief.
as a general matter,the class includes only those individuals who failed or would fail the dot hearing test.oloyede worked for ups beginning in,first applied for a driver position in,and expressed interest in that position several additional times,most recently in.his supervisor told him in that he would have to pass a hearing exam to become a driver.oloyede was not hired as a driver.
both aspects of the injury requirement are met in this case.first,ups failure to hire oloyede as a driver was a sufficiently concrete and particularized harm,in that the injury affected him in a personal and individual way.lujan,at.second,the crux of this lawsuit is the challenge to ups written qualification standard,including the dot hearing standard.where,as here,the harm alleged is directly traceable to a written policy there is an implicit likelihood of its repetition in the immediate future.armstrong,at see also fortyune am,cir.
the causation element of standing is easily satisfied.oloyede claimed to hire him as a driver because of a hearing caused and will continue to be caused by ups application of the dot hearing standard.see,mortensen county of sacramento,cir holding that plaintiff showed there was a significant possibility that he would suffer future injury based upon county written policy regarding compensatory time off,where the policy had been applied to him in the past and remained in place.
finally,we turn to the issue of redressability.after certification of the class in,oloyede accepted a position at ups which,due to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement,precludes him from presently bidding for a driver position.ups argues that because oloyede can not now bid for a driver slot,he could never be a qualified applicant who would benefit from an injunction.this argument is a backhanded way of attacking oloyede standing as a named plaintiff and suggesting that his claim is moot.indeed,mootness is described as the doctrine of standing set in a time frame.united states parole comm geraghty,d quoting henry monaghan,constitutional adjudication the who and when,yale.
even if ups is correct that oloyede claim is either not redressable or is moot because he is no longer in a position,questions we do not decide,the remaining class members are not foreclosed from attaining relief since the class was long ago duly certified.the supreme court has acknowledged that there is tension in its prior cases with respect to standing and adequacy in the class action context.gratz bollinger,d.the same tension exists with respect to standing and mootness in class actions.id.see also jean wegman burns,standing and mootness in class actions a search for consistency.nonetheless,even amidst these tensions,as in gratz,whether the requirement is deemed one of adequacy or standing or mootness,it is clearly satisfied in this case.gratz,at.see texas motor freight,rodriguez,d noting that it would be error for a district court to dismiss class allegations where it had already certified a class and only later had it appeared that the named plaintiffs were not class members or were otherwise inappropriate class representatives.
as the court reasoned in sosna iowa,once a class action has been certified,the class of unnamed persons described in the certification acquire s a legal status separate from the representative.sosna iowa,d.sosna involved a class action challenging the constitutionality of a state statute imposing a residency requirement for instituting a divorce action.id.at.at the time of the district court judgment,plaintiff had not yet met the residency requirement.id.at.by the time the case reached the supreme court,however,plaintiff had not only met the residency requirement but also obtained a divorce in another state.id.at.with regard to mootness,the supreme court held that the cases or controversies requirement of article requires a plaintiff with a live case or controversy,not only at the time of filing and at the time of class certification,but also when a court reviews the satisfied by a named defendant and a member of the class represented by the named plaintiff,even though the claim of the named plaintiff has become moot.id.at.as one commentator put it,w hat saved sosna from being moot was class certification.burns,at.
the following year the court clarified sosna in franks bowman transportation company,d,which involved a class action against an employer for racially discriminatory employment practices.although the named representative no longer had a personal stake in the outcome because he had been hired and properly discharged for cause,the court held that t he unnamed members of the class involved are identifiable individuals,individually named in the record,and n o questions are raised concerning the continuing desire of any of these class members for the seniority relief presently in issue.id.at.
the court cited franks just one year later in east texas motor freight and observed that if the initial certification was proper and decertification not appropriate,the claims of the class members would not need to be mooted or destroyed because subsequent events or the proof at trial had undermined the named plaintiffs individual claims.at.
these cases are instructive in analyzing class standing in this appeal.it is not disputed that oloyede had standing at the time of certification,which is the snapshot in time for determining initial standing.even if his claim later became moot or nonredressable,an identifiable member of the class,elias habib,surely has standing.according to the district court,habib,who is completely deaf,has a valid driver license and years of driving experience.the district court also found no evidence that he had been involved in any accidents.other than the dot physical,which habib failed because of his hearing loss,there was no other qualification standard that prevented him from applying for the job.he accordingly satisfies the injury,causation,and redressability prongs of lujan and therefore has standing to seek injunctive relief under the ada.because habib has standing to seek injunctive relief,the entire federal class has standing.armstrong,at.
iii.legal framework applicable to a qualification standard claim under the ada 
initial considerations 
the hearing standard at issue here is a facially discriminatory qualification standard because it focuses directly on an individual disabling or potentially disabling condition.see,mcgregor passenger,cir holding that a policy requiring employees to be healed or fully healed after an injury is facially discriminatory and constitutes a per se violation of the ada.instead of recognizing this posture,the district court analyzed the claim as a disparate treatment claim,applying the protocol set out in teamsters.see at.
a protocol is,however,unnecessary in this circumstance.the fact to be uncovered by such a the employer made an employment decision on a proscribed basis here,disability in the form of hearing impairment is not in dispute.see monette data,cir noting that when a defendant admits to taking account of disability status,the framework sometimes applicable to disparate treatment claims is unnecessary.
in addition,whether bates established a prima facie case of employment discrimination in the summary judgment sense is moot after trial.the relevant inquiry now is simply whether the evidence presented at trial supports a finding of liability.see postal serv.bd.of governors aikens,d costa desert palace,cir en banc,aff,d.
applicable provisions of the ada 
the enforcement provision of title i of the ada,under which bates brought suit,provides 
no covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures,the hiring,advancement,or discharge of employees,employee compensation,job training,and other terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.
a.thus,under the ada,an employee bears the ultimate burden of proving that he is disabled under the act,a qualified individual with a disability,and discriminated against because of the disability.nunes stores,cir.
there is no dispute that the class members,who are hearing impaired,are disabled.instead,we focus on the two other key terms in the statute qualified individual and discriminate.to unpack the meaning of these terms,we look to the statute.
a qualified individual is an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.emphasis added see also m.essential functions are fundamental job duties of the employment position not includ ing the marginal functions of the position.n see cripe city of san jose,cir.if a disabled person can not perform a job essential functions even with a reasonable accommodation,then the ada employment protections do not apply.cripe,at.if,on the other hand,a person can perform a job essential functions,and therefore is a qualified individual,then the ada prohibits discrimination with respect to the employment actions outlined in a.id.
discrimination under the ada includes the use of qualification standards,employment tests or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities unless the standard,test or other selection criteria,as used by the covered entity,is shown to be for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity.b emphasis added the eeoc regulations define qualifications standards as the personal and professional attributes including the skill,experience,education,physical,medical,safety and other requirements established by a covered entity as requirements which an individual must meet in order to be eligible for the position held or desired.q.
in a case involving the use of a qualification standard,the ada provides employers with a business necessity defense 
it may be a defense to a charge of discrimination under this chapter that an alleged application of qualification standards,tests,or selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out or otherwise deny a job or benefit to an individual with a disability has been shown to be and consistent with business necessity,and such performance can not be accomplished by reasonable accommodation,as required under this subchapter.
a emphasis added.
where an safety qualification standard is invoked,the question then becomes what proof is required with respect to being a qualified individual,that is,one who can perform the job essential functions.before an employee can challenge an employer qualification standard,however,an employee must first prove that he is a qualified individual within the meaning of the ada,that is,one who can perform the job essential functions with or without reasonable accommodation.bates argues that he meets all of the essential functions of the driver position,including being a safe driver.although bates acknowledges that class members do not meet the dot hearing standard,he contends that hearing is not an essential function,and thus there are qualified individuals who meet ups other job requirements.
ups,on the other hand,urges that class members are not qualified individuals because they can not meet ups requirement that all drivers pass the dot hearing standard,and thus can not meet an essential function of the certification to drive all commercial vehicles.ups also argues that each class member is required to show not only that he is a safe driver in the sense that he has a clean driving record,but also that he is a safe driver despite being hearing impaired.
we turn first to the qualified individual inquiry and then to the question of discrimination.
qualified individual with a disability 
as the plaintiff,bates bears the burden to prove that he is qualified.see nunes,at kennedy applause,cir.qualification for a position is a inquiry.the court first examines whether the individual satisfies the requisite skill,experience,education and other requirements of the position.the court then considers whether the individual can perform the essential functions of such position with or without a reasonable accommodation.m see humphrey memorial hospitals ass n,cir see also eeoc convergys customer management group,cir branham snow,cir.
job requisites 
the driver job requires an applicant to meet ups threshold seniority requirements for the driver position,complete an application,be at least years of age,possess a valid driver license,and have a clean driving record by ups local standards.the district court finding that named plaintiff oloyede and class member elias habib meet these prerequisites is not clearly erroneous.
essential functions 
to prove that he is qualified,the applicant also must show that he can perform the essential functions of the job.see nunes,at kennedy,at.as noted earlier,a job essential functions are fundamental job duties of the employment position not includ ing the marginal functions of the position.n see also id.n elaborating on reasons and evidence relevant to an essential function showing.essential functions are not to be confused with qualification standards,which an employer may establish for a certain position.whereas essential functions are basic duties,n,qualification standards are personal and professional attributes that may include physical,medical and safety requirements.id.q.the difference is crucial.
the statute does not require that a person meet each of an employer established qualification standards,however,to show that he is qualified.and,indeed,it would make little sense to require an ada plaintiff to show that he meets a qualification standard that he undisputedly can not meet because of his disability and that forms the very basis of his discrimination challenge 
although the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of persuading the fact finder that he can perform the job essential functions,we agree with the eighth circuit approach that an employer who disputes the plaintiff claim that he can perform the essential functions must put forth evidence establishing those functions.eeoc,cir.the genesis of this rule is the recognition that much of the information which determines those essential functions lies uniquely with the employer.benson nw.airlines,cir.in addition,the ada and implementing regulations direct fact finders to consider,among other things,the employer judgment as to what functions of a job are essential,job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants,t he amount of time spent on the job performing the function,n iii t he consequences of not requiring the applicant or employee to perform the function,id.n iv and the work experience of current and former employees.id.n vi,vii.thus,to the extent that an employer challenges an ada plaintiff claim that he can perform the job essential functions,we think it appropriate to place a burden of production on the employer to come forward with evidence of those essential functions.see,at benson,at.
at trial the parties agreed that two of the essential functions of the driver position are the ability to communicate effectively and the ability to drive safely.ups urged that the ability to drive vehicles was another essential function.the district court rejected that contention,finding that ups permits other drivers who can not drive all vehicles to drive package cars for example,ups has protocols in place for driver applicants who can not pass certain dot certification requirements because of their vision impairments or diabetes,but who can pass less stringent physical requirements.ups has not shown that the district court determination that dot certification is not an essential job function was clearly erroneous.see,taylor rice,concluding that issues of fact regarding job essential functions precluded summary judgment for employer because record showed that,in practice,employer did not require all other employees to abide by claimed essential function davidson am.online,cir the question of whether a job requirement is a necessary requisite to employment initially focuses on whether an employer actually requires all employees in the particular position to satisfy the alleged requirement.
only the second essential function,safe driving,is at issue in this appeal.ups argues that hearing at a level sufficient to pass the dot hearing standard is either a essential job function or part and parcel of being a safe driver.this point illustrates the critical difference between a job essential functions effective communication or safe driving versus a qualification standard based on personal or professional attributes,such as hearing at a certain level.the question,then,is whether plaintiffs established that they meet the essential function of safe driving.
the district court found that oloyede met ups threshold requirements of having no accidents or moving violations within the last year,no dui within the last three years,and no more than three moving violations in the last three years.habib also met the prerequisites to apply for the position a valid driver license,years of driving experience,and no evidence of even a minor traffic accident 
ups urges that oloyede and habib are required to show not only that they are safe drivers in the sense that they have a clean driving record,but also that they are safe drivers even though they are hearing impaired.the district court rejected that argument,stating that imposing this burden would require plaintiffs to disprove the employer business necessity affirmative defense,that the employer is justified in imposing a qualification standard that facially screens out individuals with a specific disability.
because ups has linked hearing with safe driving,ups bears the burden to prove that nexus as part of its defense to use of the hearing qualification standard.the employees,however,bear the ultimate burden to show that they are qualified to perform the essential function of safely driving a package car.in so doing,oloyede and habib need not disprove the validity of the hearing standard,but must demonstrate their safe driving ability package cars.the inquiry is not whether oloyede and habib are capable of safely driving their personal cars,but rather whether they can drive the package cars at issue in this litigation.the district court did not make a finding with respect to plaintiffs ability to drive package cars safely.merely finding an absence of evidence with respect to driving a package car is insufficient.in short,oloyede and habib bear the burden of proving that they are qualified individuals with disabilities.they must show that they can perform the essential job function of safely driving package cars.only if they meet this burden does the question become whether the qualification standard used by the employer satisfies the business necessity defense.
by requiring ups to justify the hearing test under the business necessity defense,but also requiring plaintiffs to show that they can perform the essential functions of the job,we are not saying,nor does the ada require,that employers must hire employees who can not safely perform the job,particularly where safety itself is an essential function.nor are we saying that an employer can never impose a safety standard that exceeds minimum requirements imposed by law.however,when an employer asserts a blanket qualification the essential job is not mandated by law and that qualification standard screens out or tends to screen out an individual with a disability,the the the burden of showing that the higher qualification standard is and consistent with business necessity,and that performance can not be achieved through reasonable accommodation.a.
this approach is parallel to the one adopted in a direct threat case under the ada.b the term qualification standards may include a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace.although the specifics of proof in direct threat and business necessity cases may vary,the frameworks are parallel.we emphasize that ups is not required to meet the requirements of the direct threat defense,but rather that cases under that section of the ada illuminate our analysis.
in branham,the seventh circuit considered a qualification standard that disqualified an individual from being an irs criminal investigator if the applicant had a ny condition that would hinder full,efficient performance of the duties of the position or that would cause the individual to be a hazard to or to others at quoting irs qualification standard.safety was an issue in branham,as it is here.the parties did not dispute that an essential job requirement was the ability to function safely under the working conditions imposed on such employees.id.
the irs claimed that the applicant diabetes placed him at risk of subtle sudden incapacitation,which would place the applicant and others at an extreme risk of safety that would be unacceptable.id.citation and quotation marks omitted.the irs also argued that the applicant bore the burden of establishing as part of his prima facie case that he did not pose a direct threat to himself or others.id.at.in rejecting the irs position,the seventh circuit concluded that the applicant need only establish that he was otherwise qualified for the criminal investigator job by meeting the job essential functions.id.at.and,because the irs safety qualification standard regarding the medical condition incorporated the direct threat defense under the ada,the employer bore the burden of proving that the employee was a direct threat.id.at.the employee did not have to disprove the claim that he was a direct threat as part of his prima facie case of discrimination.id.at.
the branham approach works equally well in framing our analysis of ups hearing qualification standard.the employee does not bear the burden to invalidate the employer qualification standard.nor is the employee required to disprove ups contention that,in order to be safe,the driver must pass the dot hearing very qualification standard disputed in this case.see,cripe,at holding that a service requirement that rendered only disabled officers ineligible for specialized assignments could not be applied to them unless it was shown to be and consistent with business necessity,and performance could not be achieved through reasonable accommodation mcgregor,at explaining that the ada generally requires individualized assessment of whether a qualified individual is able to perform essential functions with or without reasonable accommodation,rather than use of blanket qualification standards,like a healed or fully healed policy,as substitute for such individualized determination.
similar to the court in branham,we conclude that an employee who shows that he meets the basic qualifications for the driver position seniority,years of age,and holding a valid driver license and can drive a package car safely,including having a clean driving record and passing the driving test,is an otherwise qualified individual.
the last step of the qualified individual inquiry requires a plaintiff to show that he is qualified with or without reasonable accommodation.if the plaintiff proves that he can perform the job essential functions either without a reasonable accommodation or with such an accommodation,then he has met his burden to show he is qualified.see mcgregor,at deane pocono med,cir en banc.here,the district court did not explicitly discuss reasonable accommodation,although in finding that oloyede and habib met the job requisites and could perform the essential function of safe driving,it implicitly found that no accommodation was necessary to meet those baseline requirements for ups driver applicants 
because the district court did not analyze whether oloyede and habib are qualified individuals capable of performing the essential function of safely driving a package car in the framework discussed above,nor did it directly undertake the qualified individual inquiry,we remand to the district court for the employees to prove that they are so qualified and for an analysis of reasonable accommodation.thus,we vacate the district court order denying ups motion for judgment on partial findings under rule c,and in the alternative to decertify the nationwide class under rule c and d.
discrimination because of disability 
an employee bears the burden of proving that he was discriminated against because of a disability.a.see costa,at the employee ultimate burden of proof in all cases remains the same to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the challenged employment decision was because of discrimination.the qualification standard at dot hearing facially discriminatory and falls squarely within the ada definition of discrimination.b discrimination includes using qualification standards,employment tests or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities.
the district court found,and ups does not contest,that ups applies a qualification standard that has the effect of discriminating on the basis of disability screens out the class of employees who can not pass the dot hearing standard.see b.such discrimination violates the ada unless ups can prove a valid defense to its use of the dot hearing standard.we therefore turn to ups defense that its reliance on the dot hearing standard is justified under the business necessity defense.
employer business necessity defense 
under the ada,an employer may assert an affirmative defense to a claim that application of a qualification standard,test or selection criteria discriminates on the basis of disability.see a albertson,at.although the shorthand reference is the business necessity defense,the defense also incorporates requirements of and reasonable accommodation.
we most recently addressed the ada business necessity defense in morton.there,we held that the ada version of the business necessity defense incorporates concepts from both the traditional title vii business necessity defense to disparate impact claims and the bfoq defense in title vii and age discrimination in employment act adea disparate treatment challenges to a proscribed classification.id.at.today,we revisit our conception of the business necessity defense under the ada and overrule morton to the extent that it conflicts with this opinion specifically,we reject morton adaptation of the title vii and adea bfoq safety standard requirement in the ada context.
we look first and foremost to the text of the ada 
it may be a defense to a charge of discrimination under this chapter that an alleged application of qualification standards,tests,or selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out or otherwise deny a job or benefit to an individual with a disability has been shown to be and consistent with business necessity,and such performance can not be accomplished by reasonable accommodation,as required under this subchapter.
a emphasis added.to successfully assert the business necessity defense to an allegedly discriminatory application of a qualification standard,test or selection criteria,an employer bears the burden of showing that the qualification standard is,consistent with business necessity,and that performance can not be accomplished by reasonable accommodation.see cripe,at holding that the employer bears the burden of proving affirmative defense of business necessity.
rather than analyzing each of these statutory components of the business necessity defense,morton looked to other provisions of the ada the qualified individual requirement,the undue hardship defense,and the reasonable accommodation provision of the business necessity defense,and concluded that these provisions suggest that congress must have intended to permit exclusion of employees based upon safety criterion only on a showing somewhat similar to the one used for safety qualifications under the title vii and adea bfoq standard.morton,at.we mistakenly concluded that i f a transportation employer can demonstrate neither that all persons who fail to meet a safety criterion present an unacceptable risk of danger nor that it is highly impractical more discretely to determine which disabled employees present such an unacceptable title vii adea bfoq safety standard would not think that the safety criterion would provide an accurate measure of actual ability.id.at.
however,as morton recognized,there is no bfoq defense as such in the ada.id.at.ups argues,and we agree,that it is improper to import the bfoq standard into the ada business necessity defense.instead,we return to the statutory provisions congress set out for the ada version of the business necessity defense.
to show,an employer must demonstrate that the qualification standard fairly and accurately measures the individual actual ability to perform the essential functions of the job.see cripe,at.iii,at,reprinted in,see also belk sw.bell,cir excel,cir.when every person excluded by the qualification standard is a member of a protected is,disabled employer must demonstrate a predictive or significant correlation between the qualification and performance of the job essential functions.albemarle paper moody,d clady county of los angeles,cir as a general principle,the greater the test adverse impact,the higher the correlation which will be required.analyzing business necessity defense to title vii disparate impact claim.
to show that the disputed qualification standard is consistent with business necessity,the employer must show that it substantially promote s the business needs.cripe,at quoting bentivegna dep t of labor,cir interpreting the term business necessity for purposes of the rehabilitation act of.as we observed in cripe the business necessity standard is quite high,and is not to be confused with mere expediency.cripe,at citation,quotation marks and alteration omitted.for a qualification standard,i n evaluating whether the risks addressed by the qualification standard constitute a business necessity,the court should take into account the magnitude of possible harm as well as the probability of occurrence.eeoc exxon,cir noting that t he acceptable probability of an incident will vary with the potential hazard posed by the particular position a probability that might be tolerable in an ordinary job might be intolerable for a position involving atomic reactors,for example.
finally,to show that performance can not be accomplished by reasonable accommodation,the employer must demonstrate either that no reasonable accommodation currently available would cure the performance deficiency or that such reasonable accommodation poses an undue hardship on the employer see a,defining undue hardship.see mcgregor,at see also,at even when physical fitness is a selection criterion that is related to an essential function of the job it may not be used to exclude an individual with a disability if that individual could satisfy the criterion with the provision of a reasonable accommodation.quoting pt,app.quotation marks and alterations omitted.

in rejecting ups business necessity defense to application of the dot hearing standard to all driving positions,the district court concluded that ups has demonstrated neither that all or substantially all deaf drivers pose a higher risk of accidents than drivers nor that there are no practical criteria for determining which deaf drivers pose a heightened risk and which do not.additionally,ups has not demonstrated that it would be impossible to develop empirical evidence that would be sufficient to make either showing.this finding does not track the statutory elements of the business necessity defense.because the district court understandably based its rationale on the morton framework,we vacate the finding that ups violated bates rights under the ada,vacate the injunction,and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.we leave to the district court the determination whether additional evidence is appropriate in light of the significant change in the legal landscape of this case 
one further aspect of morton bears noting here.as part of its business necessity analysis under morton,the district court also rejected ups reliance on the dot hearing standard.the district court pointed to morton statement that the existence of its own terms standard can not shoulder ups statutory burden to show business necessity.morton,at holding that the mere existence of government safety standard did not demonstrate ups business necessity defense and fact issues precluded summary judgment.
here,ups offered up the dot standard as evidence that,for safety purposes,a certain level of hearing is necessary to drive vehicles.according to ups,there is complete congruity between the positions of driving a package car more than pounds and driving a vehicle that weighs a little less.ups argued that package cars weighing almost five tons do not have operating characteristics similar to passenger cars and pose greater risks than do passenger cars.
to be sure,dot regulation does not apply to the category of vehicles at issue in this case.however,that circumstance does not mean that the standard has no relevance to the employer safety argument.ups is entitled to use as some evidence of its business necessity defense the fact that it relied on a government safety standard,even where the standard is not applicable to the category of conduct at issue.to the extent morton suggests or is interpreted to the contrary,it is overruled.albertson,at.holding that an employer is not required to justify its decision to require that employees meet an applicable government safety regulation,even if the government permits waiver of the applicable requirements under an experimental policy.the parallel consideration applies to an employee that is,an employee may offer as evidence challenging the validity or applicability of a safety standard the government refusal to adopt such standard to govern the conduct at issue.see,discussing dot rejection of ups attempt to apply dot physical requirements to trucks under pounds because smaller trucks and vans have operating characteristics more comparable to cars and smaller trucks and vans pose a lesser safety risk than large trucks.
thus,while certainly not dispositive of ups showing of,business necessity or the reasonableness of potential accommodations,ups reliance on the government safety standard with respect to other vehicles in its fleet should be entitled to some consideration as a safety benchmark.whether,as ups puts it,package cars in the ups fleet share significant risk characteristics with their slightly larger cousins is a factual question of the congruity between vehicles and drivers in ups fleet and those regulated by dot.see johnson mayor city council,d federal rules on mandatory retirement age for firefighters may be relevant to nonfederal firefighters,depending on congruity of the occupations.we leave it to the fact finder to determine how much weight to give such evidence.
iv.california state law claims 
ups challenges the district court holding that it violated the feha,arguing that there is no qualified plaintiff under the feha requirements.ups also argues that because different defenses are available under the feha than the ada,the district court erred in concluding that because ups violated the ada,it a fortiori violated the feha with respect to the california subclass of plaintiffs.
the california supreme court recently interpreted the feha as in accord with the ada requirement that a plaintiff asserting disability discrimination bears the burden of proving that he is a qualified individual.green california,cal th,d.in a supplemental submission to this court,ups,citing green,contends that named plaintiff and class representative of the california not met his burden to show that he is a qualified individual within the meaning of the feha.ups argues,as it did with respect to the ada claims,that oloyede is not qualified because he is unable to pass the dot hearing test and he has not otherwise demonstrated that he can drive package cars safely.
as the court in green explained 
under the feha,it is unlawful f or an employer,because of the race,religious creed,color,national origin,ancestry,physical disability,mental disability,medical condition of any person,to bar or to discharge the person from employment or from a training program leading to employment,or to discriminate against the person in compensation or in terms,conditions,or privileges of employment.cal.gov t code a although section proscribes discrimination on the basis of an employee disability,it specifically limits the reach of that proscription,excluding from coverage those persons who are not qualified,even with reasonable accommodation,to perform essential job duties this part does not prohibit an employer from refusing to hire or discharging an employee with a physical or mental disability where the employee,because of his or her physical or mental disability,is unable to perform his or her essential duties even with reasonable accommodations,or can not perform those duties in a manner that would not endanger his or her health or safety or the health or safety of others even with reasonable accommodations,subd.a.
thus,a plaintiff asserting a disability employment discrimination claim under the feha must show that he is a qualified individual,meaning that he can perform the essential duties of the employment position with reasonable accommodation.id.at,at citing cal.gov t code a.the court further observed we see no statutory basis for construing the feha any differently from the ada with regard to a plaintiff employee burden of proof.id.
the bases for ups challenge to oloyede qualified individual status under the feha are identical to the arguments we rejected with respect to his qualified individual showing under the ada because we are vacating the district court determination that oloyede and habib were qualified individuals under the ada,we likewise vacate the district court finding that the two were qualified individuals in the feha context.
after the district court decision,we had occasion to address the interplay between the defenses in the feha and the ada.in eeoc united parcel service,we observed that the feha defense has no direct analogue in the ada and is broader than the ada direct threat defense,its closest analog.see,cir.ups now contends that it is not liable under the feha,arguing,among other things,that it has satisfied the feha defense.
because our clarification of the applicable legal standard may bear on the district court analysis,we do not address the finding that ups violated the feha.instead,on remand,the district court will have ample opportunity to reconsider this issue in light of eeoc united parcel service.see at feha defense requires an individualized showing that safety would be compromised by each employee performance of driving duties,although c ategorical evidence can be relevant.
ups also appeals the district court holding that it violated the unruh act.the unruh act central substantive statutory provision states that 
a ll persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal,and no matter what their sex,race,color,religion,ancestry,national origin,disability,medical condition,marital status,or sexual orientation are entitled to the full and equal accommodations,advantages,facilities,privileges,or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.
cal.b.section f of the unruh act provides that a violation of the right of any individual under the americans with disabilities act of shall also constitute a violation of this section.id.f citation omitted.bates contends that because ups violated the ada employment law provisions,it follows from section f that ups also violated the unruh act.
bates argument is foreclosed by our recent decision in bass county of butte,in which we held that the unruh act does not incorporate the employment discrimination provisions under title i of the ada.see at.we reverse the district court conclusion that the unruh act serves as a basis for relief against ups 
injunction 
the district court stayed enforcement of its injunction pending ups interlocutory appeal.we vacate the injunction and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
vacated in part,reversed in part,and remanded.each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.
i would approach the qualified individual and department of transportation dot hearing standard inquiries differently than does the majority,but do agree that this case must be remanded for under the majority statement of the business necessity framework.i therefore concur only in parts i,ii,iii a c,iii d,iii e,iv b,and v of the majority opinion,and in the judgment 
the majority holds that to be qualified individuals with disabilities oloyede and habib or some other member of the class must show that they can perform the essential job function of safely driving package cars.op.at.the majority opinion is entirely unclear,however,as to how they are to do so.in my view,such a requirement can be squared with the statute and with the complaint in this case,if at all,only if understood as imposing a definable,threshold burden.
oloyede and habib ask in their complaint just that the district court order ups to individually assess hearing disabled workers to determine if they are able to safely drive vehicles where dot regulations are not applicable.in other words,although the plaintiffs certainly hope eventually to become package car drivers,they are not seeking to bypass ups package car driver testing,training,and probation programs and be placed directly into the driver seat.the district court explicitly limited its relief to mandating individual assessment.
ups requirements and programs are extensive.first,applicants must have adequate seniority and clean driving records to begin the application process.then,in addition to the dot physical,applicants must pass a driving test to enter the program.if they pass,they enter a driving training course with both and classroom components.if they pass that course,they embark on a probationary period,with supervisors sometimes riding along.only if they pass all these hurdles do those who enter the program become ups package car drivers.
the majority opinion would require the plaintiffs to bear the ultimate burden of proving that they will be safe package car drivers,so as to show that they are qualified persons with disabilities.but,perhaps because it does not recognize the limited nature of the relief sought,the majority leaves unclear what it is asking of the district court and of the parties on remand with regard to that requirement.
requiring the plaintiffs to prove that they will be safe package car drivers,as the majority opinion does,will unnecessarily complicate this litigation on remand.safe is not a term,and particularly is not so in the context of industrial safety decisions nor is it whether any particular scheme for predicting whether a person who has never driven a package car safely will be able to do so is likely to yield valid results thus,asking oloyede and habib to prove that they are safe without providing guidance as to how they are to do so,or as to how safe is safe in this context,presents the litigants and the district court with an and complicated puzzle.yet,such a requirement is extraneous given the limited nature of the relief oloyede and habib seek.ups has designed evaluation methods using its own vehicles to test for the degree of safety it requires,so it makes little sense to suggest that oloyede and habib must devise,validate,and pass their own safety tests and training programs before they may sue to take ups tests and training,again,is all that they seek to do.
here,what makes sense is to require the plaintiffs to meet ups threshold requirements for entry into the package car driver testing and training program.ups itself will then be able individually to evaluate them for the job they desire,according to ups own standards and methods with appropriate accommodations,if requested and if the need for them is proven,see defining qualified individual and reasonable accommodation dark curry county,cir explaining the reasonable accommodation process 
practically speaking,under the approach i suggest,once a deaf applicant shows that he meets the normal threshold qualifications for he is at least years of age,possesses a valid driver license,and has a clean driving record by ups local has met his burden of proof in this regard.it is then ups burden to show,if it desires to adopt as a threshold requirement a minimum hearing level such as the dot standard,that it can establish under the business necessity test that deaf applicants as a group who do not meet that requirement can not drive package cars safely.unless ups can establish a business necessity supporting such a blanket requirement,either by validating the application of the dot standard to deaf drivers or by adopting some other validated standard for such drivers,it must allow hearing impaired applicants to take the same initial driving test,benefit from the same training program,and be subject to the same final test as all other applicants,all with reasonable accommodations if necessary.
this approach in no way compromises the safety of ups driving force,as there are other stages,after applicants are deemed qualified to commence training,at which drivers,including deaf drivers who can not safely drive package trucks,may be weeded out.if the final test,for example,shows that a deaf applicant is fully capable of driving safely,regardless of the extent of his hearing impairment,he should not be disqualified from employment.if,however,it reveals that an applicant hearing impairment results in an inability to avoid accidents to the same extent as drivers without hearing impairments,he should be deemed to have failed the test.the key,accordingly,is to design a training and testing program that will eliminate all applicants who pose a safety hazard regardless of whether the cause is hearing impairment,inadequate vision,lack of judgment,slow reflexes,lack of intelligence,or some disability other than a hearing impairment.
in this case,should the plaintiffs prevail and be allowed to undergo the training program,ups would be free to design a test to be administered following its completion.by doing so,it would test the ability of all potential employees,including those who are,to drive in a safe manner.oloyede and habib would be allowed,if they pass the initial driving test,to enroll in the training program and take the final test upon its completion.those who fail the testing and training program for reasons related to their hearing impairment,would,of course,be entitled to challenge it on the ground that it did not properly measure whether such employees could perform the essential functions of the position.but,absent such a challenge,and absent ups proof of the dot standard or some other hearing impairment standard as a business necessity,plaintiffs and other deaf drivers would demonstrate that they are safe drivers in the same manner as all other employees who desire to be package car drivers.
as i read the district court opinion,it is consistent with this basic approach.i would not,therefore,vacate the district court holding on the qualified individual point 
the majority opinion holds,instead,that the district court erred by not specifically examining whether oloyede and habib are now capable of driving a package car safely,rather than just whether they can drive safely enough to be eligible for ups package car driver assessment program.op.at.still,the majority opinion may not require significantly more proof of oloyede and habib than they have already adduced,except in one respect.
ups does not decide whether participants in its training program can drive a package car safely enough to meet ups risk standards until the end of the program.instead,it uses the entry requirements and the initial phases of the training notably,a driving decide whether applicants are,at a first cut,likely to be able to perform that essential job function and so should be allowed to continue training for the job.surely,oloyede and habib,who have never driven package cars,are not required to show that they are more able to perform the essential job function of ultimately driving a package car safely than any other similarly inexperienced ups employee who successfully passes the initial screening for the training program.instead,they must simply be as qualified as hearing employees must be at that initial stage.the majority description of its required evidentiary showing suggests as much,as it would include meeting ups entrance requirements and tests,including having a clean driving record,and passing the driving test,not more.id.
so,on remand,the district court may approach the qualified individual inquiry under the majority opinion by deciding whether the plaintiffs can show that they are likely to be able to drive package cars as safely as other training program entrants.the district court,on remand,may rely upon the evidence already provided by oloyede and habib,or on any other evidence they may introduce.also,the district court may order discovery on the ups driving test given to program entrants to allow oloyede or habib or some other class representative to reconstruct and then take the same test.members of the class who meet all valid requirements and can pass that test,with or without reasonable accommodations,would then be as qualified to be package car drivers as other employees entering the training program,and will meet their burden of proof in this litigation.
to require the plaintiffs to show any more to meet their burden of proof would be to suppose that ups training program is a useless formality in no way essential to teaching strategies and skills necessary to drive package cars safely.ups obviously does not believe that,and neither should we.as deaf potential drivers have not had the opportunity to learn those skills and strategies,they can not fairly be measured for safety against drivers who have.and,there is no way potential deaf drivers can reproduce and prove that they can pass a program supervised by experienced ups trainers.so,as far as i can tell,deaf drivers should be able to show they can drive a package car safely and so are qualified persons with a disability,as the majority requires,simply by passing a driving test equivalent to the one ups requires to enter its package car driver training program.
the majority opinion is also somewhat unclear on how the district court should review the evidence supporting ups business necessity defense of the dot hearing standard.the majority remands on this question,directing the district court to give some consideration to the dot use of the standard for larger vehicles as evidence for business necessity.op.at.
it appears to me that the district court has largely already done so.it devoted several pages of careful analysis to explaining the empirical and statistical deficiencies inherent in extending the dot hearing standard beyond the area in which it now applies.it examined the studies supporting such an extension,noting that the data supporting their conclusions is extremely dated,th
