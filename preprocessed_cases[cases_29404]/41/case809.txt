discussion 
miller challenges the district court application of the enhancements for abuse of a position of trust and obstruction of justice.we take her arguments in turn.
abuse of a position of trust 
section may be applied to increase a defendant offense level by two i f the defendant abused a position of public or private trust,or used a special skill,in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.this court applies a test to determine whether there has been an abuse of trust whether the defendant occupies a position of trust and whether the defendant abused her position in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.united states kay,cir quotation omitted.
position of trust 
application note to states that a position of trust is characterized by professional or managerial discretion,and that individuals in such positions are subject to significantly less supervision than employees whose responsibilities are primarily in nature.cmt.the ability to exercise such professional or managerial discretion is the signature characteristic of one who holds a position of trust.united states ollison,cir.miller argues that she did not occupy a position of trust because she was merely an ordinary vendor in an arm length commercial relationship with the government.she contends that under the structure of the medicare and medicaid programs,the government trust is placed in physicians who provide cmns and not in dme providers.the government counters that medicare and medicaid place substantial trust in dme providers,as evinced by witness testimony at the sentencing hearing.it further argues that circuit precedent applying to medicare service providers compels affirmance.
a enhancement was upheld in united states iloani against a chiropractor who had conspired with his patients to submit fraudulent claims to private insurance companies for treatments that were never rendered,cir.we reasoned that insurance companies usually rely on the honesty and integrity of physicians in their medical findings,diagnoses,and prescriptions for treatment or medication,and that insurance companies must rely on physicians representations that the treatments for which the companies are billed were in fact performed.id.at.in united states gieger,the defendants,operators of a ambulance company,defrauded the government by billing for the transport of patients who were improperly claimed to be,cir.this court held that iloani barred the defendants attempt to overcome a enhancement,reasoning that the defendants carried out their fraud by abusing a similar position of trust to iloani with medical insurers.id.at.
miller seeks to distinguish herself from the ambulance operators in gieger by arguing that the latter enjoyed considerable discretion,without physician oversight,to determine whether patients were ambulatory,whereas she,as a dme provider,could not provide any equipment without a cmn.we reject her argument,for two reasons.first,miller effectively exercised the discretion that the medicare and medicaid programs entrust to physicians by knowingly completing cmns for patients who had no need for the equipment provided.there was evidence that miller obtained a set of,blank cmns from long and simply filled in patient names as they became known to her.under the scheme she devised,miller assumed the position of the certifying physician,and,like the gieger defendants,she made the key decision whether a particular patient had a medical need for a wheelchair or scooter.
second,as the owner of aa better medical supply,miller exercised substantial managerial discretion,which the guidelines recognize as an independent basis for occupying a position of trust.see cmt.the psr indicated that miller directed and oversaw the business operations at both her company and a related company she specifically instructed an employee to complete cmns with patient information,and she provided cash or gifts to individuals in exchange for patient referrals from those individuals.at the sentencing hearing,a texas official charged with a
