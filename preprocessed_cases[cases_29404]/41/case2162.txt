order and opinion 
the mandate issued september,is hereby recalled.
the opinion filed august,see county of santa clara astra usa,cir,is withdrawn.a superseding opinion will be filed concurrently with this order.petitions for rehearing or petitions for rehearing en banc may be filed.
certain federally funded medical section covered entities are able to purchase prescription drugs at a discount from drug manufacturers under a standardized agreement between the federal government and the drug companies.during,for example,these covered entities spent billion on outpatient prescription drugs.they claim in this lawsuit that they have been overcharged for those drugs in violation of pharmaceutical pricing agreements between the secretary of health and human services secretary and the drug manufacturer manufacturers.applying the federal common law of contracts,we hold that the covered entities are intended direct beneficiaries of these agreements and thus have the right to enforce the agreements discount provisions against the manufacturers and sue them for reimbursement of excess payments.we have jurisdiction under,and reverse the district court dismissal of the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.
background 
in part to enable certain clinics to obtain lower prices on the drugs that they provide to their patients,see.ii,at,congress enacted section of the veterans health care act of,stat.that provision,entitled limitations on prices of drugs purchased by covered entities,requires the secretary of health and human services to 
enter into an agreement with each manufacturer of covered drugs under which the amount required to be paid to the manufacturer for covered drugs purchased by a covered entity does not exceed an amount equal to the average manufacturer price for the drug under k in the preceding calendar quarter,reduced by a rebate percentage described in a.
a this drug discounting program is commonly known as the section program,tracing back to its original location within the public health service act the program is managed by the health resources and services administration hrsa,a subdivision of the department of health and human services dhhs.see statement of organizations,functions,and delegations of authority.in accordance with statute,the secretary entered into a standard pharmaceutical pricing agreement ppa with each of the manufacturers.
one of the manufacturers principal obligations under the ppa is to charge covered entities a price that does not exceed the average manufacturer price for the covered outpatient drug reported to the secretary in accordance with the manufacturer responsibilities under b,reduced by the rebate percentage.see ppa ii a the ppa defines average manufacturer price,covered entity,manufacturer and rebate percentage to have the meanings specified in and,as interpreted and applied herein.see ppa i a o.also known as the ceiling price,the maximum price that covered entities may be charged under the ppa is calculated using proprietary sales and pricing information the manufacturers disclose only to the secretary.
the genesis of the present appeal is a putative class action filed in california state court by the county of santa clara and a number of medical facilities santa clara,which are covered entities within the meaning of a and ppa i e.relying chiefly on reports published by dhhs office of the inspector general oig,santa clara alleged that the manufacturers have systematically overcharged its medical facilities,and all similarly situated covered entities,for covered drugs.oig march report estimated that overcharges during the period ending september totaled million.its june report,which was withdrawn in october because of problems with the underlying data,concluded that covered entities overpaid million in the month of september.in october,oig confirmed that its june calculation was erroneous because the centers for medicare and medicaid services had provided it with comparison ceiling prices from the wrong timeframe.oig did not retreat,however,from its other,more general findings that hrsa was not adequately overseeing the section program and that hrsa lacks the oversight mechanisms and authority to ensure that covered entities pay at or below the ceiling price.the october report also introduce d new concerns that systemic problems with the accuracy and reliability of the government pricing data could interfere with hrsa ability to monitor the section program.finally,a oig report estimated that covered entities overpaid million in june alone.
santa clara initially brought claims under the california false claims act and california unfair competition law in state court.after the manufacturers removed the action to federal district court,santa clara amended its complaint for the first time.the district court granted the manufacturers motion to dismiss,but with leave to amend.santa clara second amended complaint,now including claims for breach of the ppa,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,negligence and quantum meruit,fared no better than the first.the district court granted the manufacturers second motion to dismiss and denied as futile santa clara subsequent motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.santa clara appeals only the district court rejection of its ppa breach of contract claim on a third party beneficiary theory.

discussion 
we agree with santa clara that covered entities are intended direct beneficiaries of the ppa and have the right as third parties to bring claims for breach of that contract.we also conclude that allowing such suits under the ppa is consistent with congress intent in enacting the section program,even though the statute itself does not create a federal private cause of action.finally,we reject the manufacturers argument that primary jurisdiction is appropriate.
federal law controls the interpretation of the ppa,which is a contract entered into pursuant to federal law and to which the government is a party,smith cent.water conservation,cir,and which expressly provides that it shall be construed in accordance with federal common law,see ppa vii g for guidance,we may look to general principles for interpreting contracts.kennewick irrigation dist.united states,cir.among these principles,we interpret every part of a written contract with reference to the whole and give terms their ordinary meaning unless a contrary intent appears.see klamath,at.when possible,we ascertain the intent of the parties from the contract itself.see id.
under the federal common law of contracts,b efore a third party can recover under a contract,it must show that the contract was made for its direct it is an intended beneficiary of the contract.id.emphasis added.a promisor owes a duty of performance to any intended beneficiary of the promise,and the intended beneficiary may enforce the duty by suing as a third party beneficiary of the contract,whereas an incidental beneficiary acquires no right against the promisor.id.at quoting restatement second of contracts.to qualify as an intended beneficiary,the third party must show that the contract reflects the express or implied intention of the parties to the contract to benefit the third party.id.at citing montana united states.although intended beneficiaries need not be specifically or individually identified in the contract,they still must fall within a class clearly intended by the parties to benefit from the contract.id.
demonstrating beneficiary status in the context of a government contract is a comparatively difficult task.see smith,at kremen cohen,cir explaining that a more stringent test applies.we have explained that p arties that benefit from a government contract are generally assumed to be incidental beneficiaries,rather than intended ones,and so may not enforce the contract absent a clear intent to the contrary.see orff united states,cir,aff on other grounds,d quoting klamath,at.this clear intent hurdle is not satisfied by a contract recitation of interested constituencies,klamath,at,v ague,hortatory pronouncements,statement s of purpose,smith,at,explicit reference to a third party,orff,at,or even a showing that the contract operates to the third parties benefit and was entered into with them in mind,id.at.rather,we examine the precise language of the contract for a clear intent to rebut the presumption that the third parties are merely incidental beneficiaries.id.at.
having done this analysis,we are persuaded that covered entities are intended beneficiaries of the ppa and,accordingly,that santa clara has stated a breach of contract claim on a third party beneficiary theory.at the outset,we reject the suggestion that the availability of a third party contract claim is conditioned on the contract inclusion of a provision expressly granting the third party the right to sue.any intended beneficiary has the right to enforce the obligor duty of performance the right to sue inheres in one status as an intended beneficiary.see klamath,at see also far fed.bank,office of thrift,cir a third party who is an intended beneficiary of a contract may sue to enforce the contract or to obtain an appropriate remedy for breach.restatement second of contracts.to require additionally of intended beneficiaries that the contract by its terms provide for third party enforcement would read the distinction between incidental and intended beneficiaries out of the federal common law of contracts.see united states city of los angeles,cir w e allowed intended beneficiaries to sue and did not allow incidental beneficiaries to sue.restatement second of contracts.in disavowing any absolute requirement that the contract expressly provide for third party enforcement,we reaffirm klamath s clear intent principle with respect to intended beneficiary status.we simply clarify that if the plaintiff is an intended klamath and progeny setting forth the requisite the third party contract claim may go forward only when the plaintiff would qualify solely as an incidental beneficiary of the government contract is it necessary to have an express,specific statement of the promisor contractual liability to that third party such as by an express clause.see smith,at montana,at restatement second of contracts cmt.a.
we hold that the parties to the ppa clearly intended to grant covered entities enforceable rights as intended beneficiaries of that agreement.see kremen,at.in determining this central question of the parties intent,we look at the contract text and purpose,smith,at,e xamin ing the contract as a whole,klamath,at.we also weigh the circumstances of the transaction,far west,at,which,when a contract is mandated by a federal statute,includes the governing statute and its purpose,sec y of state for def.trimble navigation,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also rendleman bowen,cir.
in acceding to the ppa,the manufacturers undertook a specific responsibility to the covered entities pursuant to,the manufacturer agrees to charge covered entities a price for each unit of the drug that does not exceed the ceiling price of that drug.see ppa ii a emphasis added.smith,kremen,orff and of which rejected plaintiffs claims to be intended distinguishable on this ground alone there is a stark contrast between recitation of constituencies,explanatory recitals of purpose and references to individuals that the contracting parties had in mind all insufficient to prove the plaintiffs intended beneficiary status and the terms at issue here.see smith,at orff,at klamath,at.section ii a of the ppa sets forth an unambiguous,concrete limitation on how much the manufacturers may charge the covered entities other provisions of the ppa explain how to calculate the ceiling price,see ppa i a,b,l,identify who is eligible to receive the discounted price,see ppa i e,iii a,and require the parties to maintain records relevant to those matters,see ppa ii c f,iii b c.upon a fair reading of the ppa,we are unable to discern any substantial purpose of the ppa other than to grant eligible covered entities a discount on covered drugs.we are therefore persuaded that the ppa,on its face,was clearly intended to benefit the covered entities directly.
consideration of,the governing statute specifying the ppa terms,and its purposes reinforces this interpretation.see trimble navigation,at.the ppa itself provides that ambiguities shall be interpreted in the manner which best effectuates the statutory scheme.see ppa vii g.section ii a of the ppa closely tracks section of the veterans health care act of,which was enacted to require a manufacturer to extend the same price reduction to a covered entity for a drug or biological as is provided under the medicaid outpatient drug rebate program.joint explanatory statement on,cong.rec.its purpose was to enable certain clinics,covered entities to obtain lower prices on the drugs that they provide to their patients by prohibiting medicaid matching funds from being available for state spending on a manufacturer covered drugs unless the manufacturer enters into,and complies with,an agreement under which these protected purchasers,covered entities would pay the same amount for a covered outpatient drug that medicaid pays.ii,at emphasis added.in giving these covered entities access to price reductions the committee intends to enable these entities to stretch scarce federal resources as far as possible,reaching more eligible patients and providing more comprehensive services.id.at emphasis added.thus,although we agree with the manufacturers that general purpose is to conserve federal resources so as to reach as many eligible patients as possible,the legislative history makes plain that congress intended to accomplish this objective by enabling covered entities and other protected purchasers,a revealing choice of words to obtain discounted prices on covered drugs through the ppas 
relying on wisconsin gas,cir,the manufacturers contend that the ppa provision of an elective or informal dispute resolution process means the parties intended to preclude third party enforcement of the contract by the covered entities.sections iv a,b and d of the ppa allow manufacturers to refer certain disputes they have with covered entities to the secretary to conduct an investigation.if the secretary then finds that the covered entity is in violation,he may impose monetary liability or remove the entity from the list of eligible entities conversely,if the secretary believes a manufacturer has overcharged covered entities,he may initiate an informal dispute resolution process,which could result in the covered entities being reimbursed and the manufacturer ppa being terminated.see ppa iv c.the manufacturers also cite dhhs regulations,which,apart from the ppa,establish a voluntary process for the resolution of certain disputes between manufacturers and covered entities concerning compliance with the provisions of.see manufacturer audit guidelines and dispute resolution process.this process is also voluntary covered entities or manufacturers are not required to enter this informal process for resolution of disputes id.at.
does not support the manufacturers argument.there,the plaintiffs attempted to bring suit as third party beneficiaries of affirmative action provisions whose inclusion in procurement contracts was required by section of the rehabilitation act of.as a threshold matter,the contracts themselves suggested that the plaintiffs were not intended beneficiaries they were not directed at the handicapped in any way but instead focus ed exclusively on the relationship,at.the court found further support for its conclusion that the disabled were not intended beneficiaries in section and its implementing regulations,which established an administrative remedy for any handicapped individual who believe d any contractor has failed to comply with the affirmative action provisions and emphasized the resolution of disputes by informal means,including conciliation and persuasion.see id.at,citing b and a.
we perceive four material differences between the contract and statute in and those here.first,as discussed above,the ppa sets forth the contracting parties clear intent to directly benefit the covered entities.id.at.second,says nothing about the covered entities remedies,whether judicial or administrative.id.at the statutory grant of one remedy without mention of any other implies that congress intended to bar other remedies.emphasis added.third,allowing covered entities to bring suit as third party beneficiaries would not conflict with the ppa informal dispute resolution process,given that the entities themselves are unable to initiate that process last,the voluntary administrative dispute resolution procedure created by dhhs regulations expressly leaves open resort to other remedies which may be available under applicable principles of law.see.at see also id.at covered entities are only encouraged to participate in the process before seeking other remedies.in sum,neither the ppa nor establishes an exclusive elaborate administrative procedure,at,such a procedure to signal the parties intent to deny covered entities the right to enforce the ppa through litigation as intended beneficiaries.
the manufacturers remaining arguments against the covered entities intended beneficiary status are no more convincing.first,they contend it is illogical that the united states and the manufacturers would have intended to expose themselves to suit by the large number of covered entities,about reported as of this writing the breadth and indefiniteness of a class of beneficiaries is entitled to some weight in negating the inference of intended beneficiary status.see price pierce,cir commenting that parties would not likely have intended that almost every person in the united states could enforce the contract.but numbers alone are not determinative.for example,in hook state of,dep t of,cir,we recognized all inmates of the arizona prison system as intended beneficiaries of a consent decree regulating mail policies.similarly in this case,covered entities constitute a narrow,class,not at all akin to members of the public at large.see a defining covered entity ppa iii a making available list of eligible covered entities,iv b procedure for challenging eligibility of covered entities.
we are also unmoved by the manufacturers protest that they surely would not have agreed to subject themselves to a large number of lawsuits that could undermine the confidentiality of pricing data through discovery,given the ppa inclusion of a confidentiality provision the confidentiality provision itself,however,contemplates that such information could well be subject to disclosure for purposes of enforcing the ppa discount pricing requirements beyond any actions the secretary might initiate.section v a specifies that information disclosed to the secretary by the manufacturers,except as otherwise required by law,will not be disclosed by the secretary or his designee in a form which reveals the manufacturer,except as necessary to carry out the provisions of and to permit review by the oig.emphasis added.as the italicized phrases highlight,the confidentiality provision anticipates that disclosures could be required other than to or by the secretary.a district court discovery order compelling the production of documents would be a disclosure required by law and it would be the manufacturer,not the secretary,disclosing the information.to the extent a drug company would rightly be concerned about sensitive pricing information,district courts routinely enter protective orders to prevent the undue disclosure of commercially sensitive information.see.c phillips ex rel.estates of byrd motors,cir.thus we are unwilling to read the ppa confidentiality proviso as negating third party covered entities right to enforce the discount pricing requirements themselves.
although we conclude that covered entities are intended beneficiaries of the ppa,and so would ordinarily be entitled to bring suit to enforce it,the manufacturers urge that this is not the usual intended beneficiary case and that permitting third party enforcement of the ppa would conflict with congress intent in creating the section program in this vein,they point to santa clara concession before the district court that there is no private federal cause of action under see generally alexander sandoval,d.because congress did not provide a statutory remedy,the manufacturers argue,it necessarily did not intend to allow covered entities to make an around the statutory scheme by pursuing contractual remedies under the federal common law.
the starting point of this argument is the truism that federal common law,of which the federal common law of contracts forms a part,is subject to the paramount authority of congress.city of milwaukee illinois michigan,d quoting new jersey new york.we presume that congress legislates with the expectation that the principles of the federal common law will apply except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.astoria fed.savings loan ass solimino,d quoting isbrandtsen johnson.however,when congress speak s directly to a question addressed by the federal common law,it may displace it even without affirmatively proscrib ing its use.united states texas,d see also gardiner service,cir.in evaluating the displacement issue,courts must assess the scope of the legislation and whether the legislative scheme addresses the problem formerly governed by federal common law.gardiner,at the manufacturers,relying almost exclusively on grochowski phoenix,cir,contend that does just that and,therefore,to allow covered entities to enforce the ppa as a matter of contract would be inconsistent with congress choice of remedies.
in grochowski,the second circuit did not permit the plaintiffs to bring suit as third party beneficiaries of a contract between the contractor defendants and new york city public housing authority.see at.under the act,all construction contracts for federally funded projects must include the following provision t he contractor shall pay to all laborers not less than the wages prevailing in the locality of the project,as predetermined by the secretary of labor of the united states.id.first alteration in original.exercising his authority under to prescribe reasonable regulations for contractors subject to the act,the secretary of labor established an administrative remedial scheme.see id.at chan city of new york,cir citing,a.given these administrative remedies,and the absence of an explicit private cause of action,grochowski concluded that the plaintiffs efforts to bring their claims as state contract claims were clearly an impermissible end run around congressional intent as to the availability of remedies under the act.at.
assuming grochowski was correctly decided,the case is clearly inapposite on its own terms its analytical underpinning was the elemental canon of statutory construction that where a statute expressly provides a remedy,courts must be especially reluctant to provide additional remedies.id.at quoting karahalios fed of employees,local,d emphasis added.here,does not expressly provide any remedies to covered entities and unlike the act,is silent about the agency power to promulgate regulations against manufacturers with the force of law.a a ii the secretary shall establish a mechanism to ensure that covered entities comply emphasis added.although the secretary may terminate the ppa with a manufacturer for a violation of its provisions,this remedy is a matter of contract,not statute.see ppa vi c.reflecting this paucity of statutory authority,dhhs regulations establish only an informal,nonexclusive dispute resolution process,in which neither covered entities nor manufacturers are required to participate.see.at.nothing in the statute suggests that congress intended that dhhs create a substitute,administrative remedial scheme for covered entities to invoke against manufacturers.thus,there is nothing additional about the federal common law contract remedy that the covered entities could invoke as intended beneficiaries of the ppa.golt united states,cir holding that civil service reform
