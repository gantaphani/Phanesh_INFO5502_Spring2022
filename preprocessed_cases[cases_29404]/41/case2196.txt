tuyet nguyen nguyen appeals her jury conviction and sentence for conspiracy to transport stolen property in interstate commerce in violation of,for two counts of the transportation of stolen property in interstate commerce in violation of,for three counts of the introduction of misbranded medical devices into interstate commerce in violation of a,and for conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of.we have jurisdiction under.we affirm in part and reverse in part,and we remand for retrial and resentencing.
on july,a grand jury returned an indictment against nguyen,her husband phu nguyen,their company columbia medical systems,cms,and sess merke merke.the indictment alleged that tuyet and phu nguyen conspired with merke,robert davies davies,and others to steal and transport medical equipment from their former employer,atl philips medical systems philips.the indictment alleged that nguyen had conspired to sell stolen ultrasound probes the indictment alleged that the nguyens resold these stolen probes through their company,cms,after the probes were given new fake serial numbers.merke and davies withdrew from the conspiracy in,but the government alleged that the conspiracy continued until.
davies,an unindicted,testified under a grant of immunity that phu nguyen,appellant husband,asked him to steal probes and sell them to cms.with the help of davies,the conspiracy worked its fraud as follows davies would tell philips that a customer had a broken probe that needed replacement,even though the probe was working.philips would send the new probe to the customer,expecting that the customer would ship the broken probe back.davies would give phu nguyen the customer old but still functioning probe,and phu would transfer the functioning probe serial numbers onto one of the defective probes in the cms stockroom.then,davies would send the defective probe to philips.so,at philips expense,phu nguyen and his company,cms,would end up with functioning probes that were in effect stolen by fraud,and cms would have given up only defective probes.
the fraudulent conspiracy was also furthered by the deception of others.merke stole philips inventory from its stockrooms.at trial,evalyn thomas thomas,a philips data entry clerk who worked for merke,testified that merke removed finished probes from the finished goods inventory without adequate explanation several times.thomas explained that usually when an employee took material from the finished goods stockroom,they would fill out a material transfer form.that form tracked where the material went.thomas testified that it was unusual for someone in merke position to be dealing directly with customers,and it was also odd that merke personally pulled the stock and completed the entire form himself.according to thomas,when the material transfer form stated the employee was crediting the taken material to their wash account,the new material was being taken to replace some old,defective material.therefore,a material transfer form that took six parts from finished goods out of the stockroom and credited the wash account should also show the same number of parts going into the defective material stockroom.thomas testified that this full accounting of material did not occur on several of merke material transfer forms.instead,many parts disappeared,including ultrasound probes.
another philips employee,dave westrich westrich,testified that nguyen asked him to load some of philips proprietary software onto a hard drive for her.westrich refused and told nguyen not to call him again.the government contended that nguyen must have obtained the software another way because don davis,a cms customer,testified that in june,nguyen approached him with the suggestion that she would give him access to philip software if he agreed to guarantee a certain level of business with cms.
the prosecution introduced cms business records to show that cms sold more probes than it purchased for through.fda agent borden also explained that many philips probes tied to cms had false serial numbers.the police seized several probes with false serial numbers when executing a search warrant in december.the testimony tied other probes with false serial numbers to cms based on its invoices.
the prosecution also presented witnesses who said that having accurate serial numbers on ultrasound probes is important for fda compliance,as well as for philips inventory management.in a contract with cms,one company included clauses emphasizing that cms would only sell the company ultrasound components with original serial numbers.also,a customer testified that he would return a product and refuse to pay for it if he discovered that it did not bear the original serial number.
the government alleged that the nguyens paid for these stolen probes with cash to hide their origin.fda agent mahoney testified that the nguyens had made out several checks to cash with the notation purchase probes merke and purchase probes.these checks were drawn from cms accounts,and nguyen signed and negotiated several checks.
the jury heard evidence of nguyen statement in which she claimed that she and her husband did not buy any items from merke,and that merke had never delivered probes to her.agent borden also testified about statements that merke had made during merke interrogation.the government elicited information about that statement on direct examination,and merke counsel elicited still more on.agent borden testified that merke had stated that he had sold stolen medical equipment to the nguyens,and that he had received money from the nguyens,though he refused to estimate how much money.
during closing arguments,nguyen argued that the evidence did not establish whether she knew the probes were stolen or that the serial numbers had been changed.
on april,the jury found nguyen guilty of conspiracy to transport stolen property in interstate commerce.the jury convicted her of transportation of stolen property for the shipment of probes on july,and august,but acquitted her of those charges for the shipments occurring on august,and april.the jury found her guilty of introducing misbranded medical devices into interstate commerce for the shipments of probes occurring on july,august,and august,but acquitted her of those charges pertaining to shipments on june,april,and december.the jury acquitted nguyen of all five counts of holding for sale misbranded medical devices.finally,the jury convicted her of conspiracy to commit money laundering.
the district court sentenced nguyen to months incarceration.
we review claims of a violation of the confrontation clause de novo.united states nielsen,cir.
the parties dispute whether nguyen preserved this claim of error.before trial,nguyen made several motions in limine and objected to the use of a statement merke made to agent borden,alleging that its admission would violate the confrontation clause.nguyen objected to the admission of any portion of merke statement that alluded to her both in the motion in limine and again at trial.the government argues that nguyen should have objected to merke use of his own statement when merke counsel sent notice to all parties that merke would admit his statements.nguyen argues that she did not object because she understood merke alert to mean that merke would testify,curing any confrontation clause problem.instead,merke counsel elicited the statements for which nguyen had a continuing objection.after opening statements at trial,the district court clarified that nguyen did not need to make further objection on this issue and that the issue was preserved 
we have held that where the substance of an objection has been thoroughly explored and the trial court ruling was explicit and definitive,the issue is preserved for appeal.united states,cir quoting united states palmer,cir.as we have explained,nguyen brought the confrontation clause issue to the district court attention twice,and the district court made a definitive ruling and then said she did not need to object further to preserve the issue.accordingly,if there is confrontation clause error,we must apply harmless error review.nielsen,at.
we turn to the issue of whether the confrontation clause was offended by introduction of the statement made by merke as related by agent borden in her testimony.agent borden testified that while at first merke had said that he received nothing more than lunch money,he said a lot more things including that he actually had received other money from the nguyens,including money that he had taken as a result of selling equipment to them,but he would not specify the amount.she also testified that equipment included probes.the government had previously offered to redact the portion of merke statement where he referenced accepting money from the nguyens for stolen equipment to avoid any confrontation clause related errors,but merke counsel elicited the testimony anyway.
our confrontation clause analysis does not change because a,as opposed to the prosecutor,elicited the hearsay statement.the confrontation clause gives the accused the right to be confronted with witnesses against him.const.amend.vi crawford washington,d.the fact that nguyen elicited the hearsay has no bearing on her right to confront her accusers.see also united states mayfield,cir finding reversible error where a counsel elicited hearsay statements in violation of the confrontation clause.
only hearsay statements that are testimonial implicate the confrontation clause.crawford,at.while the court in crawford did not comprehensively define testimonial statements,it stated that statements to a police officer during interrogations qualified.id.at.merke made his statement during agent borden interrogation,and we conclude that it was testimonial.
this testimonial statement was hearsay.the government argues that merke statement that he had sold the nguyens scrap metal was admitted to show consciousness of guilt.the testimony,however,was broader and agent borden testified that merke had sold the nguyens medical equipment.this statement does not show merke consciousness of guilt,nor is the statement obviously false.see,united states trala,cir holding in a case where the government sought to prove bank robbery,conflicting hearsay statements by a regarding the origin of the money were admitted to show consciousness of guilt and were obviously false.merke statement in which he said that he had received some money from the nguyens but denied receiving half a million dollars was also not obviously false.see id.the government even acknowledged that this statement raised potential confrontation clause problems and offered to redact it.
the government argues that merke statement was not inculpatory.but this is not controlling on the existence of error.crawford does not require that a statement inculpate a defendant to trigger error under the confrontation clause.simply,confrontation clause error occurs at admission of a testimonial statement without an opportunity to.crawford,at.if the statement is not inculpatory,that might be probative of the harmlessness of an error,but not of the existence of a confrontation clause error.
because merke statement was testimonial and admitted for its truth,we hold its admission at nguyen trial was error.
the prosecution bears the burden of proving the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.united states gillam,cir once we find a confrontation clause error,the prosecution has the burden of showing that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.see also chapman california,d.an assessment of harmlessness can not include consideration of whether the witness testimony would have been unchanged,or the jury assessment unaltered,had there been confrontation such an inquiry would obviously involve pure speculation,and harmlessness must therefore be determined on the basis of the remaining evidence.coy iowa,d.whether an error is harmless depends on a variety of factors,including whether the testimony was cumulative,the presence or absence of corroborating or contradicting the testimony on material points,the extent of,and of course,the overall strength of the prosecution case.mayfield,at citation and internal quotations omitted.
the government argues that the error in admitting the hearsay statement was harmless it contends that the evidence established that merke had stolen probes from philips,that both nguyens had signed checks to merke,some of which had purchase probes merke on the memo line,that cms had sold more probes than it had bought,that phu nguyen had solicited davies to steal probes for cms,that tuyet nguyen had solicited westrich to steal philips software for cms,and that tuyet nguyen falsely denied doing any business with merke.the statement that merke received money from the nguyens in exchange for medical equipment was the most persuasive evidence that tied tuyet nguyen to the stolen probes,and the only testimony that showed her knowledge that the probes were stolen.
we can not say that the government carried its burden of establishing this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.specifically,the hearsay testimony supported the government case that nguyen knew that the probes were stolen.her knowledge was an element of her convictions for the transportation of stolen property and,therefore,necessary to her conspiracy convictions.nguyen closing argument to the jury centered on her contention that she did not know the probes were stolen.while the jury could have concluded that she knew the probes were stolen absent the hearsay testimony,the government has not proven that the jury would have so concluded beyond a reasonable doubt.we reverse and remand nguyen convictions for conspiracy to transport stolen property,conspiracy to commit money laundering,and the transportation of stolen property because nguyen was not able to merke about his statement.this confrontation clause error does not affect her convictions for introducing a misbranded medical device into interstate commerce 
we next address the conviction for felony misbranding of medical devices.the problem before us here is that the jury instruction that defined felony misbranding of medical devices did not include a materiality element.nguyen did not object to the instruction and argues that we should apply plain error review.
the government to the contrary argues waiver and relies upon the invited error doctrine,which in an appropriate case allows us to decline to review instructions where a defendant invited the error and relinquished a known right.see united states perez,cir.as the court in perez stated,f orfeited rights are reviewable for plain error,while waived rights are not.id.citation omitted.waiver occurs where a defendant considered the controlling law,or omitted element,and,in spite of being aware of the applicable law,proposed or accepted a flawed instruction.id.
nguyen proposed another instruction,instruction,and the government contends that this instruction shows that she knew that materiality was an element of felony misbranding.instruction,however,only states that any omission must be material,it does not say that an affirmative statement need be material.therefore,it is not clear that nguyen considered the controlling law and accepted the flawed instruction.we conclude that the waiver argument should be rejected and instead we accept nguyen argument that we should review the jury instruction on felony misbranding of medical devices for plain error.
to prevail on plain error review,nguyen must show that the proceedings below involved error,that the error is plain,and that the error affected the substantial rights of the aggrieved party.see united states olano,d.in addition,a defendant must also show that the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings before we will exercise our discretion pursuant to rule b to correct the plain error.united states alferahin,cir en banc citing olano,at.see also united states hai waknine.
materiality indisputably is an element of felony misbranding of medical devices.united states watkins,cir.it is thus somewhat surprising that the government proposed instructions did not include this element.the government concedes that instruction did not include that element but argues that this omission was cured by instruction.that instruction stated 
if any article is alleged to be misbranded because the labeling or advertising is misleading,then in determining whether the labeling or advertising is misleading there shall be taken into account among other things not only representations made or suggested by statement,word,design,device,or any combination thereof,but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in the light of such representations or material with respect to consequences which may result from the use of the article to which the labeling or advertising relates under the conditions of use prescribed in the labeling or advertising thereof or under such conditions of use as are customary or usual.
this instruction does not cure the lack of materiality element.it states that the article could be misbranded because of a misstatement or a failure to state something that is material.therefore,we hold the government argument is unavailing and that there was error.the instructions did not include the materiality element,this was an error and it is as simple as that.
it remains to be determined whether this error requires relief under the plain error standard.we believe that the first element of that standard is met.an error is plain when it is clear or obvious under the law.olano,at.we have held that a district court error is plain when its jury instructions fail to incorporate an element that has been clearly established by ninth circuit precedent.alferahin,at citation omitted.we hold that disregard of the materiality element for felony misbranding of medical devices is a plain error.
we turn next to the third element of the plain error standard,whether substantial rights are affected,and it is here that nguyen appeal falters.t he omission of an element from jury instructions does not always affect a defendant substantial rights.id.citing neder united states,d.nguyen closing statement to the jury did not argue that the changed serial numbers were focused on the point that the numbers may have been changed by someone else and that nguyen may have not known about it.moreover,the government presented plenty of evidence to support a finding of materiality.two customers testified that they would not buy ultrasound probes without original serial numbers.one of cms customers included a clause in its contract stating that all probes would have original serial numbers.the testimony also demonstrated that the probes original serial numbers were critical for fda compliance and in the event of a recall.thus,there was overwhelming evidence of the materiality of the altered serial numbers and very little evidence that these changes were unimportant 
because of the strong evidence on materiality and because nguyen did not contest materiality of altered serial numbers in her presentations to the jury,we hold that this error did not affect nguyen substantial rights.
for the forgoing reasons,we conclude that nguyen confrontation clause rights were violated and we reverse her convictions for conspiracy to transport stolen property,the transportation of stolen property,and conspiracy to commit money laundering.her remaining convictions for felony misbranding of medical devices are affirmed.we remand for retrial,if the government wishes to pursue the charges that we reverse,and for resentencing.
reversed in part,affirmed in part,and remanded.
i agree with the majority that tuyet nguyen nguyen adequately preserved in the district court her claim that the admission of the statement by sess merke to agent borden violated the confrontation clause.i also agree that the admission of merke statement offended the confrontation clause.i disagree,however,with the majority conclusion that this error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.for this reason,i dissent in part from the majority opinion and would affirm nguyen convictions for conspiracy to transport stolen property,conspiracy to commit money laundering,and transportation of stolen property 
confrontation clause errors are subject to harmless error review.united states schoneberg,cir.a n otherwise valid conviction should not be set aside if the reviewing court may confidently say,on the whole record,that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.delaware van arsdall,d.to assess the harmlessness of an error,we inquire whether,assuming that the damaging potential of the were fully realized,we might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.harmlessness is determined on the basis of the remaining evidence,coy iowa,d,and we consider a number of factors including the importance of the witness testimony in the prosecution case,whether the testimony was cumulative,the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points,the extent of otherwise permitted,and,of course,the overall strength of the prosecution case.van arsdall,at.
the majority initially asserts that the most persuasive evidence that tied tuyet nguyen to the stolen probes,and the only testimony that showed her knowledge that the probes were stolen was merke statement,as related by agent borden,that merke received money from the nguyens in exchange for medical equipment op.at.the majority subsequent discussion is more nuanced and determines that,absent the hearsay testimony,the government has not proven that the jury would have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that nguyen knew the probes were stolen id.at.
i respectfully disagree.based on all of the remaining evidence in the record,i conclude that any reasonable jury would have connected nguyen to the stolen probes and determined that nguyen knew the probes were stolen,even without merke hearsay statement.the record demonstrates that merke stole the probes,sold and transferred them to nguyen and her company,columbia medical systems,cms,and that nguyen then sold the probes in interstate commerce.
evidence in the record indicates that merke stole functional probes from philips and sold them to cms and nguyen.documentary evidence and the testimony of evalyn thomas,a philips data entry clerk,establish that equipment,including ultrasound probes,disappeared and could not be accounted for while merke was in charge of philips defective materials storeroom and finished goods storeroom.see op.at.also,documentary evidence in the form of documents indicates that merke repeatedly shipped packages to cms tuyet nguyen.the record contains numerous shipping invoices,logs,and waybills that connect merke to nguyen and cms.
furthermore,the government presented evidence of cms practice of using checks made payable to cash to purchase probes and other ultrasound equipment,and testimony that this was an unusual practice in the industry given that it signaled potential illegal conduct.of these checks payable to cash on cms account,of them,totaling roughly,include a notation purchase probes merke or some similar descriptor.tuyet nguyen signed of these checks this evidence overwhelmingly links nguyen to the probes,and to merke.the evidence of the checks payable to cash and referencing both probes and merke also directly contradicts nguyen statement during a police interview that she had never purchased or taken delivery of any items,including probes,from merke.
the government also produced evidence that cms sold many more ultrasound probes than it recorded as purchased.for example,a comparison of cms purchase and sales reports for specific,relevant equipment models indicates that for the year,cms purchased nine items and sold sixty items.for the year,there were seven purchases and sales.in,there were four purchases and forty sales.in,cms purchased items and sold items.in,there were no purchases,yet sales 
in addition,the government produced evidence of the nguyens other attempts to facilitate their criminal scheme.first,as the majority notes,phu nguyen,tuyet nguyen husband and business partner in cms,solicited robert davies,a philips employee,to steal ultrasound probes for cms.see op.at.second,tuyet nguyen solicited dave westrich,her former colleague from philips,to steal philips prop
