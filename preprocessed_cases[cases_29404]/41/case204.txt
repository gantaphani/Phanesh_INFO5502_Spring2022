judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.as a result,disputes that are committed by contract to the arbitral process almost always are won or lost before the arbitrator.teamsters local union supervalu,cir.this case is no exception to that general rule.because the losing party,appellant cytyc corporation cytyc,has failed to establish any legally cognizable basis for setting aside the arbitrators award,we uphold the district court order granting the confirmation motion filed by the prevailing party,appellee deka products limited partnership deka.
background 
cytyc manufactures and sells a cervical cancer screening system.deka operates a commercial research and development laboratory.in the late,cytyc endeavored to improve the accuracy of the traditional pap smear test that relies on technicians to prepare a microscope slide from each cervical cell sample and then review the specimen for irregularities.due to human error,this methodology yields a relatively high incidence of false negatives.cytyc proposed to solve that problem by using a computer imager to prescreen the slide specimens.
during the developmental phase of this project,cytyc encountered a potentially insuperable obstacle its imaging technology could accurately screen a thin,uniform layer of cells,but the slide specimens prepared by human technicians were often disuniform.desirous of obtaining standardized slide specimens,cytyc retained deka to create an automated process for transferring cells from a test sample onto a slide.
deka successfully developed such a process the thinprep system.this system consists of two components.the first is the thinprep machine that transfers the cells onto the slide.the processor utilizes technology patented by deka prior to its association with cytyc.this body of knowledge is known as fluid management system fms technology.the second component of the thinprep system is a set of four disposable accessories a microscope slide,a sample collection device manufactured by a third party,a vial of cytyc patented preservative solution,and a filter cylinder invented specifically for use in the thinprep system.while the thinprep system employs a number of products and processes,its sine qua non is the fms technology.
in march of,cytyc and deka entered into a licensing agreement the agreement relative to the thinprep system.the agreement recited that deka,by means of the fms technology,had developed a method and apparatus to facilitate the preparation of slides for medical and laboratory purposes and wished to license the fms technology to cytyc for use in the thinprep system.in exchange for this license,cytyc agreed to pay deka a royalty equal to one percent of the net sales of products or improvements covered by the agreement.
by its terms,the agreement divided products into two categories product hardware and product disposables.product hardware meant,in effect,the thinprep processor we do not dwell on this,as there is no dispute between the parties concerning royalty payments related to hardware.product disposables comprised any filter cylinder or similar disposable provided such disposable utilizes the cytyc technology,the fms technology or both.the agreement noted somewhat cryptically that the term product disposable s presently includes the filter cylinder.
although the thinprep system functioned well,cytyc struggled to perfect its imaging technology.finally,it began to market the thinprep system without the computer imager.at some point,cytyc developed a special microscope slide for use in the thinprep system and started to sell it,along with the other three disposable accessories,in a single bundle called the thinprep kit.the thinprep kit became a rousing commercial success,and cytyc emerged as a leader in the market for cervical cancer screening systems.
for some period of time,cytyc made quarterly royalty payments to deka pursuant to the agreement.in november of,however,cytyc notified deka of its belief that,for an earlier period,it had calculated deka royalties too generously.in staking out this position,cytyc posited that the agreement entitled deka to royalties only on sales of the filter cylinder and not on sales of the other three disposable accessories included in the thinprep kit.cytyc further informed deka that,consistent with this reading of the agreement,it had computed the royalties referable to filter cylinder sales in accordance with the relative cost of the kit components the relative cost ratio method.deka disputed both cytyc overpayment claim and its method for figuring royalties.in deka view,the agreement required cytyc to pay a flat one percent royalty on net sales of all disposable accessories.
the parties attempted on at least two occasions to resolve their differences.at one such meeting,cytyc chief financial officer threatened that if deka continued to resist cytyc royalty calculation method,he would manipulate the cost data and suppress future royalties.
the agreement gave deka the right to commission an independent audit of cytyc books should questions arise about the amount of royalty payments due.when the parties negotiations stalled,deka exercised this prerogative.the final audit report covered the period from january of through september of.the auditors described cytyc relative cost ratio method of calculating royalties as unusual and uncommon and found that,even under this unorthodox approach,cytyc had underpaid deka.the auditors further concluded that if the agreement required the payment of royalties on the net sales of all disposable accessories contained in the thinprep kits,the amount of the underpayment would exceed for the audit period alone.
the agreement stipulated that disputes between the parties would be subject to binding arbitration.armed with the audit report,deka served a demand for arbitration.it claimed,inter alia,that cytyc had breached the agreement by failing to pay royalties on the net sales of all the disposable accessories or,alternatively,by allocating royalties referable to the filter cylinder based on the relative cost ratio method.
a arbitration panel held an evidentiary hearing that focused on the interpretation of the term product disposables and the appropriate method for calculating deka royalties.the parties positions were in sharp contrast.on the one hand,deka maintained that the term product disposables included any and all disposable accessories that used the cytyc or fms technology in the creation of a sample slide a reading that,in effect,mandated the payment of royalties with respect to sales of all four disposable accessories bundled in the thinprep kit.deka also asserted that royalties should be gauged by the net sales,rather than the relative costs,of the kit components.on the other hand,cytyc argued that the term product disposables covered only the filter cylinder,not the other three disposable accessories bundled in the thinprep kit,and that royalties should be computed by using the relative cost ratio method.
to bolster its position,cytyc proffered two kinds of adscititious evidence.the first was a set of three letters between the parties,exchanged prior to the execution of the agreement,which purported to document an intent to exclude sales of cytyc preservative solution from deka royalty base.the second comprised testimonial and documentary evidence suggesting that,over a period of years,cytyc had disclosed its use of the relative cost ratio method to deka without eliciting any objection.
shortly after the conclusion of the hearing,one of the arbitrators died.in march of,the remaining two arbitrators issued a partial final award the pfa.the agreement provided that new hampshire law would be controlling and,in the pfa,the arbitrators ruled that the new hampshire statute of limitations barred deka breach of contract claim for periods prior to november.as to subsequent periods,the linchpin of the arbitrators decision was a finding that 
fms technology is a system it is not a specific product.it is the operation of a system on certain components.in this particular situation the components are the four units the filter,the collection device,the vial and the slide t hese units are worthless by themselves,but when put together and governed by this patented system,the fms technology,they become enormously valuable.
the arbitrators coupled this finding with two other findings that the fms technology was the key component of the thinprep system and that the four disposable accessories were integrated by design and function in order to work.
after making these findings,the arbitrators addressed the contested contractual provision 
the phrase or similar disposable provided such disposable utilizes the cytyc technology,the fms technology or both can not be read to be restricted to only the filter.the very next sentence,which reads product disposable s presently includes the filter cylinder,must mean that the term disposables includes the other disposables in the kit and any improvements or modifications.
in line with this parsing of the agreement text,the arbitrators determined that cytyc relative cost ratio method for figuring royalties was contrary to the a greement and that the parties never intended that royalties would be paid on parts of the kit rather tha n the kit as a whole.based on these serial determinations and the plain language of the agreement,the arbitrators concluded that the term product disposables covered all four of the disposable accessories bundled in the thinprep kit and,accordingly,that the agreement entitled deka to royalties on the proceeds derived from the net sales of the kits.
although the pfa resolved the central issues in dispute,the panel believed that it could not make an accurate calculation of deka damages on the record as it stood.consequently,the arbitrators ordered the parties to submit proposed damage computations within days and authorized them to supplement the record to the extent necessary to buttress these computations.
the parties submitted widely disparate damage estimates.in large part,that disparity arose because cytyc claimed a right to offset deka royalties by deducting commissions allegedly paid on the sales of thinprep products,whereas deka argued that,in the language of the agreement,cytyc was entitled to deduct only those commissions that were actually stated on a customer invoice.
in their ensuing final award,the arbitrators once again sided with deka.they found that t he only customer invoices in the record are devoid of any statement of commissions.largely for that reason,the arbitrators final award set deka damages in the amount of,plus interest of that pretty much tracked what the panel characterized as the persuasive calculations made by deka accountants.the arbitrators also ordered cytyc to bear the expenses of both the audit and the arbitration,and to reimburse deka for attorneys fees and costs.
having lost at virtually every turn,cytyc asked the district court to vacate the arbitral award.deka for confirmation of the award.ruling ore sponte,the district court rejected cytyc importunings and granted deka motion.this timely appeal followed.

standard of review.
in an action to vacate or confirm an arbitral award,we typically review the district court decision de novo see,supervalu,at.the authority of a federal court to disturb an arbitration award is tightly circumscribed.while the award must draw its essence from the contract that underlies the arbitration proceeding,courts will deem that benchmark achieved as long as the arbitrators are even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of their authority.united paperworkers int l union misco,d.that a reviewing court is convinced that the arbitrators committed serious not justify setting aside the arbitral decision.id.this remains true whether the arbitrators apparent error concerns a matter of law or a matter of fact.advest,mccarthy,cir.
none of this means,however,that arbitral awards are utterly impregnable.although courts do not sit to hear claims of factual or legal error by an arbitrator as an appellate court does in reviewing decisions of lower courts,misco,at,there are nevertheless a few exceptions to the general rule that arbitrators have the last word.one set of exceptions is codified in the federal arbitration act faa.the operative provision,section a of the faa authorizes vacatur only in cases of specified misconduct or misbehavior on the arbitrators part,actions in excess of arbitral powers,or failures to consummate the award.advest,at.
a second set of exceptions flows from the federal courts inherent power to vacate arbitral awards.see id.this authority is very narrow.one manifestation of it,usually but not exclusively associated with labor arbitration,arises when an award contravenes the plain language of the applicable contract.see bull hn info,hutson,cir recognizing the applicability of this principle outside the labor context.another manifestation arises in those rare cases in which it is clear from the record that the arbitrators cavalierly disregarded applicable law.advest,at.
at the expense of carting coal to newcastle,let us make one thing perfectly clear.despite the existence of these exceptions,great deference remains the general mode of approach to judicial review of arbitral awards.id.at.
b.the merits.
against this backdrop,we turn to cytyc asseverational array.
misinterpretation of the agreement.cytyc most bruited contention is that the panel neglected to offer any interpretation of the text of the agreement or,alternatively,that the panel interpretation of the term product disposables is unfounded in reason and fact and thus,in either event,that the arbitral award fails to draw its essence from the agreement.if either part of that binary charge were correct,vacation would be an appropriate remedy.see misco,at.cytyc,however,has failed to carry its heavy burden of substantiating the charge.
cytyc claim that the panel neglected to interpret the agreement is jejune.we must uphold the arbitrators decision as long as they were even arguably construing the agreement.id.that standard is abundantly satisfied here.the panel decision portions of which are quoted above makes manifest that the arbitrators pondered the pertinent language of the agreement and construed that language in accordance with the parties discernible intent.that is contract interpretation,pure and simple.see robbins salem radiology,holding that,in reviewing a contract,a court must give the language the interpretation that best reflects the parties intentions at the time of contracting.
cytyc more robust claim is that the arbitrators interpretation of the agreement was flawed.even under the highly deferential standard that constrains judicial review of arbitral awards,the moving party may establish entitlement to vacation of an arbitral award on a persuasive showing that the arbitrators interpretation is contrary to the plain language of the contract.bull hn info,at advest,at.this configuration requires the movant to demonstrate that the award is unfounded in reason and fact based on reasoning so palpably faulty that no judge,or group of judges,ever could conceivably have made such a ruling or mistakenly based on a crucial assumption that is concededly a.advest,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
in this case,the plain language of the agreement,when coupled with the arbitrators factual findings,easily sustains the interpretation upon which the award rests.the agreement defines product disposables as any filter cylinder or similar disposable provided such disposable utilizes the cytyc technology,the fms technology or both.in what necessarily amounted to an explication of this provision,the panel supportably found that the fms technology pervades the entire thinprep system and that the four disposable
