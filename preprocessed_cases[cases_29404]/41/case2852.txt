for some years,the secretary of labor has determined whether coal mine operators are complying with standards limiting miners exposure to respirable coal dust by using a methodology that averages multiple dust samples taken over a single shift.in,the secretary issued three citations to excel mining,llc for violating those standards.excel appealed to the federal mine safety and health review commission,contending that the secretary longstanding compliance methodology was unlawful under the federal mine safety and health act of the mine act,et,and that the only lawful method was to average multiple samples taken over multiple shifts.the commission agreed with excel and vacated the citations.the secretary now petitions for review of the adverse judgment of the commission.we grant the petition and reverse.
congress enacted the federal coal mine health and safety act of the coal act to develop and promulgate improved mandatory health or safety standards to protect the health and safety of the nation coal miners.pub,g,stat.in,congress incorporated the coal act into the more comprehensive mine act,pub,stat.codified as amended at et.see secretary of labor cannelton.the new legislation brought the mining of coal,metals,and under the same regulatory scheme and transferred enforcement powers and other duties from the secretary of the interior to the secretary of labor.see a.
sections and of the mine act authorize the secretary to promulgate mandatory safety and health standards for the nation mines and to conduct regular inspections of those mines.see.section b of the mine act,originally enacted as part of the coal act,set the initial exposure standard for respirable coal dust at milligrams per cubic meter of air.b.the section was intended to provide,to the greatest extent possible,that the working conditions in each underground coal mine are sufficiently free of respirable dust concentrations in the mine atmosphere to permit each miner the opportunity to work underground during the period of his entire adult working life without incurring any disability from pneumoconiosis black lung disease or any other disease during or at the end of such period.b.
section b provides as follows 
e ach operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which each miner in the active workings of such mine is exposed at or below milligrams of respirable dust per cubic meter of air.
b emphasis added.the current mandatory health standard for respirable coal dust in underground mines,adopted by the secretary of labor in and codified at a,tracks this statutory language.see respirable dust,fed.reg.the statutory term average concentration of key import in this case is defined in f of the mine act as follows 
t he term average concentration means a determination which accurately represents the atmospheric conditions with regard to respirable dust to which each miner in the active workings of a mine is exposed as measured,during the month period following december,over a number of continuous production shifts to be determined by the secretary of labor originally,the secretary of the interior and the secretary of health and human services originally,the secretary of health,education,and welfare hew,and as measured thereafter,over a single shift only,unless the secretary of labor and the secretary of health and human services find,in accordance with the provisions of section of this title,that such single shift measurement will not,after applying valid statistical techniques to such measurement,accurately represent such atmospheric conditions during such shift.
section f of the mine act is taken essentially verbatim from f of the coal act.in,acting pursuant to the coal act,the secretaries of the interior and hew made the joint finding referred to in f,concluding that single shift measurement of respirable dust will not,after applying valid statistical techniques to such measurement,accurately represent the atmospheric conditions to which the miner is continuously exposed.notice of finding that a single shift measurement of respirable dust will not accurately represent atmospheric conditions during such shift,fed.reg,hereinafter joint finding.pursuant to mine act b and c,all standards,decisions,determinations,and regulations issued under the coal act remain in effect under the mine act until modified or set aside.b,c.the joint finding has not been modified or set aside,and continues in effect 
to ensure compliance with mandatory health standards,mine act a directs the labor department mine safety and health administration msha to test the atmosphere of each underground mine in its entirety at least four times annually.a.if upon inspection or investigation a msha inspector discovers a violation of the mine act or of a mandatory standard,he must issue a citation to the operator.id.a.section a of the mine act provides for the assessment of civil penalties for such violations.id.a.an operator can appeal to the federal mine safety and health review commission fmshrc or the commission,id.d,and the losing party can then seek review before the appropriate united states court of appeals,id.
since,the secretary of the interior and his successor,the secretary of labor,have based regular compliance determinations under the respirable dust standard on the average of multiple measurements taken over a single shift.see coal mine respirable dust standard noncompliance determinations,fed.reg,joint stipulations and statements of uncontested fact at at hereinafter joint stip.using this methodology,msha inspectors collect respirable dust samples during one full shift from miners assigned to different occupations in the same mechanized mining unit.fed.reg.at joint stip.at at.the samples are then averaged,and msha issues a citation under a if the average concentration of respirable dust from all of the occupations exceeds the applicable standard.fed.reg.at joint stip.at at.
in march,msha inspectors issued three citations to excel mining,charging violations of a respirable dust standard.each citation was based on an average of multiple samples taken over a single shift,and in each case the average respirable dust concentration substantially exceeded the applicable standard.see joint stip.at at.excel contested the citations before the commission,maintaining that under both mine act f and the joint finding,msha was barred from using any kind of sampling for enforcement purposes and was limited to sampling exclusively.the secretary took the position that,although the statute and joint finding barred her from making a compliance determination on the basis of a single sample,she was free to make such a determination based on an average of multiple samples taken over a single shift multiple samples 
the commission ruled in favor of excel and vacated the three citations.excel mining,llc sec y of labor,fmshrc.two commissioners concluded that both f and the joint finding envision ed but two methods of respirable dust sampling measurements and measurements derived from samples taken over a number of continuous production shifts,and that together they unambiguously barred all single shift sampling.id.at,riley and verheggen,comm rs.a third commissioner agreed with the secretary that the joint finding was ambiguous on the question,but concluded that the secretary interpretation was unreasonable on policy grounds.id.at beatty,comm r,concurring exercising her statutory right under,the secretary petitions for review of the commission decision.
the standard of review applicable to this petition is set out in our opinion in cannelton industries,at.under the mine act,the secretary interpretation of the law must be given weight by both the commission and the courts.id.quoting,at.when,as here,the secretary and the commission divide,it is the secretary rather than the commission who is entitled to the deference described in chevron natural resources defense council,d.see rag cumberland res.lp fmshrc,secretary of labor fmshrc,martin occupational safety health review comm n,d.
under the first step of chevron,this court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.cannelton,at quoting chevron,at.at.but when the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for this court is whether the secretary interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute.id.quoting chevron,at.at see secretary of labor fmshrc,at.under this second step,the court must defer to a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of the agency.chevron,at.at.moreover,in the statutory scheme of the mine act,the secretary litigating position before the commission is as much an exercise of delegated lawmaking powers as is the secretary promulgation of a health and safety standard,and is therefore deserving of deference.rag cumberland,at quoting martin,at.at 
the secretary is emphatically due this same respect when she interprets her own regulations.cannelton,at citing ford motor credit milhollin,d.we must defer to her interpretation unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.akzo nobel salt,fmshrc,quoting thomas jefferson shalala,d.and,as with conflicts over statutory interpretation,it is the secretary rather than the commission who deserves our deference when the two differ over a regulation meaning.see energy west mining fmshrc.
excel argues that this ordinary rule of deference to an agency regulatory interpretation should not apply to the secretary of labor construction of the joint finding,a finding that was made not by her but by the secretary of the interior and the secretary of hew.excel does not rest this argument simply on the fact that the secretary of labor was not involved in the promulgation of the joint finding.indeed,the company concedes that,as early as,the secretary of the interior interpreted the joint finding in the same way the secretary of labor does now,and that the latter has succeeded to the former role under the statute.excel br.at see energy west,at holding that appellate review of mine regulations promulgated by the secretary of the interior proceeds as if the regulations were originally promulgated by the secretary of labor see also amerada hess pipeline fed.energy regulatory comm n,deferring to ferc interpretation of a regulation promulgated by the icc before the icc authority over oil pipelines was transferred to ferc.rather,it is the secretary of hew involvement in the joint finding,excel says,that renders deference to the secretary of labor interpretation unwarranted.
it is true that we do not generally accord deference to one agency interpretation of a regulation issued and administered by another agency.see amerada hess,at.but that does not help excel here.the mine act grants the secretary of labor the authority to develop,promulgate,and revise as may be appropriate,improved mandatory health or safety standards,a,and to enforce those standards by citing mine operators for violations,id.a it further provides that standards,decisions,regulations,and determinations issued under the coal act remain in effect until the secretary of labor revises them.id.b,c.as we explained in paralyzed veterans of america arena lp,where we granted deference to the justice department interpretation of a regulation that was initially drafted by another agency but subsequently adopted and administered by justice 
we do not defer to an administrative agency interpretation of its regulation solely because its employees are the drafters and presumably have superior knowledge as to what they intended t he doctrine of deference is based primarily on the agency statutory role as the sponsor of the regulation,not necessarily on its drafting expertise under chevron,an agency interpretation of ambiguous statutory language is entitled to deference because of the agency delegated authority to administer the statute,and the same consideration underlies deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulation.
see amerada hess,at rejecting an argument that the court should deny deference to ferc because that agency did not promulgate the regulation at issue,noting that c ourts defer to agency interpretations in large part because congress has chosen to delegate to the agency decisionmaking in the field.this analysis applies here as well,and we therefore accord appropriate deference to the secretary of labor interpretation of both the mine act and the joint finding.
finally,in evaluating the reasonableness of the secretary interpretation of the statute and the joint finding,we take into account the fact that her reading tracks both the department of the interior and the department of labor original interpretation,adopted at a time when the origins of both the statute and the finding were fresh in the minds of their administrators.likewise,we give weight to the fact that the agency that administers the statute and the joint finding has interpreted them the same way for more than years.see barnhart walton,d t his court will normally accord particular deference to an agency interpretation of longstanding duration.internal quotation marks omitted 
we now proceed to examine the validity of the secretary interpretation.we consider the question of statutory interpretation in part iii and that of regulatory interpretation in part iv.
excel contends that this case is resolved by a simple application of chevron first step.according to the company,mine act f unambiguously requires the secretary to use samples to measure respirable dust,and bars her from using any kind of methodology.by contrast,the secretary argues that the case is resolved by chevron second step,because the language of the act is ambiguous on this question and her construction is reasonable.according to the secretary,the mine act permits her to use either samples or multiple samples to calculate average dust concentration for enforcement purposes.the only kind of measurement that is barred,in her view,is the use of a single sample which measures a single miner exposure over a single shift.
the starting place for our analysis is mine act b,originally part of the coal act,which sets the initial exposure standard for respirable dust.that section requires that each mine operator continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which each miner in the active workings of such mine is exposed at or below milligrams of respirable dust per cubic meter of air.b emphasis added.needless to say,the language of this section does not unambiguously resolve this dispute,as all three methodologies at issue here involve the use of averages excel method averages results over several shifts the secretary multiple method averages results over a single shift and the single method calculates the average exposure of a single miner over an entire shift.see supra note.
we next turn to mine act f,which defines average concentration for purposes of b and which is the statutory provision at the heart of this litigation.the first part of f contains a definition that,both parties agree,effectively required the secretary to use the method for the first months after passage of the coal act,a period that began on december,and ended in.see f.thereafter,f defines average concentration as 
a determination which accurately represents the atmospheric conditions with regard to respirable dust to which each miner in the active workings of a mine is exposed as measured,over a single shift only,unless the secretary of labor originally,the secretary of the interior and the secretary of health and human services originally,the secretary of hew find,in accordance with the provisions of section of this title,that such single shift measurement will not,after applying valid statistical techniques to such measurement,accurately represent such atmospheric conditions during such shift.
f emphasis added.although they disagree as to its meaning,see infra part iv,both parties agree that the joint finding is the finding contemplated in f,and neither party questions its validity.our statutory construction therefore proceeds on that assumption.see supra note.
excel contends that there is only one way to read f because the section requires measurement over a single shift only unless the secretaries make a joint finding,and because the secretaries made such a finding,measurements over a single shift however they are made are barred.this is certainly a plausible reading.but the secretary arguments persuade us that such an interpretation is not unambiguously required,and that her reading is at least a reasonable one.
to begin,we note that although f uses the phrase over a single shift only,the subsection thereafter refers to that methodology as such single shift measurement.see f.the secretary points out that this reference phrase introduces at least two ambiguities.first,if one emphasizes the word single,the result suggests that while congress was concerned that a single shift measurement might not accurately represent atmospheric conditions during a shift,the legislature was not necessarily concerned about the use of multiple measurements whether taken over a single shift or over several this reading is not unreasonable.
a second ambiguity in the same reference phrase arises from its use of the singular measurement,rather than the plural measurements.see f.the use of the singular,the secretary argues,can reasonably be interpreted as referring to the taking of a single as opposed to multiple samples,even over a single shift.this ambiguity is reinforced by a second use of the singular noun measurement,as well by the preceding term each miner instead of miners.see id.two members of the commission rejected this argument on the basis of a canon of statutory construction providing that terms written in the singular generally include the plural.excel mining,fmshrc at riley and verheggen,comm rs.but to say that the singular generally includes the plural acknowledges that there are exceptions,and hence that the singular can be ambiguous.indeed,excel own brief implicitly recognizes the ambiguity of the singular,arguing that the term measurement can be both singular and plural in meaning.excel br.at emphasis added.
there are also two ambiguities embedded in the phrase as measured,over a single shift only,unless the secretar ies find f.the first ambiguity stems from the statute use of the word only.the secretary observes that although this means that she must measure dust over a single shift if there is no finding,the implication is that if there is a finding as there is here she is not restricted to measurement only but instead has her choice of single or measurement.the second ambiguity has its source in the word unless.the secretary notes that while the word clearly restricts her to measurement in the absence of a finding,the section is silent as to what she must do if a finding is made.in light of that silence,we must accord deference to any reasonable construction proffered by the secretary.see chevron,at.at.and it is not unreasonable for her to conclude that without an express restriction she is free to use whichever of the two methodologies multiple sampling or sampling she thinks most appropriate for a particular mine.
the secretary also persuades us that her interpretation is reasonable in light of the role that f plays in the mine act,which is to provide a definition for the term average concentration as used in b the secretary notes that the purpose of the latter section is to ensure that each operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which each miner in the active workings of such mine is exposed at or below milligrams of respirable dust per cubic meter of air.b emphasis added.a single sample may not accomplish this purpose,she argues,because it measures the exposure of only one miner whose exposure may be different from that of other miners performing different jobs on the same shift while the statute requires protection for each miner.as a consequence,she postulates,it is logical to conclude that it was the statistical accuracy of single sampling that was the object of congress concern in f.
but,the secretary continues,she also can not accomplish the statutory purpose of ensuring that the average concentration of respirable dust during each shift is at or below if she is restricted as excel insists she is to averaging samples taken over multiple shifts.as the secretary explains,a average may mask a high concentration on a particular shift for example,an sample collected on the first shift,averaged with samples collected on subsequent shifts,may yield a average even though each miner on the first shift is exposed to more than.see fed.reg.at.data collected by msha during the course of its spot inspection program reveals that this is not a hypothetical problem and it is not unreasonable to infer,as the secretary does,that congress did not intend to require her to use a methodology sampling that is incompatible with the legislature purpose of ensuring that the average concentration of respirable dust during each shift remains below the designated threshold.
excel responds that the secretary method has masking problems of its own.basing compliance on the average of multiple samples taken over a single shift may hide the high dust exposure of a particular miner on that shift.and if the shift is not well chosen,this method may also mask an exposure on another shift.the secretary does not dispute these possibilities.but she also does not read the mine act as limiting her to the use of multiple samples over a single shift.rather,she believes that she also retains discretion to use multiple samples over multiple shifts.she intends,she says,to choose the method that best protects miners under the conditions in a particular mine.where the problem is variance in the quantity of atmospheric dust within a shift,she may well choose excel preferred method sampling concentrating on miners who are working in an occupation with the highest dust exposure but where there is significant variance between shifts,she may instead choose to take multiple samples over a single shift,focusing on the shift with the highest concentration of dust.
excel asserts that,notwithstanding this administrative flexibility,multiple sampling is especially unreliable as an indicator of the respirable dust levels to which individual miners are exposed,and is thus inadequate to protect miners health.excel br.at.the commission similarly describes the methodology as.excel mining,fmshrc at riley and verheggen,comm rs.needless to say,the secretary disagrees as does the united mine workers union,which filed an amicus brief in support of the secretary.this court lacks the experience and expertise to resolve that methodological dispute.but more to the point,we lack the authority to do so.when a challenge to an agency construction of a statutory provision,fairly conceptualized,really centers on the wisdom of the agency policy,rather than whether it is a reasonable choice within a gap left open by congress,the challenge must fail.chevron,at.at see also cannelton,at.
in sum,we conclude that the statutory language is ambiguous and that the secretary interpretation is reasonable.and we decline to the secretary longstanding view that taking multiple samples over both single and multiple shifts is a reasonable and effective means of effectuating the purpose of the mine act 
we turn next to the joint finding.in light of our affirmation of the secretary interpretation of mine act f,and because the parties dispute neither the validity of that finding nor the fact that its promulgation triggers the consequences contemplated by f,the finding itself does not have great independent significance for our analysis.nonetheless,our review confirms that it is reasonably read as the secretary urges as a determination that single sampling is an inaccurate methodology for measuring exposure to respirable dust,while expressing no opinion regarding the accuracy of taking multiple samples over a single shift.
as we said in part ii,we must uphold the secretary of labor interpretation unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.akzo nobel,at quoting thomas jefferson,at.at.we also take notice of the facts that as early as,the secretary of the interior,who joined in making the
