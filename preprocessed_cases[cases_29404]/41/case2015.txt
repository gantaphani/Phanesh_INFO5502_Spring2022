washington state,through its department of social and health services dshs has faced considerable challenges both legal and practical in administering timely competency evaluation and restoration services to pretrial detainees in city and county facilities.it is well recognized that detention in a jail is no substitute for mentally ill detainees who need therapeutic evaluation and treatment.supreme court precedent requires that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him,to consult with counsel,and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial.drope missouri,d.to honor its constitutional obligations,washington law provides that when there is reason to doubt the competency of a person facing criminal charges,the defense counsel or prosecutor may request an evaluation or a court may sua sponte order an evaluation to ensure that only those persons competent to stand trial are prosecuted.
following a bench trial,the district court detailed washington shortcomings in providing competency evaluation and restoration services,the insufficient number of beds and personnel as a result of inadequate funding and planning,and the deleterious effects of prolonged incarceration without evaluation and treatment for mentally ill detainees.the court addressed both initial competency evaluations and the mental health restoration services that follow a determination of incompetency to stand trial and concluded that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment requires that services for both categories must be provided within seven days of a court order,absent an individualized determination of clinical good cause.the court entered a permanent injunction to this effect,although washington appeals only that portion related to initial competency evaluations.thus,the question we address is a narrow one,focused on the timeliness of the evaluation does the due process clause compel the state to perform a competency evaluation of pretrial detainees within seven days of a court order requiring evaluation 
we agree with the district court that dshs must conduct competency evaluations within a reasonable time following a court order.the district court mandate,however,imposes a temporal obligation beyond what the constitution requires.therefore,we vacate the injunction with respect to the requirement for competency evaluations and remand to the district court to amend the injunction in a manner consistent with this opinion.

washington law,effective july,sets a performance target of seven days or less for competency evaluations,but imposes a maximum time limit,with the possibility of a extension for clinical reasons.id.a the target and time limit were to be phased in over a period beginning july.id.the law provides a number of defenses for failing to meet the deadline,including the inability to obtain necessary information regarding the defendant history,insufficient private space in the detention facility to conduct the evaluation,and lack of availability or participation by counsel,jail or court personnel,interpreters,or the defendant,any of which,if proven by a preponderance of the evidence,relieve the state of its duty to perform the evaluation within the time allotted.id.c.this provision explicitly does not create any new entitlement or cause of action to enforce these deadlines.id.
ii.district court proceedings 
this appeal arises out of a action filed in federal district court against dshs by cassie trueblood,on behalf of a single plaintiff,ara badayos.badayos had been found legally incompetent to stand trial and was detained in solitary confinement in the snohomish county jail awaiting transfer to a hospital for restorative treatment.the complaint was then amended to include a class of individuals who were either awaiting a competency evaluation or had been found incompetent and were awaiting restorative services.the district court certified the class as 
all persons who are now,or will be in the future,charged with a crime in the state of washington and a who are ordered by a court to receive competency evaluation or restoration services through dshs b who are waiting in jail for those services and c for whom dshs receives the court order.

the court held a bench trial to determine the precise outer boundary permitted by the constitution based on the specific conditions present in washington state.during the trial,the district court heard testimony on three main issues the current state of competency evaluations and restorative services in washington the effects of prolonged detention in jail,rather than a hospital,for mentally ill individuals and the feasibility of providing competency evaluation and restorative services within seven days.
between and,demand for competency evaluations in washington increased by percent.the district court found that evaluation services were delayed due to staffing shortages,high evaluator turnover,lack of accurate data and timely reporting,inadequate planning,unwillingness to use electronic court records,and long travel times between jails and evaluators offices.trial testimony also revealed that class members had suffered serious mental health consequences as a result of prolonged detention often in solitary confinement pending evaluation or services,including suicidal behavior,and refusal to take medications.it was no surprise,therefore,that the district court found p unitive settings and isolation for hours each day exacerbate mental illness and increase the likelihood that the individual will never recover.
the district court concluded that the foundational liberty inte
