appellant thomas yorkey yorkey appeals from a decision of the board of patent appeals and interferences the board denying his motion seeking invalidity of claims and of appellees mohamed diab,esmaiel jany,ibrahim elfadel,rex mccarthy,walter weber,and robert smith collectively diab patent application ser.the diab application on the grounds that the claims fail to comply with the written description requirement of.yorkey also appeals from the board ruling that he failed to establish a prima facie case of actual reduction to practice and the board consequent award of priority to the diab application over yorkey patent the yorkey patent.because we find that that the asserted claims of the diab application meet the written description requirement of,we affirm the board denial of yorkey motion.however,we reverse the board finding that yorkey failed to establish a prima facie case of actual reduction to practice and remand the case to the board for further proceedings.
procedural history 
the patent and patent application at issue in this appeal claim inventions for measuring the concentration of oxygen in blood.yorkey is named as the inventor of the yorkey patent,which issued on july,and was based on application ser,filed on june.the patent was subsequently assigned to nellcor puritan bennet,nellcor which is the party in interest.diab is the named inventor of the diab application filed on july,which claims priority in turn from application ser.filed may,and filed october,the party in interest in the diab application is masimo corporation masimo.an interference was declared by the board on july,and yorkey was declared the junior party.
two counts were declared in the interference count included claims,and of the yorkey patent and,and of the diab application count embraced claims,and of the yorkey patent and claims and of the diab application.
during the motions phase of the interference,yorkey filed four motions,all of which were denied by the board.at issue in the instant appeal is the board denial of yorkey motion seeking to have diab claims corresponding to counts and denied for failure to comply with the written description requirement of.
yorkey also appeals the board holding that he failed to establish a prima facie case that he had reduced his invention to practice prior to diab benefit date of october.
background 
the technology at issue in this case is medical instrumentation designed for the measurement of physiological signals.specifically,the inventions claimed by the yorkey patent and the diab application are directed at the noninvasive measurement of the amount of oxygen in the blood of a patient pulse oximetry which is an indicator of the healthful function of the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems responsible for the delivery of oxygen to the body tissues.
a major problem in the detection of blood oxygen saturation is the presence of ambient interference noise which can obscure the measurement of blood oxygen saturation by introducing extraneous signals into the recorded measurement.improving the ratio is a central concern in the design of biomedical instrumentation for detecting physiological signals,which are often weak when compared to background noise.certain types of noise can be removed by the use of passive or active bandpass or notch filters which filter out signals of frequencies that are outside the range of the signals that the device is attempting to detect.however,if the signal and the noise are coincident within the same range of frequencies,simple frequency filtering is insufficient and a means of separating the signal from the noise in which it is embedded must be contrived.
prior technologies for the suppression of noise have relied upon the direct subtraction of noise from the signal.however,the claims at issue in the interference are directed to a method of noise filtering that does not directly subtract noise from the detected signal.this method relies upon two assumptions that the amount of actual motion is the same for each of the two separate intensity signals measured by the probe typically one signal is measured from transmitted light in the red wavelengths of the visible light spectrum and one in the infrared wavelengths and the motion component portions of the detected signals are proportionate.the relevant portion of count i is set forth below 
a method for measuring saturation of a blood constituent in a patient comprising the steps of 
irradiating said patient with electromagnetic radiation of two discrete,different wavelengths 
sensing an intensity of said radiation for each of said wavelengths after it passes through a portion of said patient to produce first and second intensity signals including motion components and 
determining said saturation by mathematically manipulating said first and second intensity signals without subtracting said motion components and with the assumptions that 
i an amount of motion is the same at the same time for each of said intensity signals,and 
ii the motion components of said intensity signals are proportional to one another.
count is similar to count i,but includes additional steps directed to determining oxygen saturation in the presence of interference.claim of the diab application is representative of the claims embraced by count the claim recites identical language to count recited above,and continues after the ellipsis 
a method for measuring saturation of a blood constituent in a patient comprising the steps of 
taking the logarithm of each representation of said first and second intensity signals 
removing signal portions outside a known band of interest to create first and second filtered signals 
equating the first filtered signal of the first intensity signal to s n,where n is the portion of the signal due to motion and s is the portion of the signal not due to motion 
equating the second filtered signal of the second intensity signal to r as r vn,where r a,is a ratio indicative of saturation 
expressing said representations as a matrix 
using said matrix to determine r a,by assuming s and n are uncorrelated and determining said saturation from r 
the latter two limitations are at the heart of the first issue in this case.
discussion 
written description 
the written description requirement set forth by,states that 
the specification shall contain a written description of the invention,and of the manner and process of making and using it,in such full,clear,concise,and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains,or with which it is most nearly connected,to make and use the same.
whether the written description requirement is met is a question of fact.martek biosciences nutrinova,citing wang,toshiba.the test for sufficiency of support in a parent application is whether the disclosure of the parent application reasonably conveys to the artisan that the inventor had possession at that time of the later claimed subject matter.in re kaslow.this court will uphold the board finding that the diab application claims are adequately described so long as that finding is supported by substantial evidence in the record.see chen bouchard.
yorkey argues that the board erred in finding that the diab application written description of the count limitations assuming s and n are uncorrelated and expressing said representations as a matrix are sufficient to convey to a person of skill in the art that the patentee had possession of the claimed invention at the time of the application.specifically,yorkey argues that two of the methods disclosed in the diab application fail to convey to a person of ordinary skill in the art that diab had possession of the two limitations when he filed his application.
assuming that s and n are uncorrelated 
with respect to the first limitation,the claim language at issue is as follows using said matrix to determine r a,by assuming s and n are uncorrelated and determining said saturation from r 
in support of his argument,yorkey relies upon the declaration of his expert,elvir causevic causevic,who argued that 
i n determining r a using a matrix,diab makes reiterative calculations and then selects the calculation that minimizes the correlation between s and n.the action and signal processing steps of minimization of correlation are different from assuming the two values s and n are already uncorrelated before doing the signal processing.
moreover,argues causevic 
to obtain r a and r v,an exhaustive scan is executed for a good of possible values for r a and r v the minimum of the correlation function is then selected and the values of r a and r v which resulted in the minimum are chosen as r a and r 
causevic dilated considerably on the argument that the specification disclosure reveals a method of minimizing correlation,rather than assuming that s and n are simply uncorrelated,and concludes 
to a person of ordinary skill in the art,performing a scan of values is entirely different from a priori assuming that s and n are uncorrelated.when assuming that s and n are uncorrelated,a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that no iterative calculation is involved.no effort to determine the minimum degree of correlation is involved.on the other hand,scanning for values assumes that there is a correlation and uses the iterative process to find the minimum correlation.accordingly,diab iterative signal processing step of minimizing a correlation described in their approach is a different approach from assuming that two values s and n are uncorrelated,as set forth in claims and.
emphasis in original.
the board was unconvinced.citing the declaration of gail baura,diab expert witness,the court noted that the specification of the diab application described the limitation at least four different times in at least four different ways in two embodiments the board found that,on its face,the diab application repeatedly described embodiments in which it determined that s and n are uncorrelated.for example the diab application contains the description 
w here s and n are at least somewhat preferably substantially uncorrelated and s and are at least somewhat preferably substantially uncorrelated.
emphases in board original.the board found that the description quoted above would have described,by virtue of the phrase at least preferably substantially uncorrelated an embodiment in which and are completely uncorrelated.this,found the board,was consistent with baura testimony that it is clear that in assuming s and n to be at least somewhat preferably substantially uncorrelated,the ideal constraint would be that s and n have no correlation.
the board relied heavily on baura testimony,finding her to be a more credible witness than causevic.the board criticized causevic testimony for averring that a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that no iterative calculation was involved,without producing any reason why this should be so.
we defer to the board findings concerning the credibility of expert witnesses.see velander garner,it is within the discretion of the trier of fact to give each item of evidence such weight as it feels appropriate.thus the board was well within its discretion to give more credibility to baura testimony over causevic unless no reasonable trier of fact could have done so.
at first glance,equating the term substantially uncorrelated with uncorrelated might be likened to equating the term substantially not pregnant with not pregnant.however,correlation,like any other mathematical term of art,is a statistical function wherein the significance of the relationship is,in effect,arbitrarily decided.for example,the standard confidence level of p indicates at least a probability that a significant statistical relationship does not exist between two sets of values,and that probability limit not or is generally but arbitrarily accepted as definitive of statistical significance.in the instant appeal,substantially uncorrelated could be synonymous with statistically significantly uncorrelated,which would in turn be,by definition,synonymous with uncorrelated.although such a value is described by the diab application as being obtained by a process of iterative calculation,finding the values of s and n that are substantially uncorrelated and ideally statistically significantly uncorrelated is a necessary preliminary step prior to the ensuing computation.
furthermore,in addition to the language of the diab application quoted above,the application similarly states,on pages,that 
in order to determine r a and r v in accordance with this implementation,the energy in the signal s is maximized under the constraint that s is uncorrelated to n.again,this implementation is based upon minimizing the correlation between s and n 
again,if minimizing the correlation between s and n forms the basis for the ensuing constraint of between s and n,then the optimal results will be obtained when the correlation between s and n is at a minimum,below statistical significance,or uncorrelated.
given the deference that we are required to show to the board evaluation of the credibility of baura over causevic,and reviewing her declaration testimony,we find that the board ruling that the diab application possessed the limitation that s and n are assumed to be uncorrelated is supported by substantial evidence in the record and we therefore affirm the board decision in this respect.
b.that the signal be expressed as a matrix solved for r 
the board likewise found that baura was more credible than causevic with respect to the written description of the limitation expressing said representations as a matrix.causevic acknowledges the use of a matrix in the embodiment described by diab relating to r a s r v n.this matrix is used to determine r a by finding the minimum of the correlation,and appears as follows 
however,causevic contends that the second embodiment description of a further implementation to obtain r a and r v does not explicitly refer to the matrix depicted above relating to r a s r v n.the board noted,however,that this observation was not accompanied by any meaningful discussion as to the actual text of diab disclosure.
page of the diab application states 
in a further implementation to obtain r a and r v,the same signal model set forth above is again used.in order to determine r a and r v in accordance with this implementation,the energy in the signal s is maximized under the constraint that s is uncorrelated with n.
the pages of the diab application immediately preceding the quoted text,beginning on page,are contained within a section entitled alternative determination of coefficients r a and r this section begins with a series of equations defining the coefficients r a and r v.the text then sets forth a method for the determination of r a and r v by determining the minimum preferably none correlation between s k and n k that can be determined where k eq.the text continues 
minimizing this quantity often provides a unique pair of r a and r v if the noise component is uncorrelated to the desired signal component.minimizing this quantity can be accomplished by solving equations and for s and n,and finding the minimum of the correlation for possible values of r a and r solving for s and n provides the following matrix equation.
the text of the diab application then recites the matrix recited above.the text then describes further refinements of the model,inverting the matrix and solving for and,and suggesting the use of a blackman window as the preferred embodiment for minimizing the correlation of and.
the board gave more credence to baura testimony with respect to this point.baura points out the explicit language describing the same signal model disclosed for the first embodiment in which the matrix above is employed as being the one for the further implementation to obtain r a and r moreover,according to baura 
it is my opinion that this is referring to the signal model of the first embodiment.it makes sense that the signal model referred to as set forth above would refer to the first embodiment model because it immediately precedes the statement.
the board found that causevic failure to state what mathematical methodology,other than the matrix,diab disclosure would have reasonably conveyed to a skilled artisan for the further implementation embodiment w
