michael wayne moore appeals the dismissal of his civil rights complaint on the basis that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
the following is a summary of the relevant facts alleged in the parties pleadings and contained in the attachments thereto.in early,moore was a prisoner in the southern correctional institute southern in the north carolina department of correction ncdoc.while he was there,a prison physician diagnosed moore with hepatitis c and became concerned that moore pancreas,which was swollen,could be cancerous.the doctor explained that moore would need regular monitoring.
shortly thereafter,moore and other inmates allegedly witnessed an attack by several prison guards upon inmate roger bryant.moore sent bryant mother a letter the following day,informing her about the attack and offering to help document what he and other witnesses saw.when bryant mother began to investigate the allegations,moore alleges he was warned by the unit manager at southern that he should not get involved.moore insisted,however,that he wanted to see justice done.
a week after the assault,moore had collected written accounts from several inmates and had sealed them in two large legal envelopes with postage sufficient to mail them to bryant mother.before he could mail them,however,members of the ncdoc prison emergency response team are alleged to have appeared at his cell in riot gear and transported him to the prison receiving area with moore wearing only his underwear.several other inmates,most of whom had provided statements regarding the attack,were rounded up in the same manner.
moore was sent directly to a maximum security facility in tillery,north carolina.all of his privileges were revoked,and moore alleges his written statements concerning the attack were seized.three days later,moore was transferred to a high security maximum control unit,known as a supermax unit,at polk correctional institute in butner,north carolina.he was placed on strict suicide watch.internal quotation marks omitted.he was told he was on administrative seg.pending investigation,and he was refused all privileges and opportunities due to any other inmate on admin.seg.in his cell,moore was constantly monitored via video camera,and he was not allowed contact with anyone in his family or with a lawyer for several days.in fact,he states he remained in isolation for several more weeks although mental health staff later determined that he was not suicidal.
the ncdoc provides an administrative remedy procedure for prisoner complaints the arp.as is relevant here,step of the procedure allows for the filing of grievances on a form,which asks for the inmate name,number,and location,as well as the date,a grievance statement,the remedy that the inmate seeks,and the inmate signature.under the rules,the inmate must receive a formal written response to his grievance within days from the date on which the grievance is accepted.should the inmate decide to appeal,he will receive a step written response within days from the appeal request.and,should the inmate decide to appeal further,he will receive a step written response within days from the date of that appeal.the rules prohibit an inmate from submitting a new grievance before all previously filed grievances have completed step or been resolved.however,that rule does not apply to emergency grievances,which are defined as matters which present a substantial risk of physical injury or other serious and irreparable harm to the grievant if regular time limits are followed.a grievance may be rejected because,among other reasons,t here has been a time lapse of more than one year between the event and submission of the grievance or if it requests a remedy for more than one incident.
moore availed himself of this process on february,filing grievance.the grievance complained of moore transfer to a maximum security prison,and then to polk,as well as the aforementioned conditions in his cell and the revocation of all of his privileges.the grievance claimed that moore was being punished for actions he was never charged with,and indeed that he was never even informed of what he did to bring about the punishment.he requested that he be removed from polk and placed in a prison where he could have his privileges returned.the grievance was rejected the day after it was submitted,however,because it concerned more than one issue.
after arriving at polk,moore informed the prison medical staff of his hepatitis c as well as his potentially cancerous pancreas and the fact that he would need regular monitoring and blood work.the prison medical department also received a copy of his medical records.three weeks after he had been transferred to polk,medical personnel performed two sonograms but failed to give moore sufficient prior notice so that he could refrain from eating and drinking beforehand.because moore had eaten throughout the day,the sonograms did not produce a sufficiently clear image of moore pancreas.three weeks after the ineffective sonograms,moore reported to a nurse that his stomach had been hurting for several weeks.although the nurse told him that test results would be available the next day,moore did not receive any.
consequently,on march,moore submitted grievance,which explained the history of his pancreas problem and provided an account of the treatment he had received.in the grievance,moore asserted that not only had the sonograms not been performed adequately,but they also were not performed in a timely manner.he further expressed concern that his inadequate medical care was in retaliation for the events that led to his transfer to polk.the step response to the grievance determined that an ultrasound had been performed on february,that the results were in moore chart,and that a ct scan was scheduled for the near future.when moore appealed,a step response added that medical personnel would explain the results of the scheduled ct scan to moore when they arrived.following another appeal,a step response stated that moore concern had been appropriately resolved.
during his time at polk,moore had developed pain in his left hand that rendered the hand useless for three months.on may,moore submitted grievance,alleging that prison medical staff had failed to give him adequate treatment for the condition for several weeks,and that when a nurse came to see him,the nurse only glanced at his hand through a thick plexiglass window before diagnosing moore with gout.the nurse gave moore ibuprofen and told him that he would have the doctor prescribe medication,but moore never received any.moore grievance also included complaints of two other problems.it alleged that the same nurse had examined his ears through a trap door in his cell,which moore alleged was unethical.the grievance further claimed that another nurse seeking to obtain a urine sample as part of a physical for moore sent a prison officer to collect the sample.the grievance acknowledged that when moore complained to the officer,the nurse came to his cell and collected the sample herself.the grievance requested that the nurses involved in these incidents be reprimanded.it further asserted that it should be considered as filed correctly even though more than one incident is alleged because b oth incidents show a distinct pattern of i nadequate medical care,and are related in respect to specific allegations i have made concerning a series of events that constitute discrimination and intentional deliberate indifference towards me individually by the medical staff here due to the a llegation of which i am currently on claims that i had plot t ed to h arm medical staff elsewhere.the grievance nevertheless was rejected because it concerned more than one incident.
moore also was frustrated with what he considered to be a lack of adequate medical treatment for his hepatitis c condition.his dissatisfaction prompted him to twice write directly to defendant joseph lightsey,the chief physician for the supermax unit,and once to defendant richard jones,chief medical supervisor at polk,complaining of the lack of care for his condition and explaining that it was only getting worse.receiving no response,moore filed grievance,dated may,in which he claimed that this lack of treatment for the hepatitis c was part of a n and l ong pattern of deliberate indifference to his medical needs.the grievance named jones,lightsey,and four others as being responsible for the inadequate care.a step response noted that moore was scheduled to see a physician assistant.a step response,dated june,indicated that the appointment was scheduled for that very day.a step response determined that moore concerns had been adequately addressed and found no indication of staff indifference.
finally,on may,moore filed an unnumbered grievance labeled emergency grievance,complaining again that he had received inadequate treatment for his gout and that it was part of a l ong pattern concerning his health care needs.the grievance was returned to moore the next day because his hepatitis c grievance had not yet completed step or otherwise been resolved.
moore filed this civil action pursuant to west,naming as defendants lightsey and jones,as well as boyd bennett,director of the division of prisons george currie,correctional administrator at polk and tonia rogers,the classification coordinator at polk.as is relevant here,moore asserted claims for deliberate indifference to his medical needs regarding his pancreatic condition,his hepatitis c,and his gout,as well as a claim of retaliation based on his transfer and changes in his prison conditions resulting from his actions relating to the assault of bryant.the complaint alleged that moore had followed the grievance procedure a s far as he was allowed but that m ost results were evasive or unreasonable.it alleged that moore had exhausted his administrative remedies relating to the complaint,and copies of the grievances discussed herein were attached.the complaint requested injunctive relief and monetary damages.
the district court dismissed moore complaint as frivolous under e west,concluding that it contained only a blanket and conclusory statement of wrongdoing by the named defendants without the factual allegations necessary to sustain the legal claims asserted therein.moore bennette,moore i.on appeal,we vacated the district court order to the extent that it dismissed moore claims for deliberate indifference to his medical needs with regard to his pancreatic condition,his hepatitis c,and the gout in his hand.see moore bennette,cir per curiam.in so doing,we explicitly de novo district court conclusion that moore failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted.see id.we also vacated the dismissal of moore retaliation claim,holding that it ha d an arguable basis in fact and law.id.
once the case was returned to the district court,lightsey filed an answer and moved to dismiss the claims against him,see.b,contending that the complaint failed to allege that he was directly or indirectly responsible for any of the medical treatment at issue and asserting that moore had not exhausted all available administrative remedies.the remaining defendants filed an answer,attaching,inter alia,a copy of the arp,and they moved for judgment on the pleadings.they argued that moore failed to exhaust his available administrative remedies because he had not filed proper grievances regarding the gout and retaliation claims.they maintained that the pancreas,gout,and retaliation claims were also not exhausted as to any defendant because none of the defendants were named in the applicable grievances.they further contended that the hepatitis c claim was not exhausted as to defendants bennett,currie,and rogers because those defendants were not named in the applicable grievance.finally,they asserted that the complaint failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted against defendants bennett,currie,and jones because it failed to allege the requisite personal connection between these defendants and the complained of actions.
moore filed responses to both motions.he argued that he had exhausted all remedies available to him because his two gout grievances were properly made and submitted and because it was not feasible for him to file individual grievances for each individual wrong that he suffered.he also maintained that he was not legally precluded from bringing suit against individuals who had not been named in his grievances.finally,he argued that his complaint successfully stated a claim for which relief could be granted against all defendants.
the district court ruled that defendants had proven the affirmative defense of failure to exhaust,and the court dismissed all claims without prejudice,with the exception of the hepatitis c claim against jones and lightsey,which the court dismissed with prejudice for failure to state a claim.moore bennett,slip op.at.the district court ruled that the pancreas claim was not exhausted because none of the defendants were named in the applicable grievance that the hepatitis c claim was not exhausted as to bennett,currie,and rogers because they were not named in the applicable grievance and it failed to state a claim against lightsey and jones because they were not alleged to have the requisite personal connection to the actions complained of that the gout claim was not exhausted because both applicable grievances were rejected by prison officials on procedural grounds and neither named the defendants and that the retaliation claim was not exhausted because the only grievance relating to it was rejected on procedural grounds and did not identify any of the defendants as being responsible for the actions complained of.see id.at.
under the prison litigation reform act of plra,as amended,prisoners must exhaust such administrative remedies as are available prior to filing suit in federal court challenging prison conditions.a west.the outcome of the present appeal depends in part on whether particular remedies were made unavailable to moore by virtue of what moore contends was the ncdoc unwarranted refusal to consider his gout and retaliation grievances.we therefore must consider the meaning of available in this context.because the plra does not define the term,courts have generally afforded it its common meaning thus,an administrative remedy is not considered to have been available if a prisoner,through no fault of his own,was prevented from availing himself of it.see terrell,cir kaba stepp,cir.conversely,a prisoner does not exhaust all available remedies simply by failing to follow the required steps so that remedies that once were available to him no longer are.see woodford ngo,d.rather,to be entitled to bring suit in federal court,a prisoner must have utilized all available remedies in accordance with the applicable procedural rules,so that prison officials have been given an opportunity to address the claims administratively.id.at.having done that,a prisoner has exhausted his available remedies,even if prison employees do not respond.see dole chandler,cir.
in its recent decision in jones bock,d,the supreme court decided that failure to exhaust available administrative remedies is an affirmative defense,not a jurisdictional requirement,and thus inmates need not plead exhaustion,nor do they bear the burden of proving it see jones.at see also anderson xyz correctional health,cir.however,even if it is not apparent from the pleadings that there are available administrative remedies that the prisoner failed to exhaust,a complaint may be dismissed on exhaustion grounds so long as the inmate is first given an opportunity to address the issue.see anderson,at holding that district court may raise affirmative defense of exhaustion sua sponte under the plra so long as plaintiff is given an opportunity to respond.
moore first suggests that the district court dismissal of most of his claims on exhaustion grounds was premature in that it was not apparent from the face of the complaint that he had not exhausted his remedies and that he had no valid excuse for not doing so.see freeman watkins,cir w e caution that only in rare cases will a district court be able to conclude from the face of the complaint that
