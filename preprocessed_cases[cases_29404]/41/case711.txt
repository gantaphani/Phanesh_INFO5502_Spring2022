this case addresses whether ambulance services are encompassed within the definition of emergency services as articulated in.plaintiff appellant healthkeepers,hereinafter healthkeepers brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that defendant appellee richmond ambulance authority hereinafter the authority is required to comply with the rules laid out in b d since it is a provider of emergency services as defined by the statute.the appeal raises two main issues whether the definition of emergency services in b b applies to b d and whether b d covers the services provided by the authority to members of healthkeepers medicaid program.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the authority.the court read the definition of emergency services in b d as not encompassing ambulance services.thus,it found that the authority is entitled to set its own rates for the ambulance services it provides members of healthkeepers medicaid program.because we disagree and find that the definition of emergency services in the statute includes emergency services provided by ambulance,we reverse.
the parties agree on the material facts of this case.in its opinion,the district court does an excellent job of summarizing the key facts which we essentially reproduce below.
this dispute concerns what rate healthkeepers must pay the authority when the authority provides emergency transportation services to healthkeepers medicaid enrollees.a full understanding of this disagreement requires discussion of not only the exact nature of the parties businesses but also the medicaid system.
title xix of the social security act,creates a medical assistance program known as medicaid that provides resources to individuals and families for healthcare services.harris mcrae.medicaid is a cooperative program.on the federal side,medicaid is managed by the secretary of health and human services hhs,who has delegated this authority to hhs centers for medicare and medicaid services cms.in virginia,the state counterpart to cms is the department of medical assistance dmas.
dmas arranges to cover the cost of healthcare for eligible persons in several ways.for some persons,dmas makes payments directly to providers.this program is called medallion for other persons,dmas arranges with a type of health maintenance organization hmo called a managed care organization mco to provide those individuals with coverage.this program,which is in effect in richmond,is called medallion ii.when an mco enrollee needs medical care,the mco pays the enrollee providers.
for services,providers who have agreed to a particular payment schedule with the mco are called participating,or contract,providers.these rates need not track with the rates paid by dmas to an mco.mcos are able to control their costs by rates for their participants through this system.
however,since,emergency services have been treated differently than services.the balanced budget act of amended the medicaid act and specifically as follows 
b beneficiary protections 
assuring coverage to emergency services 
a in general 
each contract with a medicaid managed care organization shall require the organization or manager 
i to provide coverage for emergency services as defined in subparagraph b without regard to prior authorization or the emergency care provider contractual relationship with the organization or manager,
b emergency services defined 
in subparagraph a i,the term emergency services means,with respect to an individual enrolled with an organization,covered inpatient and outpatient services that 
i are furnished by a provider that is qualified to furnish such services under this subchapter,and 
ii are needed to evaluate or stabilize an emergency medical condition as defined in subparagraph c.
c emergency medical condition defined 
in subparagraph b ii,the term emergency medical condition means a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity including severe pain such that a prudent layperson,who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine,could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in 
i placing the health of the individual or,with respect to a pregnant woman,the health of the woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy,
ii serious impairment to bodily functions,or 
iii serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.
b.the result of this amendment was that mcos were unable to costs with providers of emergency services.
healthkeepers is a private,corporation that operates as a commercial hmo as well as an mco.in virginia,healthkeepers offers a managed care plan to persons called anthem healthkeepers plus under a contract between healthkeepers and dmas.
the authority was created by the virginia general assembly in and empowered by the city of richmond to be the sole provider of ambulance emergency services in richmond.the richmond ambulance authority act permits the authority to set its own rates and mandates that s uch rates shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any bureau,board,commission or other agency of the commonwealth or of any political subdivision.acts of assembly.
the authority provides emergency services to enrollees in its ambulances.this relationship,including payment obligations,was previously governed by a agreement,however,since february,there has not been a written contract between the authority and healthkeepers for the anthem healthkeepers products.absent a contract,a dispute arose between the parties as to what rate healthkeepers would have to pay for the services.healthkeepers asserted that it should pay the rates established by dmas the authority claimed it could charge its own rates.in a ruling,the circuit court of the city of richmond ruled for the authority.since that decision,healthkeepers has been paying the authority rates for services rendered by the authority to healthkeepers enrollees.
the central question in the instant dispute is how,if at all,the medicaid amendments affect the requirement that healthkeepers continue to pay the authority rates.in,congress passed the deficit reduction act of,which amended the social security act by appending b d to follow the statutory language quoted above hereinafter the medicaid amendment.effective on january,subsection b d addressed how much an mco had to pay providers of emergency services in certain situations 
any provider of emergency services that does not have in effect a contract with a medicaid managed care entity that establishes payment amounts for services furnished to a beneficiary enrolled in the entity medicaid managed care plan must accept as payment in full no more than the amounts less any payments for indirect costs of medical education and direct costs of graduate medical education that it could collect if the beneficiary received medical assistance under this subchapter other than through enrollment in such an entity.in a state where rates paid to hospitals under the state plan are negotiated by contract and not publicly released,the payment amount applicable under this subparagraph shall be the average contract rate that would apply under the state plan for general acute care hospitals or the average contract rate that would apply under such plan for tertiary hospitals.
b d emphasis added.
following the enactment of the amendment,another dispute arose between the parties.healthkeepers informed the authority that since the authority is a provider of emergency services that does not have a contract addressing services rendered to medicaid enrollees with,a medicaid managed care entity,the medicaid amendment now controls the maximum level of payment the authority must accept for emergency services provided by ambulance.under the medicaid amendment,that amount would be the amount set by dmas.the authority disagreed,arguing that it is not a provider of emergency services and that it had a quantum meruit contract with healthkeepers,both of which removed the authority from the ambit of the medicaid amendment.
in an effort to settle the dispute,healthkeepers directly asked cms whether a provider of emergency services in an ambulance would be co
