in this appeal,roxie hollon hollon challenges the district court decision affirming the determination of the commissioner of social security the commissioner to terminate the payment of child supplemental security income ssi benefits to hollon son,joseph hollon joseph.specifically,hollon advances three contentions on appeal i that the district court erred in declining to compel the commissioner to consider new evidence of joseph medical condition in the course of a remand to reconstruct a lost administrative record ii that the commissioner decision to terminate benefits was impermissibly based in part upon an invalid,waiver of the right to a hearing that hollon signed before she obtained the assistance of counsel and iii that the commissioner underlying benefit determination was not supported by substantial evidence.finding no error,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
joseph hollon was born on december.in april of,joseph mother,roxie hollon,applied on his behalf for child supplemental security income benefits,citing asthma as his impairment.on march,the social security administration determined that joseph asthma was disabling,and awarded child ssi benefits for the period beginning april.
a.the termination of joseph ssi benefits and the ensuing administrative proceedings 
on april,the social security administration notified hollon that joseph ssi benefits would cease in june of,based on the agency determination that her son was no longer disabled.hollon sought reconsideration of this decision,but the agency notified her on may,that it was adhering to its determination that joseph was no longer eligible for ssi benefits.hollon was further advised of her right to seek review of this decision by an administrative law judge alj.
hollon promptly requested an alj review in a social security administration form submitted on may.this form included two check boxes,inviting hollon to choose between appear ing at a hearing or allowing the alj to decide the matter based on the evidence.request for hearing form,admin.record at.it appears that hollon initially checked the box reflecting her desire for a hearing,but that she blackened this out and instead checked the box indicating that she did not wish to attend a hearing.see id.
in the course of reviewing the record,alj john lawrence noted hollon apparent election not to appear at a hearing,and sought to ensure that this accurately reflected hollon wishes.thus,the alj wrote to hollon on march,stating 
in reviewing you r file,i noted that you waived your right to appear and give evidence,and you requested that a decision be made based on the evidence of record.after reviewing the evidence in your case,i feel that it may be to your benefit to appear and testify at a hearing.
if you should decide to appear at a hearing,you will be notified in advance of the time and place.please mark below your choice,sign on the signature line of this letter,and return this letter to me as soon as possible.
alj letter,admin.record at.immediately below this text,hollon was invited to express her preference regarding a hearing,and she responded by placing a check mark next to the line stating,i do not wish to appear and testify at a hearing and request that a decision be made based on the evidence of record.id.she then signed and returned the letter to the alj,accompanied by a signed form in which she confirmed the waiver of her right to appear before the alj.see form,admin.record at.
in a decision dated april,the alj found that joseph ssi benefits had been properly terminated in june of,two months after he ceased to be disabled within the meaning of the social security act.the alj determined that joseph suffered from the medically determinable impairment of asthma,but concluded that the severity of this condition had diminished since joseph was found to be disabled in march of.the alj further determined that joseph impairment,while severe,did not meet or medically or functionally equal the requirements of any listing in the listing of impairments set forth at pt,subpt.p,app.finally,the alj found that joseph impairment did not result in marked or severe functional limitations 
on april,hollon requested that the appeals council review the alj decision.hollon was represented by counsel in this phase of the administrative proceedings,and her attorney submitted additional medical records from the kentucky river medical center and a family physician.in a decision dated november,the appeals council denied hollon request for review.the appeals council explained that the medical records provided by hollon attorney had been considered and made a part of the record,but that neither the contentions of counsel nor the additional evidence provide d a basis for changing the administrative law judge decision.appeals council decision,admin.record at.
b.the district court proceedings and the reconstruction of the administrative record 
hollon commenced this action in the district court for the eastern district of kentucky on january,challenging the decision of the commissioner of social security to terminate her son ssi benefits.shortly thereafter,and before any answer was filed,the commissioner moved for a sentence six remand under g,citing the agency inability to locate the record of the administrative proceedings regarding the cessation of joseph benefits.through this motion,the commissioner requested an opportunity to search for the file,and to reconstruct the record if it could not be located within a reasonable period of time.hollon responded that she had no objection to such a remand but,to the contrary,was already assisting the commissioner in reconstructing the lost file.accordingly,the district court entered an april,order granting the commissioner motion and remanding the case for further administrative proceedings.
over the next several months,hollon and her present counsel evidently sent two sets of records to the appeals council as part of the effort to reconstruct the administrative record.initially,in march of,hollon and her counsel forwarded pages of materials obtained from the attorney who had assisted hollon in her administrative appeal.then,on september,hollon and her counsel submitted an additional pages of documents to the appeals council,purportedly evidencing emergency room treatments or hospitalizations joseph underwent at the kentucky river medical center during the relevant time period.br.at.
on october,the commissioner submitted a administrative record to the district court and the case was restored to the court active docket.in hollon view,however,this administrative record was incomplete in two respects.first,it purportedly failed to include all of the pages of documents that hollon and her counsel initially forwarded to the appeals council upon learning that the administrative record had been lost next,the record provided by the commissioner did not include the most recent pages of medical records that hollon and her counsel mailed to the appeals council on september.
in light of these perceived deficiencies,hollon requested that the district court again remand the case to the commissioner,so that the balance of her submission and the entirety of her submission could be incorporated into the administrative record.the district court denied this motion,finding that hollon had failed to demonstrate the good cause and materiality that are the prerequisites to such a remand.the district court then proceeded to the merits of the case,determining in a june,order that the commissioner decision to terminate joseph ssi benefits was supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.hollon now appeals,advancing both procedural and substantive challenges to the district court rulings.
ii.analysis 
a.the district court did not err in declining to order a remand for consideration of additional evidence of joseph medical condition.
as is clear from the foregoing,the parties devoted a significant portion of their efforts in the court below to the threshold matter of ascertaining the proper content of the administrative record,as opposed to the substantive inquiry whether this record provided substantial support for the commissioner decision to terminate joseph ssi benefits.likewise,hollon arguments on appeal rest principally upon the premise that the administrative record is incomplete,defeating any possibility of meaningful judicial review and fatally undermining the administrative decision that rests upon this record.in light of this purported defect,hollon contends that the district court erred in declining to remand this case with instructions that the commissioner incorporate into the record all of the materials that hollon submitted to the appeals council during the process of reconstructing the lost record.we find,however,that the district court properly applied the correct standards in ruling that hollon was not entitled to a remand for further development of the administrative record.
a district court authority to remand a case for further administrative proceedings is found in g,which provides in pertinent part 
any individual,after any final decision of the commissioner of social security made after a hearing to which he was a party,may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action the court shall have power to enter,upon the pleadings and transcript of the record,a judgment affirming,modifying,or reversing the decision of the commissioner of social security,with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing the court may,on motion of the commissioner of social security made for good cause shown before the commissioner files the commissioner answer,remand the case to the commissioner of social security for further action by the commissioner of social security,and it may at any time order additional evidence to be taken before the commissioner of social security,but only upon a showing that there is new evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding and the commissioner of social security shall,after the case is remanded,and after hearing such additional evidence if so ordered,modify or affirm the commissioner findings of fact or the commissioner decision,or both,and shall file with the court any such additional and modified findings of fact and decision,and a transcript of the additional record and testimony upon which the commissioner action in modifying or affirming was based.
as we have elsewhere observed,two separate sentences within this provision authorize remands to the commissioner.see faucher secretary of hhs,cir.first,a district court may order a sentence four remand after reviewing the commissioner decision and entering a judgment,if it determines that a rehearing before the commissioner is warranted in light of the court ruling.see id.alternatively,the district court may order a prejudgment sentence six remand,which provides a potential avenue for the relief sought by hollon in this case namely,the reopening of the administrative record so that the commissioner may consider new and material evidence that for good cause was not previously presented to the commissioner.id 
yet,the statute is quite explicit as to the standards that must be met before a district court may order a sentence six remand for the taking of additional evidence.in particular,it must be shown i that the evidence at issue is both new and material,and ii that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding.g see also cline commissioner of social security,cir.the party seeking a remand bears the burden of showing that these two requirements are met.see foster halter,cir.
in this case,hollon has not,indeed,has scarcely even two prerequisites to a sentence six remand for the consideration of new evidence.first,she has not shown that her proposed additions to the record are either new or material.as to the former,we have explained that evidence is new only if it was not in existence or available to the claimant at the time of the administrative proceeding.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.such evidence,in turn,is deemed material if there is a reasonable probability that the commissioner would have reached a different disposition of the disability claim if presented with the new evidence.foster,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
neither of the two sets of documents that hollon seeks to add to the record satisfies these criteria for new and material evidence.initially,hollon protests that the record that the commissioner forwarded to the district court does not incorporate the entirety of her submission to the appeals council upon learning that her son claim file had been lost.yet,these pages of documents clearly were in existence and available to hollon during the administrative proceedings,as hollon herself asserts that all of these materials were previously submitted to the commissioner by the attorney who represented her in her administrative appeal.br.at.it follows that there is no new evidence amongst this submission.moreover,as we noted earlier,hollon has not advised us which portions of this collection of documents have been omitted from the administrative record,much less endeavored to explain how their inclusion might have led to a different outcome in the administrative proceedings.we are unwilling to assume,absent any basis for doing so,that hollon submission invariably must be more supportive of joseph entitlement to benefits than the record before us 
the other collection of documents that hollon seeks to introduce into the administrative record is the pages of medical records of joseph treatments at the kentucky river medical center that hollon and her current counsel sent to the appeals council while this case was on remand from the district court.once again,however,hollon has not even attempted to show that these materials were unavailable to her or her prior counsel during the course of the administrative proceedings.neither has she explained how these materials add anything to the existing and considerable record of joseph visits to and treatments at this same facility over an period.for all that can be discerned from the record before us,hollon submission might be entirely cumulative of materials that already are a part of the administrative record.if this were not the case,it presumably would not be difficult for hollon to identify some material distinction between the existing record and her voluminous submission.tellingly,she has not done so.
hollon showing is similarly deficient on the good cause prong of a request for a sentence six remand.a claimant shows good cause by demonstrating a reasonable justification for the failure to acquire and present the evidence for inclusion in the hearing before the alj.foster,at.again,there is no indication that any of the evidence cited by hollon as grounds for a remand was unavailable to her during the course of the administrative proceedings.nor has she identified any obstacles to her submission of this evidence during those proceedings.even assuming that hollon pro se status is relevant to the good cause inquiry,see,jones sullivan,cir,she was represented by counsel by the time the matter reached the appeals,indeed,her attorney was successful in supplementing the administrative record at that point.accordingly,we agree with the district court conclusion that hollon has not met the standards for a sentence six remand for the consideration of new evidence.
nonetheless,hollon argues that she should be relieved of the obligation to satisfy these statutory requirements of materiality and good cause,where the district court already had ordered a remand under sentence six of g to allow the commissioner to either locate or reconstruct the lost administrative record.as hollon observes,nothing in the district court order of remand precluded the commissioner from receiving her additional,indeed,the pertinent agency regulations seemingly confirm the commissioner authority to proceed in this fashion upon remand from the district court,see.because the case was remanded at the commissioner request,and because it was the commissioner negligence that necessitated this remand,hollon contends that it would only be fair to allow her to supplement the administrative record while the commissioner was in the process of rebuilding it.
hollon argument on this point,however,is at odds with both the express language of g and the practical realities of a sentence six remand for the consideration of new evidence.as discussed earlier,the statute specifically enumerates the requirements for a remand of the sort sought by hollon a court may order such a remand only upon a showing that there is new evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding.g emphasis added.the fact that another met the prerequisites for a different sort of the first portion of sentence not overcome the statutory command of both good cause and new and material evidence as required grounds for a sentence six remand for the consideration of additional evidence.
as the supreme court has made clear,we are not free to dispense with these statutory requirements.in melkonyan sullivan,d,the court considered a case in which the district court had ordered a remand for further administrative proceedings without specifying the basis for this remand.the parties and the court alike agreed that this order was not predicated on sentence four of g,as the district court did not affirm,modify,or reverse the secretary decision.melkonyan,at.at.yet,the court also found itself unable to state with certainty that the remand in this case was a sentence six remand,where the district court had not made the requisite finding of good cause for such a remand.at.at.
faced with this interpretative dilemma,the court addressed the argument that a district court has inherent authority to enter other types of remand orders,beyond those permitted under sentences four and six of g.at.at.the court found that this proposition could not be squared with the language of the statute itself 
i n a prior case we analyzed g sentence by sentence and identified two kinds of possible remands under the statute.while we did not state explicitly at that time that these were the only kinds of remands permitted under the statute,we do so today.under sentence four,a district court may remand in conjunction with a judgment affirming,modifying,or reversing the secretary decision.under sentence six,the district court may remand in light of additional evidence without making any substantive ruling as to the correctness of the secretary decision,but only if the claimant shows good cause for failing to present the evidence earlier.congress explicit delineation in g regarding the circumstances under which remands are authorized leads us to conclude that it intended to limit the district court authority to enter remand orders to these two types.
at.at footnote and citation omitted as further support for this reading,the court cited passages from the legislative history of g evidencing a belief that courts were often remanding social security cases without good reason.at.at.accordingly,the court held that in g actions,remand orders must either accompany a final judgment affirming,modifying,or reversing the administrative decision in accordance with sentence four,or conform with the requirements outlined by congress in sentence six.at.at.because the district court order in that case did not fit within either of these categories,the supreme court remanded for clarification of the grounds for the remand.
we confront no similar interpretative dilemma here.rather,all are agreed that the district court ordered a remand under the first portion of sentence six,finding that the commissioner had shown good cause for a remand through a motion brought before an answer had been filed.see g just as clearly,the district court order did not reflect the findings necessary to support a remand under the latter portion of sentence six.to the contrary,the district court subsequently held,and we have now affirmed,that hollon failed to satisfy the two statutory prerequisites to a remand for consideration of additional evidence.if the district court had nonetheless ordered such a remand,it would have exceeded its limited authority under g as construed in melkonyan.
it readily follows,in our view,that the commissioner was under no obligation to consider any additional evidence upon remand from the district court.as reflected in the commissioner motion,this remand was for the limited purpose of finding or reconstructing the lost administrative record.regardless of whether the commissioner regulations might permit the taking of additional evidence in the course of this effort,see,hollon has not identified any legal basis for compelling the commissioner to do so.to the contrary,g explicitly states the criteria that must be satisfied before a court may order the commissioner to consider additional evidence.hollon simply has not met these requirements,and neither this court nor the district court is at liberty to dispense with them.accordingly,the district court properly concluded that there was no basis upon which to order a sentence six remand for the taking of additional evidence.
even if we believed ourselves free to disregard the statutory criteria for a sentence six remand under some sufficiently compelling set of circumstances,hollon generalized appeal to notions of fairness would not motivate us to do so in this case.hollon contends,in essence,that it would be inequitable to grant a remand based on the commissioner negligence,yet deny an innocent claimant the opportunity to use this same remand to supplement the record.given that the commissioner had already embarked upon the process of rebuilding the record,hollon maintains that nothing would be lost,and perhaps something would be gained,if she were permitted to provide additional materials that would shed further light on her son joseph medical condition and treatments over the years.
we can not agree with hollon premise that her proposed supplementation of the record would be entirely.it does no good,after all,to merely add more materials to the administrative record,unless there will be further administrative proceedings in which the commissioner decides whether to revisit a denial of benefits in light of this new evidence.absent such additional administrative review,a court could not properly perform its task under g of determining whether the commissioner decision is supported by substantial evidence,because the court would be evaluating a record beyond that which was before the commissioner at the time of the challenged decision.this procedure would violate our rule that judicial review is confined to the evidence that was available to the commissioner.wyatt secretary of hhs,cir.
consequently,there is no reason for a court to permit a social security claimant to supplement the administrative record on remand unless the court also is prepared to order the commissioner to act upon this new evidence.yet,a court can not issue such an,moreover,it would serve no useful there is some basis for believing that the commissioner might reach a different decision in light of this new evidence.this is precisely the function of the materiality prong of the statutory standard for a sentence six explained,it directs the court to inquire whether there is a reasonable probability that the commissioner would have reached a different disposition of the disability claim if presented with the new evidence.foster,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.where,as here,a claimant proffered evidence does not meet this standard,nothing would be gained by adding it to the administrative record,whether through a sentence six remand or some other procedural device.
we readily acknowledge hollon concern that the commissioner loss of the administrative record injects a troublesome element of uncertainty into the proceedings,and unduly shifts the focus from ordinary substantial evidence review to litigation over the proper content of the reconstructed record.indeed,at oral argument,we expressed our dismay,frustration and concern that administrative records are lost in far too many cases,reflecting the social security administration apparent inattention to its important recordkeeping responsibilities.in addition,we sought assurances that the commissioner is working actively and aggressively to prevent such mishaps in the future,and to ensure that claim files are maintained in accordance with the agency statutory obligations.if the commissioner is unable to improve the agency performance in this regard,congress perhaps might wish to mitigate the potential prejudice to claimants by relaxing the statutory standards for remands in some cases or by adopting other remedial measures.in the present case,however,we are unwilling to order as a remedy that the administrative record be reopened to any and all submissions,absent any ground for believing that this additional evidence would result in a materially different record.because no such showing has been made in this case,we affirm the district court denial of hollon request for a sentence six remand for consideration of new evidence.
b.the district court did not err in holding that hollon validly waived her right to appear at a hearing before the alj.
as her next issue on appeal,hollon argues that the district court erred in determining that she validly waived her right to appear at a hearing before the alj.we find,however,that hollon waiver of this right comported with the pertinent standards promulgated by the commissioner and reflected in our precedents.
as we have explained,both the social security act and basic principles of due process require that a claimant receive meaningful notice and an opportunity to be heard before his claim for disability benefits can be denied.stoner secretary of hhs,cir citing b.similarly,the commissioner regulations confirm that a ny party to a hearing has a right to appear before the administrative law judge to present evidence and to state his or her position.a.this same regulation further provides,however,that a party may waive his or her right to appear by send ing the administrative law judge a waiver or a written statement indicating that he or she do es not wish to appear at the hearing.b see also stoner,at noting that the right to appear can be waived.
beyond these general provisions,the commissioner has issued a ruling that sets standards for testing the validity of a waiver 
in order to insure that any waiver is made voluntarily and knowingly,the commissioner has promulgated social security ruling ssr to establish requirements necessary for a valid waiver of an individual right to appear,in person or through a representative,and present evidence or information at a hearing before the office of hearings and appeals.prior to the publication of ssr,the only requirement for a valid waiver was that it be in writing.for administrative convenience,ssa form ha,request for hearing,included a where the claimant could indicate his decision.although the form still is in use,in order to waive the right to appear,ssr suggests that the claimant sign a statement to that effect in accordance with the evidence requirements described below.in the statement,a claimant acknowledges that he has been informed of the nature of the proceedings and of his right to counsel,to appear and testify at the hearing,to present evidence,to waive the right to appear,and to have the waiver withdrawn prior to the mailing of the decision.
in this case,hollon initially submitted a request for hearing form in may of,and she checked the box on this form indicating that she did not wish to appear at a hearing.request for hearing form,admin.record at.immediately adjacent to this,however,hollon was advised to c omplete waiver form,id,and it is undisputed that hollon did not execute this additional waiver form at the time.without more,hollon mere marking of the on the request for hearing form might have been ambiguous,and might not have qualified as a valid waiver of her right to appear before the alj.see stoner,at.
but this was not the end of the matter.rather,as recounted above,the alj wrote to hollon on march,noting her apparent waiver of her right to appear at a hearing,and cautioning that a fter reviewing the evidence in your case,i feel that it may be to your benefit to appear and testify at a hearing.alj letter,admin.record at.accordingly,the alj requested that hollon again indicate whether she wished to appear at a hearing.see id.in response,hollon signed and returned this letter to the alj a few days later,after first placing a check mark next to the line stating,i do not wish to appear and testify at a hearing and request that a decision be made based on the evidence of record.id.
just as importantly,hollon also signed and returned a separate waiver on form.see form,admin.record at.through this form,signed the same day as her response to the alj,hollon acknowledged i that she had been advised of her right to appear before the alj ii that,although this right had been explained to her,she did not wish to appear iii that she was free to change her mind and request an appearance before the alj at any time before the alj mailed his decision and iv that she had a right to be represented in the administrative proceedings.see id.so far as revealed in the record,hollon did not attempt to revoke this waiver,request an opportunity to appear,or otherwise indicate that she had changed her mind at any time before the alj issued his decision,and she does not maintain otherwise on appeal.
under these circumstances,we find no basis for questioning the validity of hollon waiver.the form that she signed in march of precisely tracks each of the requirements for a valid waiver as established in social security ruling.see stoner,at.although hollon did not execute this form in may of when she first expressed her desire not to appear at a hearing,the form was timely completed and returned well before the alj proceeded on april,to decide joseph claim without a hearing.indeed,the alj seemingly went beyond the requirements of ssr by writing directly to hollon and expressly advising her that it may be to your benefit to appear and testify at a hearing.alj letter,admin.record at.despite this urging,hollon confirmed her election not to appear,signing two additional statements to this effect.under this record,we are at a loss to discern any additional measures that the alj might have employed to confirm hollon knowing waiver of her right to appear at a hearing.
nor can we accept hollon suggestion that her failure to appear at a hearing should somehow have precluded the alj from discounting the credibility of her unsworn statements in the administrative record.whether characterized in terms of credibility,weight,or persuasiveness,each item of evidence in the record must be evaluated by the alj in his role to determine its bearing upon a claimant entitlement to benefits.in finding that certain of hollon statements were not fully credible,alj decision at,admin.record at,the alj was engaged in nothing more than the usual function of determining the extent to which a claimant own reports of his or her symptoms and limitations are consistent with or contradicted by the remainder of the record.
when she signed form confirming her waiver of the right to appear before the alj,hollon expressly acknowledged that her personal appearance before an administrative law judge would provide her with the opportunity to present her testimony,and that this opportunity to be seen and heard could be helpful to the administrative law judge in making a decision.form,admin.record at.similarly,the alj specifically advised hollon in his march,letter that her appearance at a hearing may be to your benefit.alj letter,admin.record at.having nonetheless decided to waive her right to appear,hollon can not now complain that a foreseeable consequence of this election came to,that the alj might give less than full weight to her statements regarding her son symptoms and limitations.accordingly,we affirm the ruling in the court below that hollon validly waived her right to appear before the alj.
c.the district court properly found that the commissioner decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record.
hollon final contention on appeal is that the commissioner decision to discontinue joseph benefits
