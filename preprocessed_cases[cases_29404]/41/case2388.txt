we sympathize with the toguchis on the loss of their son,keane.however,we agree with the district court that keane death was not the result of soon hwang chung deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment in favor of chung.
background 
keane toguchi keane was incarcerated for most of the period between and.he was treated by chung during his incarceration at the halawa correctional facility halawa in and.keane had a lengthy history of mental illness and had been clinically diagnosed with disorder,panic disorder,organic brain syndrome,depression,and syndrome.keane also had an extensive history of illicit drug use,including cocaine,crystal methamphetamine ice,and heroin.
keane was paroled in april of,but returned to halawa eight months later,after he violated his parole by testing positive for ice.in fact,keane had taken ice two days prior to his readmission and had not taken his prescribed medications,including seroquel,klonopine,tranxene,and zoloft,for five days.keane was placed under the direct care of chung,who kept him in therapeutic lockdown for two weeks in an attempt to stabilize his condition.chung prescribed seroquel,zoloft,haldol,and benadryl,and by december,keane had been stabilized and released into the general population.five days later,he began to display irrational behaviors,including urinating on the floor.discontinuing the use of seroquel and haldol,chung transferred keane to the mental health module of the prison,and prescribed trilafon an antipsychotic and congentin to deal with his irrational behaviors.
two days later,keane was brought to chung after he had been shaking,talking loudly,and moving around throughout the previous night.chung reported her observations of keane at and treated him with haldol,cogentin,benadryl,and artane.at around,chung observed keane acting in a bizarre manner,including walking into walls and rocking on the toilet bowl.chung ascribed keane irrational behaviors to a likely ice flashback.chung considered keane an imminent threat to himself and ordered him placed in restraints.
chung observed keane for about fifteen minutes after he was restrained and returned every fifteen minutes thereafter.at,the doctor noted that keane had fallen asleep,and was still sleeping at however,at,a nurse notified chung that keane had stopped breathing.attempts to revive keane failed,and he died shortly thereafter.the medical examiner described the cause of death as follows 
t his man died as a result of combined toxic effects of sertraline and diphenhydramine.the blood level of sertraline is in the lethal level and the blood level of diphenhydramine is in the toxic level.these blood levels are attained by ingestion of multiple tablets of the medications.it is not known whether the medications were taken with suicidal intentions or accidentally ingested because of the altered mental status of the decedent.
keane parents the toguchis brought a action against prison physicians sisar paderes and chung alleging that they were deliberately indifferent to keane serious medical needs.robert marvit and wayne snodgrass served as experts on behalf of chung.marvit concluded that it would be unrealistic to state that the levels of benadryl and zoloft in the blood were from the prescribed medications.he also opined that the care and treatment provided to keane by soon hyung chung was appropriate and met the standard of care for psychiatrists snodgrass similarly concluded that t he clinical symptoms and signs exhibited by keane were appropriately interpreted by chung to be consistent with withdrawal from methamphetamine and that the drug therapy ordered by sh chung,was appropriate and indicated.
bruce victor and randall tackett served as experts on behalf of the toguchis.victor concluded that 
chung failure to evaluate keane actual condition,to conduct a differential diagnosis that would rule out disease or conditions other than ice flashbacks,led her to disregard the known risks of harm from the medications she was administering to him in high doses which,in turn,were superimposed upon probable benzodiazipine withdrawal syndrome and wpw syndrome.her failure to consider these risks directly and proximately precluded proper treatment of keane and,thereby,eliminated any chance of determining the seriousness of his condition or taking appropriate measures that would have prevented his death.
tackett concluded that keane died from the combined effects of sertarline sic and diphenhydramine administered to him by chung.tackett expressed the view that these drugs,along with cogentin,were prescribed without any assessment by chung of keane actual medical condition and without regard for possible withdrawal symptoms that would be affecting his heart rate or potential for arrhythmia.
after considering the evidence submitted by the parties,the district court granted the defendants summary judgment motion,concluding that there was no triable issue of material fact on the question of whether keane death resulted from chung deliberate indifference to his medical needs 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.leever carson city,cir.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.citation omitted.
discussiona.deliberate indifference under.general legal standard 
as with many other actions,this case was brought under,and predicated upon a violation of the eighth amendment proscription against cruel and unusual punishment.the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain upon incarcerated individuals under color of law constitutes a violation of the eighth amendment mcguckin smith,cir citation,alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.a violation of the eighth amendment occurs when prison officials are deliberately indifferent to a prisoner medical needs.see id.
to establish an eighth amendment violation,a prisoner must satisfy both the objective and subjective components of a test.hallett morgan,cir citation omitted.first,there must be a demonstration that the prison official deprived the prisoner of the minimal civilized measure of life necessities.id.citation omitted second,a prisoner must demonstrate that the prison official acted with deliberate indifference in doing so.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
a prison official acts with deliberate indifference only if the prison official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health and safety.gibson county of washoe,nevada,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.under this standard,the prison official must not only be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,but that person must also draw the inference.farmer brennan,d.if a prison official should have been aware of the risk,but was not,then the official has not violated the eighth amendment,no matter how severe the risk.gibson,at citation omitted this subjective approach focuses only on what a defendant mental attitude actually was.farmer,at.mere negligence in diagnosing or treating a medical condition,without more,does not violate a prisoner eighth amendment rights.mcguckin,at alteration and citation omitted.

c she failed to employ emergency treatment to save keane life
