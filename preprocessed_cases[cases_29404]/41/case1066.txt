jo ann allen and debra slone collectively the plaintiffs sued their employer,highlands hospital corporation hhc or the hospital,for age discrimination under the age discrimination in employment act adea and the kentucky civil rights act kcra.in november,both women were terminated after they allegedly violated hhc confidentiality policy.hhc determined that allen and slone had breached the confidentiality of one of its patients,allen minor granddaughter,by permitting the removal of the girl from the hospital without written authorization from the girl mother.
allen and slone each filed a action against hhc.they claimed that the hospital stated reason for discharging them was a pretext designed to hide age discrimination.both cases were removed to federal district court and consolidated for trial.hhc subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment,which the court granted.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual.allen and slone terminations 
allen was hired by the hospital in.she worked in various nursing and supervisory positions until her termination.slone was hired in to work as a transcriptionist in the radiology department,where she was responsible for filing,typing,and working at the front desk of the department.at the time of their terminations,allen and slone were and years old,respectively.
emily davis,tammy davis daughter and allen granddaughter,injured her left arm on wednesday,october.allen picked up emily from school and urged tammy davis to take the child to the emergency room.davis complied by taking her daughter to the emergency room at the hospital,where were taken of emily arm.she then made an appointment for emily to see a doctor the following monday.although davis was told to pick up emily before leaving the hospital in order to have them for the appointment,she forgot to do so.
having realized that she forgot the,davis asked allen to pick them up while allen was at work on friday,even though davis had not signed a release permitting allen to obtain the records.the next morning,allen went to the radiology department in order to retrieve the.she was told by a member of the radiology department that she could not get a copy of the without a signed release form.despite being informed that releasing the without proper authorization would violate the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa,a statute protecting patient privacy,allen continued her efforts to retrieve the films.she was ultimately able to get a copy of the from slone.
allen later signed davis name on a release form,backdated the document,and put it in the jacket.throughout the course of this litigation,allen has maintained that her actions did not constitute a forgery because she had davis oral permission to sign the release.davis,however,did not recall whether she had given allen permission to sign her name,but she did give allen permission to pick up the.
hhc investigated allen and slone conduct for breach of patient privacy.harold warman,the president and ceo of hhc,decided to terminate the plaintiffs based on the recommendation of the hospital vice president of human resources.the hospital has maintained that allen and slone policy violation constituted a group i offense,the worst category of offenses that an employee can commit,and one that authorizes termination upon the first infraction.
warman,however,could not remember the exact details of the policy and conceded that,in an emergency situation,verbal authorization might be allowed.other employees also stated that they did not know whether there was a written policy detailing how authorization for the release of medical records was to be obtained,and no written policy of this type appears in the record.but every hhc official involved in the disciplinary process agreed that allen and slone had committed a group i offense and should be terminated.
hhc strategies and rates 
warman became the president and ceo of hhc in.soon after he arrived at hhc,he implemented a series of measures to cut costs at the hospital.mary jarvis,a budget manager who reported to warman,testified that these measures included increasing employee turnover,reducing the amount of sick and vacation time used by employees,closing departments,eliminating positions,and using fewer staff members per shift than had previously been required.
jarvis also said that one of warman strategies was to terminate employees based on seniority to facilitate the hiring of new,less costly employees.in fact,warman increased the annual turnover rate from to.jarvis did not know whether the measures had a disproportionate effect on older employees,but she said that warman focus was at all times on improving hhc financial situation.
as the district court noted,the measures implemented by warman did not necessarily disproportionately affect older employees at the hospital.hhc expert presented the following statistics reflecting the change in the hospital workforce from the time that warman became ceo in through the end of 
the district court summarized this data as follows 
f rom to,there was a decrease of employees in the under forty category and a decrease of six employees in the forty or over category.just under of the employees terminated or leaving hhc from until were under forty,and if the longer time period is examined,from to,just over of employee loss took place within the under forty category.the percentage of those employed within the forty and over class rose from just over to just over and back down to just over from to to,respectively.
procedural background 
allen filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc in december,claiming that hhc had violated the adea by discharging her on the basis of her age.she received a right to sue letter in april and filed suit in a kentucky state court three months later.in addition to the claim,allen also brought claims for emotional distress,defamation,and wrongful discharge.
slone filed an eeoc charge in june.like allen,slone contended that she had been discharged because of her age.slone received an eeoc right to sue letter in october.in february,she filed suit in a kentucky state court,alleging that hhc had violated both federal and state law by discriminating against her on the basis of her age.
hhc removed both suits to the appropriate federal district court,where the cases were consolidated for trial.following a substantial period of discovery,the hospital moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion in march,concluding that allen and slone and claims were without merit.with respect to their claim,the district court determined that allen and slone had failed to demonstrate that hhc legitimate,nondiscriminatory explanation for their alleged violation of patient pretextual.in particular,the court explained that the plaintiffs had failed to produce circumstantial evidence that the motivating factor behind the hospital action was based on their age.
as for the claim,the court explained that the plaintiffs had failed to identify a sufficiently specific practice that disproportionately disadvantaged hhc older employees.the court also concluded that the hospital goal of cutting costs by increasing turnover and discouraging employees from using sick and vacation time was not unlawful.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo the district court grant of summary judgment as to allen and slone and claims.see int l union cummins,cir.summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
disparate treatment 
framework for claims brought under the adea 
under both the adea,and the kcra.ann,employers are prohibited from discharging or otherwise discriminating against any employee with respect to compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment because of that individual age.claims brought under the kcra are analyzed in the same manner as adea claims.williams tyco,cir harker fed.land bank of louisville,explaining that because t he kentucky age discrimination statute is specially modeled after the federal law,in this particular area we must consider the way the federal act has been interpreted,and applying federal caselaw to the plaintiff kcra claim.
a plaintiff who brings an claim based on a theory must prove that age was a determining factor in the adverse employment action that the employer took against him.phelps yale,cir see also reeves sanderson plumbing,d when a plaintiff alleges disparate treatment,liability depends on whether the plaintiff age actually played a role in the employer decisionmaking process and had a determinative influence on the outcome.brackets,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted.such a claim may be proved using either direct or circumstantial evidence.wexler white fine furniture,cir en banc.direct evidence of discrimination is that evidence which,if believed,requires the conclusion that unlawful discrimination was at least a motivating factor in the employer actions.id.internal quotation marks omitted.circumstantial evidence,on the other hand,is proof that does not on its face establish discriminatory animus,but does allow a factfinder to draw a reasonable inference that discrimination occurred.id.
where a claim of age discrimination is based largely on circumstantial evidence,we analyze the claim under the mcdonnell douglas framework.ercegovich goodyear tire rubber,cir citing mcdonnell douglas green,d.the first step of the mcdonnell douglas test requires the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination by showing that the plaintiff was a member of a protected class of persons,persons years of age or over,was discharged,was qualified for the position held,and was replaced by someone outside of the protected class.minadeo ici paints,cir.
once a plaintiff satisfies his or her prima facie burden,the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.ercegovich,at.if the employer meets this burden,the burden of production shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer nondiscriminatory explanation is a mere pretext for intentional age discrimination.id.
direct evidence 
although their brief is somewhat unclear on this point,allen and slone appear to claim that they produced direct evidence of age discrimination.they point to jarvis statements about the measures implemented by warman,and the testimony of another employee in the protected class whose supervisor made comments to her in advance of her subsequent termination.
the plaintiffs characterize jarvis statements as an expression of warman intent to replace older employees with younger,cheaper employees.that characterization,however,is substantially misleading.in fact,jarvis said that warman endeavored to target employees based on seniority,not age.as will be discussed in more detail in part.below,that distinction matters a great deal.see hazen paper biggins,d because age and years of service are analytically distinct,an employer can take account of one while ignoring the other,and thus it is incorrect to say that a decision based on years of service is necessarily age based.jarvis testimony,in any event,simply does not constitute evidence which,if believed,requires the conclusion that unlawful discrimination was at least a motivating factor in the employer actions.see wexler,at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court agreed.
allen and slone also claimed that a comment made to another employee at hhc provided direct evidence of age discrimination.that comment was made to an older employee by her supervisor,who told her to look for a new job because i think all older employees are going to be let go.but as the district court noted,t he solitary remark regarding an attitude toward age was made by an employee of master within the context of an master employee and not by slone or allen supervisors or in the context of their termination.this type of evidence is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether age was a motivating factor in the decision to terminate allen and slone.see cooley carmike cinemas,cir explaining that when examining statements allegedly showing employer bias on the basis of age,courts should consider whether the comments were made by a decision maker or by an agent within the scope of his employment whether they were related to the process whether they were more than merely vague,ambiguous,or isolated remarks and whether they were proximate in time to the act of termination.
circumstantial evidence 
allen and slone further contend that they produced sufficient circumstantial evidence of disparate treatment based on age to send their case to a jury.as the district court noted,hhc does not dispute that allen and slone satisfied their initial production burden of establishing a prima facie case of age discrimination.the district court also concluded that it is undisputed that hhc has proffered a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for allen and slone termination.it therefore limited its analysis to whether allen and slone had produced evidence sufficient for a jury to conclude that the hospital proffered reason was a pretext to hide unlawful discrimination on the basis of age.
on appeal,allen and slone contest the district court finding that hhc had proffered a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its termination decisions.they claim that because the record is clear in showing that no group i offense was committed,hhc was not properly found to have met its burden of proof as to the legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason.allen and slone attempt to buttress their position by claiming that the hospital proffered reason should properly have been found pretextual because,according to them,the hospital claim of a group i violation was patently false and completely unsupported by the record.
the plaintiffs contention that hhc failed to meet its production burden lacks merit because hhc produced evidence sufficient for a trier of fact to conclude that allen and slone were fired for giving out unauthorized or confidential information about patients,which is explicitly prohibited by the hospital employee manual.that allen and slone believe this proffered reason to be patently false does not lead to the conclusion that the hospital failed to meet its production burden.see.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d the defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons.tinker sears,roebuck,cir holding that the employer met its production burden by alleging that tinker termination was the result of his violation of company policy on the preparation of work orders.rather,the plaintiffs argument on this score is more properly addressed at the pretext stage of the inquiry.see,manzer diamond shamrock chem,cir explaining that one way a plaintiff can show pretext is by producing evidence that the proffered bases for the plaintiff discharge are factually false.
in manzer,this court described three ways that a plaintiff can show pretext 
o nce the employer has come forward with a nondiscriminatory reason,the plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence from which the jury may reasonably reject the employer explanation.
to make a submissible case on the credibility of his employer explanation,the plaintiff is required to show by a preponderance of the evidence either that the proffered reasons had no basis in fact,that the proffered reasons did not actually motivate his discharge,or that they were insufficient to motivate discharge.the first type of showing is easily recognizable and consists of evidence that the proffered bases for the plaintiff discharge never happened,that they are factually false.the third showing is also easily recognizable and,ordinarily,consists of evidence that other employees,particularly employees not in the protected class,were not fired even though they engaged in substantially identical conduct to that which the employer contends motivated its discharge of the plaintiff.these two types of rebuttals are direct attacks on the credibility of the employer proffered motivation for firing plaintiff and,if shown,provide an evidentiary basis for the factfinder to infer illegal discrimination from the plaintiff prima facie case.
the second showing,however,is of an entirely different ilk.there,the plaintiff admits the factual basis underlying the employer proffered explanation and further admits that such conduct could motivate dismissal.the plaintiff attack on the credibility of the proffered explanation is,instead,an indirect one.in such cases,the plaintiff attempts to indict the credibility of his employer explanation by showing circumstances which tend to prove that an illegal motivation was more likely than that offered by the defendant.in other words,the plaintiff argues that the sheer weight of the circumstantial evidence of discrimination makes it more likely than not that the employer explanation is a pretext,or coverup.
id.at citations,footnote,and internal quotation marks omitted.
allen and slone present several arguments attacking as pretextual the hospital proffered explanation for discharging them.as noted above,their first claim is that because the hospital did not have a written policy outlining the procedures to be followed in the release of medical records,and because davis gave allen oral permission to retrieve the,allen and slone could not have violated hhc policy.their other claim is that jarvis testimony clearly illustrated hhc plan to eliminate older employees,which shows that the purported privacy motivated their discharge.we will address each of these arguments in turn.
hhc reasonably believed that allen and slone had breached patient confidentiality 
allen and slone object to the district court determination that they had violated hipaa and the hospital privacy policy.in particular,the plaintiffs argue that because the hospital did not have a written policy regarding the procedures to be utilized in the release of medical records,its proffered reason for terminating them must be pretextual.in other words,they claim that the proffered reason has no basis in fact.see wexler,at citation omitted.the hospital responds that whether allen and slone in fact violated hhc policy is immaterial as long as hhc possessed an honest belief that these workers breached patient confidentiality and committed a group i offense.see michael caterpillar fin.servs,cir the employee disagreement with the facts uncovered in the employer investigation does not create a genuine issue of material fact that would defeat summary judgment as long as an employer has an honest belief in its proffered nondiscriminatory reason.internal quotation marks omitted.
the record demonstrates that allen and slone are correct in arguing that the hospital did not have a written policy governing specific procedures to be followed in releasing medical records.indeed,neither warman nor any of the other witnesses who testified in the present case identified or produced such a policy.but allen and slone claim that there was no policy whatsoever governing the release of medical records is a substantial exaggeration.in particular,they themselves concede that hhc employee manual clearly identified the release of unauthorized or confidential information about patients as a group i offense,which subjected employees to dismissal upon the first infraction.
the plaintiffs instead continue to argue that because davis gave oral permission for allen to retrieve the,the release of the records can not be characterized as unauthorized.that position,however,is substantially undermined by evidence in the record demonstrating that allen and slone were informed by another hospital employee that a written release from davis was required,and recognized at the time of the incident or shortly thereafter that the absence of a written release was problematic.indeed,on the evening of the incident,slone called allen and asked her to m ake sure davis signed a release,because if there not a release signed by davis,i could be in trouble over this.allen then created a written release,signing davis name and backdating it so that the release appeared to have been created before the were taken from the hospital.this behavior strongly suggests that allen and slone recognized that their actions were incompatible with hhc privacy policy.
we acknowledge that the facts of this case are not a textbook example of a privacy violation for which a hospital would usually take such serious action against its employees.the record shows that allen was not only the biological grandmother of the patient,but also was involved in her care and guardianship although allen was admittedly not emily legal guardian.moreover,hhc does not dispute that davis,as emily mother and legal guardian,in fact gave allen verbal authorization to retrieve the.the plaintiffs have thus undoubtedly pointed to a weakness in the hospital policy,if for no other reason than that this case highlights the potential ambiguity caused by the lack of detail in the employee manual prohibition against an unauthorized release.but the fact that the hospital would benefit from developing a more detailed policy on this issue does not mean that allen and slone have succeeded in creating a genuine issue of material fact about whether hhc stated reason for terminating them was a pretext designed to hide discrimination.
we thus agree with the hospital that,in determining if the plaintiffs have raised a genuine issue of material fact as to pretext,we should consider not whether allen and slone actually breached patient confidentiality,but rather whether the hospital had an honestly held belief that they had committed a group i offense.see michael,at explaining that the plaintiff disagreement with the facts uncovered in the employer investigation does not create a genuine issue of material fact that would defeat summary judgment as long as an employer has an honest belief in its proffered nondiscriminatory reason internal quotation marks omitted majewski automatic data processing,cir a s long as an employer has an honest belief in its proffered nondiscriminatory reason for discharging an employee,the employee can not establish that the reason was pretextual simply because it is ultimately shown to be incorrect.
this court has explained that 
the key inquiry in assessing whether an employer holds such an honest belief is whether the employer made a reasonably informed and considered decision before taking the action.an employer has an honest belief in its rationale when it reasonably relied on the particularized facts that were before it at the time the decision was made.w e do not require that the decisional process used by the employer be optimal or that it left no stone unturned.
michael,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
applying this standard to the record before us,we conclude that hhc did hold an honest belief that allen and slone had violated patient confidentiality.despite the lack of a written policy detailing precisely what constitutes the unauthorized release of medical records,the uncontradicted evidence shows that the hospital engaged in a thorough investigation to determine whether allen and slone conduct was inappropriate.this investigation was conducted by personnel in the human resources department at the hospital and included interviews with allen and slone,in addition to a number of employees and supervisors within the radiology department.all of the management officials involved in the investigation agreed that allen and slone had committed a group i offense and recommended that they both be terminated.the response by the plaintiffs failed to produce any evidence indicating that the process the hospital used to conduct the investigation was irregular or idiosyncratic.jenkins nashville pub.radio,cir concluding,in a discriminatory hiring case,that the plaintiff had raised a genuine issue of material fact with respect to pretext in part because the plaintiff produced evidence of irregularities in the application and selection process.
to the contrary,the record here shows that the hospital reasonably relied on the particularized facts that were before it in deciding to terminate allen and slone.see michael,at citation omitted concluding that the employer presented sound,nondiscriminatory reasons for disciplining the employee based on a reasonable investigation of events that occurred.this is sufficient to belie the plaintiffs contention that hhc proffered explanation was a pretext designed to hide age discrimination.see id.at affirming the district court grant of summary judgment because the employee was unable to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the employer proffered legitimate explanation was pretextual.
in sum,the plaintiffs have at best succeeded in pointing out ambiguities in the hospital formal policy relating to the release of patient records.but they have not shown that the hospital acted unreasonably or without an honest belief that patient issue that is of paramount concern to healthcare providers and specifically protected by been violated.for these reasons,we reject the plaintiffs claim that their being subjected to hhc policy regarding patient privacy was pretextual.
allen and slone presented no evidence showing that hhc targeted older employees for discharge 
allen and slone alternative argument regarding pretext is that the strategies implemented by hhc specifically targeted older employees.according to them,these strategies are sufficient to show that the hospital was not actually motivated by the privacy violation in terminating the plaintiffs.in other words,they contend that the sheer weight of the circumstantial evidence of discrimination makes it more likely than not that hhc explanation is a coverup.see manzer diamond shamrock chems,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the plaintiffs argument in this regard is based almost exclusively on statements made by jarvis in her deposition.but as discussed in part.above,allen and slone have mischaracterized jarvis testimony.jarvis stated that hhc through warman,its ceo had attempted to cut costs by increasing employee turnover and targeting employees who had job seniority,those who had higher salaries and more sick and vacation time.she specifically denied any knowledge of whether those strategies had a disproportionate impact on older employees and,contrary to allen and slone suggestion,did not state that warman had targeted employees based on their age.
once jarvis testimony is accurately described,it leads to precisely the opposite legal conclusion than the one advocated by the plaintiffs.indeed,the supreme court in hazen paper biggins,d,has specifically held that the strategies discussed by jarvis are permissible methods for employers to cut costs 
when the employer decision is wholly motivated by factors other than age,the problem of inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes disappears.this is true even if the motivating factor is correlated with age on average,an older employee has had more years in the work force than a younger employee,and thus may well have accumulated more years of service with a particular employer.yet an employee age is analytically distinct from his years of service.an employee who is younger than,and therefore outside the class of older workers as defined by the adea,see a,may have worked for a particular employer his entire career,while an older worker may have been newly hired.because age and years of service are analytically distinct,an employer can take account of one while ignoring the other,and thus it is incorrect to say that a decision based on years of service is necessarily age based.
id.at.see also allen diebold,cir noting that to state a claim for disparate treatment based on age,the plaintiffs must allege that the employer discriminated against them because they were old,not because they were expensive.
allen and slone claim of pretext,based on an alleged plan to target older employees,is also undercut by the statistical evidence presented by hhc.that evidence showed that,contrary to the plaintiffs contention,older employees were not disproportionately affected by the hospital strategies.in fact,between and,employees under the age of were actually terminated in a much higher proportion than workers protected by the adea.allen and slone have thus failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the hospital was motivated by age instead of by its proffered legitimate reason for discharging the plaintiffs.we therefore conclude that the plaintiffs claim lacks merit.
disparate impact 
administrative exhaustion 
allen and slone next argue that hhc measures had a disparate impact on older employees.hhc responds that the plaintiffs claim should be dismissed because they failed to exhaust administrative remedies made available to them by the eeoc.specifically,hhc contends that identifying a claim of discrimination before the eeoc with sufficient precision is a jurisdictional prerequisite to maintaining that claim in federal court.hhc further contends that because neither allen nor slone original eeoc charges alleges,or even hints at,discrimination,they can not recover under a theory of liability.we must address hhc jurisdictional challenge before evaluating the merits of the plaintiffs claim.see cutshall sundquist,cir before we reach the merits of the parties arguments,we must address the contention that the district court lacked jurisdiction.
hhc correctly points out that the plaintiffs must file a charge with the eeoc before filing a complaint alleging age discrimination in federal court.see davis sodexho,cumberland coll.cafeteria,cir.the hospital is also correct to note that an eeoc charge must contain a written statement sufficiently precise to identify the parties,and to describe generally the action or practices complained of.see b.but hhc assertion that the exhaustion requirement is a jurisdictional prerequisite is no longer accurate in light of the supreme court decision in arbaugh y h,d see also bacon honda of am,cir noting that arbaugh may require reconsideration of our precedent that administrative exhaustion is a jurisdictional matter rather than an element of a discrimination claim,but declining to address the question because the plaintiff was able to show that he had administratively exhausted the claims at issue.
in arbaugh,the supreme court held that title vii definition of an employer,which limits the application of title vii to employers who have at least employees,is an element of a plaintiff claim for relief,not a jurisdictional issue.at.to reach this conclusion,the court adopted the following rule of construction to determine whether a statutory requirement is jurisdictional in nature 
if the legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute scope shall count as jurisdictional,then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue but when congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional,courts should treat the restriction as in character.
id.at.citation omitted.this rule requires us to reconsider this court previous holding that federal courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear adea claims unless the claimant explicitly files the claim in an eeoc charge or the claim can be reasonably expected to grow out of the eeoc charge.weigel baptist hosp.of,cir citation omitted.we now hold,in light of arbaugh,that although administrative exhaustion is still a statutory prerequisite to maintaining claims brought under the adea,the prerequisite does not state a limitation on federal courts subject matter jurisdiction over such claims.to reach this conclusion,we look to the statute that sets forth the requirement at issue.see arbaugh,at.indicating that the rule involves looking to the statutory limitation to determine whether such limitation is jurisdictional emphasis added.
hhc cites the provision d for the proposition that filing an age discrimination charge with the eeoc is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the filing of a civil action.but that subsection does not address prerequisites at all.see id.making it unlawful for employers to discriminate against employees for participating in a proceeding litigated under the adea.we assume that hhc intended to cite d instead because this provision sets forth administrative filing requirements that are relevant to this case.see vinson ford motor,cir citing d for the proposition that i t is well settled that the filing of a charge with the eeoc is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the filing of a civil action under adea.section d provides that 
n o civil action may be commenced by an individual under this section until days after a charge alleging unlawful discrimination has been filed with the eeoc.such a charge shall be filed 
within days after the alleged unlawful practice occurred or 
in a case to which section b of this title applies,within days after the alleged unlawful practice occurred,or within days after receipt by the individual of notice of termination of proceedings under state law,whichever is earlier.
upon receiving such a charge,the commission shall promptly notify all persons named in such charge as prospective defendants in the action and shall promptly seek to eliminate any alleged unlawful practice by informal methods of conciliation,conference,and persuasion.
two principal considerations lead us to conclude that this subsection does not describe a limitation on federal subject matter jurisdiction.first,nothing in this subsection clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute scope shall count as jurisdictional because it does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.see arbaugh,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the term jurisdiction,for example,never appears in this provision text or title.we recognize that d states that no civil action may be commenced until an eeoc charge has been filed.id.but this language alone does not suffice to show that congress intended for the requirement to be jurisdictional in nature.see arbaugh,at.noting that in recent decisions,we have clarified that time prescriptions,however emphatic,are not properly typed jurisdictional citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the second consideration is that the adea contains another,separate provision that speaks directly to jurisdiction.in particular,c is titled civil actions persons aggrieved jurisdiction judicial relief termination of individual action upon commencement of action by commission jury trial emphasis added.section c provides that 
a ny person aggrieved may bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter provided,t hat the right of any person to bring such action shall terminate upon the commencement of an action by the eeoc to enforce the right of such employee under this chapter.
unlike d,the subsection speak s in jurisdictional terms and refer s to the jurisdiction of the district courts.see arbaugh,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.section c establishes that any court of competent jurisdiction may hear a civil action brought under the adea.indeed,where congress intended to limit that jurisdiction,it did so expressly and in the very same provision,declaring that the right to bring a civil action shall terminate if and when the eeoc commences an action under the adea.
congress did not,by contrast,clearly state in c that filing a charge with the eeoc is a precondition to the federal courts jurisdiction over adea claims.we therefore hold that the requirement set forth in d is not jurisdictional in nature,but is instead best understood as a prudential prerequisite to filing a claim in federal court.see wilson mvm,cir distinguishing between prudential and jurisdictional exhaustion requirements,and holding that the requirement found in the rehabilitation act is prudential in nature.
turning now to the case before us,we note that hhc has raised a legitimate question as to whether allen and slone claims have been exhausted.specifically,hhc plausibly contends that the plaintiffs did not adequately describe their discrimination claim such that an eeoc investigation into potential liability based on disparate impact could have reasonably expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.see ang procter gamble,cir citation omitted holding that this court does not necessarily require the claim to be specifically raised in an eeoc charge provided that it satisfies this test.allen simply stated in her eeoc charge that she was discharged because of her age.slone included a slightly more detailed explanation i was informed that i was terminated for violation of the health information privacy act.i believe that i was discharged because of my age,in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea.
we find this question to be a close one.because administrative exhaustion does not raise a jurisdictional question under the adea,however,we may decline to decide the issue if reaching the merits of allen and slone claim provides a clearer basis for the disposition of the case.see state of ohio ex rel.celebrezze nuclear regulatory comm n,cir holding that because the merits of the plaintiff underlying claims were sufficiently clear,this court did not need to interpret the scope of a supreme court case discussing the reviewability of agency decisions.as discussed below,we conclude that the district court correctly granted summary judgment for hhc on the issue of disparate impact.
claims that stress disparate impact involve employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another.smith city of jackson,d citation,brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.in city of jackson,the supreme court stated unequivocally that recovery is available under the adea to plaintiffs who raise discrimination claims based on a theory of disparate impact.id.at.that decision also cautions that the scope of liability under the adea is narrower than under title vii.id.the court reasoned that age,unlike race or other classifications protected by title vii,not uncommonly has relevance to an individual capacity to engage in certain types of employment.id.moreover,the court referred to amendments to title vii contained in the civil rights act of,stat,which expanded the availability of liability in the title vii context,and effectively overruled the supreme court narrow construction of title vii as set forth in wards cove packing atonio,d holding that a plaintiff must demonstrate that it is the application of a specific or particular employment practice that has created the disparate impact under attack.because those amendments did not change the adea or address age discrimination,the supreme court reasoned that wards cove interpretation of title vii identical language remains applicable to the adea.city of jackson,at.
applying the wards cove interpretation of liability to the adea is significant.plaintiffs that allege discrimination based on a theory of disparate impact under the adea must isolate and identify the specific employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.meacham et knolls atomic power,d emphasis in the original brackets,citation,and internal quotation marks omitted.this requirement is important because isolating and identifying such practices is not a trivial burden,and involves more than simply point ing to a generalized policy that leads to such an impact.see id.quoting city of jackson,at.brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.in city of jackson,for example,the supreme court held that the petitioners had not raised a genuine issue of material fact because 
the petitioners have done little more than point out that the pay plan at issue is relatively less generous to older workers than to younger workers.they have not identified any specific test,requirement,or practice that has an adverse impact on older workers.as we held in wards cove,it is not enough
