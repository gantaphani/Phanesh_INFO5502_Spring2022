background 
the patent is directed to an orthodontic bracket.orthodontic brackets are structures that adhere to the surface of a patient tooth and together with an archwire comprise what is commonly referred to as braces.the patented bracket includes a means for opening a clip that holds the archwire in place.the inventor of the patent is john voudouris,who was the president of orthoarm.voudouris assigned the patent to orthoarm.in,orthoarm sued american orthodontics corporation american for infringement of the patent based on american sale of brackets.american manufactured and distributed brackets for adenta gmbh adenta.instead of proceeding with the litigation,american and orthoarm entered into a mutual settlement agreement the settlement agreement,wherein orthoarm assigned the patent to american,and american agreed to pay orthoarm a four percent royalty on its sales of a bracket,known as the time bracket.
thereafter,american asked adenta to pay a part of the royalty obligation that it owed to orthoarm under the settlement agreement.american and adenta accordingly entered into a royalty sharing agreement,wherein each party agreed to pay orthoarm half of the four percent royalty obligation on sales of the time bracket.american and adenta also entered into a license agreement that gave adenta a license to sell another version of a bracket,known as the evolution bracket.under the terms of the license agreement,adenta owed american a four percent royalty on sales of the evolution bracket.
adenta later advised american and orthoarm that it believed that the patent was invalid and that it would stop paying royalties on sales of both the time and evolution brackets.american responded with a letter stating that a failure to pay royalties would constitute a breach of the license agreement,and that in the event of such a breach,american would pursue its available legal remedies to protect its rights the american letter.adenta thereafter filed a complaint in the district court for the eastern district of wisconsin seeking a declaratory judgment that the patent is invalid and unenforceable.adenta alleged that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction because the american letter constituted a threat of an imminent patent infringement suit.adenta also alleged that the patent was invalid on the ground that wolfgang heiser,an austrian orthodontist,and claus schendell,adenta president,had publicly displayed or offered for sale a time bracket at a florida trade show in.adenta also alleged that the patent was unenforceable based on improper inventorship and that inventor voudouris allegedly knew of the time bracket,but failed to disclose it to the united states patent and trademark office pto during prosecution of the patent.
orthoarm moved to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that adenta never had a reasonable apprehension that it would be sued by american,and that adenta and american conspired to contest the validity of the patent.the district court noted that it could not resolve the suit without more documentation,but denied orthoarm motion to dismiss.thereafter,orthoarm filed a renewed motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b.after further consideration of the jurisdictional issue,the court denied the renewed motion.the case proceeded to trial on the invalidity and unenforceability issues.
during trial,adenta argued that the claims of the patent were invalid based on the public use or sale of its orthodontic bracket in at the annual session of the american association of orthodontists in orlando,florida the florida trade show,which was held more than one year before the priority date of the patent.the parties agreed that exhibit,which was a photo of a bracket,represented the type of time bracket that was allegedly shown at the trade show.adenta presented testimony from five witnesses to verify that the type of bracket as depicted in exhibit was in fact displayed at the florida trade show.those witnesses were schendell and heiser,who worked at adenta john russell,who was a sales representative for adenta brackets in england lee tuneberg,who was a vice president at american and inventor voudouris.
adenta also presented various documents to support its claim that the time bracket of the type shown in exhibit was displayed at the florida trade show.those documents included drawings of a bracket made by heiser in and exhibit a german patent application that disclosed the time bracket filed march,exhibit the florida conference exhibitor guide exhibit a fax dated june from russell to schendell that asked if heiser would come to britain to discuss the time bracket exhibit a german article that included photos of the time bracket exhibit and a letter from adenta german patent attorney to adenta patent attorney instructing the attorney to file an application on the time bracket within a year of the florida trade show exhibit.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of adenta,finding that claims and of the patent were invalidated by adenta public use or sale of its bracket at the florida trade show.the jury also found that there was no showing of inequitable conduct because voudouris did not withhold material information from the pto.
orthoarm filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law asserting that adenta had not met its clear and convincing burden to show that the asserted claims of the patent were invalid.orthoarm contended that all the witnesses that adenta presented at trial were interested witnesses and that their oral testimony was not corroborated by any documentary evidence.the district court denied orthoarm motion for judgment as a matter of law.the court noted that during trial heiser and schendell,who developed adenta bracket,testified that their bracket was on sale at the florida trade show.the court stated that they clearly were interested parties.the court found,however,that their testimony was corroborated by the testimony of voudouris,russell,and tuneberg,who were not interested witnesses.
the district court observed that voudouris was the president of orthoarm and the inventor of the patent,and that he testified that he attended the florida trade show.the court also noted that russell was the sales representative for adenta brackets in england and testified that sales of adenta products accounted for only three percent of his company sales.the court determined that russell interest in adenta was thus not sufficient to discredit his testimony that the time bracket was displayed at the florida trade show.the court next determined that tuneberg,who was vice president of research and product development at american,was not an interested witness,and he had confirmed that adenta bracket was on sale at the florida trade show.in fact,when asked during trial whether american would benefit from invalidating the patent,the court pointed out that tuneberg responded that it impossible to say that we will benefit or not benefit.
in addition to the oral testimony,the district court noted that the following documents were offered to corroborate adenta position exhibit heiser drawings exhibit german patent application exhibit florida conference exhibitor guide exhibit fax from john russell to adenta exhibit article and exhibit koerner letter to patent attorney charles mueller.the court observed that although none of those documents was strictly contemporaneous with the florida trade show,they were created shortly before or after the show.the court determined that given the quality and quantity of the evidence,a reasonable fact finder could conclude that clear and convincing evidence showed that adenta time bracket was publicly used or on sale at the florida trade show.thus,the court concluded that it would not disturb the jury verdict.
the district court thereafter denied adenta request for a declaratory judgment that the case was exceptional.the court determined that,even if the jury may have erred in finding that no material information was withheld from the examiner during prosecution of the patent,inequitable conduct was still not shown because there was insufficient evidence of intent to deceive the pto.the court thus concluded that the case was not exceptional.

subject matter jurisdiction 
on appeal,orthoarm argues that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide this case.orthoarm notes that the court itself stated that it lacked adequate information to decide the jurisdictional issue,but then proceeded to deny orthoarm motion,thereby improperly assuming jurisdiction.orthoarm further argues that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide the case because the american letter did not create in adenta a reasonable apprehension of an imminent infringement suit.according to orthoarm,the american letter only stated that american would pursue its available legal remedies in the event of a breach of the license agreement,not that it would file an infringement suit.moreover,orthoarm alleges that american and adenta interests were aligned in attempting to invalidate the patent.according to orthoarm,the parties did not have adverse legal interests because both parties would benefit from having the patent invalidated by not having to make royalty payments to orthoarm.
adenta responds that after the initial motion to dismiss was denied,orthoarm filed a renewed motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,which the court again denied after further consideration.adenta argues that the court properly considered the evidence and denied the motion to dismiss,thereby correctly concluding that it did have subject matter jurisdiction.adenta further responds that it did have a reasonable apprehension of an infringement suit.according to adenta,the american letter stated that american would pursue its available legal remedies if adenta stopped making royalty payments.adenta asserts that such a statement was sufficient to create an apprehension of suit.adenta further responds that even if orthoarm did not intend to assert an infringement claim,the letter still created a reasonable apprehension of an imminent lawsuit.
we agree with adenta that the district court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and concluding that declaratory judgment jurisdiction existed in this case.the declaratory judgment act,provides that i n a case or controversy within its jurisdiction any court of the united states may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,whether or not further relief is or could be sought.the supreme court recently reiterated that the phrase case or actual controversy in the act refers to the type of cases and controversies that are justiciable under article iii.medimmune,genentech,d.the court further stated that b asically,the question in each case is whether the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.id.at quoting.cas.pac.coal oil.in a decision,we explained that the supreme court opinion in medimmune represents a rejection of our reasonable apprehension of suit test.sandisk stmicroelectronics.we further explained that where a patentee asserts rights under a patent based on certain identified ongoing or planned activity of another party,and where that party contends that it has the right to engage in the accused activity without a license under the patent,an article iii case or controversy will arise and the party need not risk a suit for infringement by engaging in the identified activity before seeking a declaration of its legal rights.id.at.
with the supreme court decision as our guide,and following medimmune,we conclude that adenta established an article iii case or controversy that gave rise to declaratory judgment jurisdiction.after obtaining legal advice,adenta advised american that it believed that the patent was invalid and that it would not pay any further royalties on sales of the time and evolution brackets.american responded indicating that if adenta breached its license with adenta by not paying royalties,it would pursue its available legal remedies.thus,american indicated its intent to assert its rights under the patent in the event that adenta failed to pay royalties under the terms of the license agreement,thereby creating a substantial controversy.adenta did in fact stop paying royalties to american on sales of the evolution bracket.see medimmune.at there is no dispute that the requirement of a declaratory judgment action would have been satisfied if petitioner had taken the final step of refusing to make royalty payments under the license agreement.moreover,adenta identified that its time bracket had been the subject of a prior infringement lawsuit by orthoarm against american.contrary to what orthoarm argues,the failure of american to file an infringement counterclaim in response to the declaratory judgment action did not deprive the court of jurisdiction.see capo,dioptics med.moreover,the court found that american and adenta did not contrive to invalidate the patent their interests were adverse,and we do not see any reason to disturb that finding.given the facts alleged,it was proper for the court to deny the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and to conclude that a case or controversy existed within the meaning of the declaratory judgment act.
invalidity under b 
on the merits,orthoarm argues that adenta failed to present clear and convincing evidence that the asserted claims of the patent were invalid because of the public use or sale of adenta bracket at the florida trade show.orthoarm asserts that the oral testimony that the time bracket was displayed at the trade show came from four witnesses,all of whom were interested witnesses because they would benefit from invalidation of the patent.according to orthoarm,schendell and heiser were interested witnesses because they were parties to the lawsuit,russell was an interested witness because he was adenta exclusive representative,and tuneberg was an interested witness because he admitted that if adenta won the lawsuit,his company would no longer pay royalties.orthoarm further argues that when all the witnesses are interested,further corro
