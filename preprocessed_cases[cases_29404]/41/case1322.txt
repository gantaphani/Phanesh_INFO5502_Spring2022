in the petitioner,originally named eric holmes but now going by the name koor an nur of katie mary brown,was convicted of a pair of murders committed three years earlier,and in he was sentenced to death.after exhausting his state remedies,he filed the first of the two petitions for federal habeas corpus that are before us only the first need be discussed,as will become apparent.one of the issues he raised was whether he was competent to assist his lawyer in the habeas corpus proceeding.the district judge,refusing to provide funds to enable the petitioner to hire a psychologist or psychiatrist who would give evidence concerning the petitioner mental condition,ruled in after questioning the petitioner in an effort to form a judgment about his competence that he was competent,and in the following year denied habeas corpus relief.the petitioner appealed,and in august,before taking up any other issues presented by the appeal,we ordered a limited remand to the district court to determine the petitioner competence to proceed with the appeal,in light of affidavits presented by his counsel suggesting that his mental condition had deteriorated since the april hearing.we suggested that the judge,on remand,consult experts,and he did so.he received and considered reports from two experts,one hired by the state dan olive,the other by the petitioner rahn bailey.and he again questioned the petitioner but he denied the petitioner request that olive,whose report was equivocal,be made available for.the appeals in this court then resumed,with the parties filing new briefs that repeated the original appellate briefing on all issues except the petitioner competence,concerning which his lawyer asks for a further hearing in the district court to enable him to olive,the state expert.
as a matter of first impression,we might doubt the legal significance of a person lacking the mental competence to prosecute,or to assist his lawyer in prosecuting,a federal habeas corpus proceeding.technically,habeas corpus is a civil proceeding rather than a criminal one.realistically,it is a stage in the criminal process,but it is a stage initiated by the criminal defendant rather than by the state and it is odd to think that someone who initiates a proceeding can then freeze it by claiming to be mentally incompetent.an incompetent person can of course have a legal claim,and it will be prosecuted by his guardian or in the antiquated legal phrase his next friend,but the fact of his incompetence will not be allowed to interrupt or delay the proceeding.see the helpful discussion in bush,d.
but in rohan ex rel.gates woodford,cir,the ninth circuit,in an exhaustive opinion by judge kozinski,held that in a capital case a petitioner for federal habeas corpus must be competent to assist his counsel if not,the proceeding must be stayed.judge kozinski relied in part on a federal statute,q b,entitling a federal habeas corpus petitioner to counsel in a capital case,and through the statute was recently repealed,it was promptly replaced by a materially identical statute.anyway,his opinion places greater emphasis on other factors,such as that a waiver of a legal right concretely,the right to seek postconviction relief must,to be effective,be knowing,implying mental competence.see also mata johnson,cir.and really the presence or absence of counsel is a detail.if the petitioner does have counsel,the issue is his competence to proceed without assistance of counsel.if he does have counsel,the issue is his competence to provide such assistance to counsel as is necessary to enable the claim to habeas corpus relief to be prosecuted adequately by his counsel.
but whether rohan is right or wrong,we are not disposed to reject it,thereby creating an intercircuit conflict,when the state of indiana has declined to challenge it and as a result its validity has throughout these proceedings been assumed rather than litigated.
the most common claim of incompetence to participate in a proceeding is a criminal defendant claim that he is incompetent to stand because he is retarded or insane he can not understand the proceeding sufficiently to assist in his defense.if he prevails in his claim,he avoids a conviction.but once he has been convicted and imprisoned and seeks postconviction relief,he usually has little to gain by claiming that he is incompetent to conduct the postconviction proceeding or,if he has the assistance of a lawyer,to assist in the lawyer conduct of the proceeding.for if the proceeding is halted by a finding that he is incompetent,he just languishes in prison.so we are not surprised to have found no noncapital case in which such a claim has been made.but of course in a capital case the petitioner may prefer to languish in prison than to see his claims for postconviction relief denied,opening the way to his execution,though this is provided that his execution would be stayed until and unless his postconviction proceeding could be completed.
another reason that challenges to competence to conduct postconviction proceedings are so rare is that the petitioner has a tougher row to hoe than when he is challenging his competence to stand trial.the briefs in this case duel over the proper standard for assessing incompetence in proceedings,including appeals including these from denial of postconviction relief.the state argues that it should be a higher standard because the client role in assisting his lawyer in a postconviction proceeding is more limited than if he is on trial.the petitioner argues that the standard should be the same.no cases address the issue.
we do not think that creating different standards to govern the issue of competence to litigate or assist in litigation as distinct from the competence that a defendant must be shown to have in order for him to be convicted of a crime or to be executed,see,panetti quarterman,d ford wainwright,d is a fruitful approach.the multiplication of rules and standards,carrying in its train as it does endless debate over boundaries,is one of the banes of the american legal system,a source of its appalling complexity.whatever the nature of the proceeding,the test should be whether the defendant petitioner,appellant,is competent to play whatever role in relation to his case is necessary to enable it to be adequately presented.
the test is unitary but its application will depend on the circumstances.they include not only the litigant particular mental condition but also the nature of the decision that he must be competent to make.if as in rees peyton,d per curiam,the question is whether a petitioner for habeas corpus who has been sentenced to death is competent to withdraw a petition for certiorari filed on his behalf challenging the denial of habeas corpus see also mata johnson,supra,at,the answer is unlikely to require that he understand more than that the withdrawal of his petition will almost certainly terminate any legal challenge to his death sentence.or suppose the proceeding is an appeal and the only nonfrivolous issue that could be raised turns on an esoteric legal point,incomprehensible to even a highly intelligent,perfectly sane defendant,that if accepted by the appellate court will terminate all proceedings against him.assume further that his lawyer is appointed rather than retained.then all the mental capacity his client would need in order to be able to assist in the appeal would be the capacity to make a rational decision whether to take an appeal that has no downside.if instead,as is common,the issue for appeal is whether there was error at sentencing and if the appeal is successful the case will be remanded for resentencing and the judge may give the defendant a heavier sentence than the one appealed from,the defendant will need a higher level of mental functioning to be able to make a rational decision whether to pursue or forgo the appeal.
federal habeas corpus happens to be one of the most complex areas of american law.with respect to many of the issues that arise in habeas corpus cases,a lay person has nothing to contribute to his lawyer strategy.but it can be different with respect to other issues,several presented in this case,notably pr
