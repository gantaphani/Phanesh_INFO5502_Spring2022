jordan hospital,jordan,filed this lawsuit challenging the dismissal of its request for reclassification into a neighboring geographic region.success in obtaining reclassification would have entitled jordan to an additional million in medicare reimbursements for the fiscal year in question.the district court dismissed jordan complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under,and jordan now appeals.
first,jordan disputes the district court conclusion that judicial review of this administrative decision is precluded by law.second,jordan challenges the validity of the implementing regulations underlying the reclassification process,see et,as inconsistent with the statutory scheme set forth in,and alleges that its procedural due process rights have been violated.finally,jordan posits that the district court erred because the statutory deadline for filing a reclassification application is subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling.finding all of jordan arguments meritless,we affirm.
jordan,a participating provider in the medicare program is located in plymouth,massachusetts,but has regularly applied,under the prospective payment system pps,for reclassification to the cape cod area.under the pps,reimbursement rates are determined by using factors that include the average standardized amount of allowable individual hospital inpatient operating costs,and the area wage index applicable to the hospital.reclassification allows a hospital to utilize the standardized operating costs or wage index,or both,of a neighboring region if higher than the prevailing rate in its own geographic area,to calculate its prospective reimbursement.a hospital requesting reclassification must submit average hourly wage ahw data obtained from the health care financing administration hcfa hospital wage survey,which is used to construct the wage index in effect for prospective payment purposes during the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which the hospital requests reclassification.e i a.the criteria for obtaining wage index reclassification are set forth in e,and include,inter alia,a requirement that the hospital ahw be at least of the ahw of the hospitals in the area in which the hospital is located,and the hospital ahw be at least of the ahw of hospitals in the area to which it seeks to be redesignated.id.e.
prior to the promulgation of the final pps rates for an upcoming fiscal year,hcfa is required to adjust the rates to incorporate the effects of any reclassifications that have been approved.the agency initial task is to recompute the wage index for such year.once the necessary wage index adjustments have been completed,the agency must ensure that the effects of the reclassification process are budget neutral.
pursuant to d,the medicare geographic classification review board board is authorized to rule on applications submitted by hospitals seeking reclassification to an adjacent geographical area.a hospital seeking reclassification for a fiscal year must submit its application to the board not later than the first day of the period ending on september of the preceding fiscal year.id.d c ii.the board is required to render its decision on the application not later than days after this deadline id.d c iii i.if dissatisfied with the board decision,a hospital has days to appeal the decision to the administrator of hcfa,who is required to issue a decision on the appeal not later than days after the appeal is filed.id.d c iii ii.hcfa decision,which becomes the final decision of the secretary of health and human services hhs shall be final and shall not be subject to judicial review.id.
jordan filed its application for reclassification,for purposes,to the cape cod massachusetts metropolitan statistical area cape cod msa for fiscal years fys and in a timely manner and these requests were approved by the board.as a result,medicare reimbursed jordan for those fiscal years according to the value calculated for the cape cod rather than that of jordan own geographic area.however,jordan did not timely file a request for reclassification to the cape cod for fy by the statutory september,deadline because the hourly wage data published in the july,federal register indicated that jordan did not qualify.
as it turned out,the wage data published in the july,federal register had been incorrectly calculated because the cape cod hospital had submitted inaccurate wage data to hcfa.upon learning of this error,jordan filed a reclassification application for fy on august,almost a year after the expiration of the statutory filing deadline and days after the publication of the final pps rates for fy.on august,the board dismissed jordan application on the basis that the request was untimely,rendering jordan ineligible to receive the additional million in medicare program reimbursement to which it would have been entitled had it been reclassified.jordan appealed,and the hcfa administrator affirmed the dismissal on september.on october,jordan requested that the administrator amend her decision,but this request was denied on october.
on april,after exhausting all administrative remedies,jordan filed a complaint in the district court,alleging a violation of its due process rights under the fifth and the fourteenth amendments,and seeking a declaration that hcfa rules and regulations are invalid,both facially and as applied to it.on august,the defendants filed a rule b motion to dismiss on the ground that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under.on march,the district court granted the defendants motion.jordan filed a timely notice of appeal.

defendants argued,and the district court agreed,that jordan claim was barred by the no review provision of the medicare act,d c iii ii,which specifically states that t he decision of the administrator shall be final and shall not be subject to judicial review.on appeal,jordan contends that d c iii ii,when examined in conjunction with related statutes and regulations,does not bar its claim,emphasizing the fact that there is a strong presumption that congress intends judicial review of administrative action.bowen.acad.of family physicians,d.
this presumption,however,is not irrebuttable,and can be overcome when specific statutory language or legislative history indicates otherwise,or where congressional intent to preclude judicial review is fairly discernible in the detail of the legislative scheme.id.at.quoting block cmty.nutrition,d.to prove that congress has shielded administrative decisions from judicial scrutiny,an agency must show by clear and convincing evidence that this was congress intent.abbott labs.gardner,d internal quotations omitted.jordan insists that hcfa has not satisfied this heavy burden.we disagree.the unequivocal language of the no review provision clearly indicates that congress intended to preclude judicial review of this matter.section d c iii ii explicitly provides that reclassification decisions shall not be subject to judicial review.by using such plain and unambiguous language,congress made its intent perfectly clear.furthermore,the rationale for nonreviewability is eminently logical.first,hcfa strict,yet manageable,deadlines ensure that each hospital classification for a fiscal year is firmly in place in time to allow hcfa to make any necessary wage index revisions and budget neutral adjustments.see.second,adherence to these strict dates allows hcfa to publish the rates in final form sixty days prior to the start of a fiscal year.see,c ongress specified these very tight time frames in order to ensure that the effects of reclassifications could be reflected in the new standardized amounts and wage index values that go into effect on october of each year.subjecting the administrator untimeliness decision to judicial review would frustrate this expressly articulated congressional interest in finality,which is particularly crucial for planning purposes.
in a further attempt to bypass the no review provision,jordan posits that there is a material difference between decisions on the merits and dismissals o
