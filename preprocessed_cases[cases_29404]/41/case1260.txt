eugene napier filed a claim for benefits under the black lung benefits act blba in march of.an administrative law judge alj initially awarded napier benefits,but the department of labor benefits review board the board vacated the alj order and remanded the case for further consideration.on remand,the alj once again issued an order awarding benefits to napier.this time the board affirmed the alj determination.jericol mining,napier former employer,has appealed the board decision.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the decision of the board.
background 
napier,who was born on june,began working as a coal miner in may of and continued to serve in that capacity for years.he worked as a repairman and as a section foreman,and was exposed to coal dust on a daily basis.before he stopped working in may of,napier was employed by jericol as a repairman in a kentucky mine.that position required him to perform a variety of strenuous physical activities,including bending,stooping,and heavy lifting.
napier filed an application for benefits under the blba on march.during the administrative consideration of napier claim,jericol was identified as the operator that would be liable for the payment of any benefits the responsible operator.the department of labor dol claims examiner denied napier request for benefits in august of.napier filed a motion with the board for reconsideration,resulting in the reversal of the claims examiner decision by the dol district director.jericol then requested review by an alj.
the alj issued a decision and order granting napier claim for benefits in may of.in reaching his decision,the alj considered medical reports from six physicians who examined napier at various points between may of and november of.four of these.glen baker,arthur frank,kabani,and a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis,but two.bruce broudy and not.the alj found the medical opinions of baker,frank,and miller more persuasive than those of broudy and dahhan because the former physicians conclusions were consistent with napier employment history and the purportedly positive readings that indicated pneumoconiosis,and because baker and miller are in internal medicine and pulmonary medicine.kabani credibility was not assessed in the alj initial order and decision.in addition,the alj attached greater significance to baker opinions because the physician had examined napier annually between and.
the alj also determined that napier was totally disabled,a finding that was based upon the results of nine ventilatory studies and eight arterial blood gas studies,and the medical opinions that napier was unable to return to work as a coal miner.finally,the alj concluded that napier had established that his ailment was caused by exposure to coal dust.this last finding was based upon the reports of baker and frank.the alj identified february,as the commencement date for napier benefits.
napier filed a motion for reconsideration,arguing that his benefits should begin on the date of his disability rather than in february of.the alj agreed,and issued an amended order in september of that changed the commencement date of napier benefits to june.this order also recognized that the initial decision erroneously stated that all of the arterial blood gas studies were qualifying for a finding of total disability.in fact,none of these studies supported napier claim.but the alj reaffirmed his determination that the pulmonary function studies and the preponderance of medical evidence supported a finding of total disability.
on appeal,the board vacated the alj decision and remanded the case for further consideration of three issues the diagnosis of pneumoconiosis,the existence and cause of disability,and the proper date for benefits to commence.the board specifically instructed the alj to explain his findings regarding whether the supported a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis,noting that the initial order lacked any rationale for attributing greater weight to the positive readings,which supported a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis,than to the negative ones.in addition,the board concluded that the alj decision to discount the opinions of broudy and dahhan was irrational,because the alj view was based upon the problematic analysis of the readings and a failure to recognize that all of the examining physicians considered napier years of employment.
with respect to whether napier was totally disabled,the board determined that the alj had neglected to consider all of the relevant evidence and had failed to explain the weight he accorded to the inconsistent opinions from the physicians.the alj was also instructed to reconsider whether,in light of all of the evidence,napier total disability was due to pneumoconiosis.finally,with respect to the commencement date of benefits,the board directed the alj to explain the reason that he credited baker first report in june of as establishing total disability,thus serving as the basis for beginning benefits in that month.
the alj issued a decision and order on remand in november of.with respect to the,the alj found that this evidence did not establish pneumoconiosis,because the majority of the physicians who read the determined that they were negative.but the alj concluded that napier had nevertheless presented substantial evidence of pneumoconiosis,relying upon four of the medical opinions.in particular,the alj found that baker opinion was entitled to greater weight than the views of broudy and dahhan because baker had examined napier on four separate occasions between june of and september of,thereby giving him extensive experience with napier medical history.the alj also gave additional weight to kabani opinion because she was napier treating physician.
pursuant to the board instructions,the alj next reconsidered the question of whether napier had established that he was totally disabled.the alj determined that both the nine qualifying ventilatory studies and the medical opinion evidence supported a finding of a totally disabling respiratory impairment.in addition,the alj once again concluded that napier established that his total disability was at least partly the result of his employment.this conclusion is supported by the reports of baker and frank,whose opinions the alj believed were entitled to greater weight than those of broudy and dahhan.finally,the alj reversed his position as to the commencement date for benefits by returning to february,the month in which napier requested a reconsideration of the dol claims examiner denial of his claim for benefits.
jericol appealed the alj decision and order on remand,but the board affirmed the award of benefits in june of.the board concluded that the alj decision was supported by substantial evidence and contained no reversible error.it portrayed jericol objections to the alj assessment of the medical opinions as a request to conduct a de novo review of the evidence,which the board lacks the authority to do.
the board subsequently denied jericol motion for reconsideration without comment in december of.this timely appeal of the board decision and order followed.

requirements of a claim for benefits under the blba 
the blba provide s benefits to coal miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis a.in order to establish entitlement to benefits,a claimant must prove that he suffers from pneumoconiosis the pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment and,the pneumoconiosis is totally disabling.peabody coal hill,cir.the claimant has the burden of proving each of these requirements by a preponderance of the evidence,except insofar as he is aided by a presumption.id.at.
pneumoconiosis is defined as a chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae,including respiratory and pulmonary impairments,arising out of coal mine employment.b.the defining characteristic of pneumoconiosis for the purpose of the blba is that its symptoms arise as a consequence of being exposed to dust while working in coal mines.b explaining that a disease arising out of coal mine employment includes any chronic pulmonary disease or respiratory or pulmonary impairment significantly related to,or substantially aggravated by,dust exposure in coal mine employment.this legal definition of pneumoconiosis encompasses a wider range of afflictions than does the more restrictive medical definition of pneumoconiosis.cornett benham coal,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a miner who has pneumoconiosis is totally disabled if the impairment prevents him or her from engaging in gainful employment requiring the skills and abilities comparable to those of any employment in a mine or mines in which he or she previously engaged with some regularity and over a substantial period of time.f a.
presumptions based on treatment and frequency of examination 
jericol first argues that the alj improperly relied upon an automatic presumption that a physician opinion is entitled to greater weight if that physician has treated the claimant.according to jericol,such a presumption is never appropriate.jericol also insists that a presumption requiring an alj to defer to the opinions of a treating physician would violate the administrative procedure act apa emphasis on reasoned decisionmaking in light of the record,because it would relieve claimants of their burden of persuasion by automatically assuming that treating doctors opinions are more persuasive without regard to the opinion itself or anything in the record.
this court recently addressed the issue of whether a treating physician opinion is entitled to additional weight in peabody coal groves,cir groves.after recognizing that tussey island creek coal company,cir,confirmed that the opinions of treating physicians are entitled to greater weight than those of physicians,groves rejected the contention that tussey requires an alj to give absolute deference to the opinion of a treating physician.groves,at quoting tussey,at refusing to accept peabody coal company argument that tussey established a presumption that is contrary to the requirements of the apa.instead,groves clarified that tussey requires aljs in black lung cases to examine the medical opinions of treating physicians on their merits and to make a reasoned judgment about their credibility.these opinions should be g iven their proper deference.id.quoting tussey,at.
the factors discussed in d are relevant for determining the appropriate weight that should be assigned to the opinions of treating physicians.wolf creek collieries director,owcp,cir noting that this regulation is instructive groves,at citing d with approval.although this regulation applies only to evidence developed after january,it codifies judicial precedent and does not work a substantive change in the law.mining ass dep t of labor,holding that the rule embodied in d is not retroactive.the revised regulation,which establishes a rule,provides that 
i n appropriate cases,the relationship between the miner and his treating physician may constitute substantial evidence in support of the adjudication officer decision to give that physician opinion controlling weight,provided that the weight given to the opinion of a miner treating physician shall also be based on the credibility of the physician opinion in light of its reasoning and documentation,other relevant evidence and the record as a whole.
these considerations are not only consistent with the requirement that an alj decision be based upon substantial evidence,but also are in line with the views of our sister circuits that have considered the relevance of a treating physician opinion.see mining ass n,at the consensus among courts has been that an agency adjudicator may give weight to the treating physician opinion when doing so makes sense in light of the evidence and the record,but may not mechanistically credit the treating physician solely because of his relationship with the claimant.citing groves as well as cases from the fourth and seventh circuits with approval.for these reasons,jericol is mistaken both in its belief that an automatic presumption exists and in its position that the opinion of a treating physician is never entitled to added weight.
jericol also contends that the alj in the present case erroneously concluded that the physician who treated napier kabani and the physician who examined him multiple times baker were by reason of these relationships more credible than the other physicians,without the alj giving proper consideration to their reasoning and other relevant evidence.according to jericol,the record does not justify giving their opinions greater weight than the views of the other examining physicians.
with regard to the alj reliance upon the opinions of kabani,the only explanation given by the alj for attaching greater significance to her views was that she served as napier treating physician.kabani began seeing napier in march of,when she evaluated him for respiratory complaints.she saw him twice in that month,but did not see him again until five months later.
although kabani said that she continued to see napier on subsequent occasions,the record is silent as to the factors that are relevant in determining whether her opinions as napier treating physician are entitled to greater weight,considerations such as the nature and duration of the relationship,as well as the frequency and extent of the treatment.d instructing the alj to consider these factors in weighing the opinion of the miner treating physician.nor does the record contain the dates or results of any tests that kabani performed.the absence of any documentation to support kabani views precludes the alj from relying upon her opinions.director,owcp rowe,cir explaining that in making credibility determinations,the alj must examine the validity of the reasoning of a medical opinion in light of the studies conducted and the objective indications upon which the medical opinion or conclusion is based footnote omitted.
for the above reasons,we conclude that the alj decision to give extra weight to the opinion of kabani,or even to rely upon her views,was inappropriate.groves,at concluding that the alj was justified in giving extra weight to the opinion of a physician who had treated the claimant for years,a physician whose treatment notes and medical records were fully considered by the alj.
turning to the alj evaluation of baker opinions,the alj noted that baker examined napier four june,may,march,and september.the only other physician,aside from kabani,who examined napier more than once was dahhan.napier was seen twice by dahhan,once on september,and again on november.unlike kabani,who actually treated napier,both baker and dahhan were examining physicians.a treating physician sees a patient for the purpose of dealing with that individual medical condition,whereas an examining physician in the blba context evaluates a coal miner health in relation to that individual claim for benefits.see webster collegiate dictionary,defining treat as to care for or deal with medically or surgically and examine as to test the condition of.we believe that the same factors that justify placing greater weight on the opinions of a treating physician are appropriate considerations in determining the weight to be given an examining physician views.
