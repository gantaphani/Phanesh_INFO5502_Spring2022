background 
hearing components owns the three patents in suit.the and patents are related patents with similar specifications and are directed toward a hearing aid ear piece connected to a disposable,compressible foam sleeve by an attaching or fastening means,for inserting into the ear canal.the patent describes and claims a fibrous guard that is but blocks cerumen,or ear wax.shure sells earphone products,including earphones with two different nozzle designs,straight and barbed.
in may,hearing components sued shure,accusing shure of infringing the and patents with both the straight and barbed nozzle designs.all of the asserted claims of the and patents include an attaching or a fastening means.claim of the patent reads as follows 
an ear piece component for use with a sleeve,having a duct and soft polymeric foam firmly secured to the duct,to facilitate transmission of sound to an ear canal of a user,said ear piece component comprising 
a connecting portion having i distal and proximal ends and an exterior surface between said distal and proximal ends,ii a sound tube extending through said connecting portion between said distal and proximal ends,and iii means on said exterior surface for disposably attaching the duct of the sleeve to said connecting portion,and 
a flange portion secured to said proximal end.
patent emphasis added.claims of the patent and and of the patent further recite that the sleeve is insertable into the ear canal of a user.although claim of the patent does not explicitly recite insertion into the ear canal,the court construed the recited ear piece component to mean a constituent part of the portion that is inserted into the external ear canal,a part of which may extend outwardly into the bowl of the ear.claim construction opinion,slip op.at emphasis added see validity opinion,wl at,dist lexis at.
hearing components also alleged that another shure product infringed claims and of the patent.claim,which is representative of the asserted claims of the patent and from which claim depends,reads as follows 
for use in connection with a sound transmitting device of the type in which a housing contains a sound transmitting tube having a sound outlet port confronting the ear drum when said device is fitted within a user ear canal,
a disposable wax guard for mounting over the sound outlet port to prevent cerumen from fouling said outlet port,said wax guard being readily installed and replaced by a user,comprising a thin,flexible membrane that permits a user to position said guard over said outlet port,one side of said membrane being provided with a normally tacky and adhesive layer except in that portion adapted to overlie said outlet port,the portion of said guard overlying said outlet port being porous to sound and capable of wax entrapment.
patent emphasis added.
in december,the district court construed certain claims of the patents in suit.claim construction opinion.during claim construction,the court found the limitation in the patent stating said wax guard being readily installed and replaced by a user indefinite,slip op.at.the court reasoned that the word readily was not sufficiently explained in the specification.id.at.according to the court,the specification first notes that some prior art products required a tool or solvent to remove wax buildup,but it then disparages prior art products for having filters that were difficult to remove or replace by the elderly and those unable to see clearly enough or to perform fine physical actions well enough.id.at.the court found that the specification standard for the word readily was so subjective that the court could not determine what the claim term meant in the context of the patent.id.the court stated that i t would be extremely difficult,if not impossible,for someone attempting to design around claim to determine what test group of users would be used to measure ease of replacement and which degree of difficulty would be sufficient to avoid infringement.the court therefore finds this claim term indefinite.id.at.
the district court proceeded to trial on the and patents,and the jury found both patents not invalid and infringed by shure products both with a barb and with a straight nozzle.the jury therefore awarded damages of.infringement opinion,wl at,dist.lexis at.shure moved for jmol of invalidity of those patents and noninfringement by both its barbed and products.in march,the court denied shure motion for jmol of invalidity and granted in part its motion for jmol of noninfringement.
in addressing infringement on shure motion for jmol regarding the and patents,the district court focused on the attaching or fastening means.the court had previously determined that both means limitations were in format and therefore were governed by,paragraph.the court had further found that the corresponding structures for the limitations in all four claims were the same 
a duct to which a foam sleeve is firmly secured by a being molded onto the duct or b a layer of adhesive cement where i the duct and ear piece are connected using mating screw threads ii the duct and ear piece are connected using a bayonet or attachment iii the duct and ear piece are connected using a layer of adhesive cement between the proximal end of the sleeve and the distal end of the ear piece and 
equivalents thereof.
infringement opinion,wl at,dist.lexis at.the and patents depict a screw thread attachment at figure and a attachment at figure,both reproduced below 
in figures and,the ear piece is represented by numerals and,respectively.the sleeves,and,each include an elongated plastic duct,and.in figure,the attaching means consists of screw threads,and in figure,it consists of ball and socket.the parties had agreed that none of shure accused devices contained a structure identical to screw threads,a attachment,or a layer of adhesive cement.id.at,dist.lexis at.however,hearing components had argued,and the jury had found,that both the straight and barbed nozzles were equivalent to a screw thread or a attachment.id.representative examples of shure straight and earphones,inserted in ducts of foam sleeves,as shown in shure brief,are depicted below.the earphone is on the left,and the earphone is on the right.
shure br.shure products include a plastic duct that is glued to a foam sleeve.shure straight nozzle is attached by interference fit into the duct,the outer diameter of the nozzle is larger than the inner diameter of the duct.the duct is therefore stretched outward when the nozzle is inserted,and friction holds the nozzle inside the duct.similarly,shure barbed nozzle is attached to the duct by interference fit,but the nozzle also includes a protrusion,or barb,molded out of the same piece of plastic,to increase the friction holding the duct on the nozzle.
focusing on equivalence,the district court held that shure products did not infringe the asserted claims,but that its products did.the court found the evidence legally insufficient to support the jury finding of infringement by shure products.the court reasoned that shure products were not equivalent to the disclosed structures of a screw or attachment,even though they performed the claimed function of attaching the end of the duct to the ear piece in such a way that it can easily be removed and discarded by the user so that another sleeve can be attached.infringement opinion,wl at,dist.lexis at.according to the court,unlike the claimed attaching and fastening means,the interference fit was not a protuberance,snap connection,adhesion,or any other positive attachment that would keep the duct and ear piece connected.id.at,dist.lexis at.
nevertheless,the district court denied jmol with respect to shure products.according to the court,shure barbed nozzle has a protuberance,the barb,that is a structure to perform the claimed function.id.at,dist.lexis at.thus,the court held that the jury was justified in finding infringement by the barbed nozzled earphones.id.
in a separate opinion released on the same day,the district court denied shure motion for jmol of invalidity of the and patents.validity opinion,wl,dist.lexis.shure had asserted invalidity based on patents carlisle,re gardner,killion,and rock.shure had argued that the asserted claims were obvious based on one or more of three combinations of prior art carlisle and gardner,carlisle and killion,and killion and rock.id.at,dist.lexis at.the court reasoned that,despite those three combinations of prior art,and given that no other combinations were presented in detail,the jury had had sufficient evidence to find the asserted claims nonobvious.id.at,dist.lexis at.according to the court,the parties had presented conflicting,credible evidence on whether the references contained all of the limitations of the claims,on motivation to combine,and on secondary considerations of nonobviousness.id.at,dist.lexis at.for example,hearing components expert,chasin,had rebutted the testimony of shure expert,wood,by stating that the prior art combinations were missing certain claim limitations.id.at,dist.lexis at.similarly,chasin had rebutted wood testimony on motivation to combine,testimony the court found rather sparse,and lacking in specific details.id.at,dist.lexis at.further,according to the court,the jury could have weighed the conflicting experts credibility and found chasin more credible,especially given his greater familiarity with the prior art devices and personal knowledge of killion,the inventor of one of the prior art devices.id.at,dist.lexis at.
in addition,in january,the district court determined that the and patents were not subject to a laches defense.the court found that shure had not pointed to any evidence,other than evidence of delay,that was missing but could have been found if hearing components had brought its suit earlier.id.at shure laches defense would have been better if hearing components had filed earlier and there had been no laches.if there had been no laches,then shure would have been able to prove laches easier.it becomes almost circular.on economic prejudice,the court first discussed the presumption of economic prejudice that arises after a delay in filing suit.id.at.in this case,hearing components had waited exactly six years minus one day,from the date it should have known of shure alleged infringement to the date it filed suit.id.the court thus declined to presume economic prejudice but also found that,even if shure had been given the presumption,shure had not incurred any losses by the delay in filing suit.id.at.instead,the court noted,shure damages case had pointed out how little shure thought it benefitted from the patented technology,when shure had known about the patents long before suit was filed.id.the court thus found that shure had shown no economic prejudice and was not entitled to prevail on its laches defense.
hearing components timely appealed from the district court decisions finding the patent indefinite and granting jmol of noninfringement of the and patents with respect to the earphones.shure from the court denial of jmol of noninfringement of the and patents with respect to the earphones and its denial of jmol of invalidity and determination of no laches for those patents.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
a.the patent 
hearing components argues that the district court erred in finding claims and of the patent indefinite.according to hearing components,the phrase readily installed and replaced by a user is not ambiguous,as a person of ordinary skill in the art would know that it means simple to install,without tools or specialized skills.hearing components contends that the specification disparages the prior art that required a tool and touts that the invention requires no tools.according to hearing components,the specification does not suggest that a person must have a certain level of physical disability to be the claimed user,and although the patent describes that the invention benefits older persons,the patent does not distinguish the prior art on that basis.
hearing components also argues that the readily installed phrase is not a claim limitation that required construction at all,as it is in the preamble and is not an essential component of the invention.according to hearing components,the phrase is duplicative of other language in the claim,and the prosecution history does not clearly distinguish the invention on the basis of the preamble language.
shure responds that the readily installed phrase is indefinite,as nothing in the specification or prosecution history of the patent clarifies the claim scope.according to shure,the use of subjective terms such as readily renders a claim indefinite.shure asserts that it presented unrebutted testimony that the art has no commonly understood definition of the word readily.shure also argues that the readily installed term is a claim limitation at least because hearing components relied on it to distinguish prior art during prosecution and in the specification.
finally,shure asserts that hearing components never presented the claim construction to the district court that it now proposes on appeal,as it previously argued for the definition easily placed on and taken off the tube.according to shure,hearing components also first suggested that the limitation was part of the preamble in a footnote to its claim construction reply brief.hearing components replies that there was no waiver,as its proposed construction is similar to the one presented to the district court.hearing components also replies that the court specifically considered whether the phrase was a limitation or part of the preamble.
we agree with hearing components that the claim limitation readily installed and replaced by a user is not indefinite.a determination that a patent claim is invalid for failing to meet the definiteness requirement in,paragraph is a legal question reviewed de novo.young lumenis.a patent is presumed to be valid,so shure faces an evidentiary burden of clear and convincing evidence to show facts supporting a conclusion of invalidity.id.at.
as an initial matter,the readily installed phrase is a claim limitation,as shure argues.a preamble to a claim may or may not be limiting,depending on the circumstances.in considering whether a preamble limits a claim,the preamble is analyzed to ascertain whether it states a necessary and defining aspect of the invention,or is simply an introduction to the general field of the claim.computer docking station dell,quotation marks omitted.a term is often limiting when the patentee has relied on it during prosecution to distinguish prior art,as such reliance demonstrates that the feature disclosed in the preamble is necessary to the patentability of the claim.see jansen rexall sundown.in this case,hearing components clearly relied on the readily installed phrase during prosecution to distinguish prior art.see the moser et al device clearly lacks a disposable wax guard that is readily installed and replaced by a user as expressly called for in applicant claim.the membrane in the siemens device is not readily installed and replaced indeed,it apparently remains in place,where it is cleaned ultrasonically.in the oliveira device,the sleeve is certainly not intended to be readily installed and replaced,as specifically called for by applicant claim.we do not consider the readily installed phrase to be duplicative of other language in the claim.although the claim recites a membrane that permits a user to position a guard over an outlet port,the readily installed phrase refers to the entire wax guard and therefore is more limiting.we thus conclude that the readily installed phrase is a claim limitation.
however,hearing components correctly asserts that the limitation is not indefinite.under,second paragraph,the specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention,which is known as the definiteness requirement.claims are considered indefinite when they are not amenable to construction or are insolubly ambiguous.thus,the definiteness of claim terms depends on whether those terms can be given any reasonable meaning.indefiniteness requires a determination whether those skilled in the art would understand what is claimed.young,at internal citations and quotations marks omitted.the purpose of the definiteness requirement is to ensure that the claims,as interpreted in view of the written description,adequately perform their function of notifying the public of the scope of the patentee right to exclude.honeywell int l,int l trade comm n,quotation marks omitted.
here,the district court noted that the patentee has used a word of degree,readily.a patentee need not define his invention with mathematical precision in order to comply with the definiteness requirement.invitrogen biocrest,quotation marks omitted.not all terms of degree are indefinite.however,the specification must provide some standard for measuring that degree.datamize,llc plumtree software,quotation marks omitted.although readily does not refer to a mathematical measure of degree,in datamize,we addressed the purely subjective claim term aesthetically pleasing and stated that,as with terms of degree,a court must determine whether the patent specification supplies some standard for measuring the scope of the phrase.thus,we next consult the written description.id.
as the district court correctly noted,the written description of the patent states that one of the advantages of the wax guard is that it requires no tools for installation or removal.patent.indeed,that statement appears in the context of the following two sentences it is simple to install,easy to remove,and convenient to replace,even for older persons.the guard is inexpensive and requires no tools for installation or removal.id.assuming the patentee intended the second sentence to elaborate on the first sentence,a wax guard that is inexpensive and requires no tools for installation or removal will be simple to install,easy to remove,and convenient to replace,even for older persons.id.that assumption is supported by the repetition of variations on the words install and remove in both sentences.furthermore,given that the words readily,simpl y,eas ily,and convenient ly are all synonyms,the language of those two sentences in the specification closely tracks the language of the disputed claim term,readily installed and replaced by a user.thus,the written description gives a clear example of a wax guard that is readily installed and replaced by a user one that is inexpensive and requires no tools for installation or removal.
the district court was also correct in noting that the specification discusses the phrase readily installed and replaced by a user in the context of prior art.the specification disparages prior art guards that were not readily installed and replaced.it states that some prior art inventions have mechanically mounted screens or other filters beyond the sound delivery tube opening,but removal and replacement has been difficult,especially since persons wearing hearing aids are often advanced in years and unable either to see clearly enough or to perform fine physical actions well enough to replace the filters.patent.by negative implication,the patent thus explains that a filter that must be mounted beyond the sound delivery tube opening is not readily installed and replaced.
those two examples are the only examples or discussion provided by the specification of the readily installed phrase.although the court cited parts of the written description discussing prior products that needed a tool or solvent to remove wax buildup,claim construction opinion,slip op.at citing patent,that discussion is irrelevant to the wax guard because the tools and solvents that removed wax buildup were not used for install ing or replac ing a wax guard on the prior art products they were simply used to clean parts of the products.see patent discussing a hearing aid through which solvent may be pumped to remove wax buildup id.at discussing prior art patents that discussed previous prior art,but not giving a reason for the apparent difficulty in replacing previous prior art wax filters after they are soiled and describing only a reusable wax guard in which ear wax is removed by pushing a tool through a cross passage.
the district court found the readily installed phrase indefinite because the written description did not address the level of physical disability required by the terms older persons and persons advanced in years who are unable either to see clearly enough or to perform fine physical actions well enough to replace the filters.claim construction opinion,slip op.at.however,the specification is clear in its examples.those examples apply,irrespective of the age or level of disability in the user,because the patent merely uses age and disability as possible factors exacerbating the difficulty for some users.see id.r emoval and replacement has been difficult,especially since persons wearing hearing aids are often advanced in years emphases added id.at it is simple to install,easy to remove,and convenient to replace,even for older persons.emphasis added.the examples are intended to apply to all users.the specification states that a guard that is inexpensive and requires no tools for installation or removal,id.at,is readily installed and replaced,and that a filter that must be mounted beyond the sound delivery tube opening,id.at,is not readily installed and replaced.thus,the court was incorrect in its conclusion that the specification provides no boundaries as to what readily installed and replaced by a user can be.claim construction opinion,slip op.at.the specification clearly supplies some standard for measuring the scope of the phrase.datamize,at.
finally,we need not address shure waiver argument,as we decline to construe the claim in the first instance.we therefore reverse the district court determination that claims and of the patent are indefinite and remand for adjudication of the issues relating to the patent.the court can use its own discretion as to whether further construction of the readily installed phrase is required,but the distinction in the specification between the ability of a layperson user to install the wax guard without tools,on the one hand,and the necessity of a professional using tools,on the other hand,requires reversal of the indefiniteness holding.
b.the and patents 
infringement 
hearing components contends that the district court erred in granting jmol of noninfringement of the and patents by shure earphones,and shure contends that the court erred in denying jmol of noninfringement by shure earphones.specifically,hearing components argues that the jury properly found that shure straight nozzles infringe as an equivalent structure to the disclosed structures of screw threads and a attachment.according to hearing components,the straight nozzle contains sufficient outer portion of the nozzle which deforms the perform the attachment function.hearing components argues that shure chose the outside diameter of the nozzle specifically to maintain attachment with the duct and sleeve.hearing components also argues that the jury heard substantial evidence to support an infringement finding,as hearing components expert,chasin,testified that those of ordinary skill in the art would have known that a straight nozzle was interchangeable with a screw or a attachment.hearing components asserts that it also showed that a broad range of equivalents was contemplated and claimed and that shure structures easily fit within that range.
shure responds that no reasonable jury could have found that shure earphones use the claimed attaching or fastening means.according to shure,chasin merely testified that he believed the structures to be equivalent but made no particularized comparison between the structures disclosed in the and patents and shure nozzle.further,shure argues that the inventors of the and patents were aware of attachment structure alternatives to screw threads and connections but chose not to disclose them,favoring a finding of noninfringement.according to shure,the inventors distinguished a frictional attachment in the patent and during prosecution.shure asserts that there is no broad range of equivalents,as the only relevant comparison is between the accused structure and the disclosed structure,and hearing components never even argued that shure nozzles are equivalent to adhesive.
shure further argues that substantial evidence could not support the jury conclusion of infringement because shure straight nozzles have no positive attachment to the sleeves.shure asserts that the attaching means limitation requires a female structure in the duct of the foam sleeve that mates with a male structure on the outer surface of the nozzle.thus,according to shure,the straight nozzles do not attach in the same way as the disclosed structures.in reply to that argument,hearing components argues that neither the claims nor the court construction has any requirement of female matching.
as for shure argument that the court erred in denying jmol of noninfringement by shure products,shure specifically argues that no reasonable jury could have found that shure earphones use an equivalent to the disclosed structures for the claimed attaching or fastening means.according to shure,the same reasons that straight nozzles do not infringe also apply to shure barbed nozzles.like the straight nozzles,the barbed nozzles also work through a friction fit,and the foam sleeves are the same,with no female mating structure.
hearing components responds that,in addition to the reasons it gave for the straight nozzle infringing,the barbed nozzle has an additional attaching or fastening structure in the barb.thus,hearing components asserts that the court properly denied jmol of noninfringement by shure products.
we agree with hearing components that substantial evidence supported the jury verdict that both shure straight and products infringed the asserted claims.we review a grant or denial of jmol without deference to the district court.ericsson,harris,see cambridge toxicology group exnicios,cir.entry of jmol is appropriate only if the jury verdict is unsupported by substantial evidence or premised on incorrect legal standards.odetics,storage tech,see cambridge toxicology group,at.
the jury found that shure products infringed the asserted claims.a determination of infringement requires a analysis.first,the court determines the scope and meaning of the patent claims asserted second,the properly construed claims are compared to the allegedly infringing device.cybor fas,en banc citations omitted.step one,claim construction,is an issue of law that we review de novo.id.at.in this case,the parties do not dispute the court claim construction,in which the court determined that the attaching or fastening means limitations are written in format and that the corresponding structures are screw threads,a attachment,a layer of adhesive,and their equivalents.
step two,determining w hether an accused device infringes a,claim as an equivalent,is a question of fact.odetics,at.in order to establish infringement of a term,hearing components must show that the relevant structure in the accused device perform s the identical function recited in the claim and is identical or equivalent to the corresponding structure in the specification.id.at citations omitted.the assertedly equivalent structure must perform the claimed function in substantially the same way to achieve substantially the same result as the corresponding structure described in the specification.id.at.we agree with hearing components that the jury permissibly found that the interference fit of shure straight nozzle is equivalent to the screw threads or attachment disclosed in the specification.as hearing components points out,the outer surface of the nozzle,which maintains an attachment with the duct through friction,is itself a structure.contrary to the district court jmol decision,we conclude that the claimed attaching or fastening means does not require a protuberance,snap connection,adhesion,or any other positive attachment with the duct.infringement opinion,wl at,dist.lexis at.indeed,the only positive attachment provided by an adhesive,which the court found to be a corresponding structure,is increased friction.
we have stated that e vidence of known interchangeability between structure in the accused device and the disclosed structure has been considered an important factor in determining equivalence.ims,haas automation.as hearing components demonstrates,the jury heard evidence that an interference fit was known at the time of the invention to be interchangeable with screw threads or a attachment.see oliveira,one of the inventors of the and patents,testified while looking at notes from the time of invention that,in the course of patenting the attaching or fastening means,the inventors considered an interference fit,a screw thread,a barb,a socket,and adhesives as different ways of putting the sleeve on the nozzle practically and taking it off.chasin testified that shure straight nozzle is not significantly different or substantially different than a screw thread t he patent holders when they wrote the patent contemplated a very broad patent with many different possible implementations,many possible means.and we already heard that not even all of them were placed in the patent itself.shure attempts to convert known interchangeability into a factor weighing against equivalence by stating that the inventors were aware of alternatives to the disclosed structures but chose not to disclose them.however,that is necessarily the case with known interchangeability,which nevertheless can support a finding of equivalence.
we further agree with hearing components that the straight nozzle performs the claimed function in substantially the same way to achieve substantially the same result as a screw thread or a attachment.odetics,at.neither party disputes that the straight nozzle performs the same function of attaching the end of the duct to the ear piece in such a way that it can easily be removed and discarded by the user so that another sleeve can be attached to achieve substantially the same result.infringement opinion,wl at,dist.lexis at.shure asserts that the straight nozzle does not perform the function in substantially the same way as the disclosed structures because shure straight nozzle has no male structure on its outer surface that mates with a female structure within the duct to form a positive attachment instead the nozzle is smooth.however,as stated above,no positive male structure is required by the attaching or fastening means indeed,adhesive is one of the disclosed structures,and it has no positive male structure.for the same reason,a female structure in the sleeve is also not required by the claims.shure cites our opinion in cortland line orvis,for the proposition that a mere interference fit does not connect in substantially the same way,threadably lock and that an interference fit differs significantly from a threaded connection.however,an infringement analysis is,and in cortland line,unlike in this case,one of the desired results was preventing rotation.id.additionally,in that case,our review of the record disclose d no evidence suggesting structural equivalency.id.in this case,on the other hand,hearing components has presented such evidence in the form of testimony.
as for shure argument that the inventors distinguished a frictional attachment in the patent specification and during prosecution,looking at the specification and prosecution history,we disagree.shure points to the statement in the specification that gardner,a prior art reference,does not indicate how the plug is prevented from remaining in the ear canal if the tubular tip portion is accidentally dislodged or simply pulled out.patent patent.shure asserts that gardner uses a frictional attachment,so the patentees necessarily disavowed the use of a frictional attachment.however,such a reading strains the specification language as well as the language of gardner.gardner does not describe how the tip portion is held onto the sound conducting tube.the quoted language from the specification of the and patents therefore simply requires an attachment that is strong enough to prevent the sleeve from remaining in the ear canal when the nozzle is removed,and it says nothing about a frictional attachment.similarly,shure points to a statement in the prosecution history that 
a pplicants ear piece component has means on the exterior surface of the connecting portion for disposably attaching the duct of the sleeve to the connecting portion.patent to thomas at best only identifies a detachable receiving,line of thomas of the cushion on ear plug.the reliability of such detachable receiving is not a concern of thomas because thomas cushion is intended to rest against the ear of the listener,not be compressed and inserted into the ear canal of the listener.applicants need a disposable attachment in order to minimize detachment from the ear piece component of their compressed sleeve inside the ear canal.
emphases in original.as with gardner,the applicants simply disparaged thomas lack of attention to the attachment between the nozzle and the sleeve.the applicants did not disparage a frictional attachment or any other specific type of attachment.
finally,because we have determined that substantial evidence supported the jury verdict that shure earphones infringe the asserted claims,we agree with the district court that substantial evidence also supported the jury verdict with respect to the earphones.indeed,the barbed nozzles have an additional structure of a barb for performing the attaching or fastening function.
we therefore conclude that substantial evidence supported the jury verdict of infringement for both types of products.we reverse the district court grant of jmol that shure products do not infringe,and we affirm the court denial of jmol that shure products infringe.
shure argues that the district court should have granted jmol that the and patents were obvious based on one or more of three combinations of prior art carlisle and gardner,carlisle and killion,and killion and rock.according to shure,the carlisle reference teaches all of the limitations of the claims except the use of foam,which is taught in gardner and killion.shure argues that carlisle teaches an ear piece inside the ear canal and a flexible connected duct.also,shure contends that killion teaches all of the limitations except the use of mating male and female connecting features,which are taught by carlisle.shure argues that killion discloses a hearing aid with an ear piece including a short section of tubing,a flexible duct,and a sleeve.further,according to shure,rock teaches the use of a barb,like shure barbed nozzle,so shure is practicing the prior art.shure asserts that hearing components never disputed the teachings of gardner or rock,and that chasin testimony distinguishing carlisle and killion contradicts the express teachings of those references.
shure also contends that the district court erred by requiring a motivation to combine prior art references,contrary to ksr int l teleflex,d.according to shure,it would have been obvious and predictable to make the above modifications to the prior art.shure asserts that one of ordinary skill would have known that using a foam sleeve with carlisle would improve sound isolation and comfort.further,according to shure,oliveira,one of the inventors of the and patents,admitted that by,others had used foam in earphones.finally,shure argues that secondary considerations of nonobviousness suggest that the patents would have been obvious.according to shure,there is no nexus between commercial success and the patented products.indeed,shure argues,the inventors admitted that their product was commercially unappealing.shure also asserts that there is no evidence of unexpected results.
hearing components responds that carlisle does not suggest a sound isolating seal or a sleeve that is replaced by the user rather than a professional,and that shure offered no credible evidence that such modifications were sought.hearing components also asserts that carlisle ear piece is not inside the ear canal.according to hearing components,killion is not even a hearing device but a diagnostic device operated by a professional,and it has no ear piece inserted into a sleeve.
hearing components also argues that the district court jury instructions were in accordance with ksr,and shure did not object to them.hearing components asserts that the court,in its opinion,similarly considered recognition of the problem and predictability of the results.according to hearing components,shure provided little analysis for its position,and hearing components expert,chasin,had far more experience than shure expert.hearing components argues that,other than conclusory testimony,shure offered no evidence to show predictability of the results of combining the prior art.indeed,hearing components argues,the inventors were not addressing any known problem.according to hearing components,no one expected that a duct would prevent the sleeve from remaining in the ear when the hearing aid was removed.further,hearing components asserts that there was no evidence of motivation to combine prior art references.finally,hearing components argues that there was considerable evidence of secondary considerations of nonobviousness that supported the jury verdict,including a successful commercial licensing program.according to hearing components,its licensing fees declined significantly after the patents expired,showing a nexus between the patents and the value of the patented device.
we agree with hearing components that the district court correctly denied jmol,upholding the jury verdict that the and patents were not obvious.we review the jury conclusions on obviousness,a question of law,without deference,and the underlying findings of fact,whether explicit or implicit within the verdict,for substantial evidence.johns hopkins datascope,quotations omitted.we agree with the district court that the jury heard substantial evidence to support a finding of nonobviousness.as the court emphasized,in order for a party to meet its burden of proving obviousness by clear and convincing evidence,the specific evidence must have been presented to the jury.validity opinion,wl at,dist.lexis at.as the court found,the jury heard conflicting testimony from chasin and wood on whether the prior art references contained all of the claim limitations,on motivation to combine,and on secondary considerations of nonobviousness.id.at,dist.lexis at.
for example,chasin testified that carlisle device was not inserted into the ear canal,but instead just goes into the outside or the proximal end of the eartip.id.at,dist.lexis at quoting footnote omitted.shure does not dispute that the asserted claims all require an ear piece inside the ear canal but argues that carlisle teaches such an ear piece in its small ear tip duct fitting and engaging the entrance portion of the ear canal and its claimed duct extensions that are designed to form part of a hollow ear tip member shaped and arranged to fit into the ear canal.carlisle id.at.however,chasin testified that the actual ear piece of carlisle was not designed to sit inside the ear canal,but instead only the molded duct went into the ear canal.indeed,as shown in figure of carlisle,the outlet duct does not extend through the molded duct to sit inside the ear canal.carlisle.as chasin explained,at the time carlisle device was invented in the,there would have been no reason to place the ear piece,including the outlet duct,into the ear canal because it was conventional not to have an earplug that would have to sea
