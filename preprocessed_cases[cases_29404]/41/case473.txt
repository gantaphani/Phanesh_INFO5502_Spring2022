we here confront an issue of first impression whether the government,pursuant to the supreme court decision in united states sell,can have a sufficiently important interest in forcibly medicating a defendant to restore his mental competency and render him fit to proceed with sentencing.under the facts presented in this case,we answer that question in the affirmative and we will affirm.
cruz was arrested in august of and indicted on one count of assaulting,resisting,or impeding social security administration ssa employees,a violation of count i,and two counts of threatening a federal law enforcement officer,violations of respectively,count ii and count iii.the district court granted cruz a judgment of acquittal on count i,and a jury returned guilty verdicts on count ii and count iii.
in august of,after the district court received but before cruz could raise objections to the investigation report psr,the government raised concern about and moved for a determination of cruz competency its motion was granted,and cruz was evaluated by william ryan,a forensic psychologist working for the federal bureau of prisons bop.ryan,as reflected in a report submitted to the district court,concluded that cruz was mentally incompetent because he suffered from schizophrenic disorder,bipolar type.upon receipt of ryan report,the district court scheduled a competency hearing.following that hearing,it concluded that cruz was mentally incompetent and found that he could not proceed with sentencing.
the district court received a second competency evaluation and report from the bop in may of,which was by forensic psychologist angela weaver and bop staff psychologist robert lucking.weaver and lucking concurred with ryan diagnosis,noted cruz ongoing refusal to take medication recommended by bop personnel,and concluded that without such medication cruz would remain mentally incompetent.they also concluded that there is a substantial probability that his competency can be restored with a period of forced medication.app.the report included a proposed treatment plan and a request that the government seek a court order under sell,authorizing the bop to medicate cruz involuntarily.
the government filed a motion on may,seeking an order authorizing the bop to medicate cruz against his will.see app.the papers filed by the government included,inter alia,its omnibus motion and brief,related exhibits,and,pursuant to the district court local rules,a certificate indicating that cruz lawyer was contacted and expressed cruz in the motion.the omnibus motion and brief made clear that the government sought two forms of relief first,a hearing pursuant to sell and second,following the hearing,a court order authorizing forced medication.
the district court promptly scheduled an evidentiary hearing,which was continued three times twice at cruz request and ultimately held on october.in the intervening five months,the period following the may,filing of the motion and preceding the october,hearing cruz failed to file a petition,motion,brief,or other document indicating that he opposed the government ultimate request for relief.
the district court began the october,hearing by informing the parties that it was held pursuant to the supreme court decision in sell united states and providing the sell criteria sort of as a backdrop to the testimony that would be presented.app.it reminded the parties that involuntary medication of nondangerous individuals should only occur when four conditions are satisfied and recited those factors for their benefit 
first,the court must find that important governmental interests are at stake.second,the court must conclude that involuntary medication will significantly further those interests,and this second factor includes determining that medication is substantially likely to render the defendant competent and that the treatment is unlikely to have side effects that impair the defendant ability to assist counsel.
third,the court must determine that involuntary medication is necessary to further those interests because alternative,less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve the same results.and fourth,the court must find that involuntary medication is medically appropriate,or,in other words,in the patient medical interests in light of his medical condition.
the first factor,whether the government has advanced sufficiently important interests to justify forcible medication,is a question of law,and the remaining three factors are factual questions which the government must prove with clear and convincing evidence 
so in light of those factors and that background,i turn to the government and ask if it would like to present testimonial evidence in support of its motion.
weaver and lucking testified for the government,which introduced,among other documents,both the psr and the may report.cruz,who was represented by the federal public defender,did not object to the introduction of either of those documents.however,he noted through counsel that he did necessarily agree with that guideline range.app.shortly thereafter,again acting through counsel,he declined the opportunity to present evidence at the hearing and stated that he did not have any argument at that juncture.app.
the district court took the matter under advisement and two days later entered the order that is at issue on appeal.as there illustrated,the district court considered the circumstances of cruz case and concluded that all four of the sell criteria were satisfied.its analysis of the first criterion,which is central to this appeal,rested on two legs.
first,the district court concluded that a sufficiently important government interest was at stake because r endering a defendant competent for sentencing enables not only the government,but also the court and the defendant himself,to ensure that the defendant receives a sentence that accurately reflects the nature of his offense and his individual circumstances.app.citing united states wood,d.it further explained 
neither the supreme court nor the third circuit ha s promulgated a test to determine the seriousness of a crime,but other circuits have looked to the statutory maximum mandated for the offense or the applicable guidelines range.the third circuit in united states grape,cir,determined that under either rubric,the defendant was accused of serious crimes because the crimes had statutory mandatory minimums of and years and the defendant had a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.
in the case sub judice,the draft investigation report provisionally identifies a year statutory maximum for each count and a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.certainly,pursuant to the criteria set forth in grape,cruz was convicted of serious crimes and the government possesses a strong interest in rendering him competent for sentencing.
app.citations omitted.
second,the district court found that no special circumstances lessened the importance of the government interest.it noted that sell identified two examples of such special circumstances when the defendant has already been incarcerated for a significant period of time or whether there is a possibility of future civil commitment.app.but it concluded that neither of those circumstances were present here.
with respect to the length of cruz incarceration,the court concluded that he had not been incarcerated for a significant amount of time.it cited and discussed grape,where this court noted that the defendant had been incarcerated for approximately three and half years but reasoned that in light of his potential sentence,he would still need to serve a majority of his sentence if convicted.id.citing grape,at.the grape court concluded as a matter of law that that defendant had not been incarcerated for a significant amount of time.by analogy,the district court reached the same conclusion here.it reasoned that cruz,who had been incarcerated for only two years,might still need to serve the majority of his sentence.when reaching that conclusion,the district court relied principally upon the psr,which provisionally identifie d a year statutory maximum for each count and a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.id.
with respect to the possibility of future civil confinement,the district court examined the statutes that might authorize such confinement,and,and noted each statute prerequisites to civil confinement.importantly,required a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another while.required a showing of clear and present danger or harm to others or to himself.in light of those prerequisites,the district court made note of record evidence that called into question the likelihood that cruz could be civilly committed.although the psr indicate d that cruz has a lengthy criminal history involving numerous acts of violence and threats of violence,and although e ntries from the bop psychology data system indicat ed that cruz ha d continued to threaten violence against others,t he may evaluation explicitly state d that cruz ha d not posed a threat to himself or others and does not pose a risk of committing serious harm to others.app.the district court characterized the conflict in the record as u ncertainty surrounding the likelihood that cruz could be civilly committed in the future and concluded that such uncertainty did not materially diminish and clearly did not undermine the government interest in restoring cruz mental competency to render him fit to proceed with sentencing.app.
cruz moved for a stay of the district court order on october.in the brief filed in support of that motion stay brief,he conceded that the government has an interest in sentencing a convicted defendant.supplemental app.however,he argued that the district court erred in finding that special circumstances did not lessen the importance of the government interest.
cruz first argued that the district court erred when it concluded that he had not been incarcerated for a significant amount of time.he disagreed with the district court reliance on the psr,and he argued that such reliance was inappropriate because he had not yet had an opportunity to object to the guidelines,argue for relevant departures,or raise other considerations under a.specifically,he argued that it was unclear whether he needed to serve a majority of his sentence.supplemental app.
he also argued,with specific reference to both and,that it is quite possible that he could be civilly committed in the future.id.he failed,however,to flesh out that argument by either developing it further or citing relevant legal sources.
the government did not oppose cruz stay motion,which the district court granted.thereafter,cruz filed this appeal.
we pause here to restate the arguments that cruz presents on appeal and to draw a roadmap for our analysis.cruz argues that the district court erred when it authorized the bop to forcibly administer antipsychotic medication because the first sell criterion,which concerns the importance of the government interest in restoring his competency,was not adequately established.he raises five arguments that bear on that issue.
first,he argues that the government interest in restoring his competency is less than that shown in other cases,grape and sell because,here,the government merely seeks to restore his mental competency for sentencing.he thus seeks to distinguish his case from the vast majority of cases under sell,where the government seeks to restore a defendant competency before trial has begun.he then argues that the government lacks an important interest here because the crimes at issue,violations of,are less serious than the crimes that were at issue in grape and sell.
cruz next raises arguments that concern the district court reference to and,in some sense,reliance on the psr.he contends that such reliance was misplaced because he had not yet had an opportunity to object to the guidelines range calculated in the psr,which was based on a enhancement.he also finds fault with the district court for relying on the psr because it does not take into account his mental health status,which could serve as a basis for either a downward departure or variance.
finally,he states that it is very likely that he will be civilly committed to a suitable facility for care and treatment and that such likelihood constitutes a special circumstance that undermines the government interest.
the government responds that cruz failed to raise these issues before the district court and urges us to review those issues only for plain error.fed.crim.b.it also asserts that no error was committed,plain or otherwise,in the sell proceedings before the district court.
our discussion will begin with the threshold inquiry raised by the government the appropriateness of plain error review.we thereafter turn our attention to the standard of review,which we have not had cause to examine since our decision in grape.finally,we will examine the merits of each of cruz arguments 
the district court had jurisdiction under because cruz was charged with violations of federal law.it is that we have jurisdiction under the collateral order exception to.see,grape,at.
cruz disputes the government invocation of plain error review on three grounds.first,he argues that plain error review can not rise here under federal rule of criminal procedure b because the appeal does not concern a purely criminal issue.second,he argues that the government invocation of plan error review overlooks significant factual and procedural aspects of this case that belie the application of such a standard.reply br.at.finally,he contends that the arguments at issue raised on appeal were preserved in the stay brief.
upon full consideration of cruz arguments,we have concluded that they have little merit.for the reasons that follow,we will review this appeal only for plain error.
cruz first argues against the government invocation of plain error review because the federal rules of criminal procedure neither explicitly recognize nor provide a framework for objections in sell proceedings.he thus distinguishes the instant appeal from an appeal from,for example,denial of traditional motions.he also argues that the absence of such framework precludes the forfeiture of arguments that he could have raised but did not raise in the district court sell proceedings.
cruz arguments invite consideration of traditional notions of issue preservation,forfeiture,and waiver.forfeiture,of course,is not exactly the same as waiver rights may be forfeited without being waived.see freytag comm r,scalia,concurring in part and dissenting in part.the distinction between those terms is particularly important in criminal appeals.we will review issues and arguments that were forfeited before the district court but,as a general rule,we will not examine those that were knowingly and intelligently waived.see,gov t of the rosa,cir w here there was forfeiture,we apply a plain error analysis where there was waiver,we do not.citation omitted.
the supreme court considered the differences between forfeiture and waiver in united states olano.there,in the context of a criminal appeal,the court rejected the application of waiver doctrines to an issue that was merely forfeited during trial and presented for the first time on appeal.see united states olano.it noted that a rigid and undeviating judicially declared practice under which courts of review would invariably and under all circumstances decline to consider all questions that were forfeited would be out of harmony with the rules of fundamental justice.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.although in theory it could be argued that i f the question was not presented to the trial court no error was committed by the trial court and hence there is nothing to review,the court rejected that theory,noting that it was not the theory that rule b adopts.id.at first alteration in original citation omitted.
the supreme court further explained in olano that plain error includes any d eviation from a legal rule that is not explicitly,knowingly,and intelligently waived,through a guilty plea made pursuant to rule.see at.the parties do not assert and the record does not support a finding of such waiver here.thus,the plain language of rule b appears to belie cruz argument,as that rule applies to any plain error that affects substantial rights.b 
finally,it is noteworthy that this court review for plain error would comport with other courts application of that standard to similar appeals.see dillon,at recognizing forfeiture of argument on the first sell criterion and related special circumstances,and reviewing appeal for plain error united states baldovinos,cir.
cruz next argues that any assertion of forfeiture overlooks significant factual and procedural aspects of this case that belie the application of plain error review.reply br.at.specifically,he argues that his appellate arguments warrant de novo review because he lacked an opportunity to oppose the government motion.essentially,his argument tracks rule b of the federal rules of criminal procedure,which provides in pertinent part if a party does not have an opportunity to object to a ruling or order,the absence of an objection does not later prejudice that party.fed.crim.b.
we see little merit in this argument.review of the district court proceedings plainly demonstrates that cruz enjoyed but failed to avail himself of several opportunities to oppose the government motion.
cruz initially faults the government for asserting that he failed to respond to its motion.this aspect of his argument has two parts.first,he cites the government certificate of i,the certificate included in its motion papers as evidence of his opposition.second,and of purportedly g reater significance,he notes that the district court scheduled an evidentiary hearing only six days after the government filed its motion.because the district court granted the government some of the relief that it sought,he posits that there existed no basis for a response.
we find no merit in the argument that relies on the government certificate of.that certificate was filed pursuant to the district court local rules,which require the movant to certify that it sought concurrence in the motion from each party,and that it ha d been either given or denied.by filing the certificate,the government met its burden.but the government filing can not be construed as meeting cruz burden of filing meaningful opposition.this conclusion rests on both the district court adoption and interpretation of its local rules.the district court has made clear that a party opposing a motion must file an opposition brief.see med.care,am.renal,wl,at,ggis ins,lincoln ins,wl,at.indeed,middle district local rule provides the framework for opposition and states that a ny party who fails to comply with this rule shall be deemed not to oppose such motion.emphasis added.
we similarly find no merit in cruz argument that the district court calendaring of an evidentiary hearing obviated the need for opposition papers.although the district court quickly granted the government scheduling request,the government ultimate goal was clear it sought an order authorizing the bop to forcibly medicate cruz.cruz was on notice of the government ultimate request for relief,and he thus was or should have been aware of his obligation to oppose or be deemed to support it.
cruz also argues that he was not obliged to present either evidence or argument at the sell hearing.in some sense,he is correct.the government bore the ultimate burden of proof under sell,and cruz was free to leave the government to its proofs.but insofar as cruz ignored the local rules and chose not to present argument at the conclusion of the sell hearing,he made that choice at his peril.cabán hernández philip morris usa,cir.
notwithstanding his earlier arguments,cruz argues that the stay brief preserved the same arguments that he now raises on appeal.we disagree.the stay brief was incapable of preserving the arguments that cruz could have raised earlier but did not raise.see mick haig prods.does,cir.that conclusion would hold true even if the stay brief was treated as favoring both a stay and reconsideration on the merits.see united states dupree,cir.and it applies with added force here,where the timely raising of the issue would have permitted the parties to develop a factual record.gass,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
we now address the standard of review and the substantive arguments that cruz advances on appeal.
as noted above,the first sell criterion concerns the government interest in forcibly medicating a defendant to restore his mental competency.to justify such action,a court must find that important governmental interests are at stake.sell,at.a court conclusions regarding the importance of the government interest necessarily involve balancing the seriousness of the crimes at issue with s pecial circumstances that may lessen the importance of that interest.id.examples of special circumstances include the possibility that the defendant has already been confined for a significant amount of time for which he would receive credit toward any sentence ultimately imposed and the likelihood,given t he defendant failure to take drugs voluntarily,that he will face lengthy confinement in an institution for the mentally ill that would diminish the risks that ordinarily attach to freeing without punishment one who has committed a serious crime.id.
the sell court did not allocate burdens of proof or establish standards for appellate review for any of the four sell criteria.thus,we addressed those issues for the first time in grape,and we concluded that the first sell criterion is a question of law subject to plenary review the second,third,and fourth sell criteria are questions of fact that are subject to clear error review and the government bears the burden of proof on factual questions by clear and convincing evidence.f d at our discussion of special circumstances in that case was limited both by and to the arguments raised by the parties.
since grape was issued,at least two other federal appellate courts have further refined the burdens of proof and standard of review that apply to the first sell criterion.first,the court of appeals for the sixth circuit announced a standard that recognizes the defendant interest in bringing special circumstances to light.see united states mikulich,cir while the ultimate burden of proving an important interest remains with the government,the defendant must demonstrate that the special circumstances of his case undermine the government interest shortly thereafter,the court of appeals for the circuit clarified the related standard of review,ruling that it would review de novo the district court conclusion that the government has an important interest but qualifying that t o the extent that the district court determination under the first prong of sell depends on findings of fact,it would review those findings under a standard.dillon,at citations omitted.
insofar as the grape court discussed the first sell criterion,it had little reason to consider it as a mixed question of both law and fact,expound upon the related standards of review,or address a shifting allocation of the burdens of proof.there was no dispute in that case that the defendant had been incarcerated for years and faced mandatory minimum sentences of ten and fifteen years.further,the facts of that case led the court to decline to reach whether the defendant potential for indefinite civil confinement on the facts prior to his harper medication would have sufficed under the first sell factor to overcome the government stated interest.grape,at 
we will thus adopt both the mikulich standard and the mixed standard of review set forth in dillon.such adoption builds on the standard set forth by the grape court and clarifies the extent to which defendants bear responsibility for proving the existence of special recognized by the supreme court as inherently.see sell,at courts must consider the facts of the individual case in evaluating the government interest.
cruz earlier conceded,in the stay brief,that the government has an interest in sentencing a convicted defendant.supplemental app.similarly,he recognizes on appeal that there is a punishment interest that has some import.appellant br.at.but he now raises four related arguments that we must address.first,he argues that the government does not and can not have an important interest in restoring a defendant mental competency to proceed with sentencing.in that sense,he distinguishes his case from grape,sell,and others where the government interest arose.he next argues that the offenses for which he was convicted,count ii and count iii,which were each a violation of are not serious offenses that might justify the government interest.finally,he argues that the district court erred when it considered the importance of the government interest by reference to the guidelines range in the psr and,more generally,to the psr itself 
the government can have an important interest in restoring a defendant mental competency and rendering him fit to proceed with sentencing 
in,the court of appeals for the sixth circuit stated that it appear ed yet unresolved whether the sell principles permit the government to involuntarily medicate a defendant for the purpose of rendering him competent to be sentenced,noting that the sell principles had to that point only been applied where the government purpose in medicating a defendant is to render him competent to stand trial.baldovinos,f d at quoting sell,at.on that basis,cruz argues on appeal that the government lacks an important interest in restoring his mental competency to render him fit to proceed with sentencing.he seeks to distinguish this case from grape,sell,and others like it,where the sell proceedings took place.
since baldovinos was decided,only one court has considered whether the government may have such an interest in,in united states wood,the district court for the eastern district of virginia affirmatively answered that question.see wood,d at.in effect,the wood court reached the same conclusion that the government urges here it held that the government has an important interest in restoring a defendant mental competency for sentencing because it has a legitimate interest in punishing those who have committed crimes.see id.at t he sentence a defendant receives should accurately reflect the real nature of his offense,and should be tailored to the defendant circumstances.id.at t here is a very important,legislatively articulated,governmental interest in achieving fair,reasonable and sentences for similarly situated defendants who have engaged in similar conduct.
the wood court holding rests on its analysis of the sentencing reform act of the sentencing act,the sentencing guidelines,and united states booker,where the supreme court discussed governmental sentencing interests.see id.at.it found in pertinent part that booker made clear that the government has an important interest in enforcing both the sentencing act and sentencing guidelines.id.it thus concluded that the government has an important interest in r easonable,constitutionally acceptable measures that help achieve that interest,including,importantly,t he forcible administration of medication to restore competence for sentencing.id.at.
although the wood court decision does not bind this court,its reasoning is highly persuasive.as that court recognized,in booker the supreme court highlighted governmental interests that are inherent in sentencing proceedings.it repeatedly emphasized that the sentencing scheme put in place by the sentencing act and sentencing guidelines diminishes sentencing disparity and move s the sentencing system in the direction of increased uniformity.booker,at.it also repeatedly emphasized that sentencing uniformity depends in critical part on the relationship between punishment and the real conduct that underlies the crime of conviction.id.at see id.at judges have long looked to real conduct when sentencing,and often rely on a presentence report,prepared by a probation officer,for information often unavailable until after the trial relevant to the manner in which the convicted offender committed the crime of conviction.id.at i ncreased uniformity does not consist simply of similar sentences for those convicted of violations of the same statute it consists,more importantly,of similar relationships between sentences and real conduct,relationships that congress sic sentencing statues helped to advance.
the government can not achieve the sort of uniformity contemplated in booker without formal sentencing proceedings.a criminal defendant enjoys the right to allocute at sentencing,and he also enjoys the right to object to the psr,to argue for favorable sentencing variances and downward departures from the sentencing guidelines,and to oppose any arguments favoring upward variances or departures from the guidelines.those rights,which to a great degree reflect the defendant real conduct,id.at,necessarily require the defendant to both actively participate in sentencing proceedings and inform his attorney actions.because an incompetent defendant is presumed unable to take those actions,the government maintains an important interest in restoring his mental competency and enabling him to do so.
cruz here raises two arguments that the wood court appears not to have had occasion to address.first,he argues that the government interest in forcibly medicating him to restore his competency for sentencing is undercut by its ability to seek a provisional sentence under,whereby in lieu of being sentenced to imprisonment he would be committed to a suitable facility for care and treatment until he either recovered from his mental disease or defect or had been confined for the maximum term authorized by law for the offense for which he was found guilty.d,e.he also argues that the government interest in restoring his competency for sentencing is less than the interest recognized in sell,contending that the supreme court placed particular emphasis on the nature of the proceedings when it announced that it may be difficult or impossible to try a defendant who regains competence after years of commitment during which memories may fade or evidence may be lost.sell,at.but neither argument carries significant weight.cruz would have this court parse sentencing proceedings from the substantive trial proceedings to which they are inexorably linked.this court,like the wood court,will reject that invitation.if the sentencing phase of a federal criminal prosecution is not quite a tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense,mcmillan pennsylvania,it is nonetheless a critical step in the criminal justice process that congress designed.wood,d at.
insofar as cruz argues that provisional sentencing under undermines the government important interest in restoring his competency for sentencing,he appears to ignore important language from the supreme court opinion in sell.there,the supreme court noted that the possibility of civil confinement affects,but does not totally undermine,the strength of the need for prosecution.at emphasis added.and it appears axiomatic that sentencing is an integral part of prosecution 
when people speak of prosecutions,they usually mean a proceeding that is under way in which guilt is to be determined.in ordinary usage,sentencing is not part of the prosecution,but occurs after the prosecution has concluded however,r ather than using terms in their everyday sense,t he law uses familiar legal terms in their familiar legal sense.the term prosecution clearly imports a beginning and an end.
final judgment in a criminal case means sentence.the sentence is the judgment.in the legal sense,a prosecution terminates only when sentence is imposed.
bradley united states,defining prosecution within meaning ascribed by savings clause of section a of the comprehensive drug abuse prevention and control act of indeed,it is hard to imagine prosecution without sentencing.such a scheme would turn criminal convictions into little more than paper tigers.see united states petty,cir noonan,dissenting on other grounds to deny that the sentencing process is part of a criminal prosecution is to cut out the guts of criminal prosecution as it is conducted in our courts.
furthermore,insofar as cruz argues that the supreme court holding in sell should be limited to the proceedings in which a defendant guilt may be determined,he ignores important procedural aspects of the sentencing phase of trial.as noted above,the supreme court stated its concern in sell that memories may fade or evidence may be lost.at.that concern applies with equal force to both the jury determination of a defendant guilt and the court sentencing determinations.whereas the court announced in sell that it may be difficult or impossible to try a defendant who regains competence after years of commitment during which memories may fade and evidence may be lost,id.emphasis added,we recognize that it may be difficult or impossible to sentence a defendant who regains competence after years of commitment for substantially the same reasons.booker,at noting that judges have long relied upon a presentence report for information often unavailable until after the trial for sentencing purposes.
the offenses at issue were serious and they thus justified the government interest 
cruz next argues that the crimes for which he was convicted count ii and count iii,violations of were not as serious as the crimes at issue in sell and grape,and he appears to contend that the seriousness of his crimes undermines the government interest in restoring his competency for sentencing.the seriousness of a defendant crimes is,of course,the yardstick against which the court will measure the governmental interests that are at stake.and serious crimes may be committed against either persons or property because i n both instances the government seeks to protect through application of the criminal law the basic need for human security.at.
because this court has not yet promulgated a test to determine the seriousness of a crime,the district court gauged the seriousness of cruz crimes by reference to both the statutory maximum sentence associated with those offenses and the likely guidelines range that was set forth in the psr.it concluded that,under either rubric,his crimes were serious.we agree,and,as in grape,need not decide here whether the seriousness of an offense should be measured against either the statutory maximum associated with an offense or the likely guidelines range.
cruz has not argued by reference to the applicable statutory maximum that his crimes are not serious.indeed,it appears that he can not.at least two other federal appellate courts have determined that the offense at issue here,a violation of,is a serious crime because it carries a maximum sentence of ten years.see united states palmer,cir united states evans,cir concluding that violation of is a serious crime under any reasonable standard.
his argument on the seriousness of his crimes as gauged by the guidelines range in the psr is similarly unavailing.in united states gillenwater,the defendant was charged with violations of transmitting threatening interstate communications and transmitting threatening communications by mail,and the likely guidelines range w as to months,cir.that guidelines range is less than that at issue here retired supreme court justice sandra day,writing for the ninth circuit court of appeals,considered the likely guidelines range and concluded that the charged offenses were serious enough to establish an important governmental interest in the defendant prosecution.id.she noted that the defendant stood accused of making lurid and distressing threats against a bevy of government officials and employees and she thus reasoned that through prosecution the government sought to protect through application of the criminal law the basic human need for security and the very integrity of our system of government.id.quoting sell,at.
the crimes at issue here are no less lurid and distressing than those at issue in gillenwater.there,the defendant was charged with sending violent and graphically descriptive threats to officials from the occupational safety and health administration and the department of labor.see id.at.here,cruz repeatedly threatened officials from the ssa and federal protective service fps.he yelled at several ssa officials that they were going to need toe tags and told an fps official that he would take his ticket book,take his gun,take his doughnut and beat his ass.in another,particularly graphic encounter with an fps official,he stated that t here sic gon na be a war about this,explaining that you should be concerned about yourself if i gon na tell you i gon na kill you,i ai gon na tell you i gon na kill you,i gon na swing at you,all i got ta do is hit you one time,and inviting the official to come see me in person so we can talk and see whatever,so i can see what i talking to.give me a target,you have one.united states cruz,wl,at.july,citations and quotation marks omitted.
those statements demonstrate the reasonableness of concluding that the government interest in preserving human security is as great here as it was in both sell and gillenwater.see sell,at recognizing the government need to protect through application of the criminal law the basic human need for security gillenwater,at recognizing the government need to protect the very integrity of our system of government 
as a general matter,the district court did not commit reversible plain error when it considered and relied on the psr 
cruz next argues that the district court erred when it considered the guidelines range appearing in the psr because that range did not account for cruz mental health status,which could potentially serve as a basis for a downward departure or variance.however,because cruz raises this argument for the first time in the reply brief,we will not consider it.instead,we will deem it,like the other arguments that were raised for the first time in the reply brief,to be waived.see pelullo,at.
lastly,cruz argues that the district court erred when it concluded that the government interest was not undermined by the likelihood that cruz will be civilly committed in the future.as discussed above,that circumstance involves a inquiry,and,accordingly,this court should review the district court related legal conclusions de novo and its factfinding for clear error.see dillon,at.
the district court considered the likelihood that cruz would be civilly committed in the future under both federal and state civil commitment statutes and concluded that it was,at best,unclear.see app.in pertinent part,it explained 
under d,the court would need to find that cruz is suffering from a mental disease or defect that would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another if released.similarly,the state civil commitment statute,provides for involuntary emergency examination and treatment of people who are severely mentally disabled and in need of immediate treatment.under the statute,a person is severely mentally disabled when,as a result of mental illness,he poses a clear and present danger of harm to others or to himself.a.a clear and present danger of harm to others may be demonstrated by proof that the person has made threats of harm and has committed acts in furtherance of the threat to commit harm.b.
the may evaluation explicitly states that cruz has not posed a threat to himself or others while housed at fmc butner and does not pose a risk of committing serious harm to others.cruz was convicted of two counts of threatening federal law enforcement officers,but there is no indication that he committed explicit acts in furtherance of those threats.on the other hand,the investigation report indicates that cruz has a lengthy criminal history involving numerous acts of violence and threats of violence and an extensive history of mental health treatment,including involuntary commitments.entries from the bop psychology data system,dated june,to october,indicate that cruz has continued to threaten violence against others.several entries indicate that the potential for cruz to cause harm to others is moderate or high.
id.on those facts,it concluded that u ncertainty surrounding the issue of whether cruz is likely to be civilly committed does not materially diminish,and it clearly does not undermine,the government interest in sentencing cruz.app.
following close review of the record,we will not disturb the district court factfinding because it is not clearly erroneous.its recitation of the facts,inc
