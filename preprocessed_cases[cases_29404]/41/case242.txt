plaintiffs suffer from acquired brain disorders and have the option to receive medical care for that condition under the medicaid program.they would prefer to receive those services in a home care setting through a model program new hampshire has established under a medicaid waiver approved by the secretary of health and human services.c.the difficulty is that there are more people who want to be in the model program than there is room in the program.
the patients sued,on behalf of a class,relying on medicaid statutory language,id.c,and arguing that if new hampshire set up a model program at all,congress required that the waiver program have at least as many slots as the number of applicants,up to a limit of.they also argued that new hampshire did not fill even the available slots within a reasonable time.finally,they argued that the notices given to those on the waiting list were inadequate.
the district court agreed that new hampshire was mandated by the medicaid statute to create more slots in its model program and also that notice was inadequate.it did not address the second issue.we reverse the district court ruling on the first issue and remand the other two issues,vacating the notice ruling and the injunction.
bonnie bryson and claire shepardson have acquired brain disorders abds,which manifest before age sixty,are neither congenital nor caused by birth trauma,and present a severe and disabling condition which significantly impairs a person ability to function in society.admin.ann.a.bryson,shepardson,and the plaintiff class they represent are being treated in a variety of settings,from nursing homes to psychiatric hospitals to private homes 
medicaid is an optional plan under which the federal government,through the states,partially funds medical assistance to needy individuals.see wilder.hosp.ass n,d.not everyone is eligible for treatment to be eligible,an individual must have limited resources and must fit into an eligibility category.for disabled adults,the most common route to eligibility is receiving supplemental security income ssi on the basis of disability.see a a i ii.some states,including new hampshire,also elect to cover some medically needy individuals who are not poor enough to be covered by ssi.perkins,medicaid past successes and future challenges,health matrix,see a c.
in,new hampshire requested federal approval to provide home and services for individuals with abds under the medicaid waiver provisions.section c of the social security act,c,permits states to include in their medicaid plans services,such as case management,habilitation services,and respite care.id.c b.states must apply for a waiver and be approved in order to include such services in their medicaid plans.id.c.programs approved under this subsection are waived from many medicaid strictures,id.c,such as the requirements that programs be in place statewide,see id.a,and that medical assistance be made available to all individuals equally,see id.a b.waivers are initially approved for three years and may be for periods.id.c.the waiver program is designed to allow states to experiment with methods of care,or to provide care on a targeted basis,without adhering to the strict mandates of the medicaid system.
there are three primary types of home and waivers.the first type,at issue here,concerns the treatment of individuals who would otherwise be treated in an institutional setting such as a hospital or nursing home.see id.c.the second type is for individuals over who would otherwise be in a nursing home.see d.the third type targets children under age five who have aids or are born dependent on drugs.see id.e.there are currently about home and waiver programs nationwide.perkins boyle,addressing long waits for home and care through medicaid and the ada,louis.
to participate in the waiver program,states must apply to the federal centers for medicaid and medicare services cms.e.the administrator of cms has the authority to approve or deny requests,but must consult with the secretary of health and human services hhs before denying a request.id.f ii.
in theory,the waiver plans are the average estimated per capita expenditure under the waiver plans must not be more than the average estimated expenditure absent the waiver program.c d.in practice,the waiver programs may be costly to the states,because even though the individuals served by the waiver plan are no longer being served by nursing homes or other care facilities,other patients may take those nursing home spots.many patients not currently being served under medicaid may also apply for the waiver program.see perkins boyle,supra,at.the states thus have a financial incentive to keep their waiver programs small,or at least,to begin with small programs and grow them incrementally.
new hampshire applied for a model waiver,which differs from regular waivers primarily in that model waivers,by hhs regulation,may not serve more than individuals at any one time.b.new hampshire model waiver request,however,proposed to serve a far smaller number of individuals than the person maximum.the original waiver request proposed that individuals be served in the first year,in the second year,and in the third year.in,new hampshire requested and hhs approved an amendment to the waiver to accommodate individuals in the third year of the program instead of.the state also requested a renewal of the waiver for five more years,from through hhs approved this request in.new hampshire initially requested funding for only slots for each of the five years of the waiver renewal,but in it requested,and hhs approved,an amendment to the renewal,such that the program would serve individuals in the fifth year,in the sixth year,in the seventh year,and in the eighth year.in august,new hampshire requested an extension for the waiver,which hhs granted through january.new hampshire has since applied for and was granted a renewal of the waiver program,with an increasing number of slots from up to over the period.
there have always been more applicants for home and abd services in new hampshire than there have been available slots.the waiting list has ranged from people in the first year to a height of in the year.
it is undisputed that up until recently,some of the approved waiver slots have not been filled.the parties differ as to how many slots have historically gone unused,for how long and for what reasons furthermore,there is no agreement as to whether there continues to be any unused waiver slots.
bryson,shepardson,and the plaintiff class have applied for services under the new hampshire home and community based waiver for persons with acquired brain disorders.they have not received these services new hampshire instead has placed them on a waiting list,where they remain.
on december,bryson and shepardson sued the two new hampshire state officials,on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,seeking injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to.the suit challenged the defendants failure to provide home and services under the model waiver program to the plaintiff class afflicted with abd.
the complaint pled seven distinct counts only two counts are relevant to this appeal the first,count ii of the complaint,alleged that under federal law,medicaid services must be furnished with reasonable promptness under a and that the new hampshire defendants were in violation of this provision.the second,count vii of the complaint,alleged that federal law requires that the plaintiffs receive notice and the opportunity for a hearing when they have been placed on a waiting list,id.a,and that new hampshire has not provided such notice.
on october,the district court for the district of new hampshire granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment as to count vii,the notice allegation.bryson shumway,d.the court found that a,which requires an opportunity for a fair hearing when a claim for medical assistance is denied,is triggered when applicants are placed on the waiting list for waiver services.id.at.
on december,the district court granted judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on count ii,ruling that the d efendants have violated the reasonable promptness requirement of the medicaid act and requiring that they request enough waiver slots to serve the plaintiff class and to provide medicaid funded waiver services to plaintiff class in a period not to exceed months,absent extraordinary circumstances.bryson shumway,at.this appeal followed.

other rules govern the issue of statutory interpretation.if the meaning of a statute is clear,we enforce that meaning.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.here,the statute in question has been interpreted by a federal administrative agency in a rule promulgated through notice and comment.that interpretation is governed by the chevron standard if congress has not spoken to the question at issue,we may not substitute our own reading of the statute unless the agency interpretation is unreasonable.id.at.
reasonable promptness 
the statute,a,requires that medical assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.the plaintiffs contend that new hampshire operation of the abd waiver program violates a by failing to furnish the waiver services with reasonable promptness.they seek to enforce this provision through.the plaintiffs make alternative arguments for why they believe that new hampshire has failed to meet its duties under a.
requirement of waiver slots 
plaintiffs first argue that new hampshire is required by statute to request a waiver to accommodate at least individuals.they rely on statutory language governing waiver programs,which states 
c waiver respecting medical assistance requirement in state plan scope,habilitation services defined imposition of certain regulatory limits prohibited computation of expenditures for certain disabled patients coordinated services substitution of participants 
the secretary shall not limit to fewer than the number of individuals in the state who may receive home and services under a waiver under this subsection.
c.plaintiffs interpret this statute to require that states requesting waivers design plans that accommodate at least individuals,arguing that is the plain meaning of the statute itself and the thrust of the surrounding legislative history.the core statutory argument is that because the waiver programs must receive the secretary approval,this minimum should be read as a limit on both the state applying for the waiver as well as on the secretary.plaintiffs argue that the states are restricted from offering less than slots and the secretary is restricted from approving less than slots.
plain reading of the statute 
we turn first to the language of the statute itself.if a statute is unambiguous,we use neither legislative history dep t of hous.urban dev.rucker,d,nor administrative agency interpretation,chevron,at.
neither the language nor the structure of c supports plaintiffs reading the statute does not require applications for state waiver programs to serve at least individuals.the language of the paragraph,by its very terms,governs only the secretary ability to deny approval of waiver plans.see c the secretary shall not limit.the statute does not purport to govern the behavior of the states or the contents of the waiver plans themselves.moreover,the paragraph does not,by its terms,prevent the secretary from approving plans unless there are a certain number of slots.it only governs the secretary actions when she or he is acting to limit the content of waiver plans as to the number of individuals to be served.
comparing the language of c to the remainder of c,which governs waiver services,makes this reading even more compelling.some provisions of subsection c directly govern the content of the waiver plans these clearly state their purpose in limiting the content of the plans directly.see id.c a waiver may not be granted under this subsection unless.by contrast,c does not contain such language limiting the content of the plans themselves.
other provisions of subsection c,like c,operate to prevent the secretary from unduly restraining the state plans for instance,the secretary may not restrict the number of hours or days of respite care provided under a waiver plan,id.c,nor may he require that the waiver plan spend no more money than the approved estimates as a condition of waiver approval,id.c.these provisions merely prevent the secretary from imposing conditions onto the waiver plans.similarly,c restricts the secretary ability to limit the size and funding of waiver plans.read together,these provisions,like paragraph,ensure that the states will be able to receive funding for waiver plans up to a certain size and free from restrictions on how much care is provided to each individual.they do not dictate to the states the content of their waiver applications.
finally,it is evident that c contemplates state waiver plans with definite limits on the number of individuals served.paragraph permits state plans to replace individuals who die or become ineligible with other individuals i n the case of any waiver under this subsection which contains a limit on the number of individuals who shall receive home or services.id.c.state plans,then,certainly have the right to include a limit on the number of waiver slots they request 
this statute,c,is most plausibly read as limiting only the ability of the secretary to impose such restrictions,and not the ability of the states to propose or the secretary to approve waiver plans serving fewer than individuals.
administrative deference 
even if there were doubt as to the plain meaning of c on its face,the administrative interpretation of hhs does not support the plaintiffs position.if congress has not spoken on the precise question at issue,we respect the statutory interpretation of the federal administrative agency given that interpretative task,unless the interpretation is unreasonable.chevron,at.
congress has authorized hhs to interpret the statutes in question and implement regulations in this area.hhs has interpreted c through a regulation governing model waivers,which decrees that the number of individuals served under a model waiver program may not exceed recipients.b.it is possible to read the regulation,which permits no more than recipients under a model waiver program,and c,which plaintiffs urge permits no fewer than under any waiver program,to result in a scheme in which all model programs must serve exactly individuals.nonetheless,that is not the most likely reading.the regulation use of the term exceed indicates that hhs contemplates model waiver programs that serve fewer than individuals.
this conclusion is bolstered by the comments accompanying the announcement of the final rule.hhs concluded that while c could,arguably,be read to limit the actual number of individuals who may receive model waiver services to no less than,we believe that this reading is unsupportable.medicaid program home and services and respiratory care for individuals,july.
hhs interpretation of this statute is certainly not unreasonable.hhs reads c as allowing states to choose the size of their waiver programs,rather than requiring that the waiver programs be at least a certain size.this interpretation is consistent with the agency longstanding interpretation of the waiver program.see medicaid program home and services,stating that hhs believes that congress intended to give the states maximum flexibility in operating their waiver programs.
the policy reasons are obvious states,and particularly small states,may be discouraged from applying for model waiver programs at all if the choices are a program serving individuals at the partial expense of the state,or not creating a model program at all and providing only the standard medicaid services.rather,congress wished to encourage the states to pursue waiver programs,so that the states would create the types of model programs contemplated.sympathetic as these plaintiffs are,the logic of their argument may lead to the constrict
