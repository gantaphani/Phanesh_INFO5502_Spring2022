staunch claims that continental both interfered with her fmla rights and retaliated against her for exercising her fmla rights.the fmla guarantees eligible employees twelve weeks of unpaid leave during any twelve month period for certain family or medical events,including childbirth.a.the statute defines eligible employee as an employee who has been employed for at least months by the employer with respect to whom leave is requested and for at least hours of service with such employer during the previous period.a.the statute makes it unlawful for employers to interfere with,restrain,or deny these rights,a,and to retaliate against employees who exercise them,a violators are subject to consequential damages and appropriate equitable relief.a.
as an initial matter,a fmla claim can not be maintained by a plaintiff who was not an eligible employee.humenny genex,cir.the parties dispute whether staunch qualified as an eligible employee under the fmla when she sought leave related to her pregnancy beginning on january.continental asserts that staunch did not work hours in the twelve months preceding her request for intermittent leave.continental proffered the affidavit of mary sturchio,manager of human resources,with an attached chart calculating staunch total hours worked for continental from january,through january,as hours and minutes.sturchio based her calculations on continental records and factored in flight time,time,ground time,time,and training time.staunch maintains that she worked more than hours.to support her contention,staunch offered her sworn affidavit stating that she worked hours and minutes during the twelve months preceding her request for leave.her calculations were based on her own recollection of the hours she had worked and were displayed in an undated list of task and hours.the district court did not decide whether staunch had worked the requisite hours for continental rather,it assumed that she was an eligible employee and granted summary judgment to continental because her interference and retaliation claims had no basis in law.
