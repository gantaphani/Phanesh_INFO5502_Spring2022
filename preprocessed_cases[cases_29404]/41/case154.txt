we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the party,relying upon the record as defined by the district court ruling that the appellant had not properly controverted the facts set forth by the appellee in support of its motion for summary judgment cmi capital mkt,llc,cir.
in,sánchez started working as a office clerk for banco popular.she was promoted to a position as a customer service representative in.as a customer service representative,she sold the bank products to new and existing customers and assisted customers over the phone with their banking transactions,such as deposits,withdrawals,and payments.her job performance was by all accounts exemplary.
on october,while sánchez was assisting a customer on the phone,she determined that she needed the aid of one of her supervisors and placed the customer on hold.when sánchez sought a particular supervisor attention,the supervisor allegedly refused to help her.upon returning to her desk,sánchez discovered that the customer had hung up the phone.at that point,sánchez suddenly suffered from,in her words,a lack of emotional control.
on that same day,sánchez filed a workers compensation report with the puerto rico state insurance fund sif,identifying her mental health concerns stemming from this earlier incident.sif evaluated sánchez and recommended that she should go on sick leave indefinitely beginning october.while on leave,her treating psychiatrist,eli rojas,diagnosed her with a temporary condition called mixed situational disorder.he advised banco popular that when she returned to work,she should be placed in a position that did not involve dealing with the public.
in september,a human resources officer at banco popular discussed with sánchez the position she would take upon returning from her leave.sánchez alleges that the human resources officer forced her under duress to go back to her previous position as a daytime telephonic customer service representative and that she was crying when she agreed to do so.moreover,she claims that banco popular never offered her a position that did not entail interfac ing with the public.banco popular contends that it did offer sánchez several positions that were responsive to her request to avoid dealing with the public,including positions as an office clerk and as a nighttime telephonic customer service representative which typically had a lower volume of calls.banco popular asserts that sánchez turned down all of these alternative positions.
on october,after using days of her job reserve period under the workmen compensation act,laws et,sánchez returned to her previous position as a daytime telephonic customer service representative.sánchez continued to work in this position until she had a relapse of her emotional instability on march,she then went back on leave.when the remaining days of sánchez job reserve period ended and she failed to return to work,banco popular terminated her employment.
on september,sánchez filed an administrative complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging that banco popular had discriminated against her in violation of the americans with disabilities act ada,et,and the civil rights act of,et.upon receiving a right to sue letter from the eeoc on december,sánchez filed a timely complaint,with her sister and her mother as,in the district court for the district of puerto rico.before the district court,she reiterated the arguments she made to the eeoc.banco popular answered the complaint on april,asserting that sánchez was not disabled within the meaning of the ada and,in the alternative,that it had offered her a reasonable accommodation.
almost a year later,after the parties had engaged in discovery,banco popular filed its motion for summary judgment,accompanied by the required statement of facts sánchez filed her brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,which purported to be in adherence with the local rules,as well as a of facts the district court found that the plaintiffs response was not in compliance with the local rules as evidenced by the disorganized and convoluted statement of facts,spanning multiple documents in violation of local rule c and exhibits that were not properly translated from spanish into english in violation of local rule b.the court noted that because the plaintiffs failed to comply with the rules,it was permitted to treat the moving party statement of facts as uncontested.laboy,cir.
having reached this conclusion,the district court turned to the question of whether banco popular was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the entry of a summary judgment motion as unopposed does not automatically give rise to a grant of summary judgment because the district court still must consider the plaintiff ada claim based on the record properly before the court,viewing the uncontested facts in the light most favorable to the party,cir.
to assess whether banco popular was entitled to summary judgment,the district court considered whether,on the uncontested record,sánchez had established a prima facie claim of disability discrimination under the ada.given the requirements of the act,the court evaluated whether she was disabled within the meaning of the ada,she was qualified to perform the essential functions of her job,either with or without reasonable accommodations,and her employer took adverse action against her because of her disability.see bailey,cir.
the district court said that it would be justified in holding that sánchez impairment did not qualify as a disability under the ada as sánchez impairment was not substantially limiting.however,the district court went on to explain that even if the court accepts that sánchez was a disabled individual within the ada,her claims still fail because banco popular offered her a reasonable accommodation and she did not suffer an adverse employment action by virtue of her disability 
we read the court statement about sánchez impairment as tantamount to a finding on the uncontested record that she was not disabled within the meaning of the ada.however,even if the court intended a less definitive statement,we assess de novo the district court decision to grant summary judgment to banco popular,cabán hernández philip morris usa,cir,and may affirm the district court decision on any ground supported by the record,assocs.of,cir.
before reaching the merits of sánchez claim,we review for abuse of discretion the district court assessment that the motion for summary judgment was uncontested because of the plaintiffs failure to comply with the district of puerto rico local rules.crowley bean,cir explaining that the application of a district court local rule s is reviewed for abuse of discretion and a special degree of deference is accorded to a court interpretation of its own rules internal quotations omitted.here,the appellants of facts did not comply with the local rules.the citations to the record often referenced several exhibits in support of a specific contention,without indicating which pages or paragraphs were relevant.see cabán hernández,at t he appellants did not adhere to the record citation requirement f acts memorialized in their were supported only by references to multiple exhibits.this lack of specificity left the district court to grope unaided for factua
