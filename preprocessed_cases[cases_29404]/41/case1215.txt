this action presents a challenge to hamilton county distribution of public funds for provision of indigent health care services.the county actions are alleged,by certain health care providers who have not received such funds,to have resulted in a denial of their due process and equal protection rights.the district court awarded summary judgment to the defendants.trihealth,board of com rs,d.the plaintiffs now appeal.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
since,the voters of hamilton county,ohio,have used a series of tax levies,each covering a period,to fund delivery of health care services to indigent county residents.the most recent such hamilton county health and hospitalization tax levy was approved by the voters in november.defendant board of county commissioners thereafter entered into an agreement regarding use of hamilton county health and hospitalization tax levy proceeds agreement with defendants university of cincinnati,university hospital,and children hospital medical center for the period january,to december.the agreement provides for a continuation of the relationship,whereby tax levy funds designated for indigent patient health care services amounting to approximately million per year are distributed through the university of cincinnati to university hospital percent and children hospital percent in reimbursement for services rendered to the indigent and uninsured.
in unanimously approving the agreement,the board of commissioners rejected the request by other local health care providers,plaintiffs trihealth,good samaritan hospital and bethesda north hospital referred to collectively as trihealth,to share the levy funds among other hamilton county hospitals as well.although the sharing proposal was given serious consideration as an equitable approach,the comments of the commissioners at the september,meeting in which the agreement was approved reflect apprehension about the administrative difficulties and expenses associated with such a change.recognizing that health care in the greater cincinnati area was in a state of economic crisis,and concerned that increased administrative expenses would result in a reduction of funds available for actual delivery of health care,the commissioners opted to retain the status quo.they decided to distribute the levy proceeds to the two hospitals with which the county had had successful relationships,the two hospitals that undisputedly had been the predominant providers of indigent care in hamilton county.sharing was rejected in part for lack of information regarding its ultimate impact.
the board reached its decision only after significant consultation and deliberation,a process in which trihealth actively participated.an independent tax levy review committee conducted public hearings and received the report of consultant jefferson wells international.despite the recommendation of jefferson wells that the county consider providing levy funds to all qualified health systems that provide indigent care,the committee ultimately voted five to four against sharing until more information were made available.the board approval of the agreement was thus consistent with the recommendation of a majority of the committee members,as well as the recommendation of the county administrator.
within three months,the trihealth plaintiffs commenced this action.in relevant part,their amended complaint sets forth two federal civil rights claims under,for infringement of their due process and equal protection rights and a state law claim,alleging the board approval of the agreement is violative of competitive bidding requirements under ohio law.
in the equal protection claim,trihealth alleges the board,by awarding the adult indigent care funds exclusively to university hospital,unlawfully discriminated against other similarly situated hospitals without rational basis the district court determined first that trihealth had failed to state a valid equal protection claim.second,the court held that even if a valid claim were deemed to have been stated,the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to substantiate a finding either that the trihealth hospitals were similarly situated to university hospital or that every conceivable rational justification for the board decision had been disproved.
in the due process claim,trihealth alleges that hospitals denied the right to compete for a share of the levy proceeds were denied due process.the district court concluded that trihealth had failed to establish the existence of a constitutionally protected property interest.for purposes of its analysis,the district court assumed,without actually resolving the question,that the board was required by ohio law to apply the competitive bidding process in awarding the contract.even then,the court concluded that the board would still have retained discretion to award the contract as it saw fit.consequently,trihealth would not have had a legitimate claim of entitlement to the contract,but only a unilateral expectation,which is insufficient to make out a protected property interest.
accordingly,the district court awarded summary judgment to the board on both of trihealth federal civil rights claims.the court dismissed trihealth remaining state law claim without prejudice,as it declined to exercise continuing supplemental jurisdiction.subsequently,trihealth filed suit in the hamilton county court of common pleas in pursuit of its state law remedies,trihealth,board of com rs,no,which action is still pending in addition,trihealth now appeals the district court summary judgment ruling on both civil rights claims.

standard of review 
the court of appeals reviews de novo an order granting summary judgment.johnson karnes,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.id.not just any alleged factual dispute between the parties will defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment the dispute must present a genuine issue of material fact.leadbetter gilley,cir.a dispute is genuine only if premised on evidence upon which a reasonable jury could return a verdict in favor of the party.hedrick reserve care,cir.a factual dispute concerns a material fact only if its resolution might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing substantive law.id.
equal protection claim 
class of one theory 
the equal protection clause prohibits discrimination by government which either burdens a fundamental right,targets a suspect class,or intentionally treats one differently than others similarly situated without any rational basis for the difference.radvansky city of olmsted falls,cir.the trihealth plaintiffs have not alleged infringement of any fundamental right or that they are members of a suspect class.rather,they rely on the class of one theory,alleging that the county,under color of state law,treated them differently without rational basis.a class of one plaintiff may demonstrate that government action lacks a rational basis either by negativing every conceivable basis which might support the government action,or by showing that the challenged action was motivated by animus or.warren city of athens,ohio,cir.the trihealth plaintiffs rely on the former theory.to prevail,they must demonstrate that the differential treatment they were subjected to is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legitimate purposes that the court can only conclude that the county actions were irrational.id.at.
as the district court observed,the class of one theory is to the facts of this case.unlike the plaintiff in the case primarily relied on by trihealth,village of willowbrook olech,d,trihealth is not a person or entity alleged to have been intentionally singled out by government for discriminatory adverse treatment.rather,the trihealth plaintiffs are three named health care providing plaintiffs in this among a total of nine hamilton county entities that might have been qualified to share in the distribution of the tax levy funds that were instead awarded exclusively for purposes of the equal protection claim to university hospital.it thus appears that the only class of one implicated by this claim is university hospital.in effect,the trihealth plaintiffs complain not that they were singled out for adverse treatment,but that university hospital was singled out for beneficial treatment.trihealth has cited no authority for the proposition that the class of one theory can be used to make out an equal protection violation under such circumstances 
indeed,the district court characterization of trihealth claim as a spurious challenge to the county consumer choice appears to be closer to the mark.a governmental agency generally enjoys broad freedom to enter into contracts with private parties for the purchase of services.foto usa,bd.of regents of.of,cir capital dev,cir.
trihealth contends that the county freedom of contract was not so broad in this case,but was restricted by ohio law competitive bidding requirements,and that the board improperly disregarded those requirements.the applicability of the competitive bidding requirements is a question left unaddressed by the district court.it is a question currently pending in state court and is not presently before this court.yet,even if the competitive bidding requirements were deemed applicable,such a determination would afford little support for the equal protection claim.trihealth has not even argued that the board noncompliance with the bidding requirements represents evidence of invidious discrimination.instead,the noncompliance is said to be significant because it demonstrates the lack of a rational basis for the county actions.
in this regard,trihealth relies on bower village of mount sterling.cir.as an unpublished opinion,bower lacks precedential effect and is not binding on us.see cir.c united states webber,cir.yet,comparative examination of bower is instructive,exposing the relative weakness of trihealth equal protection claim.
in bower,the court reversed the district court dismissal of a class of one equal protection claim under.b,noting that all fact allegations in the complaint had to be accepted as true and that the claim could be properly dismissed only if it appeared beyond doubt that the plaintiff could prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.the court held bower had sufficiently alleged that he was similarly situated to others who received different treatment,and that his disparate treatment was motivated by invidious,retaliatory animus.further,the court held bower colorable charge that the defendant had proceeded in a manner contrary to state law was sufficient to overcome the presumption of rationality that otherwise attached to governmental action.
bower is distinguishable in several material respects.first,in reviewing the district court award of summary judgment,we are not bound by the decidedly liberal standard of review applied to a complaint challenged under rule b.see andrews state of ohio,cir.we are not required to accept trihealth fact allegations as true,but must consider and evaluate the evidentiary record as a whole and determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.second,unlike bower,trihealth has neither alleged nor adduced evidence of invidious discrimination by the board.third,whereas in bower the legal impropriety of the defendant action was patent,it is far from clear in this case that the board failure to use competitive bidding was contrary to ohio law.hence,the presumption of rationality is not so clearly overcome in this case as in bower.
further,even assuming the complained of differential treatment is cognizable as an equal protection claim,summary judgment was,for the reasons stated by the district court,properly awarded to the board.the district court concluded that the trihealth hospitals were not similarly situated to university hospital in all material respects and that trihealth had failed to negative every conceivable rational basis for the board distribution of all levy funds available for adult indigent health care to university hospital.in this conclusion,we find no error,as outlined below.
similarly situated 
the district court summarized and evaluated the parties respective positions on the extent to which they were similarly situated as follows 
trihealth argues that the trihealth hospitals are similarly situated to defendant health care providers because,among other reasons all are private,entities exempt from federal and state taxation,and as such are required to treat indigent patients both good samaritan one of the trihealth hospitals and university hospital operate within the urban core both university hospital and the trihealth hospitals are recognized as providers of high quality medical care both university hospital and the trihealth hospitals provide health care to indigent,medicare,medicaid,and other vulnerable patients and are thus all part of the health care safety net for hamilton county and university hospital and the trihealth hospitals provide essentially the same services to the indigent population they serve.
defendants argue that the trihealth hospitals and defendant health care providers are not similarly situated because they differ in several material respects.defendants point out that university hospital has the most experience providing care to the indigent and provides more indigent care than any other hospital in the county ohio law classifies university hospital,but none of the trihealth hospitals,as a teaching hospital university hospital is the exclusive provider of certain adult hospital care services in hamilton county and while university hospital and good samaritan hospital are both located in the urban core,bethesda north,another member of trihealth,is not.though trihealth raised some allegedly disputed issues of material fact in its response to the county defendants motion for summary judgment,trihealth did not dispute any of the former contentions.
even accepting trihealth contentions,the undisputed differences cited by defendants and noted above support defendants claim that plaintiffs and defendants are not similarly situated in certain material respects.
trihealth,d at citation,footnote omitted.
on appeal,trihealth takes exception only to the district court conclusion that the undisputed differences are material.trihealth maintains the identified differences can be deemed material only if relevant to the board decision not to share the levy funds.trihealth insists the differences are not relevant and that the hospitals are similarly situated in all relevant respects.the district court reasoning in reaching a contrary conclusion is not explicit.it is obvious,however,that materiality can not be evaluated in a vacuum.materiality is an integral element of the rational basis inquiry.disparate treatment of similarly situated persons who are dissimilar only in immaterial respects is not rational.conversely,disparate treatment of persons is reasonably justified if they are dissimilar in some material respect.hence,we turn to the rational basis analysis,the linchpin of the test.
rational basis 
where,as here,no suspect class or fundamental right is implicated,governmental action subject to equal protection scrutiny under the rational basis test must be sustained if any conceivable basis rationally supports it.federal communications commission beach communications,d,ohio of liquor control,cir.the board has no obligation to produce evidence to sustain the rationality of its action its choice is presumptively valid and may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.beach communications,at.nor can the board classification be deemed to lack rational justification simply because it is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.id.at.quoting dandridge williams,d.an equal protection violation will be made out only if the board action is sh
