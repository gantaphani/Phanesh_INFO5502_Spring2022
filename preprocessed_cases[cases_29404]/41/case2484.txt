tmj implants,tmji manufactures and distributes temporomandibular joint tmj implants.robert christensen is tmji founder and president.in july,the food and drug administration fda filed a complaint for money penalties cmp against tmji and christensen collectively,petitioners after concluding that they had knowingly failed to submit seventeen medical device reports mdrs relating to tmji implants.that action culminated administratively in a final decision by the departmental appeals board dab within fda parent agency,the department of health and human services.the final decision affirmed determinations by an administrative law judge alj that petitioners had knowingly failed to submit each of the seventeen mdrs and that petitioners were each liable for penalties of per violation.
tmji and christensen now petition this court for judicial review of the dab final decision.see f allowing appeals of the assessment of civil penalties directly to circuit courts.they contend that the cmp was premature they were not required to submit mdrs because christensen reasonably concluded that the devices did not cause or contribute to a serious injury if petitioners were required to submit any mdrs,their failure to do so was not knowing monetary penalties can not be assessed against christensen because he is an individual,not the manufacturer of the implants and the amount of the monetary penalties is unwarranted.we affirm.
background 
the tmjs are located slightly in front of the ears and form the interface between the lower jaw and the bottom of the skull.they are critical to several functions of daily life,such as speaking,eating,swallowing,and breathing.when the tmjs do not function properly,a variety of conditions or symptoms may develop.common symptoms of tmj disfunction include reduced ability or inability to open or close the jaw,pain,swelling,ankylosis fusion of the joint bones,infections,chronic sinus pain,hearing loss,and chronic ear pain.when necessary,a medical provider may surgically remove one or both of the tmjs and replace them with prosthetic joint implants such as those manufactured and marketed by tmji.
a.the statutory and regulatory system for medical device reporting 
tmj implants are medical devices within the meaning of h.through the federal food,drug and cosmetic act,congress empowered fda to require every manufacturer of a medical device to establish and maintain such records,make such reports,and provide such information as the secretary may by regulation reasonably require to assure that such device is not adulterated or misbranded and to otherwise assure its safety and effectiveness.a.pursuant to this broad delegation of authority,congress created an expansive reporting system under which fda must require that every device manufacturer file an mdr whenever the manufacturer receives or otherwise becomes aware of information that reasonably suggests that one of its marketed devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury.id.a a.congress clarified what types of events must be reported to fda by defining a serious injury as one that is life threatening,results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure,or necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.id.a a c.
fda has explained the purpose of the reporting requirement and its broad scope 
to carry out its responsibilities,the agency needs to be informed whenever a manufacturer or importer receives or otherwise becomes aware of information about device problems.only if fda is provided with such information will it be able to evaluate the risk,if any,associated with a device and take whatever action is necessary to reduce or eliminate the public exposure to this risk.
in response to public comments expressing concern that broad reporting requirements may impose unduly onerous burdens on medical device manufacturers,fda reiterated the need for an expansive reporting system and adopted regulations that require manufacturers to file an mdr if they become aware of information suggesting that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury rather than the more limited language proposed that would have required manufacturers to file an mdr only in cases where they receive information suggesting that a device has caused or contributed to a death or serious injury.id.at.fda explained that the broader language was necessary because the agency needs to learn of instances in which there may be an association,as well as a causal connection,between the use of a device and a death or serious injury.id.
the implementing regulations to adopt the statutory definition of serious injury and define its crucial term permanent as irreversible impairment or damage to a body structure or function,excluding trivial impairment or damage.the implementing regulations also define the phrase caused or contributed 
caused or contributed means that a serious injury was or may have been attributed to a medical device,or that a medical device was or may have been a factor in a serious injury,including events occurring as a result of 
malfunction 
improper or inadequate design 
manufacture 
labeling or 
user error.
user means a hospital,ambulatory surgical facility,nursing home,outpatient diagnostic facility,or outpatient treatment facility 
thus,focusing on the terms most relevant to this case,fda mandates the filing of an mdr whenever the manufacturer of a medical device is aware of information that reasonably suggests its device or an error on the part of the practitioner who or facility that implants or services the device may have been a factor in the need to medically or surgically intervene in a particular individual case,so long as the intervention is necessary to prevent irreversible,nontrivial impairment of a body function or irreversible,nontrivial damage to a body structure.
the implementing regulations also describe when a manufacturer is not obligated to submit an mdr when the manufacturer ha s information that would lead a person who is qualified to make a medical judgment reasonably to conclude that a device did not cause or contribute to a serious injury.c.put another way,if a qualified person rules out the device or an error on the part of the practitioner who implants the device as a factor in the need for medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent harm to the body,and this conclusion is reasonable,then the manufacturer need not file an mdr.particularly relevant to this case,however,is fda explanation that n owhere in the act or its legislative history is fda authority limited to requiring only information about reportable events that have been confirmed by the manufacturer or importer of the device.at.
the submission of an mdr is not an admission that the device caused or contributed to the serious injury and a manufacturer may deny that its device caused the injury in their mdr.indeed,the standard form for the submission of an mdr includes a disclaimer to that effect.
as part of this expansive reporting system,device manufacturers commonly receive information about their devices through fda medwatch program.under that program,any person may voluntarily report to fda an adverse event or problem with a medical device.the voluntary medwatch report form asks for the patient name,a description of the event or problem,the name and manufacturer of the suspect device,and the name of the reporter.after fda receives the report,the agency forwards it to the manufacturer identified on the report.if the reporter requests anonymity,however,regulations require fda to redact any identifying information of the reporter before forwarding the report to the manufacturer.see id.f prohibiting fda from disclosing any identifying information of a voluntary reporter.
a manufacturer is responsible for investigating events described in medwatch forms to evaluate the cause of the event and whether to submit an mdr for it.id.b.a manufacturer is not absolved of this duty when a medwatch report contains incomplete or redacted information in those circumstances,the manufacturer is required to file an incomplete report explaining why the report is incomplete and what steps the manufacturer has taken to obtain the relevant information.id.ultimately,the manufacturer is responsible for obtaining the relevant information to aid in its investigation and is required to supplement its report once it obtains such information.id.b.manufacturers must also maintain mdr event files that contain information regarding adverse events purportedly associated with their devices,including all documentation of the manufacturer decisionmaking process used to determine whether the particular event is reportable.id.b i.finally,manufacturers must permit fda to access,copy,and verify its mdr files.id.b.
under f a,any person who violates the mdr reporting requirements shall be liable to the united states for a civil penalty.the penalty may not exceed for each violation.liability for civil penalties requires proof that the violation was either a significant or knowing departure from the law,or that the violation posed a risk to public health.f b i.
b.the events giving rise to the imposition of money penalties against petitioners 
fda employees conducted an inspection of tmji facility and mdr files from july,to august.as a result of that inspection,fda determined that tmji should have submitted mdrs for events,each of which involved either a device explant the device was surgically removed or antibiotic treatment.according to information received by petitioners,these surgical and medical interventions were performed due to,among other things,apparent infections,loose screws,swelling,pain,bone growth,decreased mobility of the jaw,headaches,seizures,inflamed tissue,vertigo,and foreign body reaction occurring after a tmj had been implanted in the patient.fda informed petitioners in a february,warning letter to christensen that written mdrs must be submitted for the events within fifteen days.the warning letter further notified petitioners that y ou should take prompt action to correct these deviations.failure to promptly correct these deviations may result in regulatory action without further notice.these actions include,but are not limited to seizure,injunction,civil penalties.
petitioners did not submit mdrs for these events.instead,on march,christensen wrote to fda to express petitioners substantial disagreement with the fda position.christensen requested a meeting with fda personnel to arrive at a proper decision with respect to what,if any,actions are required of the company in this matter.christensen further expressed his view that fda may be using warning letters to retaliate against tmji.
christensen and three colleagues met with fda representatives at fda district office in lakewood,colorado on march.the meeting can be summarized as follows christensen contended that in each of the disputed events tmji devices were not explanted because of any inherent problem with the device itself rather,natural progression of the tmj disease necessitated removal of the device.for example,christensen explained that bone growth may occur after a tmji device is implanted,but that in such a case,t he device did go bad,it just meant that the disease continued despite what we did and now we got to go in and maybe build a bigger one or take out more bone or get rid of adhesions or something else.petitioners position was that pain,swelling,and loose screws are not serious injuries because they are temporary and are not unexpected following placement of the device infections did not need to be reported because the devices are sterile when they leave the manufacturer facility and therefore could not have caused any infection.christensen explained that his thirty years of experience with the devices made it reasonable to conclude that the devices themselves did not cause the symptoms that necessitated the explant.christensen and his colleagues also expressed concern that filing mdrs would expose tmji to civil lawsuits and provide their competitors with an unfair advantage.they further contended that they could not conclusively determine that their devices were even associated with certain events,since the only information they had about those events came from voluntary medwatch forms that did not contain sufficient information to conduct an investigation of the events.
fda personnel disagreed with petitioners position.the agency explained that the definition of serious injury is one that requires medical intervention to prevent a permanent impairment.thus,while pain and loose screws may not be serious injuries in and of themselves,the failure to medically intervene to treat those conditions could lead to permanent impairment of the tmj or jaw function.according to fda,the relevant regulations require tmji to report all explants and medical interventions when tmji devices may have been a contributing factor in the need for such interventions,and that if tmji did not have sufficient information to rule out its device as a potential cause of the interventions then it must report them.fda made clear that submitting an mdr did not constitute an admission from tmji that its devices contributed to any injury,and the agency suggested that tmji articulate a response to the warning letter that addressed each one of the events and why petitioners did not consider them to be reportable.
thereafter,petitioners initiated a series of phone calls and letters to fda.the communications,which included petitioners written position on each of the events,continued to express petitioners views that filing mdrs would subject them to liability disease progression was the reason for each device explant or medical treatment fda interpretation of was overly broad petitioners could not determine whether tmji devices were involved in many events and fda was not as experienced as christensen and thus incorrectly determined that tmji devices may have caused or contributed to the reported events.petitioners sought another meeting with fda.
in its letters in response,fda adhered to its position as articulated during the march meeting.on july,the agency emphasized the statutory and regulatory language requiring mdrs whenever a manufacturer has information reasonably suggesting that its device may have caused or contributed to a serious injury.fda concluded for the reasons discussed in this letter,the events identified in the warning letter are reportable under the mdr regulation.because these reports are already past due under the mdr regulation,we expect these reports within thirty days of the date of your receipt of this letter.
petitioners did not submit the mdrs.instead,they continued to send letters to fda,pressing for a more comprehensive definition of serious injury and noting that petitioners were undertaking another review of the events identified in the warning letter.petitioners also continued to request another meeting with fda to further discuss their concerns.on august,petitioners determined that user error was involved in five of the events and filed mdrs for those five events.
in a september letter,the director of fda center for devices and radiological health cdrh reiterated fda position that petitioners construction of the mdr reporting requirements was too constrained.the letter explained that b ecause of their unique knowledge about their devices,manufacturers often look for a direct causal link between the device and the adverse event,overlooking the possibility that the device may have contributed to a reportable event as articulated in a a.fda reminded petitioners that the remaining serious injury reports should have been submitted to fda by days from the date of your receipt of our july,letter please submit all outstanding mdr reports within the next working days.the letter concluded 
fda regulations provide avenues for individuals to appeal decisions within the agency.in particular,individuals may appeal the decision of an fda employee to the employee supervisor under cfr part,internal agency review of decisions.under this regulation,the proper avenue of appeal of the center for devices and radiological health decision that you are required to submit the additional mdr reports identified in the february,warning letter,as well as any other additional reports concerning other adverse events that meet the requirements of cfr part regulation,is to the commissioner of the food and drug administration.
after petitioners again refused to submit additional mdrs and instead reiterated their explanations as to why each event was not reportable,cdrh responded on november with an offer to treat the explanations as mdrs in full satisfaction of petitioners statutory and regulatory obligations.cdrh further explained that the agency had expended significant resources responding to petitioners correspondence and that they had exhausted their appellate rights at that level of the agency.finally,cdrh again explained petitioners appellate rights 
as stated in the letter of september,fda regulations provide avenues for individuals to appeal decisions within the agency.in particular,individuals may appeal the decision of an fda employee to the employee supervisor under code of federal regulations cfdr part,internal agency review of decisions.under this regulation,the proper avenue of appeal of cdrh decision that you are required to submit the additional mdr reports identified in the february,warning letter as well as any other reports concerning adverse events that meet the requirements of cfr part regulation,is to the commissioner of the food and drug administration.accordingly,any further correspondence from tmj implants,to cdrh contesting the reportability of the mdr events listed in our february,warning letter will be considered an appeal and forwarded to the commissioner.you should be aware that pendency of such an appeal does not preclude the agency from taking action to enforce the requirements of the food,drug,and cosmetic act.see d.
emphasis added.
on november,petitioners refused fda offer to consider their explanations as mdrs and requested internal agency review under.on july,cdrh filed a cmp against petitioners based on their failure to submit mdrs for the remaining seventeen events identified in the february warning letter one week later,fda denied petitioners request for agency review under.the agency reasoned that because the issues were now the subject of a cmp and would be fully developed and determined by a neutral alj,it would be inefficient and duplicative for fda simultaneously to review the matter at that point.
petitioners and fda conducted extensive discovery and submitted comprehensive briefs in the cmp action.the alj held an evidentiary hearing and ultimately issued an initial decision against petitioners on july.in its final order of september,the alj imposed sanctions in the amount of on both tmji and christensen individually.petitioners appealed to the dab,see,which affirmed the alj decision and order against them.petitioners now petition for judicial review in this court.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the final decision of the commissioner of food and drugs or other entity deciding the appeal currently the dab constitutes final agency action from which a respondent may petition for judicial review under the statutes governing the matter involved.under f,petitioners may petition for judicial review directly in this court.
under the apa,we may set aside agency action only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.mark charities liquidating trust shalala,cir quoting a.an agency factual findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.pennaco energy,dep t of the interior,cir see also newton,cir.in this context,substantial evidence is something more than a mere scintilla but something less than the weight of the evidence.pennaco energy,at quotations and citations omitted.it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.quotations and citations omitted.finally,to the extent the agency action hinges on the agency interpretation of its own regulations,such interpretation is generally given deference.see newton,at cir discussing chevron,nat.res.def.council,d.
b.the dab determination that the cmp was not premature was reasonable 
petitioners first argue that the law did not permit fda to initiate cmp proceedings before the agency had ruled on their request for internal agency review under c.petitioners contend that serving them with the cmp in these circumstances deprived them of due process and constituted a breach of contract.in the alternative,they maintain that fda should have been estopped from filing the cmp.
the dab contrary interpretation of the applicable law was not erroneous.d states 
no action taken by an interested person in accordance with any other administrative procedure in this part,part or in any other section of this chapter,the filing of a citizen petition under or a petition for reconsideration under or a request for an advisory opinion under,will stay or otherwise delay any administrative action by the commissioner,including enforcement action of any kind 
as noted,petitioners sought administrative review pursuant to part of title of the code of federal regulations.see c.therefore,petitioners argument that the cmp was premature is belied by the language of d.that language,when applied to the facts of this case,provides that the commencement of petitioners review proceedings did not preclude fda from filing a cmp to enforce the provisions of a a,even though those proceedings had not yet culminated in a decision from the commissioner simply put,whether or not the commissioner had made a final decision regarding petitioners review request at the time the cmp was filed was irrelevant to fda authority to file the cmp at that time.therefore,the dab similar interpretation of fda authority under d was reasonable.
furthermore,as the dab recognized,petitioners participated in a hearing before the alj in which they were afforded the opportunity to present their positions regarding whether they were required to file the mdrs at issue and whether monetary penalties were appropriate.that hearing certainly provided the due process to which petitioners are entitled.see mathews eldridge,d finding t he fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner quotations omitted.therefore,petitioners argument that they were denied due process is without merit.
petitioners additional contentions also lack merit.petitioners point to cdrh statement in its november letter that the proper avenue of appeal was to the commissioner,and that any further correspondence from petitioners to cdrh would be considered an appeal and forwarded to the commissioner.according to petitioners,this constituted an agreement not to initiate cmp proceedings until the commissioner had decided petitioners review request.the same letter,however,cited d and explicitly informed petitioners that y ou should be aware that pendency of such an appeal under does not preclude the agency from taking action to enforce the requirements of the food,drug,and cosmetic act.contrary to petitioners position,the agency never represented otherwise.accordingly,this communication did not bind fda in contract or equity to stay any enforcement action until the commissioner made a final decision regarding petitioners review request.
c.the dab did not err in determining that tmji must submit mdrs for the seventeen events identified in the cmp.
petitioners contend that the events at issue do not represent serious injuries under a a.they argue that the physical conditions preceding the device explant or medical as pain,swelling,bone growth,and relatively trivial and are to be expected following the surgical implant of any medical device.
again,the dab contrary interpretation of the applicable law was reasonable.indeed,petitioners misread the applicable regulation,which does not define serious injury in terms of physical significance.instead,a serious injury is a condition that necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body struc
