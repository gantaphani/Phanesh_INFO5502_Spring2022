med appeals the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of,the city of lima and david berger,both individually and in his official capacity as mayor of the city of lima,ohio collectively,the city.med,an ambulance company,challenges the city proposed suspension of med from receiving emergency dispatches from the city.the city decision to suspend med was based upon alleged incidents involving med slow response times and inability to locate addresses within the city.med alleges that the suspension constitutes a deprivation of property and liberty without due process of law in violation of the fourteenth amendment.upon the city motion for summary judgment,the district court concluded that med did not possess a property interest in receiving calls,and no liberty interest was implicated because med had not shown a loss of business opportunities or damage to reputation.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the decision of the district court.
facts and procedure 
med provides ambulance services in northwest ohio.in january of,med.applied for and received a license to provide ambulance services in the city of lima.under a of the lima municipal code,an ambulance license is required to engage in the business or service of the transportation of patients upon the streets,alleys or other public ways or places of the city.appellant,ex.chapter of the municipal code sets forth the procedures and requirements for obtaining a license to operate an ambulance service in the city.to obtain and maintain a license,ambulance operators must,among other things,demonstrate that they can respond to emergency calls within a specified time frame.lima a,appellant,ex.ambulance operators must also demonstrate their capacity to respond to more than one emergency call simultaneously.lima b,appellant,ex.
the lima municipal code also provides procedures for the revocation or suspension of an ambulance operator license.section of the code states in relevant part 
a the license officer may suspend or revoke a license required by this chapter for failure of a licensee to comply and to maintain compliance with,or for violation of,this chapter,but only after warning and such reasonable time for compliance as may be set by the license officer.within thirty days after a suspension,the licensee shall be afforded a hearing before the license officer 
c upon suspension,revocation or termination of an ambulance license,such ambulance shall cease operations as such,and no person shall permit such ambulance to continue operations as such.
appellant,ex.
in lima,emergency calls received from city residents are dispatched to ambulance companies on a rotational basis.city residents dialing to receive emergency services are routed directly to a dispatch system located in the city police department.depending upon the type of call received,the calls are then dispatched to either the city paramedic service or private ambulance companies licensed to operate in the city.med contends that in january of,mayor berger informed med that the city would dispatch every other call received by the city emergency dispatch service to med.according to med,it has responded to over calls received from the city dispatcher since this time.all parties agree that at all times relevant to this appeal,the city did not have any written policy,procedure,or legislative enactment governing the manner in which the city allocated its calls to private ambulance companies.
on november,mayor berger sent a letter to med informing the company of his decision to suspend the dispatch of calls to med for a period of one week.the letter explained that the decision was based upon the results of the city fire chief investigation of events occurring in october and upon investigations of similar incidents that occurred earlier.the fire chief investigation report was enclosed with the letter.the report discussed several complaints against med,most of which involved med ambulance drivers who were unable to locate addresses within the city.
upon receiving mayor berger letter,med filed suit in the northern district of ohio,seeking to enjoin the city from carrying out the proposed suspension.med asserted that the proposed suspension amounted to a deprivation of property and liberty without due process of law in violation of the fourteenth amendment.on november,the district court granted a temporary restraining order enjoining the suspension.the parties apparently then agreed that the suspension would not be implemented until the instant suit was resolved.on may,the city and mayor moved for summary judgment.
in an order filed on august,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.the court concluded that med had not shown any constitutional property interest in receiving dispatches from the city,because there was no enforceable policy or procedure restraining the city discretion to suspend the dispatches.the court also rejected med asserted liberty interest in its good name and reputation,because there was no evidence that either the city intention to suspend med or its reasons for the suspension were disclosed to the public.finally,the district court dismissed all claims against mayor berger.the court observed that the fourteenth amendment protects against only state action,so mayor berger could not be sued in his individual capacity.the court further observed that a suit against mayor berger in his official capacity should be treated as a claim against the underlying entity,in this case the city of lima,and determined that the suit against mayor berger in his official capacity should also be dismissed.med filed a timely notice of appeal.

alleged deprivations of med property and liberty interests 
in order to establish a procedural due process claim in a action,plaintiffs must establish three elements that they have a life,liberty,or property interest protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,that they were deprived of this protected interest within the meaning of the due process clause,and that the state did not afford them adequate procedural rights prior to depriving them of their protected interest.hahn star bank,cir,cert.denied,d.the district court awarded summary judgment to the defendants on the basis of its conclusion that med had failed to show a protected interest sufficient to satisfy the first element.on appeal,med challenges the decision of the district court that it had asserted no constitutionally protected liberty or property interest.med asserts,in essence,four different interests.first,med asserts that it does possess a protected property interest in receiving dispatches from the city.second,med claims that the suspension constitutes a deprivation of its property interest in its license to operate an ambulance in lima.third,med asserts that the proposed suspension would damage its business reputation and result in the deprivation of its liberty interest in its ability to pursue a profession.fourth,med contends that the suspension would result in a deprivation of its property interest in its business goodwill.
property interest in receiving calls 
med contends that it does possess a protected property interest in receiving calls from the city dispatch center.in board of regents roth,d,the supreme court elaborated upon the kinds of interests protected by the fourteenth amendment.the court explained that t o have a property interest in a benefit,a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.he must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.he must,instead,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.id.at.the court further explained that property interests are not created by the constitution itself,but rather by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.id.applying this principle,the roth court found that an untenured professor,whose appointment was for only one year,did not possess a protected property interest in his continued employment after the term of his appointment expired.id.at.
based upon roth,and the cases that have followed it,the district court correctly determined that med did not possess a protected property interest in receiving dispatches from the city.we have previously recognized that a party can not possess a property interest in the receipt of a benefit when the state decision to award or withhold the benefit is wholly discretionary.richardson township of brady,cir see also of,city of phoenix,cir explaining that existence of a reasonable expectation of entitlement is determined by whether language of the statute conferring the benefit is framed in mandatory terms and whether statute imposes substantive constraints on official discretion to award the benefit.if an official has unconstrained discretion to deny the benefit,a prospective recipient of that benefit can establish no more than a unilateral expectation to it.roth,at.applying this principle,we have held that no protected property interest is implicated when,under circumstances similar to those presented by the instant case,towing companies are removed from a local government rotational dispatch list.lucas monroe county,cir see also,morley auto body,hunter,cir holding that no property interest was created where policy of rotating calls to wrecker companies was issued in the sole discretion of the sheriff,and concluding after a survey of similar cases from other circuits that this reflected unanimous position of the circuits.in lucas,at,we affirmed the dismissal of several wrecker companies due process claims,which alleged that the county sheriff had improperly removed the companies from the county rotational dispatch list after owners voiced complaints charging that the sheriff was administering the list in a corrupt manner.we based this decision on the fact that the plaintiffs c ould point to no ordinance,contract or other rules of mutually explicit understandings that support ed their claim of entitlement to remain on the list.id.quoting perry sindermann,d.although there were written policies governing eligibility for inclusion on the dispatch list,we found that these policies did not create a property interest because t he written policies however unfair they may provide d that a wrecker company may be immediately removed from the list upon making a complaint to an unauthorized person.id.in other words,the policies provided unconstrained discretion to remove a company upon the occurrence of a particular event.
therefore,in order to assert a property interest in receiving calls,med must point to some policy,law,or mutually explicit understanding that both confers the benefit and limits the discretion of the city to rescind the benefit.med has not made the required showing.it is undisputed that no written policy or legislative enactment establishes a procedure for maintenance of the dispatch list or limits the discretion of city officials to remove ambulance companies from the list.in this sense,med claim is even weaker than the one we rejected in lucas,in which a written policy for maintaining the dispatch list did exist but did not provide for substantive limits on the sheriff discretion to remove wrecker companies.
med asserts that the provisions in the lima municipal code governing eligibility for,and issuance and revocation of,ambulance licenses establish a property interest in receiving dispatches.nothing in the code,however,even mentions calls or the allocation of dispatches by the city.according to the code,receipt of a license entitles the recipient to engage in the business or service of the transportation of patients upon the streets,alleys or other public ways or places of the city.lima a,appellant,ex.by its own terms,the code guarantees only the right to do business,not the right to receive particular business opportunities from the city.med notes that the code pertains to emergency calls,insofar as it requires that licensees possess a certain capacity to respond to emergency calls.according to roth and its progeny,however,it is not enough that the code refer to emergency calls instead,it must contain mutually explicit understandings that establish an entitlement to receive the benefit.there is no explicit guarantee in the code that an ambulance licensee will receive dispatches from the city,so the code can not form the basis for a property right in the continued receipt of dispatches.
med also asserts that a property interest in receiving dispatches was created by the official,albeit unwritten,mayoral policy of alternating dispatches among licensed ambulance operators.the supreme court has recognized that property interests may be created in some situations despite the absence of explicit contractual or legal provisions establishing a claim of entitlement.perry,at.for example,under traditional principles of contract law,e xplicit contractual provisions may be supplemented by other agreements implied from the promisor words and conduct in the light of the surrounding circumstances.id.at.quotation omitted.therefore,med could establish a protected property interest if it could show that the mayor or the city engaged in words or conduct that created an implicit,but nonetheless legally binding,obligation to continue to include med in the city allocation of dispatches.on the record,however,med has not adduced such facts.there is no evidence in the record,for example,that would support a claim that an implied contract was created or that would define what the terms of such a contract might have been med verified complaint alleges only that mayor berger instituted a policy in which plaintiff received every other call.joint appendix at.under prevailing law,however,the existence of a or not enough to create a property interest.see lucas,at morley,at.the terms of that policy must constrain the discretion of the official to suspend the benefit.no evidence on the record suggests the existence of any such terms.
effective revocation 
med also argues that by depriving it of the opportunity to receive dispatches from the city for one week,the city proposed suspension would effectively deprive med of its property interest in its ambulance license by rendering the license valueless during the term of the suspension.med contends that the suspension is merely an attempt by the city to suspend med ambulance license without affording med the procedural protections required for suspensions of licenses under the lima municipal code.see lima,appellant,ex.
the property interest asserted in this instance is med interest in its license,not its right to receive dispatches.med does possess a protected property interest in its license to operate ambulances.see stidham peace officer standards training,cir the supreme court has held that a license to practice one calling or profession is a protected property right.the lima municipal code authorizes revocation or suspension of ambulance licenses as a penalty for an ambulance company failure to comply with the provisions of the code.moreover,under the code,revocation or suspension can occur only after the company receives a warning and reasonable time for compliance.lima a,appellant,ex.thus,the lima municipal code imposes explicit substantive constraints on the discretion of lima officials to revoke or suspend licenses,thereby creating a legitimate claim of entitlement to the continued enjoyment of ambulance licenses.see barry barchi,d it is conceded that,under new york law,barchi license could have been suspended only upon a satisfactory showing that his horse had been drugged and that he was at least negligent in failing to prevent the drugging.as a threshold matter,therefore,it is clear that barchi had a property interest in his license sufficient to invoke the protection of the due process clause.
the question,however,is whether med will be deprived of its property interest in its license for the purposes of the fourteenth amendment if the proposed suspension takes effect.there is no allegation that med license will be actually suspended or revoked during the period of suspension.med will be allowed to retain its license and conduct business it simply will not receive dispatches from the city.nevertheless,a number of courts of appeals have held that under certain circumstances,a ctions taken by the state which destroy the value or utility of a protected property interest constitute a fourteenth amendment deprivation of that interest,even though the state does not formally deprive the owner of title to the property.stidham,at holding that state official ultra vires action in disseminating damaging information about the plaintiff that prevented him from obtaining employment constituted effective revocation of plaintiff certification to work as a peace officer see also westborough mall,city of cape girardeau,cir,cert.denied,d reed village of shorewood,cir.in reed,for example,the proprietors of a music venue that served alcohol claimed that village officials deprived them of their property rights in their liquor license by engaging in a pattern of official harassment,which included arresting customers and employees on baseless charges,demanding proof of age from customers who obviously were many years over the legal drinking age,and bringing groundless proceedings,and which ultimately forced the plaintiffs to close their establishment and surrender their liquor license.at.the seventh circuit concluded that,although t he defendants never succeeded in taking away the plaintiffs license either by revocation or nonrenewal,village officials may still have deprived the plaintiffs of their property interests in the liquor license.id.at.the court explained 
d eprive in the due process clause can not just mean destroy.if the state prevents you from entering your house it deprives you of your property right even if the fee simple remains securely yours.a property right is not bare title,but the right of exclusive use and enjoyment.
id.the court drew this conclusion,in part,from related doctrines concerning fifth amendment takings,where it is recognized that i f government makes your house uninhabitable,that is a taking of your property even if you retain clear title.id.med urges this court to follow the reasoning of these cases and hold that,by denying med the right to receive calls from the city for one week,the proposed suspension would effectively deprive med of the use and enjoyment of its property interest in its license without the procedural protections normally attendant to a suspension of a license under the lima municipal code.we find med argument unpersuasive.
assuming that med could assert a due process claim based upon the indirect loss in the value of its ambulance license that would result from the proposed suspension,summary judgment for the city would nonetheless be appropriate.med has not alleged facts sufficient to show that the proposed suspension would completely destroy the value of its license.although ordinarily the extent of the injury to the asserted property interest is irrelevant except for determining what process is due,courts have typically recognized indirect injuries to the value of property as constitutional deprivations only when such indirect injuries effectively render the property valueless.wells fargo armored serv.georgia pub.serv.comm n,cir emphasis added rejecting claim that approval of a certification for competitor of plaintiff destroyed value of plaintiff license without due process see also indus.safety equip.ass envtl.prot.agency,pirolo city of clearwater,cir u nlike the case in reed,we can not say that this action on the part of the city,even if done in bad faith as alleged,had the effect of destroying the value of pirolo business.the evidence in the record is not sufficient to support a finding that the loss of dispatches would render med license valueless,even during the limited term of the proposed suspension.in his affidavit,mayor berger stated 
had the suspension gone into effect,med would have had the right to respond to emergency calls made directly to its private telephone number,and it could still have provided ambulance services to other customers it may have under contract such as nursing homes,elderly care facilities,hospitals,or funeral homes.
at berger aff.med offers no evidence to dispute this claim.the record contains no evidence to show that dispatches constitute all,or even the majority of,med business.absent such a showing,med has not shown a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the proposed suspension would constitute an effective suspension or revocation of its license.
med next alleges that the proposed suspension would deprive it of its liberty interest in pursuing its chosen occupation.med claims that the suspension would damage its business reputation and impair its ability to obtain business in the future.the district court rejected this claim on the grounds that med had not shown that either the city decision or its reasons were disclosed to any third parties,or that the suspension would impair future business opportunities.
the supreme court has suggested that a protected liberty interest may be implicated by certain injuries to a person reputation or good name which threaten to restrain the individual freedom to pursue business or employment opportunities.wisconsin constantineau,d.the situations in which such injuries to reputation will give rise to a fourteenth amendment claim are limited,however.the fourteenth amendment does not transform all defamation claims against the state into constitutional violations.see paul davis,d.
we have held that an injury to one reputation,good name,honor,or integrity constitutes a deprivation of a liberty interest only when five elements are satisfied.ludwig bd.of trustees of ferris state,cir reviewing supreme court and sixth circuit precedent.first,the allegedly stigmatizing statements must be made in connection with the loss of a governmental right,benefit,or entitlement.mertik blalock,cir see also paul,at.there is no constitutional liberty interest in one reputation standing alone.siegert gilley,d.second,a plaintiff alleging an injury to a liberty interest must show that the defendant made defamatory statements that would foreclose his freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities.ludwig,at quoting roth,at.third,the stigmatizing statements or charges must be made public.id see also bishop wood,d.fourth,the plaintiff must claim that the charges made against him were false.ludwig,at.and l astly,the public dissemination must have been voluntary.id.
even if we assume that med has made the necessary threshold showing that its injury to reputation occurred in connection with the loss of a governmental right or benefit,mertik,at,the city would still be entitled to summary judgment.first,med has failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the alleged injury to its reputation would foreclose its ability to seek future business opportunities in the ambulance service industry.a charge that merely makes a plaintiff less attractive to other employers but leaves open a definite range of opportunity does not constitute a liberty deprivation.ludwig,at quotation omitted see also,at finding no liberty interest because city decision to ban temporarily one type of amusement ga
