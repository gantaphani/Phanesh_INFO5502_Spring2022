tenet healthsystems,a medicare provider,contends that the department of health and human services hhs inadequately reimbursed it for its losses on the sale of a hospital.the district court agreed and remanded the case to hhs for redetermination of the amount due.we disagree and reverse the judgment of the district court.
we begin with an exposition of the medicare regulations applicable to this appeal,and then describe the proceedings below.
during the period relevant to this case,and with caveats unnecessary to discuss here,hhs reimbursed health care providers for their costs in providing services to medicare patients under the pertinent regulations,these costs include medicare share of a provider depreciation expenses and capital losses the regulations use the cost basis of the depreciable assets of a provider hospital in determining both the provider annual depreciation allowances and its gain or loss when the hospital is sold.f,g.annual depreciation is calculated as a yearly fraction of the hospital basis,distributed over its useful life.d.gain or loss upon sale is determined by subtracting with appropriate adjustments the hospital basis from its selling price hence,the higher the basis,the higher the depreciation expenses that hhs will reimburse and the smaller the gain or greater the loss it will calculate upon sale.see nursing ctr.of buckingham hampden,shalala.
the medicare regulations permit a provider that purchased a hospital after july,and before july,tenet,or increase,the basis of the facility above that of the previous owner.see nursing,at pursuant to g and,the basis of such a hospital depreciable assets may not exceed the lowest of the allocated price paid for the facility by the purchaser,the allocated fair market value of the facility at the time of the sale,or the current reproduction cost depreciated on a basis over the life of the asset to the time of the sale.id the last category,depreciated reproduction cost,reflects the depreciated cost of reproducing the assets at current market prices 
a health care provider generally establishes its entitlement to medicare reimbursement by submitting a cost report to a fiscal intermediary.see a,f.if the provider is dissatisfied with the intermediary determination of the amount due,it may seek review from hhs provider reimbursement review board.see a,b.the board decision in a case is final,unless the administrator of the health care financing administration accepts the case for review.see f.after a final administrative decision,providers may obtain judicial review.f.
in september,tenet purchased two hospitals,nautilus memorial hospital and gibson general hospital,from humana of tennessee,tenet paid humana for both hospitals.based on an appraisal performed by valuation counselors southwestern,tenet allocated of the total purchase price to nautilus memorial.
tenet changed nautilus memorial name to three rivers community hospital and operated it as an acute care facility for the next six years.in its first medicare cost report for three rivers,covering the period from october,to august,tenet claimed depreciation allowances calculated by using a basis that reflected the allocated price it paid in.that price,tenet said,was lower than both the hospital fair market value and its depreciated reproduction cost as determined by the valuation counselors appraisal,and was thus the appropriate figure for the hospital basis pursuant to g however,the medicare intermediary,blue cross blue shield of tennessee,refused to recognize the on the ground that tenet had failed adequately to document the hospital depreciated reproduction cost.instead,blue cross limited tenet basis to that of the previous owner,adjusted for subsequent capital improvements,disposals,and accumulated depreciation,which it referred to as the hospital net book value as of the date of tenet purchase.as a consequence of the lower basis,blue cross reduced tenet allowable depreciation expenses for.
tenet did not appeal blue cross determination.nonetheless,tenet continued to claim depreciation allowances using the basis with adjustments in each of its next four annual cost reports.each time,blue cross limited tenet basis to adjusted net book value,and reduced tenet allowable depreciation expenses accordingly.tenet did not appeal any of those four annual determinations.
in,tenet sold three rivers for,with the purchase agreement between tenet and the buyer allocating of the sales price to depreciable assets.that year,tenet submitted a cost report that again used the purchase price with adjustments as the hospital basis.using that basis,tenet calculated its loss on the sale as and billed medicare for its share.see f.once again,blue cross reduced tenet basis to the adjusted net book value of the assets.the substitution of net book value for tenet claimed basis reduced tenet loss from to for the first time,tenet appealed the reduction of the basis to the provider reimbursement review board prrb.
after an evidentiary hearing,the prrb sustained the intermediary decision.the board held that,under the medicare regulations,a hospital basis may not exceed its depreciated reproduction cost,and that tenet had failed to adequately document its value for current depreciated reproduction cost.three rivers cmty,prrb,at,hereinafter prrb op.the board further held that because a reliable value for depreciated reproduction cost was unavailable,a basis was inappropriate and the intermediary decision to use the previous owner basis net book value was reasonable.id.the administrator of the health care financing administration declined to review the board decision,rendering that decision final.
tenet then filed suit against hhs in the united states district court for the district of columbia.on for summary judgment,the court found the prrb decision arbitrary and capricious,principally because the court read the medicare regulations to bar the use of net book value as a purchaser basis.tenet healthsystems healthcorp.shalala,slip op.at.hhs now appeals.
our standard for reviewing a decision of the prrb is the same as that which the district court must apply we may set aside a board decision only if it is unsupported by substantial evidence,or if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.e,a see f providing that judicial review of prrb decisions shall be pursuant to the provisions of et hca health servs.of,shalala.in addition,we must defer to hhs reading of its own regulations,unless that reading is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation s.auer robbins,d internal quotation omitted see thomas jefferson shalala,d.because we apply the same standard of review as the district court,we proceed de novo,as if tenet had brought the case here on direct appeal.see county of shalala,biloxi reg l med.ctr.bowen.
tenet emphasizes that it does not challenge the lawfulness or reasonableness of the medicare regulations,but rather only the way in which the prrb applied them to its reimbursement request.tenet br.at.the provider raises two principal objections to the prrb decision,contending that the board determination that the valuation counselors appraisal was inadequate to warrant a basis is unsupported by substantial evidence and the board determination that net book value was a reasonable basis for the hospital is arbitrary,capricious,and not in accordance with law.we consider these two arguments below.
the prrb did not dispute that tenet would have been eligible for a basis had it submitted adequate supporting data.prrb op.at.it concluded,however,that tenet failed to do so.id.at.although tenet contends that this conclusion is unsupported by substantial evidence in the record,we disagree.
as the prrb explained,and as tenet concedes,the basis for three rivers hospital may not exceed the lowest of its purchase price,fair market value,or depreciated reproduction cost.g.under the medicare regulations,p roviders receiving payment on the basis of reimbursable cost must provide adequate cost data,a,data that is accurate and in sufficient detail to accomplish the purposes for which it is intended,c.blue cross accepted the figures offered by tenet for the hospital purchase price and fair market value.but it concluded,and the board agreed,that tenet failed to meet its burden of submitting reliable evidence of the third regulatory criterion the hospital depreciated reproduction cost accordingly,tenet could not establish that its proffered basis was less than or equal to depreciated reproduction cost,and hence could not meet the requirements of g.prrb op.at.
in support of its claim to a basis,tenet submitted the appraisal prepared by valuation counselors at the time of the sale.although the board and the intermediary listed a number of flaws in the appraisal,we consider only the most important one here as the board correctly noted,the appraisal simply did not provide detailed documentation to support how it arrived at its depreciated reproduction cost.id.at.the appraisal listed a figure for the depreciated reproduction cost of the hospital buildings,but it included no supporting analysis or data.appraisal at at.although valuation counselors attached an,priced inventory of the hospital equipment,it attached no similar schedule for the hospital that the buildings constituted almost of the facility total appraised value.see id.at at.indeed,the appraisal did not even use the term depreciated reproduction cost to describe the value it listed,but rather the term depreciated replacement cost.id.at at.although tenet contends that valuation counselors regarded the latter as equivalent to the former,without a more detailed description of the appraiser methods and results it is impossible to determine whether that was so 
in sum,the appraisal submitted by tenet left the intermediary auditors without auditable evidence from which they could determine the depreciated reproduction cost of the three rivers facility.intermediary position paper,prrb case,at at.because that figure is essential to the calculation set forth in g,this flaw is sufficient to support the board conclusion that the appraisal was inadequate to warrant a basis 
twelve years after it purchased the three rivers facility,tenet endeavored to cure the flaw in the valuation counselors appraisal by submitting a list of the items that purportedly comprised the valuation of the buildings reproduction cost.the prrb was not satisfied with the degree of detail submitted.prrb op.at.although tenet neither included this list in the parties joint appendix,nor referred to it in its brief,at oral argument tenet counsel directed us to the appropriate pages of the agency record.we have examined those pages and concur in the prrb assessment.the new material does no more than list thirteen gross components of the three rivers buildings floors,roof,ceilings,and attach dollar figures to each.administrative record at.it does not indicate how those figures were calculated it does not even state whether they were the original calculations or simply retrospective reconstructions.
it was not only the valuation counselors appraisal itself that caused the board concern about accepting tenet proposed basis.another valuation of the hospital,conducted for tenet by the firm of marshall and stevens,raised still further doubts.prrb op.at.the marshall and stevens report valued the depreciated reproduction cost of the hospital buildings at lower than had valuation counselors,as of approximately the same date.id.at.there are no reasonable explanations for this large variance,the board said,which leads to the conclusion that the data is unreliable for computation of loss on sale of the facility.id.at summarizing intermediary view.
finally,we note that tenet itself created the evidentiary difficulty it now faces.although blue cross pointed out the inadequacy of tenet appraisal data as early as,tenet neither appealed the intermediary decision when it was made,nor did it request a reopening of the cost report within three years of the original decision.id.at.tenet also failed to challenge blue cross determination in any of the four succeeding cost years,and never offered a new appraisal that corrected the flaws in the original.although hhs has not argued that this constitutes a waiver,the agency does reasonably contend that tenet failure to appeal the first cost report has made the determination of the hospital basis all the more problematic.see,mertens,law of federal income taxation noting the difficulty of establishing the value of property a number of years after the valuation date and that,as a result,a valuation made at such time will be regarded as lacking in probative value.hence,tenet has no one but itself to blame for its present predicament.we conclude that the prrb determination,that the valuation counselors report failed to adequately document the basis of its value for current depreciated reproduction cost,prrb op.at,is supported by substantial evidence in the record before the agency 
we next consider tenet contention that the prrb decision was arbitrary,capricious,and not in accordance with law.tenet makes two arguments in this regard.first,tenet argues that medicare acted arbitrarily in rejecting the valuation counselors appraisal for the purpose of determining tenet basis in the hospital,while accepting the appraisal for the purpose of computing humana gain on the same sale.second,tenet argues that the medicare regulations bar hhs from using net book value as a hospital basis.
tenet correctly points out that,although blue cross rejected the valuation counselors appraisal for the purpose of determining tenet basis in the hospital it purchased from humana,the intermediary accepted that appraisal for the purpose of computing humana gain on the sale specifically,the intermediary accepted the appraisal allocation of of the total sales price to three rivers.by accepting the appraisal for this purpose,while rejecting it for calculating tenet basis in the hospital,tenet contends that medicare acted arbitrarily and capriciously.indeed,tenet continues,this treatment gave medicare a windfall,because medicare was able to use the higher valuation to recapture the depreciation expenses it had paid to humana,while using the lower valuation to pay lower depreciation reimbursements to tenet.we conclude,however,that there is nothing arbitrary about the conclusion that the appraisal was acceptable for one purpose but inadequate for the other.
first,and foremost,the medicare regulations expressly require different data for valuing a property for the purpose of calculating the purchaser basis than for the purpose of calculating the seller gain.as noted above,the regulations provide that the purchaser basis in depreciable assets is the lowest of three figures purchase sales price,fair market value,and depreciated reproduction cost.g.as further noted,because the intermediary reasonably concluded that the valuation counselors appraisal of depreciated reproduction cost was unsupported,it was also reasonable for it to conclude that the appraisal was unacceptable for the purpose of calculating tenet basis.
the regulations governing the seller gain,however,are different.gain is determined by subtracting the seller adjusted basis from the sales price.the seller adjusted basis is its net book value,which is unaffected by the sale.see provider manual c,ex.see also whitecliff,at.the sales price is determined by allocating the lump sum sales price among all the assets sold,in accordance with the fair market value of each asset.f iv.accordingly,for purposes of calculating the seller gain,valuation of the property at the time of the sale requires only two figures total sales price and fair market value,the latter being required to allocate the sales price when more than one asset is sold.as we have noted,the intermediary accepted valuation counselors figures for both the total sales price and the fair market value,and hence of the allocated sales price of the hospital facilities.because the only figure disputed by the reproduction not enter into the formula for calculating humana gain,it was not arbitrary to accept the appraisal for the purpose of calculating humana gain while rejecting it for the purpose of calculating tenet basis.
second,although tenet is corr
