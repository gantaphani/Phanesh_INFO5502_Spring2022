t o ensure that seriously ill californians have the right to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes where that medical use is deemed appropriate and has been recommended by a physician who has determined that the person health would benefit from the use of marijuana in the treatment of cancer,anorexia,aids,chronic pain,spasticity,glaucoma,arthritis,migraine,or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief.
