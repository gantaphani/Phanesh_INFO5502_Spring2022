erin and shawn holmes appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of merck company in their diversity action alleging wrongful death.they contend that the district court erred in applying the standards of the national childhood vaccine injury act vaccine act or the act,to their individual claims for damages.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we affirm.
when jacob holmes was one year old,his pediatrician administered m m r ii a vaccine manufactured and distributed by merck,in conformity with the recommendations set by the centers for disease control and prevention.within nine days,jacob began experiencing seizures and developed encephalopathies.he died approximately six months later acting on behalf of their son jacob estate,erin and shawn holmes petitioned for compensation from a government fund created by the vaccine act.they received through the program.
subsequently,acting in their individual capacity and pursuant to nevada revised statute section,the holmes initiated this wrongful death lawsuit in clark county,nevada their complaint set forth allegations of negligence,strict product liability,negligent design,failure to warn,misrepresentation,express warranty,implied warranty of merchantability,implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose,and punitive damages.merck removed the case to the united states district court for the district of nevada.
after three years of discovery,merck filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing,as is relevant here,that the vaccine act foreclosed plaintiffs lawsuit.the district court only partially agreed,holding that the act limited plaintiffs strict liability and negligence claims to the extent that the claims relied on allegations of design defect and failure to warn.but the district court disagreed with merck assertion that the vaccine act limited plaintiffs other state law claims.the district court therefore granted in part and denied in part merck summary judgment motion and requested supplemental briefing on plaintiffs claims of misrepresentation,breach of warranty,and punitive damages.following supplemental briefing on these remaining state law claims,the district court granted merck summary judgment.plaintiffs then filed a timely appeal to this court,challenging only the district court application of section of the vaccine act to their design defect and failure to warn claims.after oral argument,we deferred submission of the case to await the supreme court decision in bruesewitz wyeth,d.
we review de novo a district court decision to grant summary judgment.see,universal health,thompson,cir.we also review de novo a district court interpretation and construction of a federal statute.lively wild oats,cir.
the question in this appeal is whether the national childhood vaccine injury act preempts all or part of the plaintiffs claims.the national childhood vaccine injury act is part of the federal government larger program of approving,regulating,and promoting vaccines.see national childhood vaccine injury act of,tit.iii,stat,codified as amended at et.the act arose out of an attempt to balance the need for widespread childhood vaccinations with the need for optimal prevention against adverse reactions to vaccines.congress passed the law after hearing testimony that,although vaccines inevitably harmed only a very small number of people,litigation arising from these injuries was threatening the stability of the nation vaccine program.see,at,reprinted in u.in particular,injured persons complained about the tort law system uncertain and inequitable recoveries,while vaccine manufacturers testified that the high cost of litigation was causing insurance premiums to rise and reducing the number of manufacturers willing to sell childhood vaccines.see id.at see also bruesewitz.at describing impetus behind vaccine act creation.
congress addressed these concerns by establishing a no fault national vaccine injury compensation program through which persons might quickly and easily obtain damage awards from a vaccine court.see schafer am.cyanamid,cir describing compensation system and coining vaccine court term.
part ii of the act set forth the parameters of this compensation scheme and instituted a vaccine injury table to cover the vaccines and injuries,for which individuals could seek compensation.two provisions within part ii section and section are central to the issues presented in this case.
first,in section,congress stipulated that any claimant qualified to bring a claim in vaccine court must do so in advance of bringing a civil suit.a a the act specifies that a qualified claimant is any person who has sustained a injury after receiv ing a vaccine set forth in the vaccine injury table.b c.if a person is not qualified to file a petition for compensation under the program,then this subsection exhaustion requirement does not apply.a.
finally,if the person who sustained the injury is a minor,disabled or deceased,the act permits that person parent or legal representative to file for compensation on behalf of the injured person estate.b a.a parent or legal representative may not,however,file in vaccine court for compensation of his or her own individual damages.see d compensation awarded under the program may not include compensation for other than the health,education,or welfare of the person who suffered the injury with respect to which the compensation is paid.emphasis added.thus,although we have never had an occasion to rule on the question,our sister courts have consistently held that section exhaustion requirement does not apply to a parent claim for his or her individual injuries.see,moss merck,cir schafer,at.
section of the vaccine act meanwhile provides vaccine manufacturers significant protections,bruesewitz.at,by eliminating liability for injuries from unavoidable side effects,b eliminating liability for not providing direct warnings to a claimant,c and imposing a presumption that a manufacturer provided proper directions and warnings if the manufacturer complied with fda requirements,b in this way,the act sets up a quid pro quo easier and more certain compensation in exchange for limited remedies within the traditional tort system.see,bruesweitz.at t he act structural quid pro quo leads to the same conclusion the vaccine manufacturers fund from their sales an informal,efficient compensation program for vaccine injuries in exchange they avoid costly tort litigation and the occasional disproportionate jury verdict.
putting these two provisions together,plaintiffs argue that,because section of the vaccine act renders them ineligible for compensation through the vaccine court,no other part of the act,and particularly not section limitations,should apply to their claims in state court.we disagree.the exhaustion requirement in section is only a subsection of congress larger statutory scheme to ensure that vaccine manufacturers have an affordable and predictable way of handling injured parties compensation claims.though parents are not bound by section exhaustion requirement,they are not free from the act tort liability limitations.regardless of whether a plaintiff is the or the parent of one,section expressly preempts claims seeking compensation for injury or death caused by a vaccine unavoidable side effects.b.section expressly preempts tort suits based solely on the manufacturer failure to provide direct warnings to the injured party.c.in reaching these conclusions,we do not suggest that the act otherwise forecloses a parent state law claims.
preemption law begins with the presumption that congress does not intend to displace state law.maryland louisiana,d.state action may nonetheless be foreclosed by express language in a congressional enactment,by implication from the depth and breadth of a congressional scheme that occupies the legislative field,or by implication because of a conflict with a congressional enactment.lorillard tobacco reilly,d internal citations omitted.thus,when construing an express preemption clause,a reviewing court must necessarily begin by examining the clause plain wording,as this necessarily contains the best evidence of congress intent.sprietsma mercury marine,d.we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence,but look to the provisions of the whole law,and to its object and policy.pilot life ins.dedeaux,d see also freightliner myrick,d the fact that an express definition of the reach of a statute implies,supports a reasonable inference that congress did not intend to preempt other matters does not mean that the express clause entirely forecloses any possibility of implied.
congress included several clauses in section that inform our preemption determination.first,in section a,the act establishes a default that traditional state tort remedies remain except in several enumerated instances,including as provided for in subsection b.a except as provided in subsections b,c,and e of this section state law shall apply to a civil action brought for damages for a injury or death.subsection b,in turn,declares that manufacturers shall not be liable for injuries caused by side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.and subsection b states that proper directions and warnings will be presumed when the manufacturer complied in all material respects with all requirements under the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act to rebut this presumption,the act requires a plaintiff to show that the manufacturer had engaged in conduct that would subject it to punitive damages under the vaccine act or failed to exercise due care.b a b.
pursuant to subsection c,manufacturers are generally immunized from liability for failure to warn if they have complied with regulatory requirements and have given the warning to the healthcare professional,the vaccine recipient,or the vaccine recipient legal representative.c see also bruesewitz.at i mmunity does not apply if the plaintiff establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the manufacturer was negligent,or was guilty of fraud,intentional and wrongful withholding of information,or other unlawful activity.finally subsection e prohibits any state law that is more restrictive than the vaccine act.e no state may establish or enforce a law which prohibits an individual from bringing a civil action against a vaccine manufacturer for damages for a injury or death if such civil action is not barred by this part.
the text of these clauses indicates that congress expressly intended to prohibit states from regulating large aspects of tort suits against vaccine manufacturers.the third circuit explained the potential scope of this preemption provision although stating that no state shall pass laws with the following exceptions may well be broader than a provision stating state law applies with the following exceptions,the breadth of a provision does not alter the import of the underlying language,and here that language conveys a clear intent to override state law civil action claims in particular,defined circumstances.bruesewitz wyeth,cir,aff.at see also id.at comparing language in section of vaccine act to analogous express preemption language in federal cigarette labeling act and advertising act see,lorillard,at csx,easterwood,d 
in its recent decision affirming the third circuit reasoning in bruesewitz,the supreme court elaborated 
the even though clause in section b delineates the preventative measures that a vaccine manufacturer must have taken for a to be considered unavoidable under the statute.provided that there was proper manufacture and warning,any remaining side effects,including those resulting from design defects,are deemed to have been unavoidable.claims are therefore preempted.
in bruesewitz,the supreme court also discussed the interplay between subsections b and b 
the structure of the vaccine act and of vaccine regulation in general reinforces what the text of b suggests.a vaccine license spells out the manufacturing method that must be followed and the directions and warnings that must accompany the product.manufacturers ordinarily must obtain the food and drug administration fda approval before modifying either.deviations from the license thus provide objective evidence of manufacturing defects or inadequate warnings.further objective evidence comes from the fda regulations more than of them that pervasively regulate the manufacturing process,down to the requirements for plumbing and ventilation systems at each manufacturing facility.material with any one of them,or with any other fda regulation,could cost the manufacturer its defense.
plaintiffs argue that the express preemption discussed in bruesewitz does not apply to their case because bruesewitz involved a claim brought on behalf of an injured minor child.in such situations,plaintiffs do not disagree that section would expressly limit some claims for compensation.but,where as here,a plaintiff could not have first filed in vaccine court for compensation of individual injuries,plaintiffs claim section tort suit limitations are inapplicable.plaintiffs contend this construction is supported by the fact that congress did not discuss claims by parents for individual damages in either the vaccine act or the act legislative history see schafer,at discussing parents claims in context of legislative history.
we disagree with plaintiffs cramped interpretation of the vaccine act.given the structure and broad purpose of the act as a whole,it is most reasonable to apply section to all design defect and failure to warn claims arising out of a injury or death,not just those that could have first been brought in the vaccine court.
first,part ii of the vaccine act,in which sections and appear,is much broader than plaintiffs would have us construe it.part ii not only establishes the vaccine compensation program and vaccine table,but it also outlines the duties of the secretary of the department of health along with the responsibilities and liability of vaccine manufacturers.moreover,part ii provides any citizen regardless of whether that person was directly or indirectly harmed by a injury with a cause of action against the secretary where there is alleged a failure of the secretary to perform any act or duty under part ii of the act.a.
the structure of section further demonstrates that the act is meant to apply broadly.as subsection a in section explains,section applies only to a person who has sustained a injury or death and who is qualified to file a petition.a.while this provision makes clear that the subsection exhaustion requirements apply only to those who personally suffered a injury or death,the provision implies that other sections throughout the act apply to all types of potential plaintiffs.section,by comparison,applies to any civil action for damages arising from a injury.b.critically,it does not contain a limiting provision equivalent to the one in section.thus,congress inclusion of the restriction in section specifically its mention that the bar applies only to that subsection coupled with the lack of such a restriction in section strongly suggest that congress did not intend for us to apply the act tort suit limitations in the narrow manner urged by plaintiffs.see paul revere ins.group united states,cir it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely when it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
section,entitled trial,confirms this interpretation.in particular,the section sets forth three stages a liability phase,a compensatory damages phase,and a punitive damages phase by which a civil action not barred by section a of th e vaccine act shall be tried.by using this language to qualify the types of cases which may proceed to trial,congress opted for a framework inclusive of all civil actions not otherwise barred by section exhaustion requirement.indeed,only applying the trifurcated scheme to lawsuits filed by injured,and not to their parents,creates a convoluted trial and liability scenario because the child case would be subject to the trifurcation,while the parental claim would presumably proceed in a traditional manner.under that scenario,the jury would apply the section b defenses to the child claims,but would apply a
