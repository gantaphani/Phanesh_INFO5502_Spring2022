irma alexander alexander is the daughter of christen crutcher,a woman who died while receiving medical treatment at mount sinai hospital.as administrator of her mother estate,alexander brought a malpractice action in the circuit court of cook county against the corporate entities and individual physicians involved in her mother care.the united states removed this malpractice case to federal court because one of the defendants,godwin onyema onyema,was deemed to be a federal employee under the public health service act phsa,as amended by the federally supported health centers assistance act of fshcaa.a trial resulted in judgment in favor of all of the defendants.on appeal,alexander challenges subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that onyema could not be deemed a federal employee because he did not personally contract with a federally funded health center.alexander also challenges the district court entry of judgment as a matter of law in favor of one of the defendants as well as several rulings the district court made in the course of the trial.we affirm.
we begin with the question of subject matter jurisdiction,which we review de novo.samirah,cir.we also review de novo a district court decisions regarding the propriety of removal.oshana,cir.the federal employees liability reform and tort compensation act of,commonly known as the westfall act,accords federal employees absolute immunity from tort claims arising out of acts they undertake in the course of their official duties.see b osborn haley,d.when a federal employee is sued,the westfall act empowers the attorney general to certify,if appropriate,that the employee was acting within the scope of his or her employment at the time of the incident in question.d.if the attorney general issues such a certification,the employee is dismissed from the action and the united states is substituted as the defendant in place of the employee.d.thereafter,the lawsuit is governed by the federal tort claims act ftca.et.if the action was filed in state court,the case must be removed to federal court.d.the certification of the attorney general shall conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal.id.
although onyema was not a federal employee,he was working at sinai family health centers sinai,a federally supported health care center,at the time of the incident at issue here.onyema had formed an illinois medical service corporation called onyema medical service,he was the sole shareholder and sole employee of this entity.onyema medical service entered into an agreement with sinai under which onyema was to supply medical services to sinai various community health centers.onyema signed the contract in his own name on a line labeled onyema medical service,the fshcaa,like the westfall act,allows the government to remove from state court a medical malpractice action filed against a physician who is deemed to be a federal employee.see.a physician who is employed by or is a contractor for a federally funded health center may be deemed by the government to be an employee of the public health if a number of conditions are met.see h.once a physician has been deemed to be a federal employee acting within the scope of his or her employment duties,the united states is substituted as the defendant and the ftca provides the exclusive remedy for the physician negligence.see c,g.moreover,once the deems a physician to be an employee of the public health service,the determination shall be final and binding upon the secretary and the attorney general and other parties to any civil action or proceeding.g f.
alexander brought this malpractice action in the circuit court of cook county.pursuant to d and c,the united states removed the action to federal court after it determined that onyema was a contract employee working in the scope of his employment with a health center see also g n.specifically,the attorney general delegate certified that sinai family health center was a private entity receiving grant money from the public health service pursuant to.the delegate also certified that sinai family health center contract employee,godwin onyema,was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the incidents and is deemed to be an employee of the united states for federal tort claims act purposes only pursuant to.the united states thus removed the case to federal court and moved to substitute itself for onyema as the defendant.see d c,g n.
thereafter,the united states moved to dismiss the case because the plaintiff had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies as required by the ftca.a.the district court granted the motion.alexander moved to reconsider,arguing that the government had incorrectly deemed onyema to be a federal employee because onyema medical service rather than onyema individually contracted with sinai.according to alexander,the government could not treat onyema and onyema medical service as identical without making a case for piercing the corporate veil under illinois law.the government responded that federal tort law rather than illinois corporate law controlled the result and that the government was entitled to deem onyema,the sole employee and sole shareholder of onyema medical service,a federal employee.citing dedrick youngblood,cir,the district court allowed alexander to take discovery on the issue of whether onyema could be deemed a federal employee in light of the contract with onyema medical service.following discovery,the district court found that onyema medical service essentially acted as onyema alter ego with respect to his professional services relationship with sinai.alexander mount sinai hosp.med.ctr.of chicago,d.the court found that the issue of whether a physician is a federal employee under the ftca is determined by federal,not state,law.refusing to elevate form over substance in characterizing the relationship between onyema and sinai,the district court concluded that onyema was effectively an employee of a public health center and thus a deemed employee of the federal government.the court therefore dismissed onyema from the action and substituted the united states as the defendant.
after alexander exhausted her administrative remedies,she returned to the district court to pursue her remedies under the ftca.shortly thereafter,she learned that in another case filed against onyema by another party,the government admitted that its decision to deem onyema a federal employee in alexander case had been mistaken.see buckley mount sinai hosp.med,wl.april.specifically,the government admitted in the buckley case that because onyema had not contracted directly with sinai,he was not entitled to coverage under the fshcaa.the court in buckley remanded the action to the state court on the basis of the government representation that onyema was not a federal employee.citing buckley,alexander moved for reconsideration of the court earlier decision dismissing onyema and substituting the united states as a defendant.the government opposed the motion,taking the position that,although it made a mistake in alexander case,all of the parties were bound by the government original certification and deeming decision under section g f.that section provides 
once the secretary makes a determination that an entity or an officer,governing board member,employee,or contractor of an entity is deemed to be an employee of the public health service for purposes of this section,the determination shall be final and binding upon the secretary and the attorney general and other parties to any civil action or proceeding.except as provided in subsection i of this section,the secretary and the attorney general may not determine that the provision of services which are the subject of such a determination are not covered under this section.
g f.the court denied the motion for reconsideration,agreeing that section g f bound the parties to the government initial determination that onyema was a deemed federal employee.the court also noted that under section g,review of the government decision to deem onyema a federal employee was extremely limited.finally,the court noted that it had rested its decision not only on the representations of the government but also on its independent conclusion that onyema himself and not the professional corporation for which he signed was the contracting party.
since that time,yet another malpractice action filed against onyema made its way to federal court in the northern district of illinois.see ismie mut.ins.of health and human,d.in that case,after the secretary refused to deem onyema a federal employee,the doctor malpractice insurer sued the department of health and human services hhs seeking to overturn that decision.the district court in the ismie case framed the issue as whether onyema is excluded from coverage under the ftca and the fshcaa because he contracted with a clinic through his eponymous professional corporation rather than as an individual.d at.the ismie action grew out of a malpractice case filed in state court against onyema and the clinic where the plaintiff was treated.the government determined that the clinic was an entity covered under fshcaa but that onyema was not.the government removed the case to federal court based on the clinic status as a covered entity.as in alexander case,the government then moved to dismiss the case against the clinic for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.the district court obliged and returned the remaining claims to state court.as the malpractice case proceeded in state court with onyema malpractice insurer providing his defense,the insurer sought a declaration in federal court that onyema is a covered contractor under fshcaa and that hhs was responsible for onyema defense.ismie,d at.
the district court ruled that hhs was judicially estopped from asserting that onyema was not covered under fshcaa because the government had deemed onyema to be a federal employee in alexander case.ismie,d at.in the alternative,the district court found that hhs decision not to deem onyema a federal employee was contrary to the law.finding the reasoning of the district court in alexander case to be persuasive,the court rejected the elevation of form over substance and found that onyema was no less a contractor simply because he signed the contract through his professional corporation.the court thus ruled that onyema should be deemed a federal employee.ismie,d at.
this strange history of onyema three odysseys through the northern district of illinois brings us to the instant appeal where alexander argues that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case.specifically,alexander contends that onyema could not be deemed a federal employee as a contractor of a publicly funded health center because he had no direct contract with the health center.alexander asks us to reverse and remand with directions to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction so that the district court may return the matter to the state court where it originated.the government counters that even if the original deeming determination was in error,all of the parties are statutorily bound by the government decision.moreover,the government contends,the deeming decision in combination with the certification that onyema was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the relevant incident gives rise to federal jurisdiction.the government contends that a positive deeming decision by hhs is essentially unreviewable under section g f,but concedes that the attorney general scope of employment certification is judicially reviewable.of course,alexander challenges only the deeming decision and not the scope of employment certification and that must be the focus of our analysis.
section g f provides,as we noted above,that once the secretary deems an employee or contractor to be an employee of the public health service,that determination shall be final and binding upon the secretary and the attorney general and other parties to any civil action or proceeding.alexander seems to concede that the secretary decision to deem a contractor to be an employee of the phs is final,binding,and not subject to review but argues that g f references only the deeming decision and not the determination of whether one is a contractor in the first place.determining who is a contractor,alexander argues,is a reviewable decision,and the government here conceded that it erred when it characterized onyema as a contractor.
alexander cites three appellate court cases in support of her claim that a party must be a direct contractor with a publicly funded health center in order to qualify for deemed employee status.see dedrick youngblood,cir allen christenberry,cir el rio santa cruz neighborhood health ctr.dep t of health and human.in each of these cases,however,the government refused to deem the doctor involved to be a federal employee.nothing in section or in which the government also invoked when removing the case to federal court prohibits review of the government refusal to deem a contractor to be an employee of the phs.none of these cases addresses whether the government positive determination that a person natural or corporate is a contractor is reviewable.neither party to this litigation points us to any case where a court has addressed this very fine distinction that alexander seeks to draw.we have been unable to find a case directly on point.
that said,the distinction that alexander seeks to draw between deciding who is a contractor and which contractors may be deemed federal employees is a false one.before deciding whether to deem a contractor of a federally funded health center to be an employee of the public health service,the government must necessarily first decide whether the party at issue is a contractor with a qualifying entity.no one disputes that sinai was a qualifying entity.the government threshold determination that onyema was a contractor of sinai even though the contract was through his eponymous professional corporation is necessarily part of the deeming decision and is entitled to the same treatment as the deeming decision itself.the final and binding nature of the government determination would be meaningless if the losing party could challenge the government interpretation of each word in section g f.we note that the final and binding nature of the government determination binds not just the plaintiff and the doctor but also binds the government.in this case,if the jury had found in favor of alexander,the government would have been liable for the judgment even though the government later determined that onyema was not entitled to the government protection.
a recent supreme court decision lends further support to our conclusion that the district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction over the case even though the united states was admittedly mistaken in its certification.see osborn haley,d.osborn,the plaintiff,worked for land between the lakes association lbla,a private company that contracted with the united states forest service.she applied for a trainee position with the forest service.haley was in charge of hiring decisions and he hired someone else for the position.osborn ridiculed haley at the meeting where his hiring decision was announced and she then refused her supervisor directive to apologize to haley.osborn subsequently filed a complaint with the united states department of labor,asking that the hiring decision be investigated.the investigation resulted in a finding that hiring procedures had been properly followed.osborn supervisors again asked her to apologize to haley and when she again refused,she was fired.she sued haley in state court for tortiously interfering with her employment relationship with lbla,charging that haley induced lbla to fire her.the attorney general certified that haley was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the incident out of which osborn claim arose,and removed the case to federal court.the government asked that the united states be substituted for haley as the defendant and that the action be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.osborn opposed the substitution of the united states as the defendant,arguing that haley conduct was outside the scope of his employment.the district court agreed and overruled the certification on the scope of employment.because the united states was no longer a party,there was no diversity of citizenship and no federal law at issue,the district court then remanded the case to state court.when the united states moved for reconsideration,the court clarified that the certification was improper because the united states denied the occurrence of the event central to osborn claim.
the united states appealed.the supreme court remarked that section d provides that certification by the attorney general shall conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal.osborn.at.this provision,the court noted,differs markedly from the command of section d,which addresses cases in which the attorney general refuses to certify the scope of employment.in such a case,the defendant employee may petition the court to make the scope of employment certification if the case was filed in state court,the attorney general is then permitted but not required to remove the case to federal court.if the court subsequently determines that the employee was not acting within the scope of his or her employment,section d commands that the action shall be remanded to the state court.the court found that,in contrast,in cases where the attorney general affirmatively certifies the scope of employment,congress gave district courts no authority to return cases to state courts on the ground that the attorney general certification was unwarranted.osborn.at.rather,the attorney general certification is conclusive for purposes of removal.d.that section,the court held,did not preclude the district court from the original defendant for the purposes of trial if the court determined,that the attorney general scope of employment certification was incorrect.for purposes of establishing a forum to adjudicate the case,however,d renders the attorney general certification dispositive.osborn.at.otherwise,the conclusive language of section d would be meaningless.the court opined that congress adopted the conclusive for purposes of removal language to foreclose needless shuttling of a case from one court to another.osborn.at quoting gutierrez de martinez lamagno,d.
the court then addressed the question left open by lamagno,whether article iii permits treating the attorney general certification as conclusive for the purposes of removal but not for purposes of substitution.osborn.at.the problem,the court noted,was that a case could be locked into federal court even though the united states was not a party,there was no diversity of the parties,and no federal question was at issue in the litigation.the court concluded that article iii allowed this result because a significant federal question would have arisen at the outset,specifically,whether the defendant had westfall act immunity.the case would thus arise under federal law as that term is used in article iii.the court found that considerations of judicial economy,convenience and fairness to the litigants made it reasonable and proper for a federal court to proceed to final judgment once it had invested the time and resources to resolve the pivotal question.osborn.at.
in the instant case,the attorney general certified pursuant to section that sinai was a federally funded health center and that onyema was acting within the scope of his employment at sinai at the time of the incidents giving rise to the complaint.in the notice of removal,the united states invoked both section and section d.given the invocation of section d,the very section the supreme court analyzed in osborn,the question of subject matter jurisdiction has been answered by osborn.the district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction over the case because a significant federal question arose at the outset,specifically whether onyema could be deemed an employee of the public health system due to his professional corporation contract with sinai the government answered that question affirmatively,albeit mistakenly.under section,neither party could challenge the certification,and under section d,the certification was conclusive for purposes of removal.osborn determined that a federal court could retain jurisdiction over a case that was removed with an erroneous certification without offending article iii.we therefore reject alexander challenge to subject matter jurisdiction and turn to the remaining issues in her appeal.
alexander contends that the district court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law for mount sinai hospital,the entity that employed two of the physicians who treated christen crutcher.she also faults the district court for a number of evidentiary rulings and for allowing certain comments by defense counsel during opening and closing statements.finally,she complains that the court itself made remarks in the presence of the jury that were unduly prejudicial,denying her a fair trial.
christen crutcher crutcher had a mass near her uterus beginning sometime in the.in,she was referred to onyema for examination of this mass.onyema ordered an ultrasound and decided to simply monitor the situation because the mass had not changed in size since the last ultrasound in the and because crutcher was not in pain.crutcher returned to onyema approximately five years later complaining of pain in her lower right side for six months.an ultrasound and ct scan revealed that the mass had not changed in size or location but onyema discussed surgery with crutcher because the mass had become symptomatic.onyema plan for surgery was to examine the mass laparoscopically to determine if it was fibroid or benign.if he found the mass was fibroid or benign,he intended to do nothing further.if the mass involved the ovary,he planned to remove it because he believed that for a woman crutcher age she was,any mass involving the ovary was presumed malignant until proven otherwise.onyema discussed the various risks of the surgery with crutcher and she decided to proceed with the surgery.
on october,crutcher underwent surgery at mount sinai hospital.onyema was assisted by gazala siddiqui,a first year resident.onyema began with the laparoscopic procedure,which involved inserting a scope or camera into the abdomen.he encountered dense adhesions which prevented him from seeing the pelvic organs with the scope so he switched to an open procedure.for the open procedure,third year resident jennifer moran joined the surgical team.in order to reach and remove the mass,onyema used blunt dissection of the adhesions,separating them mainly by hand.he removed the mass,measuring six to seven centimeters,and sent it to pathology for analysis.the pathologist later determined the mass was benign.siddiqui wrote orders for crutcher care immediately after the surgery and was the first doctor to examine her the next morning.siddiqui heard crackles at the base of crutcher lungs,a finding that is sometimes seen after surgery because patients do not breathe deeply due to incision pain.siddiqui ordered a device to help crutcher breathe more deeply and ordered a urinalysis to determine the source of a slight fever crutcher had the prior night.onyema spoke with siddiqui that morning and then examined crutcher himself.both doctors noted that crutcher abdomen was soft and and that she had reduced bowel sounds.these were considered normal findings in the first day following surgery.onyema decided that siddiqui orders were adequate.siddiqui ordered additional antibiotics later that day.
the next day,because crutcher fever had increased,bruce smith,the senior resident on call,was asked to evaluate crutcher.he noted that she had the symptoms of ileus,an obstruction of the bowel.he also observed crackles in both lungs,a rapid heartbeat and rapid breathing.a lab report showed an elevated white blood cell count.smith plan was to rule out pneumonia with a chest,to rule out a small bowel obstruction with abdominal and to rule out a postoperative infection.he also thought crutcher should receive additional antibiotics and that if bowel obstruction was ruled out,she should receive a bowel motility drug.smith conveyed his assessment and plan to onyema who agreed to the plan.as the morning progressed,crutcher complained of shortness of breath and abdominal pain,and displayed some confusion.she continued to have crackles in her lungs.the chest indicated pneumonia and crutcher was then given triple antibiotics.by,crutcher said she was feeling better,no longer had shortness of breath,and felt like she needed to move her bowels but could not do so.
the next morning,october,crutcher had a bowel movement and was given respiratory therapy to help her clear fluid from her lungs and breathe more easily.her fever had gone down to.smith examined crutcher that morning and found that she still had crackles in both lungs,was still breathing rapidly and had a rapid heartbeat.she also had a slight,bloody discharge from her surgical wound which was otherwise intact and abdominal distention.smith noted that crutcher had pneumonia.he also assessed her for ileus,noting that she had moved her bowels and passed gas,but also had decreased bowel sounds and abdominal distention.he assessed her for wound infection and noted she was on triple antibiotics.his plan was to repeat the chest and obtain an infectious disease consult.
moran also saw crutcher that day after receiving a report on her condition from smith.crutcher told moran she was feeling somewhat better but moran noted that her breathing was labored,her blood pressure was elevated,her heart and respiratory rates were elevated,and she was using extra muscles from her chest and neck to breathe.moran noted abnormal sounds in the lungs and poor air entry.moran also observed the crutcher abdomen exhibited a small amount of oozing,redness and bruising.moran reviewed crutcher latest tests,which showed a significantly elevated white blood cell count and pulmonary edema,among other things.moran concluded that crutcher had pulmonary edema with pneumonia.she planned to continue administering oxygen,prescribed a diuretic,and continued the triple antibiotics.her notes indicated she intended to attempt to contact the infectious disease specialist again,planned to ask her senior resident to see crutcher,and then intended to speak to onyema again to get his input.after moran discussed crutcher condition with onyema,he cancelled the infectious disease consult and directed moran to consult the pulmonary service instead.moran called in joseph rosman,a critical employed by sinai for an evaluation of crutcher condition.rosman concluded that crutcher was suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and he approved crutcher transfer to the medical intensive care unit micu where the micu fellow,residents and attending staff took over her care.he suspected the ards was caused by sepsis which was brought about by the pneumonia.
rosman was aware that the abdominal had revealed no free air in crutcher abdomen.free air would have been a strong indication of a bowel perforation which would have been another source of infection leading to crutcher mounting medical problems.once in the micu,crutcher was placed on a ventilator to assist her breathing.over the next few days,crutcher condition deteriorated.on october,moran examined crutcher and found she had a soft,abdomen,with positive bowel sounds,a clean and dry incision,and reduced redness and swelling at the incision site.a few hours later when onyema examined crutcher,her abdomen was slightly distended,her incision was dry,and bowel sounds were present.the next day,her abdomen was more distended but bowel sounds were still present.on the afternoon of october,crutcher began having problems with her organs.onyema called in a cardiologist for a consult.the cardiologist noted that crutcher abdomen was rigid and distended and recommended that a surgical be done.the micu fellow ordered a ct scan for october to see if crutcher had an infection in her abdomen.
on october,rosman examined crutcher and noticed that the ordered ct scan had not yet been performed.because crutcher abdomen was distended,he called the radiologists and urged them to perform the ct scan quickly.the scan showed a collection of fluid and two pockets in the abdomen.rosman arranged to have a catheter inserted in crutcher abdomen to drain the fluid.the catheter was placed on october and revealed that crutcher had an abscess,a collection of infected fluid in her abdomen.after draining this fluid,crutcher condition improved slightly over the next few days but then the drainage from the catheter began to increase.on october,onyema requested an infectious disease consult and on october,he requested a general surgical consult.sasa korner performed exploratory surgery on october and found a hole in crutcher small bowel which he repaired by removing centimeters of the bowel.a pathologist analysis of the removed tissue showed two holes.unfortunately,crutcher condition continued to deteriorate and she died on november of organ failure,which in turn was attributed to the perforated bowel.
crutcher daughter,irma alexander,filed a malpractice action in the circuit court of cook county against mount sinai hospital medical center of chicago and sinai health system mount sinai medical center of chicago mount sinai hospital,sinai medical group sinai,godwin onyema and joseph rosman.we have already noted the path the litigation took to federal court.under the ftca,the united states was substituted for onyema.the case against the united states was tried to the judge at the same time the case against the other defendants was tried to a jury.at the close of the plaintiff case,sinai,mount sinai hospital and rosman moved for judgment as a matter of law.the court denied the motion as to rosman but granted it in favor of sinai except to the extent that sinai was vicariously liable for rosman conduct as his employer and in favor of mount sinai hospital.the jury returned a verdict in favor of the remaining defendants and the court entered judgment in favor of the united states.
we turn first to the judgment entered in favor of mount sinai hospital.the parties agreed that mount sinai hospital was liable only through the actions of its employees,moran,siddiqui and smith recall that moran was a resident,siddiqui was a resident and smith was a senior resident at the time of these events.at trial,ronald berman testified as an expert for alexander.berman opined that crutcher developed ards by october.he testified that the chances of crutcher surviving ards at that point were and that those odds decreased as time passed.berman testified that t his was onyema patient.he is in charge,at.in his testimony regarding onyema,berman criticized onyema for relying on telephone reports from residents rather than coming in to see the patient himself when she was apparently more ill than would be expected following surgery.he opined that the residents have less experience and,the more junior the resident,the less you expect,at.the standard of care for residents,berman stated,was to know the indications and to any surgical procedure in which they participate,to know the complications of those surgical procedures,to be able to diagnose those complications if the patient showed signs of them,and to treat those complications in a timely fashion,at.when berman opined that the residents should have requested a surgical consult on october,mount sinai hospital objected that berman had not previously disclosed this opinion and that he was not distinguishing between the residents who had varying levels of experience and varying contacts with crutcher after her surgery.the court struck berman testimony and directed plaintiff counsel to be more careful in questioning berman so that it would be clear which resident was involved in the particular criticism.berman subsequently testified that moran deviated from the applicable standard of care by not requesting a surgical consult on october and that siddiqui violated the standard of care by not ordering a surgical consult on october,at.plaintiff counsel then posed the following question and with regard to the requirement that smith order surgical consultation on the or the,do you hold such an opinion plaintiff counsel objected to this question objection,your honor.the same objection.because berman had not previously disclosed an opinion that smith should have ordered a surgical consult on october.the court sustained the objection.plaintiff counsel did not narrow the question to the october time frame and instead asked other questions.the court continued to sustain objections to broadly worded questions and broadly worded responses from berman.the effect of those rulings was that berman essentially offered no further admissible critique of the residents.
on,berman conceded that moran and siddiqui did nothing wrong during the surgery itself.he also testified that neither moran nor smith violated the standard of care by failing to diagnose ards.when asked about crutcher chances for survival after october,berman could state only that once crutcher was diagnosed with ards,her chances of survival were and decreasing on an unknown scale each day.berman acknowledged that there was no way of quantifying the daily decrease in crutcher chances for survival and that he could not say whether her chances on october or later would have been or.finally,berman testified that he could not predict whether a surgeon called in on october would have recommended surgery given crutcher precarious medical condition at that time,at.
at the close of the plaintiff case,mount sinai hospital moved for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure.counsel for the hospital pointed out that siddiqui was not at the hospital on october,the only day for which berman criticized her performance.counsel also noted that there was no admissible opinion given regarding smith performance and that the only criticism remaining was berman opinion that moran should have ordered a surgical consult on october.because berman could not predict whether a surgical consult would have resulted in surgery or whether either a consult or surgery would have improved crutcher chances of survival,mount sinai argued that the case against moran was purely speculative.the district court granted the motion,ruling that no reasonable jury could find that the residents violated the applicable standard of care.the court found that there was no basis for imposing liability on the residents for failing to go over onyema head to order a surgical consult the court noted that berman criticism of siddiqui and smith addressed their conduct on days that they were not physically present at the hospital,which the court characterized as very,very shoddy testimony,at.the court found no reasonable jury would impose liability on moran for failing to call for a surgical consult on october because she was a junior resident reporting to onyema who did not himself order such a consult,and because by that time,crutcher had developed ards and had only a chance of survival no matter what moran did.
alexander complains that the court improperly precluded berman from testifying that smith deviated from the applicable standard of care by failing to order a surgical consult on october.alexander also argues that the district court applied the wrong standard when it entered judgment as a matter of law in favor of the hospital.we review the district court decision to restrict an expert testimony as a sanction for failure to disclose the information in discovery for abuse of discretion.hoffman caterpillar,cir sherrod lingle,cir.we review de novo the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law.murray chicago transit,cir.see also mayer gary partners,cir holding that,in diversity cases,all standards of appellate review are governed by federal law.under rule,a court should grant judgment as a matter of law when a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.murray,at.the standard for granting judgment as a matter of law mirrors the standard for granting summary judgment.thus,we must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn from that evidence in the light most favorable to the party against whom judgment was granted.murray,at.
we begin with the district court decision to sustain the objection to the question about smith duty to order a surgical consult on october and.alexander is correct that berman had previously disclosed an opinion that smith should have ordered a surgical consult on october.but prior to trial berman also opined that no one breached an applicable standard of care by failing to call for a surgical consult before october.when counsel for mount sinai objected to the question,he was objecting to the reference to october.the court sustained the objection,and counsel for alexander tried a few more times to elicit the relevant information but continued to ask questions that were as to particular dates and particular defendants.after additional objections,the court called a sidebar where defense counsel explained that he objected because berman did not criticize the residents for certain actions or failures to act before october in opinions expressed prior to trial.thus,testimony that the residents breached the standard of care before october constituted undisclosed opinions.the court suggested that alexander counsel use berman deposition testimony and accurately phrase a question with what you know to be his opinion,at.when trial resumed,alexander counsel failed to elicit an opinion from berman about smith obligation to order a surgical consult on october.we see no abuse of discretion in the district court rulings limiting berman testimony.contrary to alexander claim,the court did not preclude berman from testifying about smith conduct on october.rather,counsel failed to ask a question to elicit this information.instead,counsel asked broad questions and berman tended to answer in a manner that was inconsistent with or broader than his deposition testimony.the court was within its discretion to restrict berman testimony to previously disclosed opinions.
the entry of judgment as a matter of law is a closer question but after careful review of the trial transcript and the relevant illinois cases,we conclude that the district court was correct to enter judgment in favor of mount sinai hospital.the court sustained a number of objections to berman testimony about the residents the evidence which survived was exceedingly thin.berman testified moran should have ordered a surgical consult on october and that siddiqui should have ordered a surgical consult on october.siddiqui,however,did not see or treat crutcher on october.as we have already noted,there was no admissible evidence regarding a breach of the standard of care by smith.thus,the only evidence of a breach of the standard of care was berman testimony that moran should have called for a surgical consult on october.we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the opponent of the motion for judgment as a matter of law and so we must assume for the purposes of this analysis that moran,a third year resident,breached the standard of care by failing to request a surgical consult at the time of the rule motion,counsel for the hospital argued that alexander failed to show that the outcome would have been any different if moran had called for a surgical consult on october.in other words,alexander failed to present evidence that this breach was a proximate cause of crutcher injury.first,alexander presented no evidence that the surgeon would have done anything differently if he had been called in on october.second,berman testified that he could not say with certainty what crutcher chances of survival were after october when she was initially diagnosed with ards.indeed he testified that her odds of survival were at best and that they decreased in an unknown percentage each day after that.thus,the effect of calling in a surgeon on october versus on some other day was unknown with any certainty.defense counsel argued that it would therefore be speculative to conclude that a surgical consult on october would have influenced the outcome.such speculation could not meet the standards for proximate cause,the hospital argued.
to sustain a claim against mount sinai hospital based on vicarious liability for the conduct of its residents,a
