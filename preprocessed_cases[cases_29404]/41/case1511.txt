this case concerns a dispute between plaintiff,michael reese hospital and medical center michael reese and the administrators of the federal medicare program.some background concerning that program is necessary in order to understand the context of this appeal.the medicare program is a health insurance program primarily for elderly and disabled individuals.the secretary of the department of health and human services secretary administers the medicare program through the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms,formerly known as the health care financing administration hcfa.this appeal concerns part a of that medicare program,which is a hospital insurance program that covered payments for the costs of inpatient hospital services,including costs incurred in connection with training and instructing residents in approved graduate medical education programs by hospitals.much of the administration of part a is handled by private contractors,called fiscal intermediaries,pursuant to contracts with the secretary.those intermediaries determine the amount of payments due to providers of services.
until,the costs of educational activities and of inpatient hospital services were reimbursed by medicare based upon a provider reasonable costs.in an effort to control spending,however,congress in adopted a prospective payment system,whereby hospitals were paid a standardized rate based on the diagnostic classification for the services rendered.at that time,costs incurred in connection with graduate medical education gme were still reimbursed separately on a reasonable cost basis.in april,however,congress changed the method for calculating reimbursable gme costs.rather than reimbursing hospitals for annual reasonable costs incurred in such gme programs,congress designated a base year,for cost determinations.gme costs recognized as reasonable for that year would serve as the base figure to calculate gme reimbursements for all subsequent years.the gme amendment directed the secretary to determine a per resident amount by dividing each provider gme costs recognized as reasonable,by the number of equivalent residents working for the provider in.that amount would then be used in subsequent years to calculate the provider reimbursement amount.specifically,in subsequent years the provider reimbursement amount would be determined by taking the base year per resident amount hereinafter base year amount,adjusting it for inflation by applying the consumer price index for all urban consumers,and multiplying it by the hospital weighted number of equivalent residents and the hospital medicare patient load for the particular year.h.
it was not until september that the secretary promulgated regulations to implement that gme amendment.in those regulations,the secretary sought to ensure that the base year amount actually reflected legitimate gme costs because that figure would be used for all future years.therefore,the secretary authorized medicare contractors to and each hospital base year gme costs and exclude or misclassified costs.e ii.the rule permitted recoupment of medicare overpayments based on the redetermined base year amount only for years in which gme payments had not become which were still within the reopening period.moreover,providers could appeal the intermediary revised base year determinations to the provider reimbursement review board prrb within days of their receipt of notice of the new determination.e v.the prrb decision was final unless within days,the secretary,acting through the cms administrator,reversed,affirmed,or modified the decision.b,a.providers could obtain judicial review of any final decision of the prrb or the secretary.f.
in july,pursuant to that final rule,the intermediary blue cross and blue shield of illinois the health care service corporation hcsc recalculated michael reese base year amount and issued notices of reopening and amended notices of program reimbursement nprs for fiscal years,and.michael reese challenged those nprs within the appeal window,filing timely appeals in december,with the prrb disputing hcsc base year determination and the amended nprs for fy.the challenge to the determination was resolved separately,and is not an issue in this appeal.
that same month a settlement,or administrative resolution,was reached regarding the base year amount,which adjusted the base year amount in michael reese favor.in accordance with that administrative resolution,michael reese withdrew its challenge to the base year amount,and the hcsc issued a notice of revised average per resident amount napra which incorporated the amount.the napra also informed michael reese of its right to appeal the determination to the prrb within days if it was dissatisfied with the amount.the napra also included a schedule showing the revised per resident amount updated by the through the cost report periods ending august,which thus included new amounts for fy.satisfied with that resolution,michael reese did not appeal from the napra,and that decision became final.
despite the schedule showing adjusted amounts for fy,however,michael reese never received any repayment from the secretary of the amount that it presumably amount totaling approximately million in may,the prrb sent reminder letters to michael reese concerning the appeals for fy.the reminder letters stated that the hearings on the prrb appeals for the fiscal years were tentatively set for august,and that the parties position papers concerning the appeal were due in january and april of.the letters further informed michael reese that if it failed to submit position papers,its appeals would be dismissed.the position papers were to address any issue not settled or withdrawn,even if a settlement was pending,and the failure to address an issue would result in the dismissal of that issue.the reminder letter also set forth the procedure to follow if all issues had been settled 
if all issues have been resolved,the provider should withdraw the appeal.if the issues have been resolved but the provider has not yet received payment,it should notify the board.the board will close the case but will permit the appeal to be reinstated at the end of one year if the provider has not been paid.
michael reese did not respond to that letter from the prrb in any way,neither filing position papers nor informing the prrb that the issues had been settled and withdrawing the appeal.accordingly,the prrb dismissed those appeals.
nothing further happened concerning the matter until june,when michael reese wrote hcsc requesting that it implement the administrative resolution and revised napra.michael reese followed up that letter with a letter in november to adminastar,which had succeeded hcsc in september as intermediary,again requesting implementation of the administrative resolution and revised napra.in august,adminastar denied michael reese request to reopen the cost reports for fy.finally,in april,counsel for michael reese wrote to cms and requested that cms order adminastar to reopen the cost reports for fy to implement the resolution and revised napra.cms affirmed adminastar refusal to reopen,stating that the request was filed after the period for reopening a cost report.
michael reese subsequently filed this action in the district court seeking enforcement of the administrative resolution.michael reese based jurisdiction on the medicare act and the administrative procedure act apa,on diversity of parties,and on the mandamus statute.on defendants motion,the district court dismissed the claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
on appeal,michael reese asserts that the district court erred in dismissing the case,and that it has established both federal question jurisdiction and jurisdiction under the federal mandamus statute.both of those claims of jurisdiction,however,ultimately rest upon michael reese contention that it exhausted its administrative remedies.because we agree with the district court that michael reese failed to exhaust those remedies,we affirm the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
in asserting federal question jurisdiction,michael reese relies on the apa,which provides a cause of action for a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute.as michael reese recognizes,however,the supreme court has held that the apa alone does not contain an implied grant of subject matter jurisdiction for federal courts to review agency decisions.califano sanders,d.michael reese identifies the medicare act,final rule,and the secretary regulations as providing that jurisdictional source.general federal question jurisdiction is set forth in,which states that district courts shall have original jurisdiction over all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states,but claims under the medicare act must take a different route.the social security act at h provides that no action against the united states,the commissioner of social security,or any officer or employee thereof,shall be brought under to recover on any claim arising under the social security act.that provision was incorporated into the medicare act through,and has been held to preclude federal question jurisdiction unless the medicare program administrative review process has been exhausted.in shalala illinois council on long term care,d,the supreme court held that h,as incorporated by,bars federal question jurisdiction under,and requires parties to proceed instead through the special review channel that the medicare statutes create.thus,a provider must channel virtually all legal attacks through the medicare program administrative review process before it may seek judicial review.the supreme court recognized an exception to this where application of h would not simply channel review through the agency,but would mean no review at all.id.at.accordingly,in determining whether federal question jurisdiction is proper,we must first consider whether michael reese exhausted that administrative review process.
that exhaustion requirement applies as well to the plea for relief under the federal mandamus statute.the supreme court has repeatedly reserved the question as to whether mandamus relief is available at all for such medicare claims,or whether it is foreclosed by h.see heckler ringer,d.in burnett bowen,cir,we joined a number of other circuits in concluding that mandamus relief is available for medicare claims that are procedural rather than substantive in nature.we need not consider whether this is such a procedural claim,however,because michael reese can not meet the standards for mandamus relief.the supreme court has recognized that mandamus relief is available only if a plaintiff has exhausted all other avenues of relief and only if the defendant owes him a clear nondiscretionary duty.heckler,at.
we turn then to the exhaustion issue.the exhaustion requirement serves an important purpose,preventing the premature interference with agency processes so that the agency can function efficiently and can correct its own errors,as well as affording the parties and the courts the benefit of the agency experience and expertise and compiling a record which is adequate for judicial review.weinberger salfi,d.the obvious problem for michael reese is its failure to pursue its prrb appeals relating to the cost reports for fy.once michael reese obtained the administrative resolution of its base year appeal,it apparently believed that the fy appeals had been resolved as well.that belief was not without some basis,given that the revised napra included an attached schedule reflecting adjustments for each fiscal year from to.michael reese contends that there was nothing left to pursue.michael reese challenges to the fy cost reports were based upon its disagreement over the base year amount,which was applied to all of those years.the final rule made clear,however,that a challenge to the base year amount could only be made in a challenge to the base year,not in a challenge to subsequent years in which that base year amount was applied.with respect to the ensuing years,the rule stated that a provider could challenge the number of residents or the application of the.because michael reese had already resolved the base year appeal by administrative resolution and had no complaints about the number of residents or the application of the,it argues that there was nothing to be gained by pursuing the fy appeals.moreover,michael reese contends that there was no point in appealing the base year challenge or the fy challenges to the prrb,because it was fully satisfied with the settlement of that issue through the administrative resolution.finally,michael reese contends that the prrb could not have provided any relief even if it had pursued the fy appeals,because the prrb can only affirm,reverse or modify a determination of the intermediary,but has no enforcement authority.
although michael reese contends that the fy appeals were meaningless once the base year appeal was resolved,it provides no support for that contention,and the evidence of record points otherwise.the reminder letters from the prrb set forth the procedures to be followed in perfecting the appeal,and the options for the provider to pursue if it believed that the matter had been settled.most significant to this case,the reminder letters notified michael reese that if all issues had been settled but it had not yet been paid,it should notify the prrb.the prrb would then close the case,but would permit the appeal to be reinstated within one year if the provider had still not been paid.that mechanism set up by the prrb addressed precisely the situation here,in which a settlement had resolved the issues but the provider had not yet received payment.michael reese provides no explanation as to why this procedure would be inadequate to address its situation,nor has it indicated what that mechanism was designed to resolve if not this type of situation.michael reese instead asserts that the provision did not apply to it because only the base year appeal had been resolved by administrative resolution,rather than the fy appeals,and therefore it could not,in these appeals,notify the prrb of the settlement and take advantage of that window.
michael reese can not have it both ways.it filed separate appeals for the base year and for each of the fiscal years from so that it could challenge the base year amount and could also seek repayment for the fiscal years if it was successful on that base year appeal.either the administrative resolution of the base year appeal settled the fy appeals or it did not.if it did,then michael reese should have followed the procedures outlined in the reminder letter and notified the prrb that the issues had been settled but that it had not been paid.that would have given the prrb the opportunity to address the matter if,as it turns out,michael reese had still not been paid a year later.if the administrative resolution of the base year appeal did not settle the fy appeals,then michael reese should have pursued the appeals with the prrb in order to resolve the issues.michael reese can not plausibly argue that the base year appeal resolved the fy appeals and therefore there was no point in pursuing it further,and simultaneously assert that it could not have notified the prrb of a settlement because the settlement occurred only in the base year appeal.
moreover,that argument conflicts with both the complaint and the briefs,in which michael reese represents that the fy appeals were resolved by administrative resolution.for instance,the complaint alleges that michael reese exhausted its administrative remedies 
by filing cost report appeals with the secretary prrb,having them administratively resolved by the secretary agent,hcsc,and then asking that the subject cost reports be reopened to implement those administrative resolutions affecting michael reese gme calculation 
thus,michael reese in its complaint characterized the fy appeals as having been resolved by administrative resolution.the prrb,however,provided for the scenario in which all issues were settled but the provider had not been paid,and michael reese did not avail itself of that procedure.in choosing to abandon its appeal
