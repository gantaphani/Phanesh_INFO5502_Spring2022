relator thomas schell schell appeals from the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of battle creek health system battle creek in the underlying false claims act fca qui tam suit.schell central allegation is that battle creek violated the fca,by charging medicare for entire vials of anesthetic medication when less than the full vial of medication was administered to a patient.the district court below concluded that battle creek was entitled to summary judgment because schell failed to demonstrate that battle creek billing methodology resulted in increased payments by medicare.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of battle creek and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural history 
from to,schell was employed by battle creek as a certified registered crna.battle creek terminated schell employment in may as part of a plan to replace crnas with independent contractors.in march,schell filed the instant fca qui tam suit against battle creek and its owner,mercy health services.in his complaint,schell alleges that,during his period of employment,battle creek committed fraud by charging medicare for entire vials of anesthesia medication when only portions of the vials contents were administered to patients 
during schell employment with defendant,as well as before and after his employment,the defendant had been ordering vials of medication,administering a small portion of the medication in each vial to an individual patient,and then charging the patient for the entire cost of the vial the opened vial would then be kept,and additional portions of medication in it would be used for additional patients,charging each patient for the full cost of a vial.this was done for all patients at the hospital from through.
joint appendix at second am.compl.the united states was served with schell complaint but elected not to intervene.after a series of motions,the district court twice granted schell leave to file an amended complaint and ordered the dismissal of all claims against mercy health services.
a rule status conference was held with a magistrate judge in october,and shortly thereafter a order requiring battle creek to produce documents relating to its billing of anesthesia medications was entered.a second rule status conference was held in january,and the magistrate judge ruled that because schell allegations of fraud primarily arose out of battle creek adherence to a policy of charging medicare for entire vials of anesthesia medication,discovery should focus,at least initially,on the question of whether such a billing practice would in fact result in increased medicare payments to battle creek.both schell and battle creek commissioned reports addressing the impact of battle creek practice of billing for entire vials of anesthesia medication on payments made by medicare.at report and affidavit prepared by robert zielesch on behalf of battle creek at report and affidavit prepared by lawrence bara on behalf of battle creek at report and affidavit prepared by jack ahern on behalf of schell at report prepared by andrei costantino on behalf of battle creek.
after the experts completed their reports and were deposed,battle creek moved for summary judgment on the grounds that battle creek policy of charging for entire vials did not result in increased expenditures by medicare because medicare reimbursements for outpatients were calculated on a cost not charge basis.the district court granted battle creek motion and ordered the dismissal of schell suit.schell now appeals

medicare outpatient reimbursement system 
based on our review of the parties reports,it appears that the parties are in agreement as to the general procedures at issue in this case.under the medicare program,battle creek received reimbursements for covered outpatients expenses in two phases.first,after a patient had been treated,battle creek would submit a claim for reimbursement to medicare,and shortly thereafter medicare would issue an interim payment to battle creek.during the years at issue in this suit,medicare reimbursed providers for outpatient expenses based on the provider reasonable cost in furnishing such care because the amount battle creek charged for a service differed from the actual cost incurred by the battle creek in providing such a service,calculating the amount required use of a ratio that would convert battle creek charges into cost figures.ratios are determined based on the total charges and costs for an entire year,and thus battle creek ratio for any given year was unknown until the year was complete.hence,in calculating the interim payment due from medicare,battle creek used the prior calendar year ratio to estimate its cost in treating a particular medicare outpatient.
during the second phase,which could take years to complete the fiscal intermediary acting on behalf of medicare would review battle creek annual cost report and determine battle creek final ratio for that year.because the interim payments previously paid to battle creek had been calculated based on the prior year ratio,the interim payments received by battle creek could reflect an overpayment or underpayment by medicare.if battle creek received interim payments exceeding the total reimbursement amount for the year,battle creek would remit the excess to the government.conversely,if the interim payments received by battle creek were less than the total amount battle creek was owed for the year,medicare would pay any outstanding balance 
battle creek method of billing anesthesia medications 
while the parties appear to be in agreement as to the basic medicare reimbursement procedures at issue in this case,the parties sharply disagree as to the proper characterization of battle creek method for billing anesthesia medications and the impact that these billing procedures had on medicare payments to battle creek.schell contends that,by charging for an entire vial of anesthesia medication when only a portion of the vial had been administered,battle creek engaged in fraud by charging medicare for medication it d
