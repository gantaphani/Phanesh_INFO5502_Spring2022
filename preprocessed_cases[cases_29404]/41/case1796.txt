buser is subject to the nebraska licensing law,as he operates a surgical medical practice in lexington,nebraska,and is licensed in nebraska.prior to october,the board investigated a complaint made against buser,containing seven causes of action.based upon the board recommendation,the nebraska attorney general filed a petition for disciplinary action against buser.at the time of the investigation,raymond was the cmo.buser hearing,however,was conducted before hearing officer terry schaaf.after the hearing,both buser and the state submitted written summaries to raymond.raymond,as cmo,subsequently issued findings of fact and conclusions of law,dismissing two of the seven causes of action,limiting buser license to practice medicine for one year,and ordering buser to pay a civil penalty of within days of the date of the order.
both buser and the state appealed the decision to the district court of lancaster county under the administrative procedures act.the state court affirmed raymond decision.neither party took any further appeal.buser then filed this action in federal district court,alleging that his due process rights were violated by the named defendants.the district court granted appellees motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,finding that raymond was entitled to absolute immunity.
ii.discussion 
buser appeals the district court grant of absolute immunity to raymond,arguing that raymond,as cmo,is not entitled to absolute immunity because due process requires the presence of the cmo at physician disciplinary hearings and the disciplinary process contains inadequate safeguards,as the cmo sole function is to step in at the last stage of the process and issue his findings of fact,conclusions of law and disciplinary sanctions without ever participating in the hearing process.

i n a suit for damages arising from unconstitutional action,federal executive officials exercising discretion are entitled only to the qualified immunity subject to those exceptional situations where it is demonstrated that absolute immunity is essential for the conduct of the public business.butz economou,d.such exceptional situations include situations arising when executive department officials functionally serve in capacities comparable to judges,prosecutors and jurors.horwitz state bd.of med.exam rs of state of,cir.thus,officials performing actions are entitled to absolute immunity.vanhorn oelschlager,cir.
whether an executive official,body,or committee is entitled to absolute immunity turns on a number of factors,which are 
a the need to assure that the individual can perform his or her functions without harassment or intimidation b the presence of safeguards that reduce the need for private damages actions as a means of controlling unconstitutional conduct c insulation from political influence d the importance of precedent e the adversary nature of the process and f the correctability of error on appeal.
krueger lyng,cir quoting brown griesenauer,cir alteration in original holding that suspension hearing process was not an adversary one because petitioner was not given an opportunity to call witnesses of his own or to the witnesses against him instead,the testimony received was in the form of letters from disgruntled employees who were not present at the hearing and whose statements were not given under oath there was little probability that any errors in the committee proceeding,which limited its consideration to employee allegations against the petitioner,would be corrected on appeal because when the matter was heard by the hearing examiner,he too refused to permit evidence that would have tended to establish that the petitioner was discharged because of his activities and rather than functioning as a review board,the members of the committee acted simply as a discharging authority.
several of our sister circuits have addressed claims brought by physicians against state boards of medical examiners.every court of appeals that has addressed the issue has concluded that members of a state medical disciplinary board are entitled to absolute immunity for performing judicial or prosecutorial functions.ostrzenski seigel,cir citing.bd.of nursing,cir wang new hampshire bd.of registration in,cir watts burkhart,cir en banc bettencourt bd.of registration in med.of commonwealth of,cir horwitz,at.but see diblasio novello,cir holding that new york medical officials were not entitled to absolute immunity from radiologist due process claims arising from summary suspension of medical license even where an official is not a board member,and thus he is one step removed from the judicial function of the board,he nevertheless may be entitled to absolute immunity if he is engaged in a protected function.ostrzenski,at.
for example,in bettencourt,the first circuit held that a member of the medical board who weighs evidence,makes factual and legal determinations,chooses sanctions,writes opinions explaining his decisions,serves a set term and can be removed only for cause is functionally comparable to a judge.bettencourt,at.the court also determined that the act of revoking a doctor license is likely to stimulate a litigious reaction from the disappointed physician,making the need for absolute immunity apparent.id.finally,the court addressed the adequacy of procedural safeguards.id.the court explained that,after the hearing officer issued his decision,the board then reviews the hearing officer decision and issues its own final decision,which also contains a statement of reasons and a determination of factual and legal issues.id.at.in making its factual determinations,the board has to give substantial deference to the hearing officer credibility determinations but is f
