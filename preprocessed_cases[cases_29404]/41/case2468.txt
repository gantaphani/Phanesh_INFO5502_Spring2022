floyd wilkerson worked on a temporary basis at the cheyenne veteran affairs medical center as a boiler plant operator.following a failed physical examination,the human resources manager notified him that he was reassigned to a lower paid position.wilkerson brought suit against the secretary of the department of veterans affairs the va,claiming that this reassignment discriminated against him based on his obesity and diabetes,in violation of the rehabilitation act of,et,and that age discrimination played a role in his reassignment in violation of the age discrimination in employment act the adea,and a.wilkerson later tried to amend his complaint to allege that his health records were illegally accessed in violation of the privacy act.the district court granted summary judgment for the va on all counts and denied wilkerson motion for leave to amend the complaint to allege the privacy act claim.
because we find that wilkerson was not otherwise qualified to hold the position as required by the rehabilitation act,we affirm the grant of summary judgment as to this claim.we also affirm the district court grant of summary judgment as to his age discrimination claim because the va had a reason for removing wilkerson that was not pretextual.finally,because wilkerson has not alleged that the accessing of the records was intentional misconduct,as required by the privacy act,we affirm the district court denial of leave to amend the complaint.
background 
wilkerson is employed by the department of veterans affairs in cheyenne,wyoming.in february,he began work at the va as a boiler plant operator under a temporary appointment.when that appointment ended in july,the va hired wilkerson as a permanent employee in housekeeping.in february,wilkerson was temporarily reassigned once again to work as a boiler plant operator due to a shortage of employees.
va directives require that all boiler plant operators complete an annual fitness exam.in early,because of an apparent oversight,the va discovered that wilkerson had not completed an annual fitness exam up to this point.nurse practitioner ann enlow conducted wilkerson physical examination on february.the exam results noted that wilkerson was obese at,wilkerson weighed pounds and had diabetes.enlow forwarded her report to james johnson,an employee health physician at the.after reviewing enlow report,johnson accessed wilkerson electronic patient records wilkerson had sought medical treatment at the va for numerous years.from these records and enlow report,johnson concluded that wilkerson diabetes was largely uncontrolled and uncontrollable.
johnson spoke to the boiler room supervisors about the physical requirements of the job,as well as with members of the engineering department and human resources.ultimately,johnson concluded that wilkerson was unable to meet the minimum requirements of the boiler plant operator position.
the va center for engineering occupational safety and health ceosh has established guidelines for work as a boiler plant operator at a va facility.the guidelines state that applicants for all boiler plant operators and heating and boiler plant equipment mechanic positions must demonstrate to the occupational health provider satisfaction that they are capable of arduous physical exertion.aple app.at.such employees,the guidelines report 
frequently work in confined areas in and around boilers and support equipment.the work requires moderate to strenuous effort and long periods of walking,standing,climbing,bending and crouching.workers frequently lift and carry boiler parts and chemical supplies weighing up to pounds unassisted and occasionally items weighing over pounds with assistance of other workers or equipment.
id.the guidelines then state that any structural or functional limitation or defect that interferes materially with a high degree of physical activity will disqualify the individual and sets a number of criteria that are exclusionary,among these are u ncontrolled or poorly controlled diabetes.id.at.finally,boiler plant operators must have annual physical examinations to ensure physical fitness to perform assigned duties.id.
accordingly,johnson called sandra willoughby,the human resources officer for the va at the time,and told her that wilkerson had failed his physical,noting wilkerson uncontrolled diabetes and his concern about wilkerson ability to perform challenging physical tasks.willoughby told wilkerson that he failed his physical,and that he no longer met the environmental requirements for a boiler plant operator because he weighed over pounds and the ladders in the boiler plant only supported up to pounds.after he received the letter,wilkerson requested that special accommodations be made for his weight specifically he asked that the va purchase ladders that would support his weight.according to the deposition testimony of willoughby,the va considered this option but dismissed it because the other issues raised by the physical would still preclude his safe employment.id.at deposition of willoughby.willoughby informed wilkerson that the va was reassigning him back to housekeeping,effective the next day.id.at.
after wilkerson reassignment to housekeeping,his pay grade fell eight levels,from to,and his hourly pay decreased from an hour to an hour.
wilkerson brought suit against the department of veterans affairs secretary,james peake,alleging that the va had discriminated against him in violation of the rehabilitation act,that the va failed to accommodate his disability,et,and that he was unlawfully discriminated against based on his age in violation of the adea,and a.while the va summary judgment motions were pending,wilkerson asked for leave to amend his complaint to include a violation of the privacy act,alleging that johnson wrongfully accessed wilkerson private medical records.
the district court granted summary judgment for the va as to all of wilkerson claims.the district court also denied wilkerson motion for leave to file his amended complaint,ruling that any amendment would be futile.wilkerson now appeals.
ii.analysis 
rehabilitation act claim 
wilkerson alleges that he was reassigned based on his diabetes and obesity,in violation of the rehabilitation act.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.somaza of denver,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting.c.when applying this standard,we examine the factual record in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.belhomme widnall,cir.
to make out a prima facie case for discrimination in violation of the rehabilitation act,wilkerson must establish that he is disabled under the act that he would be otherwise qualified to participate in the program that the program receives federal financial assistance or is a federal agency and that the program has discriminated against the plaintiff.mcgeshick principi,cir.we apply the standards from the american with disabilities act in analyzing a rehabilitation act claim.g jarvis potter,cir we look to the ada for guidance in resolving rehabilitation act claims.
is wilkerson disabled under the act 
the first factor under the rehabilitation act is that the plaintiff must have a disability.the rehabilitation act defines the term disability to mean any of the following 
a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual 
b a record of such an impairment or 
c being regarded as having such an impairment.
see also eeoc interpretive guidelines for the rehabilitation act,b.to be substantially limited in a major life activity,an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people daily lives.toyota motor,williams,d.the impairment impact must be permanent or long term.id.in analyzing whether something is a disability the court looks to whether it is a physiological disorder or condition affecting one or more body systems,or any mental or psychological disorder.enwonwu hosp,app x,cir citing h.a medical diagnosis is insufficient,rather,the ada requires plaintiffs to offer evidence that the extent of the limitation caused by their impairment in terms of their own experience is substantial.id.
here there are two potentially qualifying disabilities obesity and diabetes.the question of whether the defendant is disabled was not decided by the district court.the district court stated that for the sole purpose of determining whether summary judgment is appropriate in this case,this court will assume that plaintiff has met his burden in proving that he is a disabled person.aplt app.at.on appeal,neither side has fully briefed this question nor is there a record on which to base a decision on whether wilkerson is disabled.further,we find other aspects of the analysis dispositive.thus,like the district court,we will assume that wilkerson has met this prong of the analysis.
is wilkerson otherwise qualified 
the rehabilitation act and the ada provide relief only to disabled persons who are otherwise qualified to perform the functions of the job.a.the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc is authorized by to promulgate regulations to implement the provisions of the ada.see.we give these regulations a great deal of deference.smith midland brake,cir citation omitted see sutton united air lines,cir.under these regulations,employers may set skill,experience,education and other job related requirements,including physical qualifications for the employment position.tate farmland indus,cir southeastern cmty.coll.davis,d an otherwise qualified person is one who is able to meet all of the program requirements in spite of his handicap.an employer,however,may not us e qualification standards,employment tests or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities unless the standard,test or other selection criteria,as used by the covered entity,is shown to be for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity.b see also exxon,cir the ada prohibits an employer from using qualification standards that screen out a disabled individual or class.citing b.additionally,any job requirement must be uniformly enforced.tate,at.assuming these requirements are met,we defer to employment guidelines as constituting a body of experience and informed judgment.id.at quoting united states mead,d quoting skidmore swift.
the district court found that wilkerson was not otherwise qualified for employment as a boiler room operator although the court assumes that the plaintiff is disabled,the court finds that summary judgment is appropriate in this case because plaintiff was not otherwise qualified for the position of boiler plant operator plaintiff was not discriminated against because of his weight.he simply failed to meet the minimum physical requirements of the position.because he could not meet these requirements,plaintiff was not otherwise qualified to be a boiler plant operator at the aplt app.at citations omitted.we agree.
ceosh guidelines for who could work as a boiler plant operator set a number of criteria that are exclusionary,and among these are u ncontrolled or poorly controlled diabetes.aple app.at.the job requires an operator who might be able at all times to respond to an emergency with some degree of physical agility.id.at.moreover,the job requires a fair amount of heavy lifting,bending,agility in movement and so forth.id.at,boiler plant operator physical requirements.thus,the question becomes whether these requirements are,uniformly enforced,and consistent with business necessity,tate,at if so,the employer has the right to establish what is required to satisfactorily perform the job.
all three elements for a valid physical fitness requirement are satisfied here.first,the guidelines are undisputedly they describe the duties of the job and then establish categories of individuals who are excluded based on this.for example,in the case of a shutdown or an emergency,an operator needs to be able to react swiftly to any emergency,such as an increase in pressure.aple app.at deposition of elvin wrede describing the process in case a shutdown is needed.further the daily responsibilities require that an operator be able to utilize pipe wrenches of varying sizes for removal or tightening of pipe fittings go up and down ladders to perform any required maintenance such as or tightening the packing on the valves,change relief valves,replace gaskets and tighten bolts on steam line flanges and react instantly to any dangerous situations that might occur.id.at declaration of elvin wrede.
next,the va uniformly enforced the boiler room operator guidelines the va requires that all boiler room operators undergo an annual physical examination and those who fail are subject to removal.aple app.at declaration of sandra willoughby,declaration of elvin wrede,deposition of elvin wrede see also id.at describing another employee who failed to meet the physical requirements and who was removed from boiler room duties.indeed,wilkerson makes no real argument that the va treated others in his situation differently.
finally,the guidelines are a business necessity.the requirements are minimal physical standards that a boiler room operator must meet.wilkerson supervisors testified that his responsibilities included being able to respond to warning bells and gauges,and that he needed to be able to climb ladders and go up and down stairs quickly.aplt app.at.although wilkerson testified that of his work was l ight duty,and he was only occasionally required to climb on ladders,in times of crisis,he might need to act quickly and move with dispatch.id.at.the va was within its power when it passed these guidelines and it is understandable for administrative ease and to ensure the uniformity of standards that it would desire to have guidelines that establish a limited class of individuals who do not qualify to work in boiler rooms at their facilities.
we acknowledge that wilkerson worked for two years at this position without incident.of course,wilkerson weight and health status during all of this time is unknown we only know that information as of february.but in any event,the requirements are there in case of an extraordinary but possible emergency,not necessarily to determine the ability to perform routine boiler plant operations.the fact that no such emergency occurred during wilkerson tenure and that he was able to perform his job is fortuitous but an employer may set standards not only for the mundane work but also for the exceptional.as long as the need to perform in an emergency is a realistic component of the job,the employer should be able to establish reasonable physical qualifications to ensure that an emergency situation can be dealt with safely and efficiently by the employee,especially in situations like here,where the physical safety of others may be at risk.southeastern cmty.coll.davis,at.
the record indicates that wilkerson would pose a danger to himself and others should he fall from a ladder.it also warns of potentially disastrous effects if he was unable to shut down a boiler if it malfunctions,leading to a possible explosion.for example,wilkerson supervisor,elvin wrede,stated that if one of the boilers was to explode from improper maintenance or operation,the force would bring down the entire building that houses them.aple app.at declaration of elvin wrede.thus,we agree with the district court that because wilkerson failed to meet the va boiler room operator safety standards he was not otherwise qualified as required by the rehabilitation act.
we have established that before an individual can be deemed not otherwise qualified the employer must make an effort to accommodate the employee disability.see woodman runyon,cir b a.we have held that federal employers,like the va,must play a considerable role in ensuring that every reasonable effort is made to find suitable jobs for disabled employees.see woo
