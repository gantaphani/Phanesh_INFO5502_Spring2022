this appeal arises from a challenge to that portion of the michigan medicaid plan methodology for calculating eligibility and benefits for relatives caring for dependent children that treats differently from parents.under michigan plan,medically needy caretakers of dependent children must incur a specific amount of monthly expenses for medical care before they are eligible to receive medicaid benefits the higher an applicant countable household income,the more money the applicant must spend down before benefits are available.when a parent caretaker applies for medicaid,michigan allows the parent to exclude from countable income an amount allocated for the care of the dependent children.however,those relatives acting as caretakers who apply for medicaid are not entitled to deduct a similar portion from their income to reflect the financial needs of the children under their care.as a result,caretakers pay a higher deductible in order to receive medicaid benefits than do parent caretakers.
this suit was brought by a class of medically needy grandparents who are raising their grandchildren because the children parents have died or are otherwise absent.on behalf of themselves and relative caretakers,the plaintiffs sued the directors of the michigan department of community health and the michigan family independence agency under,arguing that michigan policy of calculating medicaid eligibility and benefit levels differently for and parent caretakers violates the federal medicaid law and its implementing regulations.the defendants maintain that the distinction between parent and caretakers is justified because parents,unlike relatives,are legally responsible for the children financial needs.
although the district court agreed with the defendants that michigan interpretation of the medicaid statutes was not altogether unreasonable from a policy standpoint,the court held nonetheless that the policy,as implemented,violates several specific provisions of those statutes and the regulations promulgated pursuant to them.the district court therefore awarded summary judgment to the plaintiffs and permanently enjoined the defendants from using a methodology for relative caretakers that differs from the methodology used for parent caretakers.see markva haveman,d.
on appeal,the michigan agencies argue that the district court erred in failing to interpret these statutory and regulatory provisions in the context of the entire web of benefits provided to children and their caretakers.the defendants also argue that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate the injury necessary for standing because other welfare benefits that their grandchildren these children would not be entitled to receive if they were living with their the increases in the plaintiffs spend down obligations.
for the reasons set out below,we conclude that the district court properly interpreted and analyzed the relevant law.accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment.
background 
the federal medicaid program,established by title xix of the social security act,provides financial assistance to individuals seeking medical care,pursuant to.states receive federal assistance to administer their own individual medicaid plans however,in order for a state to receive federal assistance,its plan must meet the requirements of the social security act and the regulations promulgated by the secretary of health and human services.
at issue here is the caretaker relative eligibility category for medicaid benefits established by a ii.see markva,d at.caretaker relatives are or other close whom a dependent child is living.see id.at.the named plaintiffs in this case are grandparents who are raising one or more of their grandchildren because their grandchildren parents have died or are otherwise unable to care for them.see id.at.they are all medically needy,meaning that although their incomes are too high to entitle them to cash assistance under general welfare programs,they nonetheless qualify for medicaid because their incomes do not cover the costs of the medical care they need.see id.at.medically needy individuals qualify for medicaid by showing that their countable income minus their medical expenses falls below the applicable income limit,called the protected income level.if an applicant income exceeds the protected income level,then medicaid benefits are not triggered until the applicant incurs a specific amount of monthly expenses for medical care.see id.at.this deductible,referred to throughout this litigation as the spend down,is calculated as the difference between the applicant countable income and the protected income level.see.
michigan family independence agency program eligibility manual sets forth the policies that govern the caretaker relative medicaid category for recipients in that state.in calculating eligibility and benefit levels for those within this category,michigan does not include dependent children living in the home within the caretaker family group for medicaid purposes.accordingly,the protected income level of each caretaker does not rise with the number of children living in the household.however,when a parent caretaker applies for caretaker relative medicaid,the michigan agencies reduce the amount of the parent caretaker countable or budgeted income by a pro rata amount to account for the needs of each of his or her children.see markva,d at.because parent caretakers whose budgeted income exceeds their protected income are required themselves to pay medical expenses equal to the difference between the two the spend down,a lower budgeted income means a lower obligation.
the michigan agencies do not apply this proration methodology to caretakers who are not the biological or adoptive parents of the children under their care.in calculating the amount that a relative caretaker is required to incur before she can receive medicaid benefits,the defendants do not deduct from the caretaker budgeted income an amount attributable to the financial needs of the dependent children under his or her care.see id.at.as a result,caretaker relative medicaid applicants who are the parents of the children under their care are entitled to greater benefits than otherwise caretaker relative medicaid applicants who are not the biological or adoptive parents of the children in their household.the plaintiffs argue that michigan policy of treating parent and caretaker relatives differently violates the federal medicaid statute and its implementing regulations.
in granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs,the district court held that the defendants policy of using different methodologies violated federal medicaid law in three respects.first,the district court held that the defendants policy violated a c i iii and d,which require states to use a comparable methodology to determine the benefits for all persons within each category of assistance within an eligibility group in this case,all relative caretakers,whether parent or.see markva,d at.second,the district court found that the policy violated a c i ii and b,which require states to provide services that are equal in amount,duration,and scope for all recipients within the group of medically needy relative caretakers.see markva,d at.third,the district court held that the policy violated a c i iii and d,as modified by a,which require states to use a methodology for determining medicaid eligibility of relative caretakers that is no more restrictive than the methodology in effect on july,to determine cash assistance eligibility for the most categorically needy group.see markva,d at.however,the district court rejected the plaintiffs claim that the defendants policy violated the requirement in a that the state reasonably evaluate an applicant resources,finding that the defendants policy was not unreasonable per se.see markva,d at.
as a result,the district court permanently enjoined the defendants from using a methodology to determine the medicaid eligibility and benefit amount,including the monthly spend down amount,for the plaintiffs and the members of the certified class that is different from the methodology used to determine the medicaid eligibility and benefit amounts,including spend down amounts,for medically needy parent relative caretakers.the court also ordered the defendants to provide interim and final notification to all class members of the procedures necessary to obtain the correct amount of benefits.
following the filing of the defendants notice of appeal,the district court denied their request for a stay,but we subsequently reversed that order and entered a stay of the injunction pending appeal.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court order granting summary judgment,see johnson econ.dev,cir,and we affirm if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.when reviewing a motion for summary judgment,we view the evidence and draw all reasonable inference therefrom in the light most favorable to the party.see williams int l paper,cir.summary judgment must be entered against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.celotex catrett,d.
to prevail on a claim brought under,the plaintiffs must prove that the defendants acted under color of law and that the defendants conduct deprived them of a right,privilege or immunity secured by the constitution or the laws of the united states.see ahlers schebil,cir citing flagg,brooks,d.the defendants do not dispute that they acted under color of law.rather,they contest the district court determination that their failure to extend the proration methodology to as well as parent caretakers violated several provisions of the medicaid statute and implementing regulations.
does michigan policy violate medicaid statutory provisions and regulations 
the plaintiffs allege that the defendants policy violated a c i iii and d,which provide that if a state adopts a methodology to calculate medicaid benefits that is less restrictive than the one used for determining eligibility for the related cash assistance program in effect on july,then that methodology must be comparable for all applicants within an eligibility group.the plaintiffs also allege that michigan policy violated a c i iii and r,as modified by a,and d,which provide that the methodology used to determine medicaid eligibility and benefit levels for relative caretakers must not be more restrictive than the methodology in effect on july,to determine cash assistance eligibility for the most categorically needy group.the district court agreed with the plaintiffs on both counts.on appeal,the defendants contend that by not addressing these provisions in context,the district court failed to recognize that extension of the proration policy to caretakers would actually violate the medicaid statute and implementing regulations.we are unpersuaded by this argument.
the provisions in question tie the methodology for determining eligibility for medicaid groups to the methodology for determining eligibility for assistance under the welfare statutes in effect on july,the date on which the former aid to families with dependent children afdc program was superceded by amendments to the social security act.it is therefore necessary to understand how eligibility for afdc benefits was determined prior to that date.under the former afdc methodology,benefit levels for parents or into account the resources contributed by every member of the household and the needs of every member in the household,including children.for purposes of calculating the caretaker benefits,parents and were treated identically.a a,a.it was only in the context of calculating the benefit levels for children that the former afdc program treated parents and differently.if a family wanted to receive afdc cash assistance for a child living at home with a parent,then the parent was required to apply for afdc along with the child and the child siblings.see a.parents and children would necessarily all be considered part of the same afdc group,meaning that the parents income was always attributed to the child.if the child lived with a caretaker,however,the caretaker could choose whether to apply for afdc with the child or whether to apply for afdc for the child only.if the caretaker received little or no income,she would likely choose to be included in the child afdc group,for larger groups received greater assistance.on the other hand,if the caretaker income was above a certain level,she would most likely choose to apply for afdc benefits for the child only,so that the child would not be disqualified based on the caretaker income.michigan refers to this difference in the treatment of parents and under afdc as the financial responsibility distinction.
michigan current proration policy,adopted in,is less restrictive than the policy in effect on july,in two respects.first,whereas the prior methodology assume d that all of a parent s income was available to meet the needs of each child,the revision,in effect at the time that this action was filed,apportioned a parent income among the spouse and children supported by that parent.markva,d at.second,under the provision,unlike the earlier one,income deemed available to a child for the purpose of assessing the child eligibility for benefits is deemed unavailable to the parent when assessing the parent own eligibility for benefits.see id.
on appeal,the defendants do not dispute that the current policy is less restrictive than the policy in effect on july.rather,they take issue with the district court finding that the current policy is not comparable for all members of the eligibility group.the defendants argue that eligibility requirements and benefit levels are comparable for parent and caretakers to the extent they are financially responsible for children in their care.they cite the financial responsibility distinction recognized in the afdc program as precedent for treating parents and differently under the medicaid program.
we conclude that this argument is without merit.both parents and who care for dependent children are members of the caretaker relative medicaid eligibility group defined by a ii.see markva,d at citing a.there is simply no basis in the relevant statute or regulations to distinguish among individuals in the medically needy caretaker relative group based on financial responsibility or any other such criteria.see a c i iii a medicaid plan must include a description of the single standard to be employed in determining income and resource eligibility for all such groups,and the methodology to be employed in determining such eligibility emphasis added d the less restrictive methodology applied under this section must be comparable for all persons within each category of assistance aged,or blind,or disabled,or afdc related within an eligibility group.
the district court also properly found that the current methodology for determining medicaid benefits for caretakers is more restrictive than the methodology for determining afdc benefits for this class.under the former methodology,benefit levels for caretakers,like parents,were determined with reference to the income and needs of everyone in the household,including children.under the current methodology used for caretakers,by contrast,neither the income nor the needs of the children are taken into account in calculating the caretakers benefits,and neither the income nor the needs of the caretakers are taken into account in calculating the children benefits.as a result,as the district court found,the smaller group size for current applicants protects less income and results in fewer benefits due to the higher spend down amount that results.markva,d at.thus,a lthough children applicants for assistance in such households may be better off under the superceding methodology because income can not be deemed available to them,those that care for them,such as the plaintiffs in this case,do not fare as well.id.at.because the current methodology for determining the medicaid benefits of caretaker applicants is more restricti
