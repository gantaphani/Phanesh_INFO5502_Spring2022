eunice campbell appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to gambro healthcare,gambro on her claims of race discrimination under,and interference with and retaliation for taking leave covered by the family and medical leave act fmla under a.on appeal,campbell has abandoned her race discrimination claim,and challenges the district court judgment only as to her interference and retaliation claims under the fmla.we hold that when the employer cites only factors predating the employee return to work to justify the adverse action,the claim may be brought under either a retaliation or interference theory.evaluating campbell claim under both theories,we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm.
campbell began working for gambro as a patient care technician pct in april at its atchison,kansas clinic gambro is headquartered in denver,colorado,and operates a national chain of clinics providing renal dialysis and related services.the atchison clinic is relatively small,with an optimal capacity of to patients in fact,the clinic treated substantially fewer patients throughout campbell tenure.as such,the clinic was leanly staffed,employing a center director ilene dwyer,a registered nurse,and two pcts,of which campbell was one.the clinic employed a second pct,pat jackson,who had slightly more seniority than campbell due to prior work experience.
campbell duties included working under the nurse supervision to provide patient care operating,cleaning,and inspecting the dialysis machines monitoring patients during dialysis keeping patient records communicating patient statuses to the nurse and performing other functions as necessary.in addition to these core pct duties,campbell served as the clinic inventory technician and unit secretary.as inventory technician,she was responsible for tracking the clinic inventory utilizing an automated physical inventory computer system pics,recording inventory receipts,removing expired supplies from the shelves,and ensuring that the oldest supplies were used first.her primary duty was to match physical inventory on the shelves with inventory as reflected in the pics database.as unit secretary,she was responsible for maintaining accurate patient data,such as by preparing charts for new patients,adding new data for existing patients,coordinating patient mailings,and archiving old patient records.
on june,gambro promoted campbell to pct ii,a job title that reflected increased pay but no change in duties.throughout her employment,and before taking medical leave,campbell received high marks from her supervisors for her job performance.
beginning in may and extending through the date of campbell termination,the atchinson clinic suffered a steady decline in patients,with the number stabilizing at.rather than lay off either pct,gambro asked each to accept a reduction in hours,to per week,with the option to supplement hours at neighboring clinics.at a meeting in early august,richard pedrick,gambro regional director,met with dwyer,jackson,and campbell to discuss jackson and campbell options in the face of the dwindling patient count.jackson and campbell both chose to work a reduced schedule without seeking to supplement their hours elsewhere.by reducing labor and other costs,gambro managed to keep the atchison clinic afloat during this period,although it suffered a steep drop in profitability.
on or about october,dwyer went on vacation,leaving the director of the nearby joseph clinic,ruby thompson,in charge.three days later,campbell slipped and fell at her home,injuring her back and aggravating a preexisting degenerative back ailment.the record establishes that campbell did not call or send a text message to thompson prior to the start of her shift.both parties acknowledge that gambro policy requires an employee to notify a superior of her absence prior to the start of her shift.
on october campbell visited a doctor,who recommended she have surgery on her back.surgery was scheduled for november,and campbell applied for fmla leave,which was approved from october,through january.campbell leave was backdated to october,the first day she was absent from work.the next day,after hearing about campbell request for fmla leave,dwyer sent pedrick an email complaining that campbell was unreliable and had disturbed her vacation on account of her absence.at this point,dwyer did not know about campbell fall or the nature of her condition.
during campbell absence a pct from the joseph clinic,gaylene caples,was brought into the atchison clinic to assume campbell inventory duties.caples immediately discovered major problems with the clinic inventory.most significantly,she discovered a discrepancy between the inventory listed in the pics database and the items physically present on the shelves.gambro mandates that items used or delivered be entered into the computer system on a weekly basis,and that employees perform a physical inventory every month.campbell does not dispute that she failed to properly update the inventory system as required by gambro policy.
at the same time,another atchison employee,cindy keling,took over campbell unit secretary duties.keling noticed that several thousand sheets of old patient records were piled up in campbell back office.this was also a violation of gambro policy,which requires that inactive files be sorted and stored in file cabinets at the clinic or.keling spent approximately two months sorting and processing these records.campbell testified that the records were not processed because dwyer redirected her to other tasks.
on december,just before campbell was scheduled to return from fmla leave,she sent pedrick and dwyer an email inquiring about the possibility of supplementing her hours at joseph.pedrick emphatically rejected this idea,writing,not a good option in my opinion.
campbell returned to work on january.she learned that her hours had been reduced to per week from,and that she had been stripped of her unit secretary and inventory technician duties.it is undisputed that jackson,the senior pct,had also had her hours cut back due to a lower patient count.campbell received the same hourly wage and benefits she had received before taking fmla leave.
during her first day back at work,dwyer presented campbell with a corrective action form,stating that campbell had violated gambro procedure for providing notice of her absence on october.this was the first disciplinary action to which campbell had been subject.the form evidences dwyer annoyance that campbell interrupted dwyer vacation and closes as follows it caused a serious situation in the unit due to the other pct not having any training with inventory and unit secretary duties this has caused serious difficulties in the atchison unit for getting everything back up to date following the time span with no one taking care of the filing,campbell refused to sign the form,arguing that she had complied with policy by notifying thompson of her absence prior to the start of her shift.
pedrick sent campbell an email on january,informing her that gambro had decided it could only keep one pct at the atchison clinic,and that campbell was being terminated due to patient census and reimbursement concerns.jackson was selected to remain b ecause of recent performance concerns with campbell.specifically,the email cites campbell failure to perform her inventory technician duties and to properly notify thompson of her absence on october.pedrick gave campbell a choice she could either apply for a transfer to another gambro clinic or resign voluntarily,in which case she would receive six weeks severance pay and would be required to sign a release from legal action.campbell says she was under the impression that,pursuant to gambro policy,she was ineligible to transfer until six months had elapsed from the corrective action.gambro admits the existence of the policy,but pedrick testified that gambro was making an exception for campbell with regard to the transfer and severance pay policies.
campbell turned in her keys to dwyer on january.dwyer testified that campbell relinquishment of the keys signaled her resignation,and that campbell had asked for the six weeks severance pay,but refused to sign a release.campbell maintains that she never told dwyer she wanted to accept the severance pay and testified that she turned in her keys because her shift had been changed and she did not want to be questioned about being on the premises during.on january pedrick sent dwyer an email instructing her to start the process of ending campbell employment.two days later,campbell showed up for work for the final time,when dwyer again offered her the option of taking severance pay or seeking a transfer to another gambro clinic.campbell refused to sign any paperwork memorializing her termination and disputes dwyer characterization of their january conversation.
campbell subsequently filed suit against gambro in federal district court in kansas,alleging that gambro racially discriminated against her in violation of,interfered with her right to take fmla leave in violation of a,and retaliated against her for taking fmla leave in violation of a.the district court granted summary judgment to gambro on all claims,from which order campbell appeals.
campbell appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to gambro only as to her interference and retaliation claims.we review the district court summary judgment decision de novo to determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,viewing the record in the light most favorable to campbell.garrett,cir.
campbell asserts two alternate claims under the fmla that gambro interfered with her right to take fmla leave,in violation of a and that,upon returning to work,gambro retaliated against her for taking fmla leave,in violation of a.the two theories require different showings and differ with respect to the burden of proof.
to establish an interference claim,campbell must show that s he was entitled to fmla leave,that some adverse action by the employer interfered with h er right to take fmla leave,and that the employer action was related to the exercise or attempted exercise of h er fmla rights.jones denver pub,cir.to make out a prima facie retaliation claim,campbell must show that she engaged in a protected activity gambro took an action that a reasonable employee would have found materially adverse and there exists a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.metzler fed.home loan bank of topeka,cir.we have characterized the showing required to satisfy the third prong under a retaliation theory to be a showing of bad intent or retaliatory motive on the part of the employer.id.at quotation omitted.notably,we interpret retaliation claims under the architecture of mcdonnell douglas green,d,whereas the employer bears the burden of proof on the third element of an interference claim once the plaintiff has shown her fmla leave was interfered with.see metzler,at.due to this difference in where the burden lies with respect to the third element of each theory,it is not unusual for a plaintiff to pursue an interference theory while the defendant argues that the evidence may only be analyzed under a retaliation theory.
beyond differences in the elements and burdens of proof,the two claims differ with respect to the timing of the adverse action.in order to satisfy the second element of an interference claim,the employee must show that she was prevented from taking the full weeks of leave guaranteed by the fmla,denied reinstatement following leave,or denied initial permission to take leave.see,id.at holding that second element is satisfied when fhlb interfered with metzler right to take up to the twelve weeks to which she was entitled under a and denied her the right to be reinstated to her former position or an equivalent one upon her return to work a.in contrast,a retaliation claim may be brought when the employee successfully took fmla leave,was restored to her prior employment status,and was adversely affected by an employment action based on incidents her return to work.see,doebele mgmt,cir analyzing doebele fmla claim under a retaliation theory when she was restored to her prior position,but soon terminated for alleged attendance problems following her return.
the district court found an interference theory to be inappropriate on these facts,finding instead that campbell claims are more properly analyzed as a single retaliation as separate interference and retaliation claims.we disagree.when,as is the situation before us,the employer cites only factors predating the employee return to work to justify the adverse action,the plaintiff is not foreclosed from bringing an interference claim.to hold otherwise would create a perverse incentive for employers to make the decision to terminate during an employee fmla leave,but allow the employee to return for a brief period before terminating her so as to insulate the employer from an interference claim.
although it vacillated on this point at oral argument,gambro final explanation of campbell termination is limited to factors predating her return to work.by fall of,the declining patient census allowed for only one pct to continue employment as between jackson and campbell,gambro chose jackson due to her seniority and campbell inadequate performance as unit secretary and inventory technician.pedrick,who was responsible for setting staffing levels at the atchison clinic,had concluded by the end of that the clinic could only support one pct.although in august pedrick chose to allow the two pcts to work reduced hours rather than to terminate either one,he stated in his affidavit that by july it was determined that it might be necessary to lay off one of the pcts,unless one of the pcts would work at another clinic.tellingly,pedrick did not increase jackson hours to compensate for campbell absence,but instead reduced jackson hours from to.
gambro does not argue that any new facts regarding staffing needs at the atchison clinic came to light during the period after campbell returned to work.nor does it argue that its understanding of campbell failures as unit secretary or inventory technician changed meaningfully between campbell return to work and her termination.although the record shows that pedrick and dwyer offered campbell the opportunity to explain those problems after she returned,it would be a synthetic view of the facts to interpret gambro decision to terminate her as motivated by the inadequacy of her explanations.rather,it was the fact of her poor performance as unit secretary and inventory technician,discovered in late october,that partly motivated gambro to choose jackson over campbell as the clinic sole pct.accordingly,campbell termination was a foregone conclusion by the time she returned to work,and her restoration to her prior duties during the period of january,was illusory on these facts,campbell has satisfied the second element of her interference claim,and may proceed on that claim irrespective of whether she was,in fact,restored to her prior duties.
we now turn to the question of whether the district court properly denied campbell summary judgment on her fmla claim under an interference theory.as campbell has satisfied the first two elements,we must determine whether,viewing the record in the light most favorable to campbell,a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the employer action was related to the exercise or attempted exercise of campbell fmla rights.jones,at.once a plaintiff has proved that her employer has interfered with her right to take fmla leave,the employer bears the burden of proving that an employee,laid off during fmla leave,would have been dismissed regardless of the employee request for,or taking of,fmla leave.smith diffee,cir citing a.however,we have held that an employee who requests fmla leave would have no greater protection against his or her employment being terminated for reasons not related to his or her fmla request than he or she did before submitting the request.gunnell utah valley state,cir.
reviewing the record as a whole,we determine that gambro has met its burden on the third element,and that no genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to its reasons for terminating campbell.ample undisputed evidence points to gambro difficulties
