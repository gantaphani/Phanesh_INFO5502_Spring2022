edmund chein chein seeks review of the revocation of his practitioner registration and the denial of his application for a registration to export schedule iii and schedule iv controlled actions taken by the united states drug enforcement administration dea.the dea deputy administrator da found that it was not in the public interest to renew chein practitioner registration or to grant him an export registration because he provided several undercover agents with anabolic steroids to enhance athletic performance committed a number of record keeping violations ordered controlled substances using an unauthorized dea registration number illegally imported controlled substances from an unregistered mexican pharmacy and illegally shipped controlled substances to hundreds of overseas patients without a dea export registration.moreover,the da found that chein continued to dispense controlled substances even after his dea registration had been suspended and continued to export controlled substances even after being informed by dea that it was illegal to do so.for the reasons set forth below,we deny his petition.
chein is the owner of the palm springs life extension institute pslei in palm springs,california.he is a physician,having graduated in from the american university of the caribbean school of medicine.he also holds a law degree.edmund chein,revocation of practitioner registration,denial of application for exporter registration.chein is licensed to practice medicine in california and in utah and was,before the proceeding under review,registered with dea to dispense controlled substances schedules ii through v.see gov t ex.gx.chein purports to be one of the world leading authorities in the field of medicine.chein br.he believes that every adult experiences hormone level reductions over time and those reductions coincide with outward and inward signs of aging.id.chein claims that through gradual increases in hormones to those approximating youthful levels,along with exercise and diet modification,individuals can slow the process of aging and delay the onset of,or prevent,conditions.id.this is accomplished through the administration of very low doses of hormones over an extended period of time,accompanied by continued monitoring of baseline hormone levels until they slowly rise to approximate levels of a healthy young adult.id.at.chein calls the practice total hormone replacement therapy.thrt.id.at.according to chein,thrt differs from traditional gastroenterology in that a physician administers hormones when they are less than those common in people of comparable age in thrt,by contrast,a physician administers hormone s when levels drop below those of a typical healthy young adult.id.at.he asserts that n o patient has ever complained about his practice.id.at.
chein has had a tense history,however,with the california medical board cmb,dea and law enforcement in general the cmb has taken action against chein medical license three times.in,the cmb revoked chein license,stayed the revocation and put him on probation for failing to obtain a business license and for falsely advertising himself as a physician and lawyer when he had never obtained a license to practice law.chein med.bd.of,at,gx.in the cmb again revoked chein medical license,charging that he had prescribed human growth hormone for a patient without medical indication and had made false and misleading statements in certain publications and advertisements about hormone replacement therapy.id.at.chein challenged the revocation in state court and was successful in part.id.at.the cmb and chein ultimately entered into a settlement agreement revoking chein license,staying the revocation and suspending chein from the practice of medicine for months with credit for months already served.gx,at gx,at.
in,the cmb initiated a third disciplinary action against chein alleging,inter alia,that he had prescrib ed human growth hormone without a good faith examination and medical indication,fail ed to maintain adequate and accurate records,obtained controlled substances by deceit,misrepresentation and subterfuge and dispensed controlled substances without proper privileges.in re edmund chein,accusation,filed.the cmb and chein eventually settled this dispute as well,noting that the settlement was intended to resolve,in addition to the cmb disciplinary action,any disciplinary action taken by another state or the federal government based on the conduct alleged in the august,accusation.in re edmund chein,stipulated settlement disciplinary order filed.under the settlement,the cmb revoked chein medical license,stayed the revocation and placed chein on probation for five years 
chein has also had a long history with dea.in and,investigators from dea,the food and drug administration fda and the united states customs service customs conducted a series of undercover visits to pslei.during the visits chein dispensed and prescribed human growth hormone hgh and anabolic steroids to the investigators ostensibly to improve athletic performance on may,fda obtained a search warrant for pslei.see search warrant,may.fda and dea investigators who conducted the search seized various anabolic steroids.tr.although dea regulations require a registrant to maintain purchase records,an inventory and a dispensing log at his registered address see,no such records were found during the search.tr.
on july,chein applied to renew his dea practitioner registration.see gx.because chein california medical license was revoked at the time,his application received close scrutiny.on january,dea diversion investigator di doris desantis,accompanied by di linda martin,visited pslei to interview chein,inspect his clinic and review his records.tr.chein was not there at the time and the two met instead with darryl physician practicing at pslei.garber informed di desantis that he could not provide the biennial inventory and dispensing logs because they were stored electronically and none of the employees on duty knew how to access pslei computer system.id.at.another pslei employee informed di desantis that the purchase invoices were stored with pslei accountant.id.at.garber was eventually able to provide only two invoices,both for the purchase of phentermine a schedule iii controlled substance.id.at.di desantis informed garber that dea regulations require records to be readily available for inspection and copying and that invoices be stored.id.at see also infra note.
five days later,di desantis and di martin returned to pslei to review the records that were not available during their earlier visit.id.at.again,chein was not present.id.at.garber asked the investigators to wait while he retrieved the records.after two or three hours he returned with a computer generated inventory report,id.at gx,dispensing logs for phentermine and various forms of testosterone,id.at gx,and four purchase invoices for phentermine,id.gx the documents revealed several irregularities.dea regulations require a registrant to maintain most records for two years for inspection and copying by dea employees,a however,the dispensing logs garber produced covered only the period from july,to february.see tr.gx.in addition,the dispensing logs indicated that during the period,pslei physicians had dispensed controlled substances times to patients in foreign countries,including france,germany,great britain,spain,switzerland,china hong kong,indonesia,japan,south korea and canada see gx.neither chein nor garber had an export registration required to dispense overseas.see gx see also.moreover,some shipments went to countries where the products were illegal.see,gx c garber acknowledged that i n japan and korea it is against the law to prescribe anabolic steroids and phentermine for the purpose of medicine.citations omitted see also e registered exporter required to file export declaration with dea indicating importation is not contrary to the laws or regulations of the country of destination for each shipment.the dispensing logs garber produced indicated that pslei physicians regularly dispensed various forms of testosterone,see gx,but garber did not provide any purchase invoices therefor.tr.finally,the four phentermine purchase invoices indicated that pslei employees had been ordering the controlled substance with an unauthorized dea registration number.each of the invoices contained the dea registration number of connie chein,chein physician sister.see gx.although connie chein owned pslei for approximately months during when her brother california medical license was revoked she denied that she gave her brother permission to use her dea registration or that she was aware that anyone at pslei had used her registration to order controlled substances.see gx.
on march,di desantis telephoned garber at pslei to inquire about the shipments of controlled substances listed in the dispensing logs outside the united states.see tr.garber confirmed that pslei was shipping controlled substances overseas.id.at see also.at that time di desantis instructed garber to immediately cease the shipments because no one at pslei had a dea export registration.id.at later that day,pslei staff faxed di desantis copies of purchase invoices for testosterone which had not been produced during her february,visit.tr.again,the records appeared to be incomplete.the earliest invoice was dated november,see gx k however,the dispensing records indicated that testosterone had been dispensed for several months before november.see gx,at 
on august,di desantis and di violeta willmont finally met with chein.tr.chein acknowledged not having a dea export registration however,he claimed that because he was shipping controlled substances directly to overseas physicians,he did not need an export registration.id.at he told di desantis that he had continued to export controlled substances despite her earlier instruction to garber.id.at.chein told di desantis that he did not plan to stop exporting until he received something in writing from dea.id.at.he did not tell her that he had applied for an export registration.id.at.during the meeting chein provided her with additional purchase invoices for controlled substances.one of the invoices,dated june,was for the purchase of units of and units of decadurabolin both schedule iii controlled substances from a pharmacy in tijuana,mexico.see gx tr.chein was not then or since registered with dea as an importer.gx tr.on august,di desantis instructed chein by fax that,because he was not registered to import or export controlled substances,he must immediately cease all acitivity sic in these areas as previously instructed.id.
on november,dea issued an order to show cause requiring chein to show why his practitioner registration and his pending application for renewal should not be denied on the ground that his continued registration was inconsistent with the public interest under f and a.gx.dea also issued a notice of immediate suspension informing chein that his registration was immediately suspended as an imminent danger to the public health and safety under d.id.di desantis delivered both documents to pslei on november,tr,and,while there,inspected additional purchase invoices.one invoice dated march,indicated that two kilograms of testosterone had been purchased using connie chein dea registration.gx a.three invoices indicated that garber had been receiving shipments of testosterone at his home and not at his registered address,pslei in violation of e and.see gx b,c,d g.
subsequently di desantis conducted three trash runs searching garbage left for collection at pslei.tr.she found paperwork showing chein continued to export controlled substances even after she had ordered him to cease further exporting.see,gx,invoice for shipment of phentermine and testosterone to patient in japan gx,instruction,signed by chein,ordering shipment of testosterone to second patient in japan.following these discoveries,dea obtained an administrative inspection warrant for pslei.gx.dea agents executed the warrant on march,seizing pslei dispensing logs,patient records for approximately overseas patients and samples of controlled substances.tr.the records showed that chein regularly exported controlled substances for almost three months after di desantis first instructed him to stop in august,see,gx,and that several of the exports took place even after chein received dea notice of immediate suspension.gx,at noting eight exports by chein on november,and five on november.
a dea administrative law judge alj held a hearing on january,september and december.on july,the alj issued her recommended decision.in re edmund chein,recommended findings of fact,conclusions of law,and decision of the administrative law judge july,alj.the decision concluded that chein continued registration was against the public interest and also recommended that his application for an export registration be denied.alj.three years earlier,on may,dea had issued a second order to show cause directing chein to show cause why his application for an export registration should not be denied.see alj.on february,the da issued the final agency order revoking chein practitioner registration and denying his pending export registration application.at.chein then filed a timely petition for review pursuant to.
chein raises a host of objections to the da analysis as well as to the procedure employed during the alj hearing we have considered all of chein objections on the briefs and at oral argument and conclude that only the first merits discussion.in morall dea,we vacated dea revocation of a physician registration because dea had consistently declined to revoke the registration of any other physician in a comparable context,or even under significantly more troubling circumstances and because dea offered no explanation for the departure from its precedent.id.at we first explained that under the administrative procedure act,a,the da choice of sanction is entitled to substantial deference and will be set aside only if her decision is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.at quoting tourus records,dea,quoting a.ordinarily,the mere unevenness in the application of a sanction will not render its application in a particular case unwarranted in law.id.at quoting butz glover livestock comm,d first alteration in morall.if the revocation represents a flagrant departure from dea policy and practice,however,and if the departure is not only unexplained,but entirely unrecognized in the da decision,the agency sanction can not withstand abuse of discretion review.id.at.
addressing morall first factor,we believe chein has failed to demonstrate that dea has a consistent policy of allowing a practitioner to retain his registration under similar circumstances.the numerous cases in which chein claims dea has allowed more egregious violators to retain their registrations are easily distinguishable from his in each of the cases,the da,using the public interest standard,imposed a sanction less than revocation primarily because the practitioner had corrected the prohibited practices,accepted responsibility for his or her conduct,cooperated fully with dea and,where applicable,sought treatment for drug or alcohol addiction underlying the violation not so here.chein can not credibly claim that he has cooperated with dea given his continued exporting of controlled substances after he was repeatedly informed that it was illegal to do so,as well as his continued dispensing of controlled substances even after his dea registration was suspended.nor has chein accepted responsibility for his misconduct as evidenced by,inter alia,his continued insistence that his dispensing of anabolic steroids to the undercover agents was proper and his providing misleading information to dea investigators.see supra notes.moreover,we note that chein engaged in a persistent course of misconduct which,at the time of the notice of immediate suspension,spanned at least seven years.see morall,at noting morall failures occurred during a relatively brief time period because chein has failed to demonstrate that his revocation represents a flagrant departure from dea policy and practice in analogous cases,morall,at,we need not reach the question whether dea adequately explained the departure.id.accordingly we deny
