larry bellum appeals the decision of the district court granting summary judgment to pce constructors,pce on bellum federal claim under the family and medical leave act fmla,et,and on his pendent mississippi law claims for both the intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
pce is in the construction industry and does work primarily on a basis its principal place of business is baton rouge,louisiana,though it takes on projects across several southern states.during the time giving rise to the events in this case,pce was building a facility for fabricated pipe,inc fpi in fernwood,mississippi.pce was also involved in helping fpi establish its pipe fabrication business.
pce hired bellum,who had worked for pce on a before,on december,to manage a particular project at the fpi site in fernwood.pce had a staff of at its headquarters in baton rouge and at the fpi site.bellum testified in his deposition that he drove each day between his home in baton rouge and fernwood,a of about miles.the distance between pce headquarters and fpi is between and linear miles but miles over public roadways 
on december,bellum told his supervisor,charles gibson,that he was taking leave from work to have surgery.bellum last day was december.bellum contends that while he was on leave for his heart surgery,gibson repeatedly told both him and his wife that a job was waiting for him at the fpi site.following his recovery from heart surgery,bellum visited the fpi site on march,to investigate returning to work.gibson apparently told him there was no longer any work for him because bellum project was completed in his absence.the two remained in touch over the next two weeks discussing work possibilities,but bellum was formally terminated on march,without ever having returned to work.
on march,bellum filed the instant suit in the district court seeking relief under the fmla and for state law claims of emotional distress.on april,the district court granted summary judgment to pce on the ground that bellum was not an eligible employee under the fmla.the district court also concluded that,absent a duty under the fmla to rehire bellum,pce was free not to rehire him because mississippi is an employment state.it follows from this,the district court reasoned,that bellum could not succeed on his claim that he suffered actionable emotional distress when pce chose not to rehire him.it is from this disposition that bellum now appeals.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the district court.faris williams,cir.we examine questions of law de novo and construe disputed material facts in favor of the.id.
b.the fmla 
the fmla provides,inter alia,an eligible employee with a total of workweeks of leave during any period b ecause of a serious health condition.a d.the parties do not dispute that bellum heart problems qualify as a serious health condition.what they do dispute,however,is whether bellum is an eligible employee.pce maintains that bellum falls within one of two enumerated exceptions to the definition of eligible employee 
any employee of an employer who is employed at a worksite at which such employer employs less than employees if the total number of employees employed by the employer within miles of that worksite is less than.
b ii.this exception applies,pce contends,because its headquarters,as measured over public roads,is more than miles from the fpi worksite bellum counters that the exception does not apply because the linear distance,as the crow flies,between fpi and the baton rouge headquarters is less than miles.
the district court resolved this controversy by consulting b,which states that the distance is measured by surface miles,using surface transportation over public streets,roads,highways and waterways,by the shortest route from the facility where the eligible employee needing leave is employed.the regulation goes on to provide that the distance should only be measured as the crow flies when there is no available surface transportation between worksites.id the district court granted summary judgment to pce because,under the method of measurement set forth in the regulation,bellum was not an employee.because the fmla speaks simply of miles,not surface miles,bellum urges us to strike down b as manifestly contrary to the plain language of b ii.
we review federal regulations of the sort at issue here under the familiar chevron doctrine.if a statute is unambiguous,then the statute prevails over an inconsistent regulation.chevron,natural resources defense council,d if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.citations omitted.to ascertain whether the statute has spoken unambiguously to the question at issue,we avail ourselves of the traditional means of statutory interpretation,which include,see,dynamics land,cline,d,the text itself,its history,and its purpose.while the distance set forth in the statute is not inherently ambiguous,we disagree with bellum that the failure of congress to stipulate a method of measuring that distance implies that it should be measured as the crow flies.to measure in linear terms as bellum suggests would regularly conduce to absurd results and no canon of statutory construction requires us to honor plain language when to do so would frustrate the unmistakable purpose of the law.hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d stating that when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states ron pair enterprises,d in turn quoting caminetti united states.harbert healthcare services group,cir stating,as one of its reasons for striking down an fmla regulation,that no deference is owed to an interpretation of the statute that makes arbitrary distinctions.
the error in bellum approach may be illustrated as follows.suppose that company a had its headquarters along the south rim of the grand canyon and a branch office on the other side only miles away as the crow flies.suppose further,quite plausibly,that the shortest distance between the two by public roads is miles.now,imagine that company b has its headquarters next to a interstate highway and a branch office miles away also right along the interstate.under bellum reading of the statute,company a would be bound by the fmla but company b would not be.given that the purpose of the exception at b ii is to relieve the burden of fmla compliance on companies with widely dispersed operations,it would make no sense to construe the statute in a way that subjects company a but exempts company see moreau air france,cir concluding that the purpose of the exception was to accommodate employer concerns about the difficulties that an employer might have in reassigning workers to geographically separate facilities.quoting,pt,at b it is the purpose of this act to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers.see also harbert,at making use of a similar hypothetical to illustrate an arbitrary and capricious interpretation of the fmla.we conclude,therefore,that the decision of congress not to define a method of measuring the distance constitutes an implicit statutory gap the secretary of labor is authorized to fill by see note,supra 
when congress has left an implicit gap such as this one,the question before us is simply whether the regulation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron.at.in answering this question,we consider only whether the regulation is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the fmla.id.we may not substitute our own preference for a reasonable alternative devised by the secretary of labor.id.the secretary judgment that a particular regulation fits within the statutory framework of the fmla must be given considerable weight.ragsdale wolverine world wide,d.this is the essence of what is known as
