plaintiff andrew harley speaker speaker sued the defendant united states department of health and human services centers for disease control and prevention cdc for violating the privacy act,by disclosing his identity and confidential medical information relating to the treatment of his tuberculosis.plaintiff speaker appeals the district court grant of defendant cdc motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.after review and oral argument,we reverse.
background 
speaker amended complaint 
in this rule b context,we start by outlining the allegations in plaintiff speaker amended complaint,which seeks to recover damages under the privacy act.
speaker first tested positive for tuberculosis in march.in april,after undergoing tests and treatments,speaker received a preliminary susceptibility test result suggesting an elevated diagnosis of tuberculosis.
during the course of speaker treatment,several cdc employees became aware of his intention to travel to europe in may for his wedding ceremony and honeymoon.speaker cites records of cdc officials acknowledging the upcoming trip as evidence that the cdc was planning treatment options around these travel plans.cdc officials were also aware that speaker doctor at the fulton county health department tuberculosis program was advising further care at the national jewish medical and research center in denver upon speaker return.this contradicted later public statements by the cdc that it had no knowledge of speaker travel plans.
in the days leading up to his departure,speaker claims health officials repeatedly gave assurances that he was not contagious or a threat to anyone,and that no public health official advised him against traveling abroad.on may,speaker departed for europe.
soon afterwards,the cdc lab received test results indicating increased resistance to drug treatments.the cdc then reclassified speaker tuberculosis as extensively tuberculosis,a more virulent strain.on may,speaker was contacted in europe by bob cooksey,a microbiologist in the cdc division of tuberculosis elimination about a change in test results.speaker immediately contacted david kim,a cdc employee,who informed him that the cdc had elevated his tuberculosis diagnosis to.kim allegedly informed him that,while his treatment options would change,he remained.
nevertheless,the cdc forbade speaker from flying on a commercial airliner.kim notified speaker that the cdc was making arrangements to fly him back to the united states.the next day,however,kim informed speaker that the cdc did not have money in its budget to pay for the flight.kim gave speaker two options he could charter a private flight if he wished to return to the united states for treatment,or he could check into an italian hospital the next day.
although he had been told by his doctor that the national jewish medical and research center in denver presented his best treatment option,speaker could not afford a chartered flight to the united states.faced with the prospect of indefinite detainment in italy,and relying upon the statements of health officials that he was not contagious,speaker elected to disregard the cdc travel instructions and booked a flight to montreal on a commercial airliner.speaker then crossed the border by car into the united states,notifying the cdc of his whereabouts.the cdc directed speaker to check himself into bellevue hospital in new york city,which speaker did.at bellevue,speaker was served with a federal quarantine order,the first imposed on a united states citizen since.speaker subsequently received treatment at grady memorial hospital in atlanta and the national jewish medical and research center in denver.
upon being hospitalized,speaker alleges that the cdc caused personally identifiable information about him to be improperly disclosed without his consent to law enforcement officials,the news media,and the general public as a result of the deliberate actions of the cdc and its employees or agents.am.compl.speaker accuses the cdc of causing the following disclosures of his personally identifiable information 
a public disclosures to the international news media during press conferences and interviews held on or about may and,june,and july and,
b upon information and belief,other disclosures by cdc agents or employees to members of the media during the time frame of said public press conferences and interviews,including but not limited to information that enabled the media to ascertain speaker identity and whereabouts on or about may,and to publish his name on and after may,
c upon information and belief,disclosure of speaker identity to law enforcement officers who in turn leaked his identity to the associated press between may and may,
d upon information and belief,confirmation of speaker identity to the associated press between may and,
e upon information and belief,other disclosures made as part of a media campaign directed toward speaker and his disease that will be identified through discovery and proven at trial.
although speaker amended complaint alleges the cdc caused disclosures,speaker elsewhere in the amended complaint refers to the cdc making the aforementioned disclosures about speaker.id.emphasis added.other examples make clear that speaker alleges direct disclosures of his identity by the cdc.see,id.referring to the cdc intentional,unauthorized disclosure of plaintiff confidential medical history id.referring to the cdc unlawful disclosure of speaker identity and private health information to the world media id.referring to the cdc highly publicized release of speaker private information id.stating that t he aforementioned disclosures by the defendant cdc about plaintiff andrew speaker and his status as a tuberculosis patient resulted in the release of private identifiable information id.referring to identifiable private information that the defendant released about speaker,including but not limited to his identity,his occupation,his city of residence,his wedding travel plans,his medical history,and his present medical status id.stating that unauthorized disclosures of speaker identifiable private information by a federal agency charged with the responsibility of maintaining the confidentiality of that information constituted a violation of the privacy act id.referring to the cdc intentional,unauthorized disclosure of speaker identifiable private information id.referring to identifiable private information released to the world media by the cdc id.referring to identifiable private information released by the cdc 
ultimately,speaker diagnosis proved erroneous,and his tuberculosis was downgraded back to.
cdc motion for summary judgment 
on april,plaintiff speaker filed his original complaint.on june,defendant cdc filed an answer.immediately after answering,the cdc,on july,filed a motion to stay the proceedings and a motion for summary judgment,arguing that speaker failed to satisfy the elements of a privacy act claim and under eleventh circuit precedent,speaker could not recover damages under the privacy act.the cdc attached a statement of material facts about which there is no genuine dispute and various exhibits,including the cdc statements at press conferences and the contents of newspaper articles 
in response,speaker filed motions opposing the stay and summary judgment.he supplied a statement of material facts and a response to defendant statement of facts,along with a rule f affidavit requesting discovery.
the district court ruling referenced the contents of some of the cdc exhibits,so we recount them here.
one cdc exhibit was the transcript of the cdc first press conference on may.in that press conference,cdc director julie gerberding stated that the tuberculosis patient in question,whom she did not identify by name,departed atlanta on may,traveling to paris on air france flight and returned to the united states on may,taking czech air flight from prague to montreal,and crossing the border by car.martin cetron,the cdc director of the division of global migration and quarantine,identified atlanta as the patient home.
the cdc also attached as an exhibit an atlanta article that appeared within hours of the cdc may press conference.the article revealed that the tuberculosis patient participated in a telephone interview with the newspaper,on condition of anonymity,and reported that he was presently under federal quarantine at grady memorial hospital in atlanta.
another cdc exhibit was a transcript of its press conference on may.in this second press conference,the cdc cetron provided additional information about the patient flights,including approximate numerical figures of passengers and crew members potentially affected.cetron also listed the patient seat number as on the czech air flight from prague to montreal.the cdc did not identify speaker by name in the press conference,but did identify both his flight and seat number.
the next day,the associated press ap published an article,which the cdc also filed as an exhibit,that identified speaker by name.the ap may article announced that speaker was a personal injury attorney who practices law with his father in atlanta.the ap story stated that speaker identity was provided to the ap by a federal law enforcement official and confirmed by a medical official in atlanta who,along with the law enforcement official,spoke on condition of anonymity 
after speaker was identified as the tuberculosis patient on may,he appeared on television.the cdc included as an exhibit the transcript of a june,good morning america episode on abc,in which diane sawyer interviewed speaker.now that his identity had been revealed,speaker in this interview revealed details about his tuberculosis diagnosis.the cdc included transcripts of subsequent national media interviews in which speaker participated,along with the transcript of speaker testimony before congress on june.the cdc also attached as exhibits transcripts of its june,press conference and media interviews in which the cdc participated on july and july.throughout these media events,the cdc did not use speaker name,even though his identity had been widely revealed at this point.
district court status conference 
on august,the district court conducted a telephonic status conference with counsel for the parties.the main issues in the conference related to what losses are recoverable under the privacy act and what discovery could be sought.the cdc counsel invoked the precedents of bell atlantic corporation twombly,and ashcroft iqbal,as a rationale to deny speaker rule f discovery request.the cdc contended that speaker had not properly alleged the statutory elements of a privacy act violation,nor had he identified the nature of the wrongful disclosure.the district court inquired why the cdc filed a motion for summary judgment when it was alleging pleading inadequacies 
after lengthy exchanges with counsel for both parties,the district court denied speaker request for discovery at this juncture and temporarily stayed the case the court,however,allowed speaker the option of filing an amended complaint to add factual specificity necessary to survive a rule b c motion under the pleading standards set forth in twombly and iqbal.
final proceedings 
on august,plaintiff speaker filed an amended complaint,which we recounted above.on september,defendant cdc filed a motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,a motion for partial summary judgment.along with its motion to dismiss,the cdc attached another statement of material facts about which there is no dispute,in addition to essentially the same exhibits that were attached to its earlier motion for summary judgment.among the new exhibits,however,were videos of the may and may,cdc press conferences,which reflect the cdc statements recited above 
in a november,order,the district court granted the cdc motion to dismiss speaker amended complaint under rule b for failure to state a claim.the court denied the cdc other motions as moot.speaker hhs cdc,d.speaker timely appealed.
ii.standard of review 
motion to dismiss 
we review de novo a rule b dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim.see rosenberg gould,cir.in ruling on a b motion,the court accepts the factual allegations in the complaint as true and construes them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.hill white,cir.
exhibits relating to cdc motion to dismiss 
in appeals of rule b dismissals,it is generally true that the scope of the review must be limited to the four corners of the complaint.george pinellas,cir.if matters outside the pleadings are presented by the parties and considered by the district court,the rule b c motion must be converted into a rule summary judgment motion.d.this court,however,has recognized an important qualification to this rule where certain documents and their contents are undisputed 
in ruling upon a motion to dismiss,the district court may consider an extrinsic document if it is central to the plaintiff claim,and its authenticity is not challenged.sfm holdings,banc of am.secs,llc,cir see also harris ivax,cir stating that a document central to the complaint that the defense appends to its motion to dismiss is also properly considered,provided that its contents are not in dispute.in its order,the district court relied upon defendant cdc supporting exhibits and its statement of material facts about which there is no genuine dispute derived in part from those exhibits.because the materials relied upon by the district court are not disputed at least at this juncture and because they are central to plaintiff claim,we similarly incorporate their contents to determine whether speaker has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim under the privacy act 
pleading standard under twombly and iqbal 
in conley gibson,the united states supreme court instructed that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.id.at.at.in,the supreme court in bell atlantic corporation twombly,retired conley no set of facts test in favor of a new formulation of rule b pleading standard.id.at.at.
in twombly,the supreme court distinguished plausible claims from allegations that were merely conceivable,and stated that the court did not require heightened fact pleading of specifics,but only enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.id.at.at.the supreme court explained that a complaint does not need detailed factual allegations,but the allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.id.at.at.furthermore,a complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable,and that a recovery is very remote and unlikely.id.at.at quotation marks omitted.
subsequently,in iqbal the supreme court clarified that a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.at.at see also watts.int l,cir the court has instructed us that the rule does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage,but instead simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the necessary element.quoting twombly,at.at.given the twombly and iqbal plausibility standard,we turn to whether speaker amended complaint states a claim under the privacy act.
iii.discussion 
four elements of a privacy act claim under g d 
in congress enacted the privacy act to protect the privacy of individuals identified in government information systems by regulating the collection,maintenance,use and dissemination of personal information and prohibiting unnecessary and excessive exchange of such information within the government and to outside individuals.cochran united states,cir.the privacy act imposed upon federal agencies an array of obligations to prevent unauthorized disclosures of confidential information.it also created a private right of action,enabling citizens to sue when privacy act violations occur.g.
specifically,the privacy act contains a provision allowing an individual to bring a civil suit when an agency fails to comply with the privacy act in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual.g d a civil plaintiff may recover actual damages,attorney fees,and costs under this subsection,but the court must first determine that the agency acted intentionally or willfully.see g.
in fanin dep t of veterans affairs,this court summarized the four elements necessary to bring a claim under g d 
the plaintiff must demonstrate that the government failed to fulfill its obligation the agency acted intentionally or willfully in failing to perform its obligation the failure proximately caused an adverse effect on an individual and that individual suffered actual damages.
cir citing perry bureau of prisons,cir,cert.denied.
therefore,to state a valid claim under the privacy act,speaker must establish these four elements the cdc failed to fulfill its obligation,g d it did so deliberately,g speaker suffered an adverse effect from this disclosure,g d and he suffered actual damages,g a.
moreover,given the pleading standards announced in twombly and iqbal,speaker must do more than recite these statutory elements in conclusory fashion.rather,his allegations must proffer enough factual content to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.twombly,at.at.accordingly,to state a claim,speaker must do more than allege that the cdc did not fulfill its obligation.speaker must allege the specific nature of the obligation the cdc failed to satisfy.
the obligation at issue here is outlined in b,which states that n o agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person,or to another agency,except by the individual written consent or if one of twelve statutory exceptions are met.b.the privacy act defines a record as 
a ny item,collection,or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency,including,but not limited to,his education,financial transactions,medical history,and criminal or employment history and that contains his name,or the identifying number,symbol,or other identifying particular assigned to the individual,such as a finger or voice print or a photograph.
a emphasis added.meanwhile,the act defines a system of records as a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number,symbol,or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.a.
accordingly,the cdc did not fulfill its obligation if it disclosed a any item,collection,or grouping of information b that contains and is retrievable by speaker name or an identifying number,symbol,or other identifying particular assigned to speaker c within its system of records d by any means of communication e to any person or agency.
speaker amended complaint 
reading speaker amended complaint as a whole,we conclude that it both alleges the requisite statutory elements and marshals enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.twombly,at.at.
whether speaker allegations satisfy elements two,three,and four in the fanin test is not the main focus of the appeal.we review elements two,three,and four and then turn to element one,the cdc obligation.
as to the intentionality requirement in element two,speaker expressly alleges that the cdc unauthorized disclosure was intentional.am.compl.see also id.stating that improper disclosures were a result of the deliberate actions of the cdc and its employers or agents id.alleging that cdc disclosures were part of a media campaign directed toward speaker id.stating that a t all times relevant herein,the cdc acted wilfully and intentionally in connection with the aforementioned disclosures id.referring to cdc unauthorized disclosure as intentional.
as to the adverse effect required in element three,the supreme court has stated that the adverse effect language of the privacy act is a term of art identifying a potential plaintiff who satisfies the and causation requirements of article iii standing,and who may consequently bring a civil action without suffering dismissal for want of standing to sue.doe chao.speaker has alleged numerous injuries sufficient to satisfy both article iii standing and the adverse effect element of the privacy act.see,am.compl.alleging marital dissolution caused by cdc unlawful disclosures id.stating that speaker was subjected to public criticism and forced to defend the false allegations being made against him id.alleging unwanted public attention,death threats,and strain on his marital relationship id.alleging damage to his personal and professional reputation id.alleging grave mental anguish and emotional distress.
as to the actual damages requirement in element four,this court has held that actual damages as used in the privacy act permits recovery only for proven pecuniary losses and not for generalized mental injuries,loss of reputation,embarrassment or other injuries.fitzpatrick irs,cir,abrogated on other grounds by doe chao,at.at.speaker allegations,taken as true for purposes of a rule b motion,satisfy this requirement.see,am.compl.alleging that speaker suffered both pecuniary and losses id.alleging that cdc disclosures had a substantial economic and noneconomic impact upon his livelihood,including loss of prospective clients as an attorney id.alleging considerable economic and damage to his personal and professional reputation.
the crux of the cdc arguments on appeal concerns element one of the fanin test whether the cdc failed to fulfill its obligation.as to this element,speaker amended complaint sufficiently states a claim as well.
at the outset,speaker alleges that the cdc disclosed an item,collection,or grouping of information about speaker.among other allegations,speaker claims that the cdc disclosed his confidential medical history,am.compl,one of the expressly enumerated items listed in the privacy act definition of record.see a.speaker also alleges that the defendant cdc maintained a system of documents and records containing sensitive private information,including medical history and other protected health information,identifiable to specific individuals including speaker.am.compl.emphasis added.that cdc medical records contain the individual name and are retrievable by name is hardly surprising.and speaker expressly alleges that these records were contained within the system of records maintained by the cdc.am.compl.speaker further alleges that the unauthorized disclosures were made to person s,particularly law enforcement officials,members of the media,and the general public.am.compl.
the cdc main argument here is that speaker amended complaint impermissibly equivocated on the issue of whether the cdc itself disclosed his name.the cdc cites,in particular,paragraph of the amended complaint,which alleges that the cdc caused personally identifiable information about speaker to be improperly disclosed.am.compl.the cdc,however,reads the amended complaint far too narrowly.nothing in the transitive verb cause necessitates the intervention of a third party,as the cdc seems to imply.
even if a substantive difference arguably exists between causing disclosures and making disclosures,any pleading infirmity is obviated by the fact that speaker later refers to the cdc making the aforementioned disclosures about speaker.am.compl.emphasis added see aldana del monte fresh produce,cir stating that,in a rule b context,w e read the complaint as a whole.as recounted earlier,speaker amended complaint in multiple places refers to the cdc making the disclosures or to the cdc unlawful disclosures of speaker private identifiable information.
the district court stated,what is clear from the allegation itself is that speaker identity was not disclosed by the cdc or any other person.if speaker was identified by a news agency,it was because it discovered speaker identity using other information sources.speaker,d at.this statement gives credit only to speaker indirect disclosure theory and does not fully take into account the instances throughout the amended complaint in which speaker alleges a direct disclosure by the cdc.of course,whether speaker can ultimately prove his allegations is another matter 
twombly and iqbal plausibility analysis 
furthermore,plaintiff speaker has pleaded enough factual content to nudge his claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.twombly,at.at.importantly,speaker allegations are not barren recitals of the statutory elements,shorn of factual specificity.see id.at.at stating that a plaintiff obligation to provide grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions,and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do quotation marks and brackets omitted.
rather,speaker alleges what the cdc disclosed namely,personally identifiable information,including information relating to his medical history and his testing and treatment for tuberculosis.am.compl.moreover,he alleges when the cdc disclosed this information namely,during the time frame of said public press conferences.am.compl.speaker amended complaint narrows the time frame of the cdc initial disclosures to a short period in late may.speaker also expressly identifies one news organization to whom disclosure was made namely,the associated press,which he claims received the leaked information between may and may.id importantly,speaker has also alleged with factual specificity how the cdc came into possession of this information.even the cdc does not dispute that it had the information that speaker alleges was impermissibly disclosed.and there is no doubt that some entity,or its employees,disclosed speaker identity,since not even the cdc contends that speaker himself revealed this information before the ap may article.
defendant cdc asserts that the factual scenario in this case largely mirrors the pleadings in twombly.we disagree.twombly involved a claim by plaintiffs that telecommunications providers violated the sherman act,by conspiring to enter into agreements not to compete in each 
other respective territories.at.at.the supreme court stated that mere parallel activity that is unfavorable to competition,absent some factual context suggesting agreement,was insufficient to withstand rule b dismissal,since such parallel activity was equally consistent with lawful independent action.id.at.at.in twombly,doubt encompassed not merely who entered into an agreement,but whether such agreement existed at all.the only lingering uncertainty here,by contrast,concerns whether it was a federal agency namely,the cdc or a very limited number of other health institutions that divulged speaker identity.
speaker provides greater factual specificity than the twombly plaintiffs and,by extension,a more plausible claim,such as by alleging an extremely determinate and compressed span of time in which the violations took place.for example,a fair reading of the amended complaint indicates that the cdc allegedly leaked his identity to the media sometime between the day it found out about his elevated diagnosis may,and the day the ap publicly revealed his identity may,and most likely during the period between its first press conference may,and the ap story may.this contrasts markedly with the long and nebulous time frame in which an agreement was alleged to have occurred in broad window which would have necessitated sprawling,costly,and hugely discovery.twombly,at.at.
moreover,the short time frame alleged by speaker is not only factually specific,but it is also more suggestive of a causal nexus between the cdc press interaction and the exposure of speaker identity.although several health institutions treated speaker in atlanta,there are,at this juncture at least,no allegations of press conferences or such press interaction by those other atlanta entities around the time his identity was revealed.this close temporal relationship between the time of the cdc press interaction and the discovery of speaker identity is far removed from the factual allegations in twombly 
speaker need not prove his case on the amended complaint must merely provide enough factual material to raise a reasonable inference,and thus a plausible claim,that the cdc was the source of the disclosures at issue.speaker has met this burden.
iv.conclusion 
accordingly,we reverse the district court dismissal of speaker amended complaint and remand for further proceedings.
reversed and remanded.

speaker amended complaint also alleges an indirect disclosure of his identity by the cdc in its press conferences.see am.compl.claiming that disclosures at cdc press events would have allowed him to be readily identified even if his identity had not been directly disclosed by the cdc.such cdc disclosures included details of speaker medical history and his alleged medical condition including the dissemination of a detailed timeline of his medical treatment,the fact that he had flown to greece to get married,and the fact that he was a lawyer in atlanta.id.this indirect disclosure allegation,however,does not annul the allegations of direct disclosure contained throughout the amended complaint.speaker amended complaint also alleges an indirect disclosure of his identity by the cdc in its press conferences.see am.compl.claiming that disclosures at cdc press events would have allowed him to be readily identified even if his identity had not been directly disclosed by the cdc.such cdc disclosures included details of speaker medical history and his alleged medical condition including the dissemination of a detailed timeline of his medical treatment,the fact that he had flown to greece to get married,and the fact that he was a lawyer in atlanta.id.this indirect disclosure allegation,however,does not annul the allegations of direct disclosure contained throughout the amended complaint.
