on january,michael reed sued his former employer,the lear corporation lear,under the family and medical leave act fmla.see et.he alleged that lear violated the fmla when it fired him for absences he incurred in reliance on lear representation to him that he was on provisional fmla leave.on january,the district court granted lear motion for summary judgment.reed appealed.we affirm.
in august,reed began working at lear plant in bridgeton,missouri,which supplies car and truck seats to chrysler.reed worked on an assembly line as a rear seat assembler.his job involved heavy lifting and significant bending and twisting,and over time he developed back problems.in,reed began seeing a chiropractor,colaneri,as a result of his back deteriorating condition.colaneri diagnosed reed with arthritis,a bulging disc,and a lesion on his spine.the record indicates that reed was frequently absent from work during this period.
in august,lear implemented a new attendance policy in response to an ongoing absenteeism problem at its bridgeton plant.approximately to percent of the plant employees were absent on a daily basis.under the old policy,lear would excuse absences if the employee provided a timely doctor note.the new policy was a no fault point system,under which each day of absence would be penalized three points regardless of the reason for the absence.if an employee missed up to three consecutive days due to illness and substantiated the illness with a doctor note,lear would record the absences as a single incident and assess only three points.accumulating points in any period would result in the employee termination.the new attendance policy excepted vacation days and leave from the point system.
reed entered the new system with eight points assessed against him as a result of being subject to disciplinary sanctions under the old system.after the implementation of the new system on august,reed absences continued.on september,lear notified reed in writing that he was at risk of termination due to excessive absences.after this first warning,reed continued to miss work.lear warned him again on october,that he was close to exceeding the threshold.at this point,he had accumulated points.
around the time of this second warning in october,reed visited the company nurse.the nurse suggested that he apply for fmla leave and directed him to the human resources department to obtain the paperwork.the packet of paperwork contained information on how to fill out the necessary forms and directed employees to call the bridgeton plant human resource specialist,scott patsaros,if they had any questions about their request for fmla leave.information in the packet stated that incomplete forms would not be reviewed and that an employee must provide a medical certification from a licensed health care provider attesting that the employee is unable to work due to illness or injury.it also stated that any time an employee took off before official approval for fmla leave would not be protected if the request for leave was ultimately denied.
after picking up the fmla packet on october,reed continued to miss work.reed submitted his request for fmla leave,along with a medical certification form filled out by colaneri,on october.he sought fmla protection for future absences as well as his absences incurred after october.on the form,colaneri indicated that reed was not presently incapacitated and that it was not necessary for reed to work less than a full schedule.at his deposition,colaneri acknowledged that,at the time he completed the forms,he believed that reed could perform the essential functions of the job.
on november,reed was given a letter from patsaros denying his request for fmla leave and explaining that his request had been denied because colaneri had not indicated that his condition necessitated time off from work.lear human resources manager,ron conrad,also notified reed that he was being terminated due to excessive absences.however,lear rescinded reed termination on november,as a result of a rollback of attendance points.lear reinstated him on november,with attendance points assessed against him.
on the day of his reinstatement,reed resubmitted his fmla request with a second medical certification form filled out by colaneri.this second form also failed to contain a certification that reed could not work due to his back problems.on the form,colaneri stated that he could not determine the full extent of reed problems until after reed scheduled visit to a neurosurgeon on november.
on november,the day of his scheduled visit with the neurosurgeon,reed received a second letter from scott patsaros rejecting his november,fmla request.the letter stated,in pertinent part 
under the act,once an event takes place that the employee believes may fall under the fmla,the employee has to inform their employer that it may be fmla qualified and acquire the necessary paperwork.the company can not at this time recognize that any such event has happened within a window prior to the receipt of the paperwork,therefore,the company is not obligated to honor the certification.the certification makes note that an upcoming doctor appointment will take place nov,that may make known the full impact of your condition.with the above situations in mind,once you know the impact of your condition,any possible time away from work,and the reasons for the time away from work,the company will acknowledge a certification that was acquired within the window as noted above.
the letter goes on to state 
any time off you declare as family medical leave prior to notification by the company of provisional fmla or an official approval will not necessarily be protected under the act.you must meet the stipulation above before any consideration for family medical leave will be given.
reed took this letter to his union steward,nick badolato,because he was confused as to its meaning.reed then went with badolato to the human resources department to ask about the meaning of the letter.they found several people in a meeting in a conference room,and badolato entered the room to ask about the letter.reed stayed outside the room with the door open.he claims that although he did not observe the conversation,he overheard someone in the room tell badolato that his request had not been denied and that he was on provisional fmla leave.
according to reed,the person who made this statement was joel kato.kato was not responsible for handling individual requests for fmla leave,but handled the implementation of the fmla program.during the relevant time period,scott patsaros was responsible for handling individual fmla requests at lear bridgeton plant.at his deposition,reed stated that he was told by his union representative that he was going to see kato and that he recognized kato voice while listening outside the conference room.however,in his affidavit he avers that he later learned his name was joel kato and that he was an hr manager for lear.reed did not contact patsaros about the meaning of the letter.he submitted no affidavit or deposition of badolato to the district court.kato stated during his deposition that he did not recall the conversation with badolato.
reed missed work on december,and.these absences increased his attendance points to,and lear terminated him on january.he never submitted any details about his visit with the neurosurgeon on november.
on january,reed filed a lawsuit,alleging that lear should be estopped from denying that his absences were protected under the fmla by virtue of the statements reed overheard kato make to badolato during their conversation about the second letter.reed did not contend that lear improperly denied him leave for which he was eligible.reed also alleged that lear violated the fmla when it refused to designate retroactively his december absences as vacation days.on january,the district court granted lear motion for summary judgment.the district court found that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to reed equitable estoppel claim,the lawsuit was barred by the fmla statute of limitations,and lear did not violate the fmla by refusing to designate retroactively reed december abse
