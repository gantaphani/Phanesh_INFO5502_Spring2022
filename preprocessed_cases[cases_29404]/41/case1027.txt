mingus is a prisoner confined at the robert cotton correctional facility correctional facility in jackson,michigan.butler,a registered nurse,was the health unit manager at the correctional facility in,the relevant year for the allegations underlying this case.
in may,mingus,who suffers from macular degeneration and other physical infirmities,filed a civil rights complaint against butler and eight other defendants,alleging violations of the eighth amendment,the ada,and state law.the complaint was based on the defendants alleged deliberate indifference to and negligent treatment of mingus various medical conditions and denial of his requests for a room with locks.the district court,adopting the magistrate judge report and recommendation,granted in part and denied in part the defendants dispositive motions.specifically,it denied butler qualified immunity on mingus eighth amendment claim and rejected her sovereign immunity defense to an ada suit in her official capacity.report and recommendation at,mingus antonini.the parties subsequently stipulated to dismissal without prejudice because the complaint contained unexhausted claims.
in october,mingus filed suit against butler under for violations of the eighth and fourteenth amendments and under the ada.he sought declaratory relief,a prospective injunction requiring the correctional facility to provide him with a room,and damages.the exhibits attached to the complaint document mingus medical history,communications with butler and her subordinates,and his appeals through the administrative process.on march,mingus wrote to butler,notifying her that because he could not see his locks,he was unable to protect his property.in that letter,he remarked,i am not helpless,and i see the larger world well enough to fend for myself.it the little stuff and things a few feet away i ca see.he complained of other inmates,especially ones,receiving rooms when he did not.in her medical notes,one of butler subordinates wrote that inmate does meet criteria for single man cell and recommended that mingus receive locks.in late march,mingus again wrote to butler regarding his circumstances,indicating his intent to grieve her decision and clarifying that his complaint is not just that i ca see my locks,because i vulnerable in many other ways.in response,one of butler subordinates again wrote in her medical notes,correspondence from inmate stating he is upset he can not have single room inmate does not meet criteria for single man room.discussed this situation with butler throughout the administrative grievance process,mingus continued to assert that he feared that he could not protect himself from other inmates and that their predation is the direct result of my disability.
on february,butler moved for summary judgment on all counts of the complaint.she moved on six grounds title ii of the ada does not permit suits for damages against a state official in her individual capacity title ii of the ada does not permit suits for damages against a state official in her official capacity if they are based on a theory of equal protection the eleventh amendment bars suits for damages against a state official in her official capacity she was entitled to qualified immunity on mingus eighth amendment theory mingus fourteenth amendment claims fail under rational basis review and mingus could not make a showing of irreparable harm necessary to warrant injunctive relief because he received his locks.
butler supplemented the administrative record of mingus grievance with a prison policy directive and guidelines document.the former directed prison health personnel to identify reasonable options available in a corrections setting to accommodate a prisoner with a special medical need.the latter set forth the criteria the prison used in assigning rooms.specifically,it listed certain medical conditions,such as gender identity disorder,which may require a single person cell.although macular degeneration was not listed,the document also allowed that the outpatient mental health team may order a single person cell for reasons other than those listed above but consistent with their guidelines.
the magistrate judge recommended dismissal of mingus individual capacity ada claim,official capacity claim,and request for injunctive relief regarding the issuance of locks.however,he permitted the rest of mingus claims to proceed.specifically,he reasoned that title ii of the ada abrogated state sovereign immunity in official capacity suits under the supreme court holding in united states georgia.relying upon the district court orders in the lawsuit,he held that butler was not entitled to qualified immunity because there were disputed issues of material fact regarding the scope of her supervisory authority at the correctional facility,her alleged deliberate indifference to mingus medical conditions,and her possible awareness of the substantial risks that mingus inability to see created for him and his property.the magistrate judge then ruled that mingus fourteenth amendment claims could proceed because a jury could find that butler had no rational basis for denying mingus a room when,according to mingus uncontradicted allegation,other similarly disabled prisoners were given such rooms.finally,he allowed mingus to pursue injunctive relief regarding his request for a room.
butler timely objected to the report and recommendation and argued that the magistrate judge misconstrued the holding of georgia,incorrectly analyzed qualified immunity,misapplied fourteenth amendment analysis,and improperly the discretionary decisions of prison administrators by allowing mingus to pursue prospective injunctive relief.on september,the district court rejected all of butler objections and adopted the report and recommendation in full with emphasis on the importance of georgia.butler then timely appealed and,before us,mingus moved for appointment of counsel.
we address,in turn,butler assertions of qualified immunity to mingus eighth amendment claim and eleventh amendment immunity to the ada claim,her appeal of the district court denial of summary judgment on the equal protection claim,and mingus motion for appointment of counsel.
