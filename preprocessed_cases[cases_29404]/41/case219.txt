the question presented is whether a regional diagnostic and treatment center which treats only ambulatory patients and has an emergency room independent of a hospital is subject to the requirements of the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala.
the district court,ruling on a suit by the parents of a old baby girl who died after being seen in the emergency room of a diagnostic and treatment center centro de diagn√≥stico y tratamiento cdt in corozal,puerto rico,held that an emtala suit was actionable.we accepted the district court certification of this dispositive issue of law for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.we reverse,and order dismissal of the suit.
the plaintiffs,a married couple,had a daughter,lilliam diaz rodriguez,who was born on october,with a combination of congenital cardiovascular defects which made her prone to cyanosis.
lilliam vomited twice on march,and was taken by her mother to the emergency ward at the corozal cdt at pm for respiratory difficulties.the emergency ward doctor at the cdt decided to transfer the child to the pediatric hospital at the puerto rico medical center and inserted an endotracheal tube in lilliam.at am the next morning the child was transported to the puerto rico medical center with generalized cyanosis,and lilliam died sometime after arriving there.
the plaintiffs filed a federal suit for damages against corporacion de servicios integrales de salud del area de barranquitas,corozal,naranjito y orocovis corporacion,the owner of the corozal cdt,and american international insurance company of puerto rico aiico,corporacion insurer the plaintiffs asserted federal subject matter jurisdiction by alleging that the defendants violated emtala by failing to provide the child with an appropriate medical screening examination so as to detect her emergency condition and by failing to stabilize the child condition properly before transferring her.see a c.the complaint also alleged a puerto rico law claim of medical malpractice by the defendants,and invoked the federal court supplemental jurisdiction.
the defendants moved for summary judgment.the defendants,inter alia,denied the existence of federal subject matter jurisdiction,contending that emtala does not apply to the allegations in the complaint because the corozal cdt is not a hospital within the meaning of emtala.
the district court denied the defendants motion for summary judgment on may.in its opinion and order,the district court concluded that the provisions of emtala apply to cdts in puerto rico that offer hour emergency room services,and that consequently,plaintiffs have a colorable claim under said statute.
the defendants then sought to certify the district court order for interlocutory appeal.after initially denying the motion,the district court ultimately certified the jurisdictional issue of whether the provisions of emtala are applicable to cdts for consideration before this court.pursuant to b,this court allowed the interlocutory appeal after both appellants and appellees stipulated that the following facts are not disputed

in congress enacted emtala in large part to solve the problem of dumping of uninsured problem of hospital emergency rooms refusing to treat or transferring indigent patients to public hospitals without first assessing stabilizing the patient condition.see correa hosp.san francisco,cir.emtala imposed some limited substantive requirements on emergency rooms of hospitals participating in the federal medicare program.specifically emtala requires that a participating hospital afford an appropriate medical screening to all persons who come to its emergency room seeking medical assistance,and if an emergency medical condition exists,the participating hospital must render the services that are necessary to stabilize the patient condition unless transferring the patient to another facility is medically indicated and can be accomplished with relative safety.id.at a c.
emtala created a private cause of action for damages for violations of the act against participating hospitals.d a.congress conditioned those hospitals continued participation in the federal medicare program on acceptance of the duties imposed by emtala,n eeding a carrot to make providers more receptive to the stick.correa,at.
the question of law posed by this case is whether a cdt,defined by puerto rico law as an independent facility which provides community services for the diagnosis and treatment of ambulatory patients under the professional supervision of persons licensed to practice medicine,surgery or dentistry in puerto rico,laws ann.a qualifies as a hospital that has a hospital emergency department under emtala,a it is undisputed that the corazal cdt is an independent facility and is not attached to a hospital.cdts are unique to puerto rico and are limited health facilities that offer only outpatient services such as dentistry,and laboratory services.
it is clear that emtala does not apply to all health care facilities it applies only to participating hospitals with emergency departments further,the screening requirement under emtala only applies to patients seeking treatment at the emergency room,not elsewhere in a hospital.see hawayek,cir baber hosp.of,cir.it follows that if the corozal cdt is not a hospital,emtala can not apply to it.
as an amendment to the social security act,emtala incorporates the act definition of a hospital.see jackson east bay,cir correa,at looking to the social security act definition of state law as the term is used in emtala.that definition of hospital set forth in includes,in relevant part 
e hospital.the term hospital means an institution which 
is primarily engaged in providing,by or under the supervision of physicians,to inpatients a diagnostic services and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis,treatment,and care of injured,disabled,or sick persons,or b rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured,disabled,or sick persons 
and,in the case of an institution in any state in which state or applicable local law provides for the licensing of hospitals,a is licensed pursuant to such law or b is approved,by the agency of such state or locality responsible for licensing hospitals,as meeting the standards established for such licensing 
e.the corozal cdt plainly does not meet these requirements,for at least two reasons.first,it is not primarily engaged in providing diagnostic and therapeutic or rehabilitation services to inpatients,as required by subsection e.the cdt is engaged entirely in outpatient,ambulatory care.
second,even if the requirement of subsection e were met,the other requirements of subsection e must be met as well.puerto rico law does not license or characterize cdts as hospitals.indeed,puerto rico law clearly distinguishes between hospitals and diagnostic and treatment centers.compare laws ann.a defining a hospital as an institution which renders services to the community providing medical surgical diagnosis treatment for illnesses or injuries obstetric treatment to hospitalized patients emphasis added,with laws.ann.a defining a cdt as an independent facility or one operated in conjunction with a hospital which provides community services for the diagnosis and treatment of ambulatory patients under the professional supervision of persons licensed to practice medicine,surgery or dentistry in puerto rico emphasis added.even if a cdt provides emergency services,that does not make it an emergency room of a participating hospital.
the district court recognized that under normal circumstances,the court would agree that a clinic,which is really what a cdt is more akin to,does not fall under the auspices of emtala.as a resu
