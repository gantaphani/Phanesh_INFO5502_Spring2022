plaintiffs,the operators of a nursing facility that receives reimbursement for services under the new york state medicaid plan,appeal from a judgment entered on october,in the southern district of new york conti,judge,following a grant of summary judgment in favor of the new york state department of health department on plaintiffs claims that the facility was inadequately compensated by the department for certain rehabilitative services provided to its patients and that such undercompensation constitutes a violation of federal medicaid law.we affirm.
background 
plaintiffs,concourse rehabilitation nursing center,and concourse nursing home collectively concourse,operate a residential health care facility in the bronx.as we explained in our previous opinion,concourse rehabilitation nursing center,debuono,cir hereinafter debuono,this case arises from an audit conducted by the department in and,which concerned claims submitted by concourse in may.as a result of this audit,the department determined that concourse had misclassified the type of therapy provided to a number of its patients and had,as a result,been overcompensated for their care.see id.at.concourse contends that the criteria used by the department for making this determination violate the federal medicaid act title xix of the social security act,supp.iv.
although our previous opinion provides a thorough description of the statutory and regulatory scheme governing this case,see debuono,at,it is useful to review that framework briefly here,before moving on to the arguments presented by the parties on appeal.
a.the medicaid program 
the medicaid program,which covers the costs of medical care for the indigent,is jointly funded by the federal government and the governments of participating states.see debuono,at.although states are not required to participate in the program,those electing to do so must submit a plan to the secretary of health and human services secretary for approval.id.as we explained in debuono 
the plan must be in writing and must comprehensively describe the nature and scope of the state medicaid program.upon approval of the plan by the secretary,the state becomes entitled to receive reimbursement from the federal government for a percentage of the monies it pays to residential health care facilities for their care of medicaid patients.the balance of the costs for such care is furnished by state and local governments.
id.administration of the program is governed by the medicaid act,and the distribution of federal funds to the states for care provided in accordance with the individual state plans must be approved by the health care financing administration hcfa,a division of the department of health and human services,according to standards contained in a.id.when the dispute over the department audit of concourse submissions arose,hcfa approval of federal funding was governed in part by a provision called the boren amendment,a,which has since been repealed,see balanced budget act of,a,stat,repealing the boren amendment for services provided after,note,infra.at that time,the boren amendment provided,in pertinent part,that 
a state plan for medical assistance must 
provide for payment of the nursing facility services provided under the plan through the use of rates determined in accordance with methods and standards developed by the state which,in the case of nursing facilities,take into account the costs including the costs of services required to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical,mental,and psychosocial of each resident eligible for benefits under this subchapter of complying with subsections b other than paragraph f thereof,c,and d of section of this title which the state finds,and makes assurances satisfactory to the secretary,are reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities in order to provide care and services in conformity with applicable state and federal laws,regulations,and quality and safety standards 
a a.thus,under the boren amendment,states were required to assure the secretary that their plans provided reasonable and adequate payment for costs incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities in order to be eligible for federal funds.in wilder virginia hospital ass n,d,the supreme court held that the boren amendment afforded health care providers a substantive under reasonable and adequate rates,in addition to a procedural right to have a state make the requisite findings 
the boren amendment reference to services required to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical,mental,and psychosocial of each resident eligible for benefits has its origin in certain revisions made to the medicaid and medicare acts as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of,stat.to obra.see generally indiana ass of homes for the aging,indiana office of medicaid policy planning,cir describing the effect of obra on the medicaid program valdivia california dep t of health,no.em,wl,at same.under b one of the provisions added to the medicaid act by obra a nursing facility must provide services and activities to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical,mental,and psychosocial of each resident in accordance with a written plan of care 
hcfa regulations expand upon this requirement,providing that if specialized rehabilitative services are required in the resident comprehensive plan of care,the facility must either provide those services or obtain those services from an outside source.a.more specifically 
each resident must receive and the facility must provide the necessary care and services to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical,mental and psychosocial,in accordance with the comprehensive assessment and plan of care t he facility must ensure that a resident abilities in activities of daily living do not diminish unless circumstances of the individual clinical condition demonstrate that diminution was unavoidable and a resident is given the appropriate treatment and services to maintain or improve his or her abilities 
obra provided for a range of civil penalties for providers found not to be in compliance with these requirements.see h valdivia,wl,at.it is the cost of such rehabilitative services that the former boren amendment requires states to take into account.see a a.
b.the new york state medicaid plan 
under new york medicaid plan,the direct cost component of medicaid reimbursements for a particular nursing home is gauged according to a case mix index,which reflects the number of patients in the facility,the severity of each patient diagnosis,and the consumption of resources required by patients with similar diagnoses.debuono,at citing regs.tit,a.as the district court explained,t he weighted sum of the distribution of a facility patients in the various diagnostic categories determines the case mix index cmi,which in turn determines the amount of the facilities reimbursement accordingly,the higher the cmi,the greater the remuneration for the facility.in order to ensure that the case mix index for each facility is current and accurate,health care providers are required to submit periodically a patient review instrument pri for each patient.see id.these pris may be they were in this the foundation for quality medical care,under contract with the department of health.see id.
the pri contains a number of standards,called documentation qualifiers,which are used to assess a patient medical condition to calculate the case mix index for a particular facility.see id.the qualifiers relevant to the instant dispute are used to determine whether a patient is in need of maintenance therapy or restorative therapy.the qualifier for maintenance therapy which is already included in the direct component paid to a provider,and thus does not result in a higher case mix index,see regs.tit,c states as follows 
therapy is provided to maintain retard deterioration of current activities of daily living status.therapy plan of care and progress notes should support that patient has no potential for further or any significant improvement.
id.citing regs.tit,i patient review,question.for a patient to meet the qualifier for restorative therapy,which increases a facility case mix index and thus entitles the facility to a higher rate of reimbursement,one must find that 
there is a positive potential for improved functional status within a short and predictable period of time.therapy plan of care and progress notes should support that patient has this improving.
id.citing regs.tit,i patient review,question.additionally,the department has created an audit tool for use in pri audits,which was not a part of the state plan originally approved by hcfa,and which states that in order to be classified as receiving opposed to,an auditor must find that the p atient condition is realistically expected to improve significantly within a reasonable and generally predictable period of time.id.as the district court found,and as the parties agreed at oral argument,the department interprets the restorative therapy qualifier to mean that a facility can be reimbursed at the restorative therapy rate only where patients have shown actual improvement as a result of treatment.in explaining the prospective language used in the second sentence of the restorative therapy is,the statement that the t herapy plan of care and progress notes should support that patient has this improving the department contends that the language referring to a patient potential applies only to new patients,and that otherwise the qualifier calculates payment rates based on the number of patients who are actually improving.
case history 
as indicated above,this case has its origins in an audit conducted by the foundation for quality medical care on behalf of the department of health.following a audit,the department determined that concourse had incorrectly classified certain patients as having received restorative therapy,as opposed to maintenance therapy,resulting in the department overpaying concourse in the amount of.see debuono,at.the conclusion that concourse had erred in its classification was based on the auditor finding that certain patients receiving therapy classified as restorative had not actually progressed as a result of the therapy.on april,plaintiffs filed suit in federal court,alleging that the audit tool constituted an amendment of the state plan,and that the state violated federal law by instituting such an amendment without approval of hcfa the department violated its own audit procedures and that they were deprived of due process of law.on june,following a bench trial,the district court found for defendant on all three issues.
plaintiffs appealed,and this court found that the failure of a state authority to comply with state regulations can not alone give rise to a cause of action and that the court therefore lacked jurisdiction over any such claims and that the audit tool did not amend the plan,but was instead an interpretation of the plan,which did not give rise to a section action because it did not have the clear and unequivocal effect of altering the written terms of the plan.id.at.we vacated the district court opinion and instructed the district court to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.we recognized,however,that there were at least two arguments that could be raised if plaintiffs chose to refashion their complaint.first,we suggested that the plaintiffs remained free to argue that the state plan,as interpreted,violated the plaintiffs substantive right under the boren amendment to a reasonable and adequate rate of reimbursement.see id.at.second,we left open a novel argument which had been made only in a brief by one of the amici and in a footnote to the plaintiffs reply brief that the department interpretation of the requirements for restorative therapy might be preempted by federal law insofar as its practical effect is to prevent health care providers from complying with and.see id.
on july,plaintiffs filed an amended complaint advancing both of these arguments.on october,the district court entered an order granting the defendant motion for summary judgment,finding that the state plan did not conflict with federal law,and that there was therefore no federal preemption and that the plaintiffs had failed to provide any evidence that the state reimbursement rate as a whole was inadequate or unreasonable,or that the state failed to take the services required by obra into account in formulating the rate.on this appeal,the plaintiffs challenge both of these findings,and contend that they were prevented from conducting adequate discovery on their boren amendment claim.they also for the first time in this the state plan failure to reimburse concourse for services allegedly mandated by obra constitutes a taking without due compensation under the fifth amendment of the united states constitution.
discussion 
we begin with the plaintiffs claim under the boren amendment.before we can turn to the merits of this claim,we must consider whether the claim is one that can properly be brought under.section provides a cause of action for violations of federal statutes as well as the constitution.wilder virginia hospital ass n,d citing maine thiboutot,d.in order to seek redress through,however,a plaintiff must assert the violation of a federal right,not merely a violation of federal law.blessing freestone,d.a plaintiff alleging a violation of a federal statute will be permitted to sue under unless the statute does not create enforceable rights,privileges,or immunities within the meaning of,or congress has foreclosed such enforcement of the statute in the enactment itself.wilder,at.quoting wright roanoke redevelopment hous,d.a court considering whether a particular statute gives rise to a claim must first ask whether the provision in question was intend ed to benefit the putative plaintiff.id.at.quoting golden state transit los angeles,d internal quotation marks omitted see blessing,at.if so,the provision creates an enforceable right unless it reflects merely a congressional preference for a certain kind of conduct rather than a binding obligation on the governmental unit,or unless the interest the plaintiff asserts is too vague and amorphous such that it is beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce.wilder,at.citations omitted see blessing,at.
with this standard in mind,we turn to the two statutory provisions relied upon by the plaintiffs.first,we have the provisions of and its accompanying regulations that require nursing facilities to provide specialized rehabilitative services to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical,mental and psychosocial of each resident.b a.it is clear from the plain language of this provision that it was not intend ed to benefit the putative plaintiff s here the health care providers.wilder,at.rather,the provision is obviously intended to benefit medicaid beneficiaries.we therefore find that does not entitle providers to bring suit under section.
second,we have the boren amendment,which requires states to take into account the costs of providing specialized rehabilitative services in formulating their medicaid plans.plaintiffs rely on the supreme court decision in wilder to support their contention that the boren amendment creates a federal right cognizable under section.as indicated above,the supreme court,in wilder,held that the boren amendment requirement that state plans provide reasonable and adequate reimbursement did entitle health care providers to bring suits under,finding that health care providers were the intended beneficiaries of the law,the provision was mandatory,rather than hortatory in nature the requirement that reimbursement be reasonable and adequate was not too vague or amorphous to be judicially enforceable and that the alternative enforcement mechanisms within the medicaid act were not sufficient to evince a congressional intent to foreclose the possibility of suits under section.see id.at.however,plaintiffs claim here is based not merely on the boren amendment requirement that reimbursement be reasonable and adequate as a whole,but also on the amendment requirement that a state plan take into account the costs of the services mandated by.thus,wilder does not provide a co
