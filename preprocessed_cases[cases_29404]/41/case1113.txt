in this appeal,plaintiff kimberly cruse cruse challenges the district court decision affirming the determination of the defendant commissioner of social security commissioner that cruse was not disabled and therefore not entitled to disability insurance and supplemental security income ssi benefits under the social security act the act.specifically,she advances four contentions on appeal the commissioner afforded less than the proper amount of weight to the opinions of her treating physician and nurse practitioner the commissioner erred in finding cruse testimony about disabling pain,other symptoms,and functional limitations less than credible the commissioner decision finding cruse not disabled was not supported by substantial evidence and the commissioner erred by failing to present vocational expert testimony.finding no reversible error,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
cruse was born on may.in,she applied for disability insurance and ssi benefits pursuant to titles ii and xvi of the act,et and et,alleging disability dating from october.specifically,cruse alleged that she was unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity due to dizziness,an inability to stand without falling,migraines,and chronic vertigo.cruse claim was denied by the social security administration administration in.
hearing before administrative law judge 
a hearing was held before an administrative law judge alj in.cruse completed high school and attended one year of college.she had past relevant work experience as a produce clerk,cashier,and greeter.she alleged that on october,she came home from school and passed out.thereafter,she claimed to have continued suffering from dizziness for which she has regularly received medical attention.
relevant medical history 
on october,cruse was admitted to general hospital due to persistent dizziness.after being released the following day,kevin gray noted that,with medication,cruse was fairly asymptomatic.on december,cruse visited gale gardner,complaining of dizziness,imbalance,and falling.gardner described cruse impairment as total and further noted that she should not return to work pending the outcome of her neurological gardner assessed that cruse suffered from idiopathic dizziness.on december,natasha mahajan,cruse primary care physician,reported that cruse was not taking any medications,she was in no acute distress,and her neurological examination was negative.mahajan also noted that cruse had been for the previous couple of months due to dizziness.
on february,anne,a neurologist,reported that cruse mri,laboratory studies and strength were normal,though she did have some weakness in her lower extremities.further remarked that cruse gait was markedly abnormal with swaying and grabbing onto various objects.at one point during the examination,cruse fell down and reported dizziness after being helped onto a chair,though her blood pressure and pulse remained stable.noting the lack of neurological explanation for her symptoms,opined that cruse had a conversion disorder and suggested that she undergo a psychiatric evaluation.also suggested that cruse dizziness and vertigo could be.
on may,a medical consultant,louise patikas,indicated that cruse physical impairments,singly or combined,were not severe.on may,renga vasu,a neurologist,observed that cruse had difficulty standing and could not balance even with two people holding her even though she could walk with support.vasu assessed that cruse suffered from brainstem migraines and somatization,but ruled out conversion disorder.she suggested that cruse undergo psychiatric treatment and physical therapy.
christine hasselle,a family nurse practitioner,treated cruse on june,and august.hasselle reported that cruse was coherent with a guarded attitude,an appropriate affect,adequate judgment,intact memory,and no perceptual abnormalities.hasselle diagnosed cruse with conversion disorder and anxiety disorder.she assessed cruse prognosis as good however,she indicated that cruse was unable to work as of the june,evaluation.
on august,cruse was again seen by mahajan,who diagnosed her with the following symptoms abdominal pain migraine headaches dizziness internal hemorrhoids and possible conversion reaction.
from august through december,cruse was examined by shankar natarajan,a pediatric neurologist.natarajan indicated that her physical and neurological examinations were unremarkable.during the august,examination,cruse was diagnosed with vertigo and lower extremity weakness.in an october,letter,natarajan advised cruse not to return to work until her migraines and dizziness were under control.natarajan changed his diagnosis to conversion disorder at the following examination,but later ruled it out on december.natarajan also indicated that cruse could move her legs easily when sitting in a wheelchair but her legs became wobbly when standing.cruse refused to be examined during her december,consultation.
on september,cruse impairments were again described as by another medical consultant.thereafter,cruse obtained psychiatric treatment from martha gordon from december,through june.on january,gordon assessed cruse mental capacity for work activity and found that her cognitive limitations were fair to poor in all categories.gordon indicated that cruse was unable to work due to an inability to stand or walk,dizziness,dissociative episodes,depression,anxiety,and panic.
cruse was hospitalized for two weeks during april for intensive physical therapy,during which she progressed to walking with the assistance of a rolling walker.davidson curwen,a rehabilitation specialist,stated that cruse was able to tolerate all scheduled therapies,and that her functional limitations were gradually improving.at her first outpatient visit,on may,cruse indicated to curwen that overall she was doing better,and her strength had improved.she further indicated that she was able to get around using a walker,although she did not always need it,and that she was hopeful to be free of the walker within several weeks.curwen noted that cruse was independent in all aspects of and opined that she would be totally independent in six to eight weeks and able to resume all aspects of her life.
following a psychiatric diagnostic interview on april,kelly blair,found that cruse was alert,cooperative,pleasant,and exhibited appropriate behavior.despite cruse assertion that she could not retain anything,blair believed that she demonstrated adequate recall of both recent and remote events,while displaying a relevant and organized train of thought.blair opined that cruse did not appear to suffer from significant depression or emotional instability.subsequent progress notes show that cruse performed adequately on a brief neurocognitive evaluation.she was able to follow verbal and written commands.a personality assessment inventory indicated significant elevation on items measuring concerns about somatic events.blair noted that her findings were consistent with conversion disorder.
on june,dr mahajan stated that cruse complained of shortness of breath.cruse indicated to mahajan that she had been through physical therapy and that it had helped her a lot.mahajan also noted that cruse was using a walker and was not in a wheelchair.
cruse returned to mahajan on june,complaining of dizziness and shortness of breath.while at the lab,she passed out and fell.cruse stated that while her dizziness had improved,it was returning.during a july,appointment with mahajan,cruse was again using a wheelchair.she was diagnosed with asthma in august.
robert kennon conducted a psychological evaluation of cruse in september.cruse related that her daily activities included washing dishes,light cooking and washing clothes,although these tasks were limited by her pain.she also stated that she regularly attended church and shopped for clothes and food using a motorized cart.kennon opined that cruse was capable of managing her own funds.he stated that her stream of thought was logical,clear,and coherent.he found that cruse had a conversion disorder with a mixed presentation of motor and sensory symptoms or deficits and a personality disorder,with predominant masochistic traits.he found that cruse psychological difficulties were at the root of her neurological,somatic,and motor deficits.as to the impact on her activities,kennon stated cruse was capable of following simple work rules and using appropriate judgment with the public.however,he indicated that she may have difficulty sustaining employment due to her somatic complaints and unfounded belief that she has an neurological condition.
on september,the intake clinician at pathways of tennessee,pathways reported that cruse was neat,casual,coherent,and restless,with fair judgment,poor insight,an appropriate mood and affect,adequate impulse control,poor memory,poor,good eye contact,and a normal,organized,and thought process.the clinician observed that cruse was adequately able to express her needs,had good verbal skills,and was independent in her activities of daily living.cruse reported that she was able to read,shop,and spend time with friends without any problems.she was diagnosed with a conversion disorder and dissociative amnesia.
testimony at the hearing 
cruse arrived at the hearing using a walker.she stated that she lived with her parents.she also stated that she was unable to walk at all without the walker she indicated that her therapy doctor at the time of the hearing advised her to move around as much she could,and that he had not placed any specific restrictions on her.
cruse indicated that she believed the cause of her symptoms was dissociative disorder.she further indicated that her primary disability is her inability to walk unaided.cruse testified that on average,she falls two to three times per day after passing out,and gets migraines approximately two to three times per week.cruse listed a number of undesirable caused by her migraine prescriptions,but stated that she was getting dizzy before she even went on the medication.cruse indicated that she did not believe that her symptoms are mental.cruse also noted that she suffers from asthma.she reported having problems with concentration and that she was incapable of managing her own money.cruse indicated that at the time of the hearing,she had not suffered a panic attack in over two years.

cruse mother,hildreth cruse cruse,also testified at the hearing.she testified about many of the same conditions and limitations already indicated by her daughter,noting that her daughter still falls every day,but passes out less frequently.cruse also stated that her daughter had made progress at the time of the hearing,particularly in the area of personal hygiene,bathing,and dressing herself.
decision of the alj and subsequent procedural history 
on december,the alj denied cruse disability insurance and ssi benefits,finding that 
cruse met the requirements for a period of disability and disability insurance benefits set forth in section i of the act and was insured for benefits through june,but not thereafter.
cruse has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since her alleged onset of disability.
cruse conversion disorder and asthma are considered severe based on the requirements in the regulations b and b,but do not meet or medically equal one of the listed impairments in appendix,subpart p,regulation listing of impairments.
cruse allegations regarding her limitations are not supported by the medical evidence and are less than fully credible.
all medical opinions in the record regarding the severity of cruse impairments have been judiciously considered per and.
cruse retains the physical residual functional capacity to lift and carry up to twenty pounds occasionally,ten pounds frequently,and stand,walk or sit up six hours in an day.she should also avoid concentrated exposure to dust,fumes,gases,odors,chemicals,and other pulmonary irritants.
cruse mental capacity for work activity is limited only by occasional lapses in concentration.
cruse past relevant work does not require the performance of activities precluded by her residual functional capacity.
cruse conversion disorder and asthma do not prevent her from performing her past relevant work.
cruse was not under a disability as defined in the act at any time through the date of this decision,f and f.
thereafter,on december,the appeals council denied review.
cruse then filed a complaint in federal district court pursuant to g,challenging the commissioner decision.the district court upheld the commissioner decision.
ii.analysis 
the act defines disability as the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity,because of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment of at least one year expected duration.see combs comm r of soc,cir en banc quoting d a.to identify claimants who qualify as disabled,the commissioner uses a sequential evaluation process.id.quoting a.the five steps are as follows 
a claimant who is engaging in substantial gainful activity will not be found to be disabled regardless of medical findings.
a claimant who does not have a severe impairment will not be found to be disabled.
a finding of disability will be made without consideration of vocational factors,if a claimant is not working and is suffering from a severe impairment which meets the duration requirement and which meets or equals a listed impairment in appendix to subpart p of the regulations.claimants with lesser impairments proceed to step four.
a claimant who can perform work that he has done in the past will not be found to be disabled.
if a claimant can not perform his past work,other factors including age,education,past work experience and residual functional capacity must be considered to determine if other work can be performed.
wyatt sec y of health human,cir citing b f,b f see also combs,at citing a.the initial burden is on cruse to demonstrate that she is disabled and can not engage in her former employment.see atterberry sec y of health human,cir the initial burden of proof rests with the claimant to show that he can not perform his past relevant work.with respect to step three,the commissioner has promulgated an extensive list of impairments.see combs,at citing part,subpart p,appx.the list,which includes somatoform disorder,provides 
somatoform disorders physical symptoms for which there are no demonstrable organic findings or known physiological mechanisms.
the required level of severity for these disorders is met when the requirements in both a and b are satisfied.
medically documented by evidence of one of the following 
a history of multiple physical symptoms of several years duration,beginning before age,that have caused the individual to take medicine frequently,see a physician often and alter life patterns significantly or 
persistent nonorganic disturbance of one of the following 
hearing or 
use of a limb or 
movement and its control,coordination disturbance,psychogenic seizures,akinesia,dyskinesia or 
sensation,diminished or heightened.
unrealistic interpretation of physical signs or sensations associated with the preoccupation or belief that one has a serious injury 
resulting in at least two of the following 
marked restriction of activities of daily living or 
marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning or 
marked difficulties in maintaining concentration,persistence,or pace or 
repeated episodes of decompensation each of extended duration.
part,subpart p,appx.
in this case,the alj determined that cruse residual functional capacity does not preclude her from performing her past relevant work as a cashier and greeter,and that she is not suffering from a severe impairment that meets or equals a listed impairment.therefore,the burden of proof is on cruse to show that she is disabled.see jones comm r of soc,cir through step four,the claimant bears the burden of proving the existence and severity of limitations caused by her impairments and the fact that she is precluded from performing her past relevant work.we review the commissioner application of this framework under a deferential standard.
alj treatment of the medical opinion evidence 
cruse contends that in finding her capable of performing her past relevant work,the alj erred in fail ing to give controlling weight to the opinions of her treating sources,gordon and nurse practitioner hasselle.first,cruse points to the alj statement that the extreme limitations expressed by gordon are not supported by the documented available record,and are,therefore,afforded little weight.cruse insists that the alj did not provide any support for this finding.
in general,we have held that the opinions of treating physicians are entitled to controlling weight.see walters comm r of soc,cir citing d.a physician qualifies as a treating source if the claimant sees her with a frequency consistent with accepted medical practice for the type of treatment evaluation required for the medical condition.smith comm r of soc,cir alteration in original quoting.the record shows that gordon performed a new patient evaluation for cruse on december,and saw cruse twice more thereafter,on january and june.the record also shows that cruse was treated to a similar extent by other doctors,including mahajan,natarajan,and curwen,and had similar initial assessments performed by other doctors,including blair and kennon.from this evidence,we can not say that the alj erred by not giving gordon initial assessment,performed on january,controlling weight over the opinions,some more recent than gordon,of the number of other doctors who were as much treating physicians as was gordon.
cruse also suggests that the alj improperly discounted the opinion of nurse practitioner hasselle.hasselle indicated both in her june,evaluation of cruse,as well as through a letter dated october,that cruse was unable to work.while the alj summarized hasselle findings,he did not give hasselle opinion significant weight or explain his reasons for discounting hasselle findings.as a nurse practitioner,hasselle is listed under other sources.see.we have previously held that an alj has discretion to determine the proper weight to accord opinions from other sources such as nurse practitioners.see,walters,at.however,at oral argument,cruse suggested that a recent social security ruling controls our analysis.ssr was issued effective august,and clarifies how the commissioner is to consider opinions and other evidence from sources who are not acceptable medical sources.ssr,wl.while the ruling notes that information from other sources can not establish the existence of a medically determinable impairment,the information may provide insight into the severity of the impairment s and how it affects the individual ability to function.id.at.the ruling goes on to note that 
with the growth of managed health care in recent years and the emphasis on containing medical costs,medical sources who are not acceptable medical sources,such as nurse practitioners have increasingly assumed a greater percentage of the treatment and evaluation functions handled primarily by physicians and psychologists.opinions from these medical sources who are not technically deemed acceptable medical sources,under our rules,are important and should be evaluated on key issues such as impairment severity and functional effects,along with the other evidence in the file.
id.at.further,the ruling explains that opinions from sources who have seen the claimant in their professional capacity should be evaluated by using the applicable factors,including how long the source has known the individual,how consistent the opinion is with other evidence,and how well the source explains the opinion.martin barnhart,d,citing ssr,wl at.finally,the ruling states that 
a lthough there is a distinction between what an adjudicator must consider and what the adjudicator must explain in the disability determination or decision,the adjudicator generally should explain the weight given to opinions for these other sources,or otherwise ensure that the discussion of the evidence in the determination or decision allows a claimant or subsequent reviewer to follow the adjudicator reasoning,when such opinions may have an effect on the outcome of the case.
in his decision denying cruse disability insurance and ssi benefits,the alj stated the findings of nurse practitioner hasselle,including her letter advising that cruse was unable to return to work.the alj only explanation for discounting hasselle opinion was that hasselle is neither a medical doctor nor a vocational expert,and thus lacks the credentials for making such a determination.as it stands,the alj decision was devoid of any degree of specific consideration of nurse practitioner hasselle functional assessments.following ssr,the alj should have discussed the factors relating to his treatment of hasselle assessment,so as to have provided some basis for why he was rejecting the opinion.however,ssr was not implemented until august,after the administration had issued its december,final decision through the appeals council.
we are not aware of any constitutional or statutory requirement that the administration apply its policy interpretation rulings to appeals in the federal courts,absent,of course,ex post facto or due process concerns not present here.neither in the text of ssr nor elsewhere can we identify any intent on the part of the administration to apply ssr to appeals pending in the federal courts as of august,and we therefore decline to require that it be applied in this case see landgraf usi film products,d t he mere fact that a new rule is procedural does not mean that it applies to every pending case.a new rule concerning the filing of complaints would not govern an action in which the complaint had already been properly filed under the old regime,and the promulgation of a new rule of evidence would not require an appellate remand for a new trial.our orders approving amendments to federal procedural rules reflect the commonsense notion that the applicability of such provisions ordinarily depends on the posture of the particular case.
substantial evidence supports the alj credibility assessment of cruse 
cruse also argues that the alj erred in finding that her claimed limitations were not supported by the medical evidence and were less than fully credible.there is no question that subjective complaints of a claimant can support a claim for disability,if there is also evidence of an underlying medical condition in the record.jones,at citing young sec y of health human,cir.here,it is uncontested that doctors diagnosed cruse with illnesses including conversion disorder and asthma,treated her for those disorders,and have therefore supplied the requisite objective medical condition to support cruse claim.id.however,an alj is not required to accept a claimant subjective complaints and may consider the credibility of a claimant when making a determination of disability.id.at citing walters,at.notably,an alj credibility determinations about the claimant are to be given great weight,particularly since the alj is charged with observing the claimant demeanor and credibility.however,they must also be supported by substantial evidence.walters,at citations omitted.
here,the alj specifically set forth his reasons for discrediting cruse subjective complaints based on the medical evidence and inconsistencies in her testimony.namely,the alj noted that cruse testimony regarding her activities was hardly reflective of any totally di
