factual and procedural background 
paul gossett is a military veteran who is entitled to receive va benefits.in,gossett was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity and was committed to a state psychiatric hospital by court order.gossett was transferred to the hospital,where he is currently detained,in september of.
in,the va found gossett mentally incompetent to manage his own affairs.the va appointed czech to serve as gossett legal custodian and entered into a fiduciary agreement providing that the hospital would be reimbursed from va benefits for the costs it incurs as a result of gossett care.since the agreement has been in effect,czech has been using gossett va funds to provide gossett a monthly stipend for groceries and sundries and to partially reimburse the hospital for the costs of gossett care.
on july,gossett brought this action under in the united states district court for the northern district of california,claiming that czech use of his va benefits to reimburse the hospital was unlawful under various federal and statutory laws the complaint sought to permanently enjoin the said state hospitals and their personnel from any future misappropriation of funds,to seek punitive damages,declaratory relief,and any other relief that is just,equitable and proper.czech moved for summary judgment,claiming that he used gossett funds in a manner authorized and required by federal and state law,in particular section and by california health and welfare code section,as well as by departmental policy,and that his actions were proper under washington state department of social and health services keffeler,d,a case involving state use of social security ss benefits as reimbursement for costs incurred in caring for eligible foster children.
the district court granted czech motion for summary judgment and dismissed gossett claim.the court extended the logic of the supreme court keffeler ruling to veterans benefits,and held that a representative payee use of va funds for support of the beneficiary does not violate section a.gossett appeals.

discussion 
the veterans benefits act vba,stat.codified as amended at et,contains a provision that limits the availability of va benefits for the payment of certain types of claims 
payment of benefits due or to become due under any law administered by the secretary shall not be assignable except to the extent specifically authorized by law,and such payments made to,or on account of,a beneficiary shall be exempt from taxation,shall be exempt from the claim of creditors,and shall not be liable to attachment,levy,or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatever,either before or after receipt by the beneficiary.
a.this exemption provision protects the veteran recipient of the benefits and affords security for his or her family.the vba also dictates the manner in which payments of va benefits are made to fiduciaries,allowing that payment of benefits under any law administered by the secretary may be made directly to the beneficiary or to a relative or some other fiduciary for the use and benefit of the beneficiary.a.here,gossett brings a section action,claiming that defendant czech,his legal custodian authorized to receive and administer his veterans benefits,has been using part of his benefits to reimburse the hospital for gossett care and maintenance in violation of a 
the district court granted summary judgment for the defendant in this case,basing its holding on the supreme court decision in keffeler,d.in keffeler,the state of washington was appointed to serve as the representative payee for foster care children receiving ss benefits.id.at.washington then used the ss benefits to reimburse itself for the cost of foster care.id.at.the plaintiffs alleged that the state use of their benefits violated a,the antiattachment provision contained in the social security act ssa,stat,codified as amended,et id.at.the court,however,found that the state use of plaintiffs ss benefits did not amount to an execution,levy,attachment,or garnishment within the meaning of section a.id.at.the court further held that the state reimbursement scheme did not fit within the meaning of other legal process,and thus did not violate section a.id.at.
in addition,the court specifically noted that the state,much like a parent or legal guardian,was under a legal obligation to support the basic needs of its foster children,irrespective of whether those children were eligible for ss benefits or whether such funds could be used as reimbursement.see keffeler,at.similarly,in serving as the representative payee for the foster children ss benefits,the state was charged with acting in their interests.see id.at.the court in keffeler concluded that section a did not apply to the state in this context,because just as a parent ha s no obligation to exhaust his personal finances in providing for his child support before spending any of the child social security benefits on the child maintenance,neither did the state have such an obligation to exhaust its own funds first.see id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court in this case held,and defendant here argues,that because of the similarity between the ssa and the vba,the keffeler holding should be extended to veteran benefits and section,meaning that a representative payee use of the funds for support of the beneficiary does not violate section.
we observe that keffeler does not directly control this case,as there are significant differences between the antiattachment provision for ss benefits analyzed by keffeler,a,and the va benefits counterpart,a.we acknowledged similarities between these two statutory sections in nelson heiss,cir,but we also noted that the language of the two sections is somewhat different id.at.while those differences did not affect our decision in nelson,see id.at concluding that va benefits recipients,like ss benefits recipients,can not consent in advance to an assignment of future funds,the differences are significant in this case.specifically,section a,unlike section a,expressly exempts veterans benefits from the claim of creditors.in addition,section a protects ss benefits only from execution,levy,attachment,garnishment,or other legal process,while section a provides that va benefits shall not be liable to attachment,levy,or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatever.thus,the vba creates a significantly broader preclusion than the corresponding section in the ssa,which the supreme court has construed narrowly as addressing only judicial means of attachment.see keffeler,at.
nevertheless,keffeler provides important guidance concerning the principles that should apply when determining whether czech use of gossett funds violates federal law.specifically,in keffeler,the court focused on the fact that the commissioner of social security implementing regulations construe the ssa as authorizing the appointment of custodial institutions like the washington state department of social and health services as a representative payee for the foster care children in the state of washington who are eligible for ss benefits.see at.keffel
