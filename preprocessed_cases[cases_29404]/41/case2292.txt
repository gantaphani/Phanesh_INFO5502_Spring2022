in this petition for review,we must determine whether an employee of a company that shoots,processes,and sells photographs to tourists on a historic naval ship is entitled to collect benefits under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca,or is barred from recovery by the lhwca express exclusion of individuals employed by a museum or retail outlet.b.we hold that in determining the applicability of b,we must look not only at the nature of a claimant employer but also at the nature of the claimant particular workplace and duties.in this case,we conclude that petitioner falls within the scope of the retail outlet exclusion at b because both her employer business and her own employment activities focused,in substantial part,on retail sales and,moreover,had little connection to traditional maritime activities.because an employee may be excluded from lhwca benefits under b only if he or she is covered by state workers compensation,however,we remand the case for a determination whether petitioner is eligible for benefits under hawaii law.
background 
on november,while petitioner cheryl peru was ascending a ladder inside the uss missouri,she hit her head,sustaining head and neck injuries.peru worked for respondent sharpshooter spectrum venture,llc ssv,the exclusive provider of photographic and imaging concession services for visitors to the famous world war ii battleship,which is now moored at pearl harbor and open to the public.ssv employees greet tourists as they enter the uss missouri and ask permission to take their photographs.the employees then shoot photographs of the tourists at several locations on the ship and the nearby pier.they process the photographs in a mobile trailer lab located on the pier and offer them for sale at a designated sales area,also located on the pier.
when peru started at ssv in july,she worked as a photographer.peru subsequently was promoted to a sales job and then to a position as assistant manager.as assistant manager,peru performed a variety of administrative tasks,but also continued to do greeting,sales,and photography work as needed.at the time of her accident,peru,loaded with camera equipment,was making her way to the uss missouri captain room to photograph a tour group.
following her injury,peru was unable to continue in her old job.peru attempted to apply for hawaii workers compensation benefits in late november,but,for reasons that are not clear from the record,ssv claims adjustor denied she was eligible.peru then filed a claim with the department of labor office of workers compensation programs for compensation under the lhwca.ssv again disputed peru claim for benefits,arguing that she was not covered by the lhwca.after a hearing,the administrative law judge alj held that peru was not covered by the lhwca because she was an employee of a museum,a category of worker expressly excluded from lhwca benefits under b.alternately,the alj held that peru was employed by a retail outlet,and thus fell within another category of worker excluded under b.
peru appealed the alj decision to the benefits review board brb or board.the brb affirmed the alj holding that peru was excluded from lhwca coverage as an employee of a retail outlet based on ssv sales of photographs to tourists on the pier and peru employment duties in furtherance of this sales activity.it declined to reach the question of whether she was employed by a museum.peru now petitions for review of the brb decision.we have jurisdiction to review the denial of benefits pursuant to.we affirm the brb holding that peru falls under the retail outlet exclusion at b but remand for further proceedings.
ii.standard of review 
whether an employee who seeks benefits is covered by the lhwca is a mixed question of fact and law.harbor tug barge papai,d.where,as here,the underlying facts are undisputed,lhwca coverage is decided as a matter of law.see id.we review questions of law,including interpretations of the lhwca,de novo.const.castro,cir.because the brb is not a policymaking body,its construction of the lhwca is not entitled to any special deference.cutter carroll,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,we will respect the board interpretation of the lhwca where such interpretation is reasonable and reflects the policy underlying the statute.id.quoting mcdonald,owcp,cir.
iii.scope of the lhwca 
two federal acts provide compensation to workers injured on or adjacent to navigable waters.the jones act covers seam e a formerly a.the lhwca covers certain maritime employee s.a.those not eligible for recovery under either federal act are covered by state workers compensation laws.see mcgray const,owcp,cir t he question is not whether an employee will be left out in the cold,but only which scheme covers him.peru contends that she is entitled to recover under the lhwca.
status and situs requirements for lhwca coverage 
the supreme court has explained that to qualify for lhwca compensation,a worker ordinarily must satisfy both a situs requirement and a status requirement,owcp perini river,d.it is undisputed that peru was injured on navigable waters or certain adjoining land areas,namely,on board the uss missouri,and therefore satisfies the situs requirement.see also a.but ssv argues that peru does not satisfy the status requirement.
congress added an express status requirement to the lhwca in,specifying who qualifies as an employee covered by the act.in,congress enumerated specific types of workers who do not qualify as employees under the lhwca.the lhwca now provides that 
t he term employee means any person engaged in maritime employment,including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations,and any including a ship repairman,shipbuilder,and,but such term does not include 
a individuals employed exclusively to perform office clerical,secretarial,security,or data processing work 
b individuals employed by a club,camp,recreational operation,restaurant,museum,or retail outlet 
c individuals employed by a marina and who are not engaged in construction,replacement,or expansion of such marina except for routine maintenance 
d individuals who i are employed by suppliers,transporters,or vendors,ii are temporarily doing business on the premises of an employer described in paragraph,and iii are not engaged in work normally performed by employees of that employer under this chapter 
e aquaculture workers 
f individuals employed to build,repair,or dismantle any recreational vessel under feet in length 
g a master or member of a crew of any vessel or 
h any person engaged by a master to load or unload or repair any small vessel under eighteen tons net 
if individuals described in clauses a through f are subject to coverage under a state workers compensation law.
emphasis added.
congress creation of an express status requirement coincided with its relaxation of the situs requirement.before the amendments,it was only necessary for an injured employee to satisfy a situs requirement however,under the situs requirement then in effect,the injury had to have occurred upon the navigable water of the united states.ramos universal dredging,cir.in,congress extended lhwca coverage to individuals injured on areas adjoining navigable waters,including any pier,wharf,dry dock,terminal,building way,or marine railway,in order to avoid anomalies inherent in a system that drew lines at the water edge.ne.marine terminal caputo,d quoting a.the expansion of the situs covered by the lhwca to include rather large shoreside areas necessitated an affirmative description of the particular employees working in those areas who would be covered.herb welding,gray,d.
both we and the supreme court have construed the general definition of employee in the first paragraph of narrowly to encompass only those employees engaged in loading,unloading,repairing,or building a vessel.mcgray const,at quoting herb welding,at.internal quotation marks omitted.peru clearly does not fall within this definition.
however,the supreme court,in perini,concluded that congress,in enacting the amendments,intended to broaden,not narrow,the lhwca overall coverage.at.the court thus held that individuals
