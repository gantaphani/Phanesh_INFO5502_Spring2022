facts and procedure 
cavin worked as a production associate in honda assembly department from until.as a honda employee,cavin received an associate handbook handbook which contained detailed information about honda leave policies.in the event of an absence,a honda employee must notify either plant security,his department,or administration prior to the beginning of his scheduled shift,or as soon as reasonable.joint appendix at handbook.according to honda,employees may call security to report a vacation day,a absence,or a sickness.at patterson dep.however,when an employee absence continues beyond one day away from work he should contact coordination.at handbook.if the need for leave is unforeseeable,leave must be requested no later than three consecutive workdays of the first day missed.the first day missed counts as day one.at handbook.
the handbook provides that whenever an employee falls below percent attendance,honda will strive to help the employee improve his attendance through a system designed to ensure that employees understand the attendance policy.however,failure to comply with honda established attendance guidelines and leave of absence requirements,at handbook,will result in corrective action up to and including suspension without pay or separation from employment,at handbook.in fact,if an employee is absent for three consecutive workdays without notifying coordination,he will be separated from employment.at handbook.
on june,cavin injured his right shoulder in a motorcycle accident.cavin was treated in the emergency room of ann hospital and released the same day with a prescription for pain medication.the emergency room physician wrote cavin a note excusing him from work until june.when he returned home from the hospital,cavin called honda to inform the company that he needed to take time off work because he was injured in a motorcycle accident.according to cavin,
when i called in on the and security asked my reason for calling in,i stated that it was a motorcycle accident.and i knew that when i was a team leader we had a screen on the company computer system that could tell us why a person was not coming to work,and when i stated motorcycle accident,they also asked me when i planned on returning.i gave them a return date,and i thought that information would have been communicated to my coordinator.
at cavin dep.there is no evidence that cavin informed security at that time that he would be absent for more than one day.
cavin received treatment from a second doctor,scott cohen cohen,the day after the accident.cohen excused cavin from work until june.according to cavin,during his absence he called the company everyday sic that he was scheduled to work to inform the company of his status.at cavin aff.cavin reported his absence to security every day during the week of june.the following week,cavin was not scheduled to work because there was a scheduled plant shutdown.cavin returned to work on july,two weeks after the first day of his absence,at which time cavin finally notified the leave coordination department of his need for a leave of absence.
when cavin returned from leave on july,his supervisor and several other honda employees knew that cavin had been in a motorcycle accident and inquired about how he was doing.that day,cavin received what honda refers to as progressive counseling,or coaching,for employees with less than percent attendance.counseling is an element of honda progressive discipline structure for attendance violations.at mcclellan dep.linda mcclellan mcclellan,a representative of honda associate relations department,met with cavin and reviewed honda leave policies.she informed cavin that any future violation of company policy would result in his separation.
cavin explained to mcclellan that he had been injured in a motorcycle accident on june,had been excused from work through june by the emergency room doctor,and further excused until june by a second doctor.cavin told mcclellan that he had called honda every day to report his absence and gave her the return to work slips that his doctors had signed to excuse him.honda gave cavin a leave coordination packet,instructing cavin to have his doctor complete the forms and to return the packet by july.cavin timely completed the packet,in which cohen certified that cavin june leave was due to a serious health condition.
on july,honda disallowed a portion of cavin leave under the fmla on grounds that the absences were not approved.cavin had violated honda leave policy by failing to call honda leave coordination department within three consecutive workdays of his first day of leave honda refused to approve cavin absences for june as leave,recognizing only june as qualifying leave.cavin was forced to take a vacation day to cover his june absence.
cavin missed work several times during the following months because he was suffering from extreme pain in the shoulder that was injured during the motorcycle accident.honda approved cavin july and july leaves of absence as,but denied his final request for fmla leave on grounds that he failed timely to submit a certification form for the september absence.to receive fmla leave for this period,cavin was required to submit a certification form to the leave coordination department before october.cavin met the deadline,but the certification was facially incomplete it did not include the dates of treatment or incapacity.the leave coordination department instructed cavin to submit a completed form by october.cavin failed to meet the new deadline when his doctor did not timely submit the form to honda because honda did not timely receive the certification,cavin was disciplined a second time in november.honda then fired cavin for violating the honda leave policy twice.
on april,cavin filed a suit in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio,alleging that honda had interfered with his fmla rights and wrongfully discharged him in violation of ohio public policy.honda filed a motion to dismiss the wrongful discharge claim,and the district court granted the motion on march.cavin honda of am,d,cavin i.honda then filed a motion for summary judgment on the fmla claim,which the district court granted on february.cavin honda of am,wl,at,cavin ii.

fmla interference claims 
the fmla entitles qualifying employees to twelve weeks of unpaid leave each year if,among other things,an employee has a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.a d.congress enacted the fmla because,among other reasons,there is inadequate job security for employees who have serious health conditions that prevent them from working for temporary periods.a.the fmla accommodates the important societal interest in assisting families by establishing minimum labor standard s for leave.i,sess,at hereinafter cong.
pursuant to the fmla,i t shall be unlawful for any employer to interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise,any right provided under the fmla.a see b any violations of the act or of these regulations constitute interfering with,restraining,or denying the exercise of rights provided by the act.employers who violate are liable to any eligible employee affected for damages and for such equitable relief as may be appropriate.a.
cavin maintains that honda interfered with his rights under the fmla by refusing to recognize his june absence as leave.to prevail on an interference claim,a plaintiff must establish that he is an e ligible employee,the defendant is an e mployer,the employee was entitled to leave under the fmla,a the employee gave the employer notice of his intention to take leave,e and the employer denied the employee fmla benefits to which he was entitled.see price multnomah county,d,see generally arban west publ g,wl,at cir.honda concedes that during the relevant time period,honda was an employer and cavin was an eligible employee for fmla purposes.honda also concedes that cavin would have been entitled to take fmla leave for june had he given appropriate notice,as honda recognized cavin june and june absences arising from the same circumstances as qualifying leave ultimately,honda contends that cavin interference claim fails because cavin did not give honda proper notice of his intention to take leave.
cavin notice to honda 
honda associate handbook articulates the following procedure for employees seeking a leave of absence 
if you require a leave of absence,you must formally request a leave from the coordination department.your request must be made in a timely manner 
if your need for a leave is foreseeable,you must request the leave at least thirty days or as soon as practicable before your leave is to begin.
if your need for a leave is not foreseeable,you must request the leave no later than three consecutive workdays of the first day missed.the first day missed counts as day one.
at handbook.honda timing requirements are consistent with the fmla requirements for foreseeable leave,see e b,and for the most part more generous than the fmla requirements for unforeseeable leave see a it is expected that an employee will give notice to the employer within no more than one or two working days of learning of the need for leave.however,cavin violated honda policy by failing to request a leave of absence from the leave coordination department within three consecutive workdays of the first day of work missed due to the motorcycle accident.
honda policy is inconsistent with the fmla 
cavin contends that honda policy is inconsistent with the notice requirements set forth in the fmla.specifically,cavin argues that the fmla would not permit employers to deny fmla leave simply because an employee fails to follow a company internal notice requirements.although the regulations do specifically contemplate the establishment of notice policies by individual employers,we agree with cavin that the fmla does not permit an employer to limit his employee fmla rights by denying them whenever an employee fails to comply with internal procedural requirements that are more strict than those contemplated by the fmla.
honda policy requires an employee to notify the leave coordination department of his need for leave no later than the third day missed.at handbook.cavin was absent five days from june through june,he was excused from work the following week due to a plant shutdown,and he returned to work on july.on july,cavin notified the leave coordination department of his need for leave.honda apparently concluded that cavin provided timely notice to the leave coordination department with respect to his june and june july was not more than the third workday from those days recognized those two days of leave as.however,because cavin failed to notify the leave coordination department within three workdays of his absence on june,honda denied those days.honda internal notice requirements thus may foreclose relief otherwise available under the fmla.we must determine whether honda notice requirements are consistent with the fmla.
the regulations governing the application of the fmla state that an employee with a foreseeable need for leave shall provide at least verbal notice sufficient to make the employer aware that the employee needs leave,and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave.c.however,in the context of requests for foreseeable leave,the regulations also state that 
an employer may also require an employee to comply with the employer usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave however,failure to follow such internal employer procedures will not permit an employer to disallow or delay an employee taking fmla leave if the employee gives timely verbal or other notice.
d.the regulations do not so explicitly discuss employer notice procedures in the context of an employee unforeseeable need for leave,noting only that when an employee requires emergency medical leave,an employer can not require advance written notice pursuant to its internal rules and procedures.a see mora,d,the act does not specify the form of notice that is required for foreseeable leave,and interestingly the act makes no reference to any notice requirement for unforeseeable leave.
in this case,we must focus on because cavin need for leave was not foreseeable.clearly the emergency medical leave provision of does not apply here because honda policy did not require advance written notice at all.beyond the emergency medical leave provision,the regulation governing unforeseeable need for leave makes no other references to an employer internal requirements.in light of this silence,the tenth circuit,in an unpublished opinion,interpreted the regulation to mean that the fmla prohibits an employer from enforcing only its requirement of advance written notice and,even then,only in the context of emergencies.holmes v.the boeing,wl,at cir.the tenth circuit reasoned that t he fmla does not prohibit an employer from requiring its employees to give notice to specific company supervisors on the day the employee is going to be absent in a nonemergency situation,as in this case.id.the holmes court thus concluded that an employee can not seek fmla relief in the event of his noncompliance with his employer specific notice requirements absent an alleg ation that his physical condition was such that he could not comply with defendant reasonable notice requirements.id.emphasis added.similarly,the seventh circuit in lewis holsum of fort wayne,cir,concluded that an employer did not violate the fmla by discharging an employee who failed to comply with applicable company rules and policies regarding leave notice where it was not impossible for her to do so.id.at emphasis added.
we conclude that the seventh and tenth circuits have misinterpreted the fmla notice requirements.their interpretations are contrary to the goals of the fmla and inconsistent with the regulation of notice in situations where an employee has a foreseeable need for leave.rather than simply drawing an inference from the silence of about employer notice requirements other than advance written notice,we read in the context of the fmla itself and.
as an initial matter,we note that the discussion in about employer notice procedures in the context of an employee foreseeable need for leave should also apply in the context of an employee unforeseeable need for leave.it would be illogical to conclude that congress intended to prohibit employers from disallow ing or delay ing an employee taking of fmla leave for failure to comply with internal employer procedures in the context of foreseeable need for leave,but not in the context of unforeseeable need for leave.d.the regulations suggest that notice requirements for unforeseeable leave are more relaxed than the requirements for foreseeable leave,in keeping with the idea that an unforeseeable need for leave will often arise in the context of a medical emergency.therefore,there is no principled reason to conclude that employers may disallow or delay an employee taking fmla leave for failure to follow internal employer procedures in the context of unforeseeable leave when they are prohibited from doing so in the context of foreseeable leave.id.
moreover,the conclusion that employers can not deny fmla leave on grounds that an employee failed to comply with internal long as the employee gives timely verbal or other notice is consistent with the purpose of the fmla.d.in enacting the fmla,one problem that congress sought to remedy was the inadequate job security for employees who have serious health conditions that prevent them from working for temporary periods.a.congress sought to articulate a minimum labor standard for leave that employers would not be able to limit.cong.at.central to the purposes of the fmla is that its provisions apply even where the entitlements created by the act are in excess of those that an employer would be willing or able to provide on its own.marrero camden county bd.of soc,d,citing.some courts have struck employer policies that impose more stringent requirements on employees seeking fmla leave.see,id.striking an internal policy requiring a doctor certification within five days rather than the fifteen days provided for under the fmla mora,d at defendant policy that employees call within thirty minutes of the beginning of their shift is inconsistent with the fmla and is inapplicable to employees requesting fmla qualifying leave.in permitting employers to develop notice procedures,the department of labor did not intend to allow employers in effect to undermine the minimum labor standard for leave.
reading in the context of the fmla and,we conclude that employers can not deny fmla relief for failure to comply with their internal notice requirements.therefore,we conclude that honda could not interfere with cavin fmla rights by enforcing its notice requirements to deny cavin benefits to which he otherwise may have been entitled under the fmla.
cavin compliance with the fmla 
w here an employer internal policies conflict with the provisions of the fmla,the fmla controls and an employee need only comply with the requirements of the act to invoke its protections.marrero,d at.having concluded that cavin was not obligated to comply with honda requirement that he notify the leave coordination department,we proceed to evaluate whether,viewing the facts in a light favorable to cavin,he complied with the notice requirements of the fmla.
when discussing notice requirements in other statutory contexts,this court has said that adequacy of notice is consistently regarded as a finding of mixed fact and law.burkart,cir analyzing the notice provisions of the vietnam era veterans readjustment assistance act of.we have distinguished the factual and legal aspects of notice as follows 
t he question of whether any notice was given,and if so,what the notice consisted of and when it was given,is one of fact.however,the question of whether the notice satisfied the statutory requirement is one of law.thus,the issue of notice in this case presents a mixed question of fact and law.
k m joint venture smith int l,cir analyzing notice requirements for breach of warranty claims under a state statute.in a recent unpublished opinion,however,a panel of this court characterized the issue of adequate notice under the fmla as involving primarily questions of fact not questions of law.williams schuller int l,wl,at cir.in spite of this recent unpublished opinion,however,it seems more accurate to describe notice as a mixed question surely there are some facts that as a matter of law are not sufficient reasonably to apprise an employer of an employee need for leave.although it is within the province of the jury to determine the facts of the notice given,it is for the court to determine whether those facts are sufficient reasonably to give an employer notice as required by the fmla.therefore,for summary judgment purposes,we should determine whether,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to cavin,cavin has complied with the fmla notice requirements as a matter of law.
t o invoke the protection of the fmla,an employee must provide notice and a qualifying reason for requesting the leave.brohm jh,cir.however,a n employee does not have to expressly assert his right to take leave as a right under the fmla.hammon dhl airways,cir see c,b.because an employee need not expressly invoke the fmla,t he critical question is whether the information imparted to the employer is sufficient to reasonably apprise it of the employee request to take time off for a serious health condition.brohm,at quotation omitted.a n employee gives his employer sufficient notice that he is requesting leave for an condition when he gives the employer enough information for the employer to reasonably conclude that an event described in the fmla a has occurred.hammon,at.we agree with the fifth circuit that it would be inappropriate to articulate categorical rules governing the content of notices,instead recognizing that w hat is practicable,both in terms of the timing of the notice and its content,will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case.manuel westlake polymers,cir.
cavin called security on the day of his motorcycle accident to inform honda of his absence.according to cavin,w hen i called in on the and security asked my reason for calling in,i stated that it was a motorcycle accident.at cavin dep.he told security that he expected to return to work the following day,but after receiving treatment from another doctor cavin called in absences for several additional days on a daily basis.according to cavin affidavit of june,
on june,i was in a motorcycle accident in which i was badly injured.on this same day,i called honda to inform the company that i just got out of the hospital because i was injured in a motorcycle accident.i told honda that i could not work.thereafter,i called my company everyday sic that i was scheduled to work to inform the company of my status.when i returned from leave on july,many employees at honda knew that i had been injured in a motorcycle accident.many of these employees,such as judd,jock,and steve asked how i was feeling after the accident.shawn dobbins,my supervisor at the time,also asked how the accident occurred,how i was feeling,and if i was alright.
at cavin aff.according to honda,cavin only told the security desk that he had
