united states steel corporation uss and its subsidiary,united states steel mining company ussm collectively appellants,brought this action against the commissioner of the social security administration ssa,under the coal industry retiree health benefit act of,coal act,challenging the ssa assignment of various united mine workers of america umwa retirees to them for health care premium payments.the district court granted summary judgment against appellants on all claims.on appeal,appellants argue that the ssa improperly withheld requested earnings records for certain miners,incorrectly found that another responsible coal operator was not in business for purposes of the coal act,incorrectly applied a rebuttable presumption in assigning three miners to appellants,and improperly assigned to appellants miners who had become unassigned following the supreme court holding in eastern enterprises apfel,d.we affirm the district court order with respect to the request for earnings records,the assignment of two of the three miners to appellants based upon a rebuttable presumption,and the assignment of miners who became unassigned following eastern enterprises.we reverse the district court judgment upholding the assignment of one of the three miners,lee jones,to appellants based upon a rebuttable presumption,and with respect to eleven of the fifteen miners assigned to appellants based upon a finding that another responsible coal operator was not in business for purposes of the coal act.we remand with respect to four of the fifteen miners whose employment with the other responsible coal operator is contested.
background 
i.the coal act 
the coal act of was the culmination of a long history involving bituminous coal companies,the united mine workers of america,and collective bargaining agreements between them.pittston united states,cir.in,the bituminous coal operators association bcoa and the umwa negotiated the first national bituminous coal wage agreement nbcwa,creating a trust fund to provide pension plans and medical benefits to retired coal miners and their families.sidney coal ssa,cir.in,the trust fund became a trust which was funded by coal operators with royalties paid in proportion to the operators coal production.pittston,at.the trust did not provide a consistent level of benefits.sidney,at.
as a result,in,the umwa and the bcoa entered into another nbcwa,replacing the prior trust fund with four separate trusts which were funded by royalties on coal production and premiums based on employee hours.pittston,at.the nbcwa was the first agreement between the umwa and the bcoa to expressly reference health benefits for retirees,at.the trust funds,however,began to experience financial difficulties and thus,in,another agreement was made assign ing responsibility to signatory coal operators for the healthcare of all of their own current and former employees.pittston,at.despite such actions,the trust funds continued to experience financial difficulties and were modified again in.id.
in,congress enacted the coal act to preserve benefits for umwa retirees,at.specifically,the coal act created the united mine workers of america combined benefit fund combined fund,which provided lifetime health benefits to retirees and their dependents.id.at.the combined fund is financed by annual premiums assessed against coal operators who had signed any nbcwa or any other agreement requiring contributions to the or benefit plans.id.citing b,c.the amount owed in premiums depended on the number of retirees and dependents for which each signatory operator was responsible.sidney,at citing a.any of these signatory coal operators who conducts or derives revenue from any business activity,whether or not in the coal industry,may be liable for those premiums,at.citing a,c.if a signatory is no longer involved in any business activity,premiums may be levied against related person s,including successors in interest and businesses or corporations under common control.id.citing a,c a.
the act instructs the ssa to assign retirees to operators using the following formula 
to the operator which was a signatory to the coal wage agreement or any subsequent coal wage agreement,and which was the most recent signatory operator to employ the coal industry retiree for at least two years 
if unassignable under the first step,then to the operator which was a signatory to the coal wage agreement or any subsequent coal wage agreement,and which was the most recent signatory operator to employ the coal industry retiree in the coal industry and 
if unassignable under the first two steps,then to the signatory operator which employed the coal industry retiree in the coal industry for a longer period of time than any other signatory operator prior to the effective date of the coal wage agreement.a.
if an eligible beneficiary can not be assigned under any of these steps,the beneficiary is considered unassigned,and his benefits are funded through asset transfers from the national bituminous coal wage agreement fund or the abandoned mine land reclamation fund.sidney,at citing a b.if the asset transfers are insufficient,then the unassigned miners benefits are funded though premiums assessed against all assigned operators.d.
ii.the supreme court decision in eastern enterprises 
in eastern enterprises,the supreme court held that the third step of,assigning retirees to operators which had signed wage agreements prior to but had not signed the nbcwa or a subsequent coal wage agreement promising lifetime benefits,was unconstitutional,at.a majority of the court concluded that such assignments were unconstitutional because they retroactively required premium payments from coal operators that had not signed any agreements promising lifetime benefits for their employees,and because such operators did not have sufficient notice that lifetime benefits would be required later.id.at.a plurality of the court concluded that such assignments amounted to an unconstitutional taking because they forced such operators to bear the expense of lifetime health benefits for miners based on their activities decades before those benefits were promised.id.at.
after the supreme court decision,the ssa invalidated all assignments to coal operators that had not signed the nbcwa or a later agreement.sidney,at.the ssa then assigned those miners to operators that had employed the retired miners for the longest period and to whom it was constitutional to make assignments under,only those coal operators that had signed a nbcwa or later agreement and that remained in business.id.
iii.factual procedural 
the current case arises from various assignments of miners to appellants by the ssa.
assignments 
on september and october,and,ssa service centers sent letters to appellants assigning miners to them under the coal act.each letter stated that operators had thirty days upon receipt of the letter to either request further information about the assigned miners or to request a review.the letters also stated that if an operator requested further information about the miners,it would have thirty days from receipt of those records to request a review of the assignment.
on october,darrell lilly lilly,the human resources manager for ussm,sent letters to the ssa requesting the earnings records of,and the basis of assignments for,miners assigned on september.on october,lilly sent similar letters to the ssa requesting similar information concerning the october and assignments.the letters from lilly were written on ussm letterhead and indicated that ussm was a subsidiary of uss,then referred to as usx,but did not mention any specific miners or assignments made to uss or ussm.in response,in letters dated february,and,and march and,the ssa sent lilly the earnings records for various miners assigned to appellants.
on march,lilly sent letters to the ssa stating that we are asking you to review the assignment per the attached list.we have not received an itemized statement of earnings for these individuals.therefore,we must disagree with the assignment that steel mining is the responsibility sic operator.steel,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.although the letters referenced only ussm,the list attached to each letter included miners assigned to both uss and ussm.in response,in letters dated march,and april and,the ssa sent lilly the requested earnings records and basis of assignment.
the letter dated march,however,also stated that the ssa had not enclosed the earnings records for eight particular miners but that it would send the information later.the records were not sent.appellants now seek the records for five of the eight miners listed that were assigned to uss on october.
assignments 
on june and september,the ssa sent notices to appellants assigning them additional miners.on september,lilly sent a letter to the ssa requesting the earnings records of the miners assigned to ussm on september.on november,the ssa acknowledged receipt of the request.lilly replied,stating that he had intended to request the earnings records for miners assigned to uss and ussm.the ssa responded by sending uss the records for miners assigned to it in june,rather than september.appellants now seek the correct records from the ssa.
assignments 
the ssa again issued notices in,and,assigning additional miners to appellants.the assignments included miners who had been initially assigned to operators that had not signed the nbcwa or any subsequent coal wage agreements,and miners who had been employed longer by black diamond coal company black diamond than by appellants.appellants requested review of of these assignments.the ssa reviewed the assignments and issued a final decision ruling that the appellants were responsible for some,but not all,of the miners.
procedural history 
appellants brought the underlying suit on january,on august,the ssa filed a motion to dismiss,or in the alternative,for summary judgment.appellants responded by filing a motion for summary judgment on most counts of their claim and also asked the court to defer consideration of counts iv,v,and vii so that they could conduct discovery.the court granted appellant motion to defer consideration of counts iv,v,and vii.the court then granted summary judgment to the ssa on the nondeferred counts and the deferred counts were dismissed subsequently.
appellants appeal on four grounds.first,appellants argue that the ssa acted improperly when it failed to furnish the earnings records for five miners assigned to ussm in and for miners assigned to uss in september.second,appellants contest the assignment to uss of miners who had worked longer for black diamond than for uss.appellants argue that those miners should have been assigned instead to argyle investments argyle,which was black diamond parent company and which is still in business for purposes of the coal act.third,appellants argue that the ssa incorrectly assigned to appellants three miners that they had not employed in the coal industry.appellants essentially claim that the ssa arbitrarily and capriciously rejected evidence submitted showing that those miners had not worked in appellants coal operations.finally,appellants challenge the ssa assignment of miners who had become unassigned following the supreme court holding in eastern enterprises.
jurisdiction standard of review 
the court has jurisdiction under.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.mahon dep t of,cir.the summary judgment procedure is particularly appropriate in cases such as this,in which a district court is asked to review a decision rendered by a federal administrative agency.id.at.

discussion 
failure to furnish earnings records 
when a coal operator receives notice assigning beneficiaries,it may,within days of receipt of such notice,request from the ssa detailed information as to the work history of the beneficiary and the basis of the assignment.f.after receiving the requested materials,the operator may,within days of receipt of the information,request review of the assignment.id.f.if the operator does not request additional information,it may request review of the assignment within days from receipt of the notice of assignment.when a review is completed,the ssa decision is final.f.here,appellants claim that the ssa failed to furnish them with the requested earnings records for miners on two separate occasions.they seek an order instructing the ssa to furnish those records now.
appellants claim that the ssa neglected to send them the requested earnings records for five miners assigned to them in october.appellants did not produce any copies of such a request,but instead rely upon a letter from the ssa to show that they had made the request.the letter,dated march,states 
we are writing you about the miners assigned to you under the coal industry retiree health benefit act of.as you requested,enclosed are the earnings record s and the basis for the assignment s for the miner s for whom you requested such information.
letter from frank hagel,assistant regional commissioner,western program service center,ssa,to usx corporation.several pages later,the letter continues,stating 
below we identify the retired coal miner s whose earnings record s is not enclosed.we will send you the earnings record s and the basis for the assignment s later.
id.the letter then listed the five miners in question.
appellants argue that the latter two sentences of the letter establish that they had requested the records at issue.the ssa argues otherwise,reasoning that its letter does not establish that appellants had made a timely request for records because the ssa may have inadvertently included the five miners in the letter,mistakenly thinking they were a part of appellants request s.appellee br.regardless of whether appellants had made the request,their claims are barred by the statute of limitations.
because this claim for review is brought under the apa and the coal act does not provide a statute of limitations,this action is barred unless filed within six years of the final agency action.a ctr.for biological diversity hamilton,cir when the act prescribes no statute of limitations,the general statute of limitations for suits against the united states applies.usx barnhart,cir recognizing a statute of limitations on claims filed under the coal act.the statute of limitations period begins to run once the agency has issued a final action.power teleport commc ns atlanta,cir only final agency actions can be subject to judicial review.trafalgar capital,cuomo,cir referring to the final agency action that commenced the statute of limitations.to be considered final,an agency action must mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature and must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences will flow.bennett spear,d internal citations quotations omitted.
here,the assignment of the beneficiaries to appellants is the final agency action for purposes of a.first,the assignment of miners is not tentative or interlocutory in nature,but instead is a definitive decision to attribute responsibility for beneficiaries to operators.second,once assignments are made,the operator must pay the premiums attributable to the challenged assignments or incur the penalties for failure to make those payments,regardless of whether the operator seeks administrative review of the assignments.dixie fuel commn r of ssa,cir overturned on other grounds by barnhart peabody coal,d.thus,the requirements to be considered a final agency action are met here.
appellants argue that the assignment of miners is not the relevant final agency action.appellants argue instead that because they seek only information regarding the miners assigned,the relevant last action is the ssa failure to respond to their request for information,and this failure to act does not constitute a final agency action for purposes of a.whether appellants seek information regarding the assignment or seek review of the assignments,however,appellants have suffered a final agency action that has adversely affected them,as they have been obliged to pay premiums since the initial assignment.see dixie fuel,at.further,a request for information regarding an assignment does not relieve appellants of the obligation to proceed in a timely manner.rather,a request for information is merely an avenue that an assigned operator may take to obtain review of the factual basis for the assignment of particular beneficiaries.id.at.thus,we hold that the statute of limitations for appellants claim ran from the date of the initial assignment.
here,the assignment of the miners at issue in was a final agency action that began the statute of limitations period.appellants did not bring the current action until.nothing occurred which arguably could have tolled the statute of limitations for a sufficient length of time to prevent its expiration.likewise,the statute of limitations has run on the appellants request for the records of the miners assigned in.in that instance,appellants claim that the ssa sent them the records for the wrong miners,and that they now seek the proper records from the ssa.the records were sent in,but appellants did not realize until that they had not received the proper records.appellants should have checked the records much earlier and have no excuse for not doing so as appellants did not bring suit until,the statute of limitations has run.
accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment against appellants on their request to order the ssa to furnish the earnings records for certain miners assigned in and in.
ii.failure to assign miners to related persons 
appellants also challenge the assignment of fifteen miners who had worked longer for black diamond than for them.appellants acknowledge that the ssa could not have assigned these miners to black diamond,because it went out of business before the initial assignments were made appellants,however,argue that the ssa should have assigned the miners to argyle,which was a related person to black diamond.
in a review decision given to appellants,the ssa found that argyle was black diamond parent company and that the two were related for purposes of the coal act.ssa great lakes program serv,coal act review determination.the ssa,however,held that it could not assign the miners in question to argyle because it was not in business for purposes of the coal act.id.at.the ssa concluded that argyle had not been in business since because it became a holding company,no longer paid wages to employees,sold most of its real property,hired a real estate management company to administer its remaining parcel of rental property,transferred the administration of its investment portfolio to a bank,and received only passive income from rent and investments.id.at.the parties agree that argyle was black diamond parent corporation and do not appear to contest that argyle and black diamond are related.thus,the issue is whether or not argyle is in business within the meaning of the coal act.
under the coal act,a person shall be considered to be in business if such person conducts or derives revenue from any business activity,whether or not in the coal industry.c.we agree with our sister courts that this is a broad definition,including within its scope not only an entity that conducts business activity,but also one who derives revenue from business activity.lindsey coal mining chater,cir stating that because the conducts prong is provided for separately,the derives revenue prong does not require the party liable under the coal act to itself conduct a business activity dist,united mine workers of am.united mine workers of am benefit plan,cir the act employs an expansive definition of in business that includes conducting or deriving revenue from any business activity,whether or not in the coal industry.quoting c emphasis removed.
there is no dispute here that argyle is deriving revenue.that is,argyle still owns a parcel of property from which it receives rental income and has an investment portfolio of cash and publicly traded stocks,bonds,and notes from which it receives interest.although argyle is clearly deriving revenue from various sources,the ssa argues that it is not deriving revenue from business activities because it transferred the management of its rental property to a real estate management company and the administration of its investment portfolio to a bank.the ssa essentially claims that business activity does not include passive ownership of assets,but must entail at least the management of the assets 
the ssa interpretation is contrary to legislative intent.as lindsey coal indicates,congress intended for the definition of in business to be interpreted broadly.lindsey,at.particularly persuasive was the following exchange between senator bentsen,then chairman of the senate finance committee,and senator rockefeller,a principal architect of the legislation 
bentsen that definition of business activity has alternative tests a company is considered to be in business if it either conducts a business activity or derives revenue from a business activity.as is apparent from the existence of the two tests,the intention of the legislation is to define the term in business broadly.
even in cases where a company is not considered to conduct a business of its own,if the company has leased any of its property in return for the right to receive royalties based on the use of the property in a business operated by the lessee,the company would be considered to derive revenue from the business activity conducted by the lessee.
rockefeller.president,again i agree with the chairman of the finance committee.the language of the statute is purposely broad.certainly,a company would be considered to be in business if it continued to own significant properties and has leased some of those properties so that it may derive revenue from the business operation of the leased properties by the lessee.
it appears from this that a wide variety of activities,including owning and leasing property,would cause a company to be considered in business within the meaning of the act.there is no indication that congress meant to define certain phrases within the definition of in business,such as business activity,narrowly.doing so would undermine the overall broad meaning of the statute,allowing companies to escape liability under the act by framing their activities as passive business activities.the legislative intent to construe in business broadly counsels us instead to consider the ownership of property,investments,and other assets as business activity within the meaning of the coal act.see lindsey,at holding that a company that derived revenue from leasing its property was in business for purposes for the coal act dist,at holding that a company that had constructive possession over its assets remains in business within the meaning of the act united mine workers of am benefit plan rushton in re sunnyside coal,cir holding that a company that entered into liquidation remains in business for purposes of the act steel barnhart,d,holding that a company that generated revenue from the sale of its assets remained in business.
as previously stated,the parties do not contest that argyle is still receiving revenue from its leased property and its investment portfolio.that argyle chose to delegate management of its property and other assets to third parties does not relieve it from liability for premiums owed under the act.thus,we hold that argyle is in business for purposes of the statute.accordingly,we will reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for the district court to order the ssa to rescind the assignment to appellants of eleven of the fifteen miners at issue that indisputably had worked for black diamond longer than for appellants 
iii.rebuttable presumption 
appellants also challenge the review decisions upholding the assignment of three miners,lee jones,victor hribar,and woodrow stewart.specifically,appellants assert that the ssa misapplied a rebuttable presumption that a miner was employed in the coal industry by a signatory operator to deny the appeal of an operator who has shown that there are no records show ing that the miner had worked for that operator in the coal industry.appellants br.
preliminarily,administrative agencies may establish presumptions,as long as there is a rational nexus between the proven facts and the presumed facts.cole dep t of,cir sec y of labor keystone coal mining,stating that presumptions are permissible if there is a sound and rational connection between the proved and inferred facts quoting chem.mfrs.ass dep t of.appellants bear the heavy burden of demonstrating that there is no rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact to be presumed.usx,at quoting cole,at.
here,when assigning beneficiaries to coal operators,the ssa examines its earnings records,which identify the employers of each beneficiary but not the nature of the employment.instead of showing that a worker was employed specifically in the coal industry,the ssa employs a rebuttable presumption that 
a beneficiary who otherwise qualified for benefits under the coal act was employed in the coal industry for purposes of a if his employer was a coal mine operator that signed a national coal wage agreement and his employment occurred during the employer participation in the national coal wage agreement.
we agree with our sister circuit that it is a reasonable inference that a beneficiary earnings from a coal operator,which are posted to the ssa earnings records,were for work in the coal industry.see id.at.further,as the third circuit noted,the ssa rebuttable presumption is a sensible response to the difficulty of locating records that the worker was employed specifically in the coal industry as the beneficiaries personnel files can date back fifty to sixty years,and even a worker own employer can have difficulty retrieving them.id.citing panduit all states plastic,presumptions of fact have been created to assist in certain circumstances where direct proof of a matter is rendered difficult.overruled on other grounds by,koller,d.moreover,if a worker was not employed in the coal industry,the coal operator is in a position to correct the misapprehension.id.
the parties here disagree on what occurs when an operator presents evidence rebutting the presumption.appellants claim that,like employment discrimination cases,a presumption shifts the burden of going forward with evidence but does not shift the burden of proof.see chapman ai,cir stating that an employer only needs to produce evidence rebutting a presumption of discrimination,but that the burden of persuasion remains on the employee to prove that he was a victim of intentional discrimination.according to appellants,the ssa can use the presumption to make the initial assignments but can not use the presumption to support a denial of an appeal or if an operator has presented evidence rebutting the presumption.in contrast,the ssa claims that the presumption can be used during the review process and that the framework for applying rebuttable presumptions in discrimination cases does not apply to this case.appellee br.
we agree with the ssa and the district court that it is reasonable for the presumption to stand during a review of an assignment.the coal act provides that if an operator disagrees with an initial assignment,it can seek review of the assignment by providing evidence showing a prima facie case of error.f.thus,it is during a review that an operator may offer sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption.
sufficient evidence is the kind of evidence a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.conoco,office of worker comp.programs,cir quoting noble drilling drake,cir abrogated on other grounds by,office of workers comp.programs greenwich collieries,d.the evidence must merely raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether the operator employed the beneficiary in the coal industry.chapman,at citations quotation marks omitted.if the operator can not present such evidence,the presumption stands.once an operator presents sufficient evidence rebutting the presumption,however,the ssa must then show that the beneficiary has worked in the coal industry for the operator see mary honor ctr.hicks,d stating that in employment discrimination cases,once a defendant has rebutted the presumption that it had discriminatory motives for its actions,the plaintiff then has the burden of persuasion to show that he was a victim of intentional discrimination chapman,at same.
here,the ssa apparently found that appellants did not produce sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that lee jones,victor hribar,and woodrow stewart worked for them in the coal industry.we review the ssa decisions under an arbitrary and capricious standard.
appellants contend that jones worked in an oil well warehouse rather than in a coal mine.in support,appellants submitted an affidavit from a uss representative stating that he spoke with jones nephew,vincent coleman,who spoke with his aunt,jones widow.dimmock aff,july.she informed her nephew that she did not recall her husband ever working in a coal mine for appellants.id.jones nephew further stated that his aunt and her husband lived in charleston,west virginia,during his employment with uss.id.appellants then submitted an affidavit stating that they did not own any coal mines in charleston,west virginia,during the relevant time period.boskovich aff,july.appellants also submitted a list of uss facilities from the showing that there was an oil well warehouse in charleston at that time and that the closest coal mine was miles away.see barnhart,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.appellants argue that it was not possible for jones to have commuted to work at any of the mines that uss owned in west virginia,and that jones must instead have worked at uss oil well warehouse.
upon request for review,the ssa rejected appellants argument.the ssa found that jones worked for uss during the period at issue,that jones had not worked for any other coal industry employer after working for uss,and that uss was a signatory to a coal wage agreement for the periods shown.id.at,dist.lexis,at.based on this,the ssa concluded that the appellants were the last signatory operators still in business to employ jones in the coal industry under a coal wage agreement.
despite the deferential standard with which we review decisions of the ssa,there must be a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.arango,at citation quotation marks omitted.here,there is no rational connection between the ssa denial and the evidence with which it was presented the evidence here,that jones widow did not recall him ever working in a coal mine,that jones lived in charleston,west virginia,and that the closest coal mine to charleston was miles away,supports the conclusion that jones did not work in the coal industry for appellants the ssa,however,did not address this evidence but merely repeated the factors leading to the application of the presumption.as appellants had presented evidence to rebut ssa presumption,the ssa can not point to the presumption itself to refute the rebuttal.in so doing,the ssa acted arbitrarily and capriciously.accordingly,we reverse the order of the district court and remand for the district court to order the ssa to rescind the assignment of jones to appellants.
victor hribar 
appellants also claim that hribar did not work for appellants or a related company in a position that would qualify for nbcwa benefits.upon review before the ssa,appellants produced evidence that the combined fund did not have records showing that hribar had worked for appellants instead,the combined fund had records showing that hribar worked for hillman coal coke during,the year that ssa records indicated that appellants employed hribar.addi
