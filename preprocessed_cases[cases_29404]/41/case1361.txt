background 
sanjay andonissamy began working for in april,as a systems engineer assigned to the qwest cyber center in chicago.andonissamy is a citizen of france of indian ethnicity,and his employment was based on sponsorship of his visa.classified as a technician,andonissamy primary responsibilities included providing technical support to qwest data centers and to qwest customers.
andonissamy and offer divergent accounts of andonissamy tenure with the company.andonissamy alleges that,in the wake of september,smith created a hostile work environment by directing numerous racist comments at andonissamy,and that he was placed on remedial performance plans either as retaliation for his complaints to human resources about his work environment,or because of his supervisor personal animus towards him,on the other hand,alleges that andonissamy was an abusive and unprofessional who was terminated after the company gave him numerous warnings about his insubordination and disrespectful comments.
andonissamy employment discrimination suit is based on a series of comments from smith.first,andonissamy claims that sometime after september,smith said in conversation with andonissamy that,all of asia should be smashed,and used his hands in a way that indicated that he meant south asia specifically second,that smith told andonissamy that people like him should be hanged from trees as had been hanged third,that people out of college in the united states were unable to find jobs because people like andonissamy had taken them fourth,that jobs should be reserved for americans fifth,that no matter how much andonissamy worked he would never be like his sixth,that smith claimed when reviewing resumes that he would look for resumes with names.andonissamy also claims that he was involved in a fight with two who called andonissamy an indian racist bastard and who then spoke with smith after the fight ended.
andonissamy claims that he expressed his frustration with smith several times during his tenure with.he sent complaints to russell lewis,smith supervisor,in october,april,and may.andonissamy alleges that in october and may,he was issued performance warnings after complaining to lewis.andonissamy finally claims that in may,he was suspended after smith made a false report to human resources that andonissamy had said we will all have a big surprise,a report that andonissamy claims was designed to make him look like a security threat.human resources then conducted an investigation into the remark,which andonissamy claims led to his firing on june.
andonissamy bases his family and medical leave act claim on his treatment for depression and anxiety,which began at some point in and lasted until the end of his employment with in.smith learned in late that andonissamy took medication.andonissamy claims that his condition worsened after the death of his brother and nephew in march and april,respectively,and that he was not given leave to attend their funerals.he also missed work on two occasions due to illness in may.while andonissamy was taking medicine for depression from to,his treating physician examined him on four separate occasions and did not place any restrictions on his daily activities or work.nor did his physician diagnose andonissamy with clinical depression.
offers a different version of events.in january,andonissamy supervisor,ken smith,gave him his first performance review.while smith found that andonissamy technical skills were strong,he also noted that andonissamy could improve his relationships with and customers.a few months after the first performance review,several of andonissamy colleagues complained that andonissamy had treated them rudely,and smith informed him of those charges in an.another complaint,that andonissamy had been rude to a qwest employee in an,followed shortly thereafter.in october,smith placed andonissamy on a performance plan to monitor his work for days,after a customer of the qwest cyber center had network outages that were partly attributed to andonissamy.
concerns about andonissamy performance grew.in,andonissamy refused to train a to serve as his,despite repeated requests from smith that he do so.on march,smith contacted lewis about an argument he had with andonissamy when the latter refused to attend an installation for a customer.on march,carol,an employee of human resources department,began investigating andonissamy performance issues.during her investigation,interviewed andonissamy,who reported that smith frequently bore the brunt of andonissamy abusive yelling.those same testified that andonissamy screamed at them and talked down to them,sent condescending to qwest employees,and failed to meet deadlines or follow instructions.
on april,recommended that issue andonissamy a performance warning.smith issued this warning on may,although andonissamy refused to sign it.the warning listed the five most recent examples of insubordination and inappropriate conduct,including two incidents that had caused a qwest employee to complain to smith.andonissamy,in response to the warning,then sent an to lewis and complaining about smith.after the warning,andonissamy continued to submit work late,missed scheduled installations,and refused to train a.
in june,in response to the concerns of qwest employees about andonissamy behavior,qwest refused to authorize andonissamy return to the cyber center.lewis then decided to terminate andonissamy employment,which he did on june.
on september,andonissamy filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission for national origin discrimination against.while his complaint contained many of the claims he makes in the present lawsuit,it apparently did not include the allegations that smith had said indians should be hung from trees,or that after september all of south asia should be wiped out.on january,the eeoc dismissed the complaint and issued andonissamy a right to sue letter.
on april,andonissamy filed a complaint against,adding a family and medical leave act complaint on may,and eventually joining both qwest and smith to the complaint.on november,andonissamy also asserted a cause of action against smith for assault under illinois law on may,the district court granted smith motion to dismiss this claim.the district court granted summary judgment for,qwest,and smith on may,and andonissamy now appeals.

a.the title vii and claims.
title vii claim.
the first issue is whether the district court properly granted summary judgment to on andonissamy hostile work environment claim.to survive summary judgment on a hostile work environment claim based on national origin,a plaintiff must establish that he was subjected to unwelcome harassment,the harassment was based on his national origin,the harassment was severe and pervasive enough to alter the conditions of his environment and create a hostile and abusive working environment,and there is a basis for employer liability.velez city of chicago,cir.title vii protects a worker against conduct which is sufficiently severe or pervasive that a reasonable person would find it hostile and which the victim himself subjectively sees as abusive.ngeunjuntr metropolitan life ins,cir citing harris forklift systems,d.
courts examine a variety of factors when evaluating whether a workplace is hostile,including the frequency of the supposed discriminatory conduct the severity of it whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee job performance.harris forklift systems,d.
the district court rejected andonissamy hostile work environment claim because it determined that,even assuming smith had made every comment attributed to him,the comments were insufficient as a matter of law to support a claim for national origin discrimination,and,second,because andonissamy had not demonstrated a basis for employer liability.andonissamy argues on appeal that there is sufficient evidence for a jury to find that he was subjected to a hostile work environment.he lists once again smith alleged remarks,and argues that they demonstrate an objectively hostile atmosphere based on his national origin.responds that the district court properly found the comments insufficient as a matter of law,and that many of the alleged remarks can not even be attributed to national origin discrimination.
we do not need to reach the question of whether smith comments are sufficient to support a hostile work environment claim.even assuming arguendo that the remarks created a hostile work environment,andonissamy has not established a basis for employer liability in this case.under title vii,an employer can be vicariously liable for a hostile work environment created by a supervisor,but is only liable for a hostile work environment created by a if the employer was negligent in discovering or remedying the harassment.velez,at.a supervisor for purposes of title vii is not simply a person who possesses authority to oversee the plaintiff job performance,but a person with the power to directly affect the terms and conditions of the plaintiff employment.id see also hall bodine,cir.in this circuit,the term means generally a person with the authority to hire,fire,promote,demote,discipline or transfer rhodes illinois of,cir.smith,while andonissamy supervisor in the colloquial sense of the word,did not possess the authority that would make him a supervisor for purposes of title vii.he did not hire or fire andonissamy,and while he recommended disciplinary action,the record shows that human resources first had to conduct an investigation and issue a recommendation before any disciplinary action could be taken.
andonissamy argues that smith directed andonissamy performance and recommended disciplinary action to human resources,and thus qualifies as a supervisor for purposes of title vii.however,as the district court correctly noted in its summary judgment opinion,directing work activities and recommending disciplinary action are not in and of themselves sufficient to make someone a supervisor under title vii.see rhodes,at.rather,andonissamy would have to point to evidence that smith could directly affect the terms and conditions of his employment.again,andonissamy must produce evidence that smith could hire,fire,promote,demote,discipline or transfer him.such evidence is simply not in the record.smith neither hired nor fired andonissamy the deposition testimony indicates that russell lewis,not smith,made the decisions to hire and fire andonissamy.nor could smith demote or discipline andonissamy he could recommend that the company discipline an employee,but such action was subject to an investigation and approval from human resources,and the decision was not up to him.
andonissamy attempts to establish liability under cat paw doctrine,arguing that lewis and the human resources department were just a screen for smith decisions.the cat paw doctrine does create a basis for employer liability when a single individual lacks the requisite power of a title vii supervisor.see phelan cook county,cir see also shager upjohn,cir.the doctrine is not helpful to andonissamy in this case,however,because it applies only in those cases where no one individual possesses the powers of a title vii supervisor such as the supervisory committee this court reviewed in phelan.in this case,however,russell lewis ultimately made the decision to hire and fire andonissamy,and thus he has the authority of a title vii supervisor.additionally,the cat paw doctrine has been applied in cases where committee decisions are not independent and appear to be taken without conducting any real investigation.see shager,at.here,however,human resources investigated the complaints against andonissamy before recommending disciplinary action,and there is no evidence that the department was simply a legal smokescreen.
andonissamy does not establish that is liable for failing to detect or remedy the alleged discriminatory environment.to establish that is liable for failing to remedy a hostile work environment created by,andonissamy would need to demonstrate that he notified the employer about the harassment or that the harassment was so pervasive that a jury could infer his employer knew about it.see zimmerman cook county sheriff,cir.in his briefs to this court,andonissamy cites the fight with his as an instance of national origin discrimination that was negligent for not remedying this incident,however,was not mentioned in andonissamy eeoc letter and the allegation appeared for the first time in this litigation.even assuming that the claim is not barred,this was a single incident,and andonissamy does not present evidence that he brought the incident to anyone attention.while he did send an to lewis and to human resources on may,complaining about smith,this did not contain allegations of national origin discrimination the only reference in the is a reference to andonissamy immigrant status,which is not itself a complaint about national origin discrimination and would not establish that is liable for failing to act on the allegation.accordingly,we affirm the district court summary judgment decision on this count.
when pursuing a claim,a plaintiff can proceed by either the direct or indirect method.the direct method requires the plaintiff to produce evidence that the defendants were motivated by animus based upon his national origin when he was denied some employment benefit or suffered some adverse employment action.sun board of trustees of of,cir.the indirect method requires demonstrating that plaintiff is a member of a protected class he was meeting his employer legitimate performance expectations he suffered an adverse employment action other similarly situated employees who were not part of the same class were treated more favorably.fane locke reynolds,llp,cir.
while andonissamy briefs mention the claim,there is nothing in either brief discussing the elements of a claim under either the direct or indirect method.his discussion of the claim in his opening brief overlaps entirely with the hostile work environment claim.at any rate,under the direct method andonissamy has simply not pr
