jason brown died tragically while detained in the wichita county jail.his estate sued sheriff thomas callahan for failure to train and supervise the jail medical employees and for maintaining an unconstitutional policy of deliberate indifference to detainees serious medical needs.the district court denied sheriff callahan motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity,and he appeals.because there is insufficient evidence of deliberate indifference or objective unreasonableness by the sheriff,we reverse.
background 
the underlying facts are not in dispute.jason brown died of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage while in pretrial custody in the wichita county jail.during the hours between brown and his death,he informed the intake nurse of multiple serious medical problems,repeatedly vomited what appeared to be blood,complained of feeling unwell,requested to be sent to the emergency room,and ultimately was for extended periods of time.during his confinement,brown lacked access to his prescription medications.an attending jail nurse,nurse krajca,treated brown symptoms by giving him liquid antacid,placing him in a medical solitary cell,and administering an suppository.brown was neither transferred to a hospital er,nor was he seen by the jail supervising physician,bolin.in fact,no one from the jail ever contacted bolin for his advice on jason brown.the jail deputies,however,periodically checked brown condition from outside the medical solitary cell.when the deputies checked on him the next evening,brown was dead.
brown parents,janis and billy ray brown,filed suit individually and as representatives of the estate of jason brown against sheriff callahan and others.relevant to this appeal,the appellees contend that sheriff callahan is liable for brown death in his individual capacity under under two possible theories.first,they argue that callahan is personally responsible for training staff and supervising the medical treatment of individuals in the custody of the jail.more specifically,the appellees allege that sheriff callahan failed to supervise properly the jail staff and bolin,who intimidated the nurses,discouraging them from contacting the doctor or referring patients to the er for further medical treatment.second,the browns allege that the sheriff ratified as custom or policy bolin intimidation of the nursing staff that caused their son death.
sheriff callahan moved for summary judgment,asserting qualified immunity.the district court denied his motion.it found that the appellees offered sufficient evidence to create material fact issues whether a sheriff callahan failed adequately to supervise the jail medical personnel,and b approved or ratified defendant bolin pattern and practice of harassing and intimidating jail nurses when they would call him with questions regarding nursing care,discouraging sending inmates to the hospital causing brown death.the same evidence persuaded the court that sheriff callahan actions may have been objectively unreasonable and therefore not protected by qualified immunity.sheriff callahan appeals.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews a denial of a public official motion for summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity by determining whether the district court erred in assessing the legal significance of the conduct that the district court deemed sufficiently supported for purposes of summary judgment.kinney weaver,cir en banc.the court reviews de novo the district court legal determination of the materiality of the identified fact issues.lemoine new horizons ranch,cir.summary judgment is required if the movant establishes that there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.
a qualified immunity defense alters the usual summary judgment burden of proof.see michalik hermann,cir.once an official pleads the defense,the burden then shifts to the plaintiff,who must rebut the defense by establishing a genuine fact issue as to whether the official allegedly wrongful conduct violated clearly established law.id.the plaintiff bears the burden of negating qualified immunity,but all inferences are drawn in his favor.
the qualified immunity defense has two prongs whether an official conduct violated a constitutional right of the plaintiff and whether the right was clearly established at the time of the violation.manis lawson,cir.a court may rely on either prong of the defense in its analysis.id.
if the defendant actions violated a clearly established constitutional right,the court then asks whether qualified immunity is still appropriate because the defendant actions were objectively reasonable in light of law which was clearly established at the time of the disputed action.collins ainsworth,cir citations omitted.whether an official conduct was objectively reasonable is a question of law for the court,not a matter of fact for the jury.williams bramer,cir.to be clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity,the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.brown miller,cir.the unlawfulness of the defendant actions must have been readily apparent from sufficiently similar situations,but it is not necessary that the defendant exact act have been illegal.id.at.an official actions must be judged in light of the circumstances that confronted him,without the benefit of hindsight.graham connor.in essence,a plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to demonstrate that no reasonable officer could have believed his actions were proper.babb dorman,cir.
iii.discussion 
as a pretrial detainee,jason brown had a clearly established fourteenth amendment right not to be denied,by deliberate indifference,attention to his serious medical needs.hare city of corinth,cir en banc.whether bolin,jail nurses,or other staff violated brown rights is not before us the browns case against bolin and nurse kracja,awaits trial pending the outcome of this appeal,and we express no opinion on its merits.sheriff callahan had no knowledge of and did not participate in the events surrounding brown fatal period of detention.thus,the sheriff can only be held liable in his capacity as a supervisor of the jail for his own unconstitutional conduct.city of canton harris,no respondeat superior liability of supervisors.
the browns have alleged two theories of supervisory liability,which,being founded on the same facts,may be discussed together.mirroring the requirements in this circuit,they contend first that callahan failed to train or supervise bolin and the jail staff that a causal link exists between the failure to train or supervise and the unconstitutional denial of medical care to jason and his failure to train or supervise amounts to deliberate indifference.estate of davis city of richland hills,cir their second theory of liability is that the sheriff ratified or condoned bolin custom or policy of intimidating nurses from providing needed medical care,and the custom or policy was so deficient that the policy itself is a repudiation of constitutional rights and is the moving force of the constitutional violation.cozzo tangipahoa parish,cir citing thompkins belt,cir.
for purposes of analysis,we assume arguendo that jason brown experienced an unconstitutional denial of medical care while a pretrial detainee,and that the denial of care enabled his gastrointestinal hemorrhage to become fatal.
the facts relevant to the browns theories,developed in discovery,demonstrate that the sheriff is legally responsible for operating the county jail.loc.ann.a.in the mid the county executed a contract with bolin explicitly requiring the doctor to supervise the professional work of the jail medical staff,six licensed vocational nurses lvns,while the sheriff supervised their employment.during the period in question,the jail formal medical care plan complied with state standards.the browns have offered no evidence that any detainee before jason brown experienced allegedly substandard medical care or any denial of his constitutional right to receive medical care at the wichita county jail.
