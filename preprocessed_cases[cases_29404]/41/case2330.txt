american federation of government employees,afge,and edwin savlov collectively appellants brought this action to challenge appellees or va exemption from arbitration of a grievance that had been filed under the negotiated grievance procedure of a collective bargaining agreement.ruling on for summary judgment,the district court accepted one reason given by the va,but found that an alternate reason would not have justified the exemption from arbitration.appellants appealed and the va the district court rejection of the alternate ground asserted as a basis for an exemption from arbitration.the va also appeals the district court earlier denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
background 
savlov was a va physician who filed a grievance alleging unlawful discrimination based upon his age and gender.savlov spent approximately seventy percent of his time providing primary care services,in the form of compensation and pension examinations c p examinations,and approximately thirty percent of his time performing surgeries.the basis of the grievance was the allegation that savlov was removed from surgical duties at the age of,and his specialty pay for surgery was discontinued,even though,allegedly,a female physician of approximately the same age,who had also been removed from surgical duty,continued to receive specialty pay.savlov was denied specialty pay from,when he was removed from surgical duty,until,when he retired and ceased all work for the.he estimates that he was denied a total of approximately in specialty pay,which he allegedly should have received in addition to his pay for his primary care duties.
title vii of the civil service reform act of csra,codified at,governs labor management and relations for federal employees.the csra authorizes collective bargaining with certain federal employees.the csra also directs that a collective bargaining agreement cba shall provide procedures for the settlement of grievances.a.a ny grievance not satisfactorily settled under the negotiated grievance procedure shall be subject to binding arbitration which may be invoked by either the exclusive representative or the agency.id.at b c iii emphasis added.the grievance procedure in this case was the product of a cba that the union,as labor exclusive representative,negotiated with the va pursuant to a.
the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia decision in colorado nurses ass flra,questioned whether the csra applied to the labor rights of va medical professionals.in response to the colorado nurses decision,congress enacted as part of the department of veterans affairs labor relations improvement act of in an effort to grant va medical professionals the title collective bargaining rights enjoyed by other federal employees.
while va medical professionals now enjoy collective bargaining rights,including a grievance procedure,these rights are restricted by three significant exemptions designed to ensure adequate patient care and to prevent conflicts with statutorily established pay scales.the rights to grievance procedures provided by a cba do not extend to three statutorily exempted types of disputes,relevantly including any matter or question concerning or arising out of professional conduct or competence or the establishment,determination,or adjustment of employee compensation under this title.id.b.section d provides that whether a matter concerns or arises from one of the exemptions of b shall be decided by the secretary and is not itself subject to collective bargaining and may not be reviewed by any other agency.d.
after exhausting the procedures of the negotiated grievance process,afge local,acting on savlov behalf,sought to have the grievance resolved by a labor arbitrator,in accordance with the terms of the cba.before the dispute was finally submitted to the arbitrator,va under secretary roswell issued a decision paper,under the authority of d determining that the grievance was exempt from the terms of the cba because the grievance involved issues of professional conduct or competence and because it concerns or arises out of a matter or question of the establishment,determination,or adjustment of compensation under title.after issuing its decision paper,the va moved for the arbitration to be dismissed with prejudice,based upon the exemptions defined by b.the arbitrator dismissed the case without prejudice to give appellants an opportunity to seek judicial review.plaintiffs filed no exceptions to the arbitrator decision and filed this action,claiming that the va had misused,misapplied and violated b and d.
the district court ruled on the parties for summary judgment and found that the va misapplied the exclusion based on the establishment,determination,or adjustment of employee compensation,b,but was exempted from arbitration because it had correctly applied the professional conduct or competence exemption under b.plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal,and the va,arguing that the district court erred in rejecting the va argument that the matter was exempt from arbitration because it involved an adjustment of employee compensation under b and in rebuffing the va claim that the circuit is the exclusive forum for judicial review of this dispute.
discussion 
a.the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the.standard of review 
the district court properly denied the va motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.our review of the district court subject matter jurisdiction is de novo.see,campos nail,cir.the district court based its assertion of jurisdiction on,which authorizes original jurisdiction in federal district courts over disputes arising out of the application of federal law.see gallo cattle dep t of,cir a federal court has jurisdiction pursuant to over challenges to federal agency action as claims arising under federal law,unless a statute expressly precludes review.the va argues that the district court jurisdiction over this case was precluded by e of title,which provides 
a petition for judicial review or petition for enforcement under section of title in any case involving employees described in section b of this title or arising out of the applicability of chapter of title to employees in those positions,shall be taken only in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit.
the va argues that e applies to this case and limits the forum in which judicial review could have been sought by appellants because the d determination denied the applicability of the grievance procedure and,therefore,the applicability of chapter of title to savlov appellants argue that e limits jurisdiction only over petitions arising under section of title.section of title relates to judicial review of orders of the federal labor relations authority flra,and no such order was ever issued in this case because judicial review was sought instead of an appeal to the flra.an appeal of the arbitrator dismissal to the flra would have been fruitless because the flra constitutes a different agency and can not rule on the propriety of the va use of d.see dep t of veterans affairs,wl.
we review de novo the district court construction or interpretation of a statute.our analysis begins with the language of the statute.united states davidson,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the parties vigorously dispute the statutory construction and legislative history of e.the va argues that several possible readings of e grant the circuit exclusive jurisdiction over disputes that do not involve an flra order,but we reject the va alternate readings of the statute and affirm the district court assertion of jurisdiction.
the va first proposed reading of e 
a petition for review is a phrase associated with judicial review of an administrative decision.section a of title authorizes judicial review for a ny person aggrieved by any final order of the flra.a petition for enforcement is a petition,filed by the reviewing administrative agency,such as the flra,which seeks judicial enforcement of an order.both parties agree that,under the best reading of the statute,both of the terms petition for judicial review and petition for enforcement are modified by the phrase under section of title.the parties disagree on how this phrase is modified by the remaining phrase,in any case involving employees described in section b of this title or arising out of the applicability of chapter of title to employees in those positions.the va argues that the clause or arising out of the applicability of chapter of title to employees in those positions has independent meaning and that the circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over any appeal challenging the va application of chapter of title to employees in those positions.the va argues that jurisdiction is therefore limited to the circuit for review of any petition for review or enforcement under section of title in any case involving va health care professionals or any petition arising out of the applicability of chapter of title to employees in those positions.
we do not agree with the va proposed reading of the statute.section e limits jurisdiction to the circuit only with respect to a petition for judicial review or petition for enforcement under section of title.to read the statute as suggested by the va would expand the statute reach beyond its plain meaning.the meaning of the language or arising out of the applicability of chapter of title to employees in those positions can be determined by the context,which is that this clause refers to a petition involving such issues.the types of petitions that are jurisdictionally limited are specified in the first clause of the sentence,which refers to petitions for review or petitions for enforcement under section of title.the va argues that the opening phrase a petition for review or petition for enforcement is actually modified by two independent phrases,the first being under section of title in any case involving employees described in section b of this title and the second modifying phrase being or arising out of the applicability of chapter of title to employees in those positions.the problem with the va reading is that it divorces the phrase petition for review or petition for enforcement from the words under section of title even though that section clearly refers to and defines the types of orders that may serve as the basis for such petitions,and despite the fact that these clauses are not grammatically separated in a way to indicate that any of the subsequent text in e refers to petitions not brought under.the plain language of e refers only to petitions for review or petitions for enforcement under of title.section of title,in turn,specifically references petitions for review and petitions for enforcement as means to challenge or enforce certain flra orders.moreover,the types of petitions for judicial review are limited by and would have precluded judicial review of an flra order in the instant case.
although all parties would agree that e was not intended to prevent all forms of judicial review,they disagree about whether any meaningful review could take place under the va construction of the statute.because d prohibits review by any other agency,it is undisputed that the flra would not have had jurisdiction over the dismissal of the arbitration in this case.accordingly,the circuit would have affirmed the flra dismissal and never reached the merits of the arbitration in light of a,which prohibits judicial review of a petition for review of an flra decision that involves the award of an arbitrator unless the order involves an unfair labor practice under section of this title.a.because no unfair labor practice under was involved in this case,as a practical matter,an appeal from the arbitrator decision would be immune from any form of substantive agency or judicial review.
the va asserts that the statutory construction adopted by the district court,and urged by appellants,renders the phrase or arising out of the applicability of chapter of title to employees in those positions superfluous because that clause is preceded by a clause referring to petitions brought under of title in any case involving employees described in section b of this title.e emphasis added.although at first blush,the phrase in any case appears to cover any flra cases involving such employees,a closer reading of the section shows that the words or arising out of the applicability of chapter of title clause does not have independent meaning but modifies the phrase under section of title in any case involving employees described in section b of this title.we do not believe that such a reading renders the phrase arising out of the applicability of chapter of title to employees in those positions superfluous because the phrase is merely a description of a type of flra order that can only be reviewed in the circuit as opposed to other courts that may otherwise have had jurisdiction.see a and b authorizing petitions for review of flra orders in the united states court of appeals in the circuit in which the person resides or transacts business and petitions for enforcement in any appropriate united states court of appeals preminger principi,cir section gives the federal circuit exclusive jurisdiction to review challenges to most actions by the secretary of veterans affairs.moreover,the statute does not provide for exclusive jurisdiction over petitions for review or enforcement in any case involving a order involving b employees or in any case arising out of the applicability of chapter of title to such employees.instead,the statute drafters placed the phrase in any case after a description of the types of petitions whose review would be jurisdictionally limited,petitions for review or enforcement under.therefore,based on the plain language of the statute,we conclude that e does not grant exclusive jurisdiction to the circuit over petitions involving b employees or the applicability of chapter or title,unless those petitions also arise from an flra order as described in.because no such order was issued in this case,we find that the district court properly asserted jurisdiction.
the va second proposed reading of e 
the va admittedly second best construction of the statute suggests that the various canons of statutory construction,including the doctrine of the last antecedent,should control our reading of the statute.under the doctrine of the last antecedent,qualifying phrases are to be applied to the words or phrase immediately preceding the qualifier and are not to be construed as modifying more remote phrases.see bingham,united states,cir.the va argues that,applying the doctrine of the last antecedent,under section of title modifies only the words petition for enforcement and not the words petition for judicial review.
we find this argument unpersuasive.the implication of the va argument is that any petition for review involving a b employee,irrespective of the subject matter,would have to be litigated in the circuit.this reading is inconsistent with our reading of the text,as discussed above,as well as the statutory framework and history of e.
nothing in the text of e,or case law addressing judicial review of va actions,suggests that congress intended to grant exclusive jurisdiction to the circuit over all petitions for review brought by va professionals in any context.see,preminger,at discussing the federal circuit exclusive jurisdiction over most actions of the va secretary.when,as in this case,the doctrine of the last antecedent is inconsistent with the plain language and the legislative history of the statute,a court must adhere to a logical plain reading of the statute.see may trucking or.dot,cir holding that the doctrine of the last antecedent only applies where no contrary intention appears nw.forest res.council glickman,cir w e are not inflexible in our application of the doctrine of last antecedent,and have recognized that the principle must yield to the most logical meaning of a statute that emerges from its plain language and legislative history.section e,plainly refers to both a petition for judicial review and a petition for enforcement in connection with the phrase under section of title.moreover,a provides that a ny person aggrieved by any final order of th
