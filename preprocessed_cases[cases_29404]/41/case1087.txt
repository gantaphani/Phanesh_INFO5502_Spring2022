the plaintiffs,julie and david brittingham,appeal the district court denial of their motions to remand the case to state court and its grant of summary judgment in favor of both defendants,virginia stull and general motors corporation gm.the plaintiffs claims arose from a physical examination conducted by one of gm physicians,stull.that examination produced two abnormal lung function tests,the results of which were never discussed with brittingham.when she was later diagnosed with a lung disease,the plaintiffs sued gm,stull,and several others for negligence,intentional misconduct,breach of fiduciary duty,and fraudulent concealment.the case was originally filed in state court,but was removed by the defendants to federal district court under on the basis of complete preemption.because we find that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction at the time of removal,we vacate the district court judgment and remand with instructions to remand the matter to the state court from which it came.
factual and procedural background 
brittingham applied for employment at gm in july.on august,she underwent a physical examination that included a pulmonary function test.after the first test showed brittingham lung function to be of predicted value,the test was repeated and again it showed diminished lung function,this time at of predicted value.in her deposition,brittingham testified that no one explained to her why the test had to be repeated.joint appendix ja at iii.after reviewing two abnormal pulmonary function tests,stull did not discuss the results and their significance with brittingham.instead,stull had brittingham sign a printout of the results and then approved her for employment in a gm plant.subsequently,brittingham worked for gm from september,until august,when she became physically unable to continue working.in september,brittingham was diagnosed with antitrypsin deficiency syndrome aad,also known as acquired emphysema.aad is an inherited condition resulting from the liver failure to produce a sufficient amount of the protein antritrypsin.to extend her shortening life expectancy,brittingham,as of september,was awaiting a double lung transplant which carries a fifty percent,death rate.brittingham maintains that if stull had informed her of the abnormal test results and referred her to a physician,she would have stopped smoking and sought immediate treatment.
on february,the brittinghams filed a complaint against gm,stull,and others in ohio state court.at vol.ii.the defendants removed the case to federal court on the grounds that some of the claims were subject to complete preemption under section of the labor management relations act lmra.they argued that the state law tort claims were actually based on alleged breaches of the collective bargaining agreement cba that brittingham was subject to during the course of her employment.the plaintiffs moved to remand arguing that the complaint only stated state law claims,did not rely on any provision in the cba,and did not contain a federal claim.at vol.i.the district court disagreed,reasoning that it had subject matter jurisdiction over at least one of the plaintiffs allegation that brittingham was coerced to return to it fell within the scope of the cba and was necessarily preempted.id.at.the court noted that the cba specifically addressed sick leave and returning to work and that there was no basis in state tort law for a claim based on being coerced to return to work.id.after denying the motion to remand,the district court granted the plaintiffs motion to file an amended that would be limited to state law that the plaintiffs express purpose was to eliminate any claim which would be subject to preemption.id.at.
the plaintiffs first amended complaint,in addition to other changes,omitted the previous allegations that gm placed brittingham in an environmentally hazardous work environment and coerced her to return to work when she was ill.id.at.those two claims were dismissed with prejudice.id.at.the district court then reached the issue of whether it had original jurisdiction over any of the remaining claims in the amended asking whether there were any remaining claims that were preempted by the lmra.the defendants argued that several of the plaintiffs claims were of which were omitted in the amended complaint except one that gm and delphi failed to disclose the results of her physical examination both before and after her employment.id.at.the defendants contended that the claim would require reference to a provision in the cba that provides a report of physical examination and any laboratory test made by physicians acting for the corporation will be given sic the personal physician of the individual employee involved upon the written request of the employee.id.at.the district court found that brittingham was not subject to the cba at the time of the examination and consequently was not subject to any particular procedure for receiving finding reinforced by the complaint language limiting the claim to the time period before and after employment.since the plaintiffs claims would not require interpretation of the cba and were rooted in state law,none of the remaining claims were preempted.id.at.finding it no longer had original jurisdiction,the district court then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the plaintiffs state law claims,some of which might raise potentially complicated issues of state law.id.at.the case was remanded to state court.
upon returning to state court,the plaintiffs again amended their complaint and again it was removed to federal court by the defendants.the significant difference between the first amended which the district court found that none of the claims were the amended complaint filed in state court was that the former limited the negligence claim to the time before and after employment while the latter did not.compare pl.am.compl.federal court,at i,they failed to disclose to plaintiff julie brittingham the results both before and after her employment,with pl.am.compl.state court,at i,said defendants failed to disclose to plaintiff julie brittingham the results of her physical examination and testing with general motors.the plaintiffs filed a motion to remand arguing that none of the claims were preempted.the district court concluded that the complaint,taken on its face,presents factual allegations of actions that allegedly occurred while brittingham was employed at gm or delphi and since those actions may have taken place during the time when brittingham was governed by the cba,adjudication of the claims may require interpretation of the cba.at vii.consequently,the district court denied the plaintiffs motion to remand.
in april,the district court granted the plaintiffs motion to file a second amended complaint.in the second amended complaint,the plaintiffs limited each of the claims discussed above to the time period before and after employment.the district court,dismissing numerous arguments by the defendants that some of the claims were still preempted,concluded that the plaintiffs second amended complaint was not subject to preemption.however,instead of remanding the case back to state court,the court exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.the court attributed the volleying of the case between federal and state court to the plaintiffs tactics which it found were clearly manipulative,regardless of whether they were intentional.id.at.the court noted that significant litigation in the case had already taken place and it found that the principles of judicial economy and fairness outweighed the principle of comity in the instant case.id.at.
in november,the district court granted stull motion for summary judgment after it found that the plaintiffs complaint was for medical malpractice,which is subject to a statute of limitations that the plaintiffs had not met.id.at.in june,the district court granted gm motion for summary judgment because it found that,under ohio law,a potential employer does not have a duty to disclose an applicant medical condition to her and refer her to a qualified physician.at ix.without a duty,the plaintiffs other claims,including intentional misconduct,breach of fiduciary duty,fraudulent concealment,and loss of consortium were dismissed.id.
we review a district court decision regarding subject matter jurisdiction de novo.long bando of,cir.in order to invoke the district court removal jurisdiction,a defendant must show that the district court has original jurisdiction over the action.id.at.further,t he burden of showing that the district court has original jurisdiction is on the party seeking removal.id.
when the defendants removed the case to federal court for the second time,the district court declined to remand it to state court.the court reasoned that it had subject matter jurisdiction because at least two of the plaintiffs claims were preempted because they implicated facts that may have occurred while brittingham was an employee and governed by the cba.on review,we find that none of the claims in the plaintiffs amended complaint in state court were preempted because none of them required an interpretation of the cba rather,each claim was based solely on state law rights.
section of the labor management relations act provides 
suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce may be brought in any district court of the united states having jurisdiction of the parties,without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.
a.causes of action within the scope of section are removable to federal court under the doctrine of complete preemption.caterpillar williams,d.questions relating to what the parties to a labor agreement agreed,and what legal consequences were intended to flow from breaches of that agreement,must be resolved by reference to uniform federal law,whether such questions arise in the context of a suit for breach of contract or in a suit alleging liability in tort.lueck,d.in lingle norge division of magic chef,d,the supreme court emphasized that the policy underlying the preemption doctrine is to ensure uniform interpretation of agreements to promote the peaceable,consistent resolution of disputes.these policies are not implicated in every labor law case.as the court has stated,not every dispute concerning employment,or tangentially involving a provision of a agreement,is by or other provisions of the federal labor law,at.it is only when resolution of a claim is substantially dependent upon analysis of the terms of an agreement made between the parties in a labor contract,that the claim must either be treated as a claim or dismissed as by federal law.id.at.emphasis added.i t would be inconsistent with congressional intent under section to state rules that proscribe conduct,or establish rights and obligations,independent of a labor contract.id.at.
in lingle,the supreme court delineated the guiding principle for courts to use when discerning whether the state law claim is preempted 
i f the resolution of a claim depends upon the meaning of a agreement,the application of state law which might lead to inconsistent results since there could be as many principles as there are states is preempted and federal uniform throughout the be employed to resolve the dispute.
at.further,in caterpillar,the supreme court clarified that s ection governs claims founded directly on rights created by agreements,and also claims substantially dependent on analysis of a agreement.at.citing electrical workers hechler,d.based on the supreme court directives,this circuit developed a approach for determining whether a state law claim is preempted by section.first,the district court must examine whether proof of the state law claim requires interpretation of collective bargaining agreement terms.decoe general motors,cir.the question informing the first step analysis is whether the plaintiff can prove all the elements of her claim without contract interpretation.id.looking to the essence of a plaintiff claim,a court must determine whether the plaintiff is attempting to disguise what is essentially a contract claim as a tort.id.the second step requires a court to ascertain whether the right claimed by the plaintiff is created by the collective bargaining agreement or by state law.id.
the plaintiffs claim for negligence and intentional misconduct was based upon two factual allegations that s aid defendants failed to disclose to plaintiff julie brittingham the results of her physical examination and testing with general motors and that s aid defendants failed to disclose to plaintiff julie brittingham facts about her medical condition that said defendants knew,but of which julie brittingham was unaware.at ii.to determine whether the claim is preempted,we inquire whether proving this claim would require the interpretation of any provision in the cba.we must also ascertain whether the right claimed by the plaintiff is created by the collective bargaining agreement or by state law.decoe,at.to succeed on a negligence claim under ohio law,a plaintiff must establish the existence of a duty,a breach of that duty,and causation of an injury.see menifee,adm x ohio welding,ohio,ohio.there are three cba provisions that the defendants argue would be relevant to a court inquiry.first,there is a provision that reads w hen physicals are conducted on area hire or extended area hire applicants,the criteria used is the same as that used for a fit for duty exam when an employee of that plant is undergoing a reinstatement to return to work from sick leave.at i.the second provision requires the employer to provide physical exams to employees who are exposed to certain substances and provides that each employee may request a written report of the results of such examinations which are related to occupational exposure.at i.these provisions are easily dismissed as inapplicable to brittingham factual situation.the first is irrelevant because brittingham was not an area hire or extended area hire applicant.the second provision only governs examinations taken while the individual is an employee and its procedure for the report of such results is limited to tests related to occupational exposure it would not cover physical examinations.
the third provision presents the more difficult question.it reads a report of physical examination and any laboratory test made by physicians acting for the corporation will be given sic the personal physician of the individual employee involved upon the request of the employee.at i.on its face,the provision only governs employees and would not apply or govern the disclosure of results either before or after brittingham employment with gm.we agree with the district court that if the claim is limited to the time before and after employment,it is clearly not preempted.at i.what makes the issue more complicated is that the plaintiffs amended complaint in state court did not limit the time period to before and after employment.consequently,the defendants argue that any alleged duty to disclose that arose during the course of brittingham employment would require an interpretation of the cba provision covering the disclosure of test results to an employee.we find this argument unpersuasive.
first,the cba provision is best interpreted as governing individuals who were employees at the time of the examination.the provision twice refers to an employee,as opposed to job applicants.that brittingham later became an employee does not alter our view that the provision appears to apply solely to those individuals who were employees when the exam took place.this reasoning comports with the district court interpretation of the provision when it was deciding whether the plaintiffs second amended complaint was preempted.although the second amended complaint was limited to the time before and after employment,the district court analysis is accurate and instructive the section cited presumably applies to employees who are members of the collective bargaining unit and does not refer to physical examinations made prior to when brittingham was employed and was not a member of the collective bargaining unit.at iii.second,the provision makes l
