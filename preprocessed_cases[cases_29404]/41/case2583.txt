few decisions by state officials are as wrenching as the decision to remove a child from a home based on suspicion of parental abuse.the competing constitutional interests are so powerful that courts have struggled to find adequate superlatives.on one hand,the state interest in shielding children from abuse is transcendent,maryland craig,d internal quotation marks omitted,compelling,globe newspaper super.for norfolk county,d,of the highest order,palmore sidoti,d,of surpassing importance,new york ferber,d.on the other hand,parents interest in raising their children free from government interference is essential,meyer nebraska,cardinal,prince massachusetts,an enduring american tradition,wisconsin yoder,d,perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by the supreme court,troxel granville,d.
the state failure to act on reasonable suspicion of abuse can have unthinkable consequences for the children physical injury,emotional scarring,a lifetime of recovery,disease,dysfunction,or death.but false positives can carry grave and irreversible consequences as well anguish for the family,public humiliation,developmental setbacks for the children,distrust,or divorce.
in this case,we revisit the constitutional standard for determining whether state officials may remove children from a home,consistent with procedural due process,without affording the parents advance notice or a hearing.based on our recent decision in gomes wood,cir,we hold that police and social workers in this case had reasonable and articulable suspicion that the child ren ha d been abused or were in imminent peril of abuse.id.at quoting hatch dep t for children,youth their families,cir.we therefore affirm the decision of the district court granting summary judgment to the defendants.
factual and procedural background 
the plaintiffs,jacinto arredondo and marisela olivas,have two children,ashley and jasmine.on february,olivas brought jasmine,then eleven months old,to the emergency room at artesia general hospital in artesia,new mexico.olivas reported that jasmine was having difficulty crawling,and revealed a single fracture in her left arm.when asked how the injury occurred,olivas offered two different explanations that jasmine had been trying to crawl and the arm buckled,app,and that jasmine had a fall from the bed the day before,app.the physician assistant who first saw jasmine,gary boone,found her injury inconsistent with this explanation because t he fracture was too high up and i f she had fallen and tried to catch herself then she would have more than likely broken both bones in her arm.app.william baggs,an orthopedic surgeon who treated jasmine that day,also found olivas story slightly confusing and a red flag.id.at.a complete babygram a set of from head to toe revealed no other fractures,however,and neither boone nor baggs made a report to the new mexico children,youth and families department cyfd.
four days later,on the night of february,olivas again brought jasmine to the emergency room,this time because jasmine could not put weight on her left leg.baggs also examined jasmine on the morning of february.an revealed some fuzziness and a periosteal reaction consistent with a healing injury.id.at.olivas attributed the injury to the same fall from the bed.mom said this occurred at the same time.id.based on olivas conflicting stories and the fact that jasmine had suffered two injuries requiring emergency care within four days,joann vandergriff and baggs each made referrals to cyfd on february.id.at.the cyfd intake report for vandergriff referral states that she suspect ed possible pa physical abuse pn physical neglect of child.id.at.baggs notes reflect the same concerns two injuries in this month old raises the question of child abuse.id.at.his report also stat ed that the left femur was broken,id.at,although the hospital showed no fracture,id.at.
cyfd coded the case,a designation requiring action within hours,and two social workers were assigned to the investigation.defendant naomi locklear was given overall responsibility for jasmine case,but due to her absence on february,defendant rebecca was charged with initiating action.shortly before the hour deadline expired on february,contacted another defendant,detective rudy arrey of the artesia police department,for assistance.
together they visited the hospital.nurse vandergriff was not available,but they spoke with physician assistant boone,who had seen jasmine on february.he recounted his reasons for suspicion regarding the fractured arm,adding that i t look ed as if she were grabbed and pulled,id.at,using a torquing motion,id.at.he also reiterated that,contrary to baggs report,taken at the hospital had detected no injury around the left hip or upper thigh.id.at.next they proceeded to the plaintiffs home.at first,olivas refused to speak with detective arrey,citing concern about her probation on a fraud conviction for playing with counterfeit money,but after speaking with her parole officer she allowed them inside.id.at.and detective arrey examined the bed from which jasmine reportedly had fallen.it was only to feet off the floor,and the floor beneath was covered in thick maroon carpet.id.at.
detective arrey decided to remove jasmine from her parents custody immediately.he based his decision on the two injuries,olivas conflicting explanations,and the implausibility of olivas story that a short fall onto a carpeted floor caused both a broken arm and a broken leg.understandably,olivas became angry and upset.id.she was a good mother,she said,and if she was a child abuser,why did jasmine have bruise s all over her id.she begged them not to take jasmine away,and told him they were falsely accusing me of something that was not true.id.at.he told her to calm down.id.at.
detective arrey decided to remove ashley,who was then five years old,at the same time.he had learned,at a training class sponsored by cyfd,that if one of the children is in harm,then when it taken out of the home,then the abuse goes to the other child or children.id.at.in his experience,it was common practice that all the children have to be taken when there is a risk that any child in a home has suffered abuse.id.disagreed.based on her own conversation with ashley,during which ashley showed no signs of injury and reported no abuse,she concluded that ashley was fine.id.at.she therefore refused to take custody of ashley.detective array was frustrated and angry with that decision because,in his view,both children were at risk of being abused by their caretakers.id.at.that day,cyfd removed only jasmine from the plaintiffs home,giving custody to olivas sister,yolanda due√±ez.
the next morning,february,locklear returned to work and expanded the investigation.she contacted baggs,who described jasmine injury as suspicious for a healing fracture and a red flag.id.at.she then conducted a lengthy phone interview with olivas,who described the events surrounding jasmine fall from the bed.she also learned from detective arrey that arredondo had a felony conviction for cocaine trafficking.around noon,locklear held a staff meeting,joined by,their supervisor,and a cyfd attorney.they agreed that jasmine faced an immediate risk of harm,id.at,and decided to place her in foster care immediately,out of concern that olivas sister would not do enough to prevent the plaintiffs from visiting and physically abusing jasmine.
the staff also agreed to remove ashley on a targeted child or scapegoat theory.according to locklear,it is very common for abusive families to target one child who gets the brunt of the abuse.id.at.when the targeted child is removed,leaving no one else in the home for them to abuse,the abuse shifts to other children.id.it was agreed at the staff meeting that jasmine was the most needy,the most demanding child in the plaintiffs home,and that if she were removed,ashley could become the scapegoat.id.the staff also relied upon computer software called structure sic decision making sdm,which,according to the defendants,objectively assessed and confirmed locklear belief as to the level of risk faced by jasmine and ashley.locklear response br.although continued to believe that there was no emergency situation,app,and that there was no reason on either the or the why a court order could not have been obtained,id.at,she apparently did not voice her dissent at the meeting.
early that afternoon,and a fourth defendant,administrative sergeant mike pitts,went to ashley school.they found olivas there,and provided her with two documents a statement of reasonable grounds,informing her that sergeant pitts was taking jasmine and ashley into custody because he had reasonable grounds to believe that they were suffering from an illness or injury as a result of alleged abuse or neglect were in danger from their surroundings,id.at and a notice to parents of physical custody,informing her that jasmine and ashley had been taken into custody as alleged neglected or abused children and requiring cyfd to file a petition alleging neglect or abuse by february or release them,id.at.they took custody of ashley and placed her in foster care.
on february,a state district court issued an ex parte order finding probable cause to believe that both jasmine and ashley were abused or neglected under new mexico law.id.at.six days later,on march,the plaintiffs and their attorney attended a custody hearing before the same judge.again the court upheld cyfd custody,finding probable cause to believe that the children will be subject to injury by others if not placed in the custody of the department.id.at.
on march,baggs contacted cyfd and reported that he had misdiagnosed jasmine leg injury.rather than a fracture,she had suffered a septic hip,a serious bacterial infection that requires immediate surgery to avoid permanent damage to the hip joint.he told cyfd that he feared malpractice liability because jasmine might walk with a limp and have complications.id.at.he also recanted his earlier report to cyfd,making clear that he had no concerns regarding suspected child abuse or neglect.id.
initially cyfd was unimpressed.based on olivas unsatisfactory explanation for the first injury,as well as other concerns with olivas parenting skills,locklear decided to retain custody of both children indefinitely.id.for reasons that are unclear,however,cyfd reversed course two weeks later,and released both children to their parents custody on march.
arredondo and olivas filed suit under,alleging that the removal of their children without notice and a hearing violated their procedural due process rights.on for summary judgment,the defendants argued not only that their actions were justified by emergency circumstances which pose an immediate threat to the safety of the child,roska ex rel.roska peterson,cir quoting hollingsworth hill,cir,but that they were entitled to qualified immunity.the district court agreed on both counts,holding that the plaintiffs had failed to show any genuine issues of material fact as to the existence of a constitutional violation,and that in any case the law was not clearly established such that the defendants had fair warning that their conduct was unlawful.mem.
when a defendant raises the defense of qualified immunity,we must consider two questions whether the alleged conduct violated a constitutional right,and if so,whether the law was clearly established at the time of the defendant actions.shrum city of coweta,cir quoting saucier katz,d.we must first resolve whether a constitutional violation occurred because,in the course of determining whether a constitutional right was violated on the premises alleged,a court might find it necessary to set forth principles which will become the basis for a holding that a right is clearly established.harman pollock,cir quoting saucier,at.we review the district court grant of summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity de novo,and affirm only if the record reveals no genuine issue of material fact,such that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.johnson ex rel.estate of cano holmes,cir.
ii.discussion 
the supreme court has held that under the fourteenth amendment,parents enjoy a protected liberty interest in the care,custody,and control of their children.troxel,at.state officials therefore may neither permanently terminate parental rights,santosky kramer,d,nor temporarily remove children from a home,roska,at,without affording the parents due process of law.
ordinarily,due process requires that the state provide parents with predeprivation notice and a hearing that is,notice and an opportunity to be heard before state officials remove children from the home.hollingsworth hill,cir.given the state powerful countervailing interest in protecting children from abuse and neglect,however,we have long recognized that extraordinary circumstances may justify the state in postponing the hearing until after the event.spielman hildebrand,cir quoting smith org.of foster families for equality and reform,d.faced with emergency circumstances which pose an immediate threat to the safety of a child,the state may temporarily deprive a parent of custody without parental consent or a court order.hollingsworth,at.for such a procedure to comport with due process,of course,the state must provide a prompt postdeprivation hearing.
following the order of operations set forth in saucier,we first consider whether there are genuine issues of material fact as to the existence of a constitutional violation,and then consider whether the law was clearly established at the time of the defendants actions.
constitutional violation 
in gomes wood,cir,this court adopted a reasonable suspicion standard for determining whether emergency circumstances justify the removal of a child from a home without notice and a hearing.under that standard,state officials must have evidence giving rise to a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the child has been abused or is in imminent peril of abuse.id.quoting hatch dep t for children,youth their families,cir.although we give some consideration to whether state officials might obtain judicial authorization of the removal without additional risk to the child,id.at,we take care not to make this factor the single focus of the inquiry,id.at quoting doe kearney,cir.among the standards proposed by various courts of appeals,we concluded,this standard best balances the interests of the parents,the child,and the state.id.
because gomes is our only case decided under the reasonable suspicion standard,a brief review of its facts is in order.in april,shauna gomes took her daughter rebekah to a pediatrician for diagnosis of a head injury,and told the doctor that rebekah had fallen from the bed the previous day.id.at.revealed a skull fracture,but the shape of the fracture suggested to the doctor that it had been caused by a blunt trauma.id.he told gomes that he was required to make a report to the state division of child and family services,but sent her home with a prescription for motrin.id.in his report to the agency,he said that gomes explanation of the injury was suspicious but possible,noting that the fracture was consistent with a fall on a flat object.id.he was also concerned that gomes had waited until the next day to seek medical attention.id.the intake worker said that because the matter did not appear to be an emergency,an investigator would call back the next day.id.at.no one fact,no one took any gomes returned for a visit with rebekah and asked the doctor whether he had contacted child and family services yet.id.that day the doctor finally spoke with a social worker about rebekah injuries.based on the seriousness of the injury,the doctor suspicions about the explanation,and the delay in seeking medical attention,state officials decided to conduct a home visit.id.when a social worker and police officer finally observed the bed and floor,two days later,they found gomes explanation implausible and immediately removed rebekah from her parents custody,without notice or a hearing.id.at.after four months in state custody,the agency decided that rebekah should be returned to her family.id.
based on those facts,we held that the record supported gomes claim that state officials lacked reasonable and articulable suspicion that rebekah ha d been abused or was in imminent peril of abuse.id.at.the doctor never was highly suspicious that rebekah had been the victim of child abuse,and his report specifically stated that her fracture was consistent with a fall on a flat object.id.both the doctor and the intake worker at the agency saw no imminent peril of abuse,as the doctor felt comfortable sending the child home and the agency took no action for two days.id.most strikingly,it was gomes herself who reminded the doctor about the need for consultation with child and family services,kickstarting an investigation that the state apparently had abandoned.her actions therefore were arguably inconsistent with that of a neglectful or abusive parent.id.taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,we held that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the defendant officials removed rebekah without reasonable and articulable suspicion.id.quoting hatch,at.
in this case,by contrast,we find that the evidence available to state officials was sufficient to create reasonable suspicion that jasmine had been abused,and that ashley was in imminent peril of abuse.because that evidence differs with respect to each of the children,we separately discuss whether genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment as to jasmine and ashley.
the rationale for intervention in jasmine case was much clearer than in ashley.the defendants had ample evidence giving rise to a reasonable and articulable suspicion that jasmine had been abused or was in imminent danger of abuse.in a period of four days,she had suffered two injuries requiring emergency care,one of which appeared to have resulted from a sharp grab or torquing motion.app.olivas had offered conflicting stories about how the injuries occurred,and baggs and physician assistant boone believed that her explanation could not be squared with the of jasmine arm.nurse vandergriff and baggs reported their concerns about child abuse to cyfd independently,fulfilling a statutory duty to report the matter immediately whenever they know or ha ve a reasonable suspicion that a child is an abused or neglected child.a.unlike the doctor report in gomes,baggs report unequivocally cited suspicions of child abuse.although the defendants knew that one set of had found nothing wrong with jasmine leg,they had another report from baggs that reached the opposite conclusion,diagnosing the injury as a fracture and calling it suspicious and a red flag.app.the fact that his diagnosis ultimately proved incorrect does not render the defendants reliance on it unreasonable.finally,during a visit to the home,two of the defendants inspected the bed from which jasmine fell,and found it highly unlikely that a short drop onto thick carpet could have caused such serious injuries.under the circumstances,there is no question that the defendants had a reasonable and articulable basis for suspicion of abuse with respect to jasmine.
the plaintiffs rely heavily on two statements by.first,says that she did not at any jasmine faced an emergency situation.id.at.yet was only one member of the team of social workers that agreed on february that jasmine was still in immediate danger of harm,and she apparently did not share her reservations with her colleagues,either before or after the staff meeting.id.at.her statement is also difficult to reconcile with her actions she found the situation urgent enough,on the afternoon of february,to remove jasmine from the home immediately.in any case,subjective belief that the situation was not an emergency does not change the fact that the defendants had an objectively reasonable basis to suspect that jasmine had been abused or faced imminent peril of abuse.under gomes,reasonable suspicion is enough.
second,the plaintiffs quote as saying that there was no reason on either the or the why a court order could not have been obtained.app.as we made clear in gomes,the question of whether state officials had time to seek and obtain authorization for the removal without jeopardizing the safety of the child will be an important consideration when determining whether the circumstances justify the removal of a child without notice and a hearing.gomes,at.but as a practical matter,this factor can be difficult to evaluate it may not be entirely clear either how long it would take to obtain judicial approval or whether this period of delay would jeopardize the safety of the child.id.at.accordingly,to facilitate the subtle balancing required in cases,we take care not to blunt the inquiry by simply asking whether there was time to get a warrant.id.quoting kearney,at.we treat this factor as an important consideration,but not our sole focus.id.at quoting kearney,at.
although one member of the team investigating jasmine situation,stated her opinion that there was no reason why a court order could not have been obtained,she provided no information about the amount of time typically required to obtain a warrant,or her reasons for believing that the immediate danger of harm to jasmine did not require immediate removal.by contrast,locklear affidavit states that cyfd sdm or structured decision making software concluded that the children should be removed from the home pending a ex parte order.app.this demonstrates that the decisionmaking process of the team as a whole evaluated the imminence of harm to jasmine against the benchmark of the time it would take to obtain an ex parte order,as it should,leading to the conclusion that immediate removal was necessary.where,as here,the child had sustained two serious injuries in four days,without plausible explanation,the team was justified in believing that delay of even a brief duration could be calamitous.taking into account all relevant circumstances,one participant opinion that a court order could have been obtained is insufficient to show that the decision to remove jasmine from the home immediately falls short of the reasonable suspicion standard.see gomes,at.
in ashley case,the question of reasonable suspicion is much closer.the only basis for removing ashley from the home was the targeted child or scapegoat theory.the best description of this theory comes from the affidavit of karen campbell,a doctor consulted by cyfd concerning jasmine and ashley.she explains 
my reported concern of risk towards ashley,the older child,was based on my training and experience.studies show that siblings of abused children have a higher abuse rate than in the general population.because studies show that abuse or serious concerns of abuse exist in nearly half of the families in which another sibling had been previously abused,i believe it was necessary and essential to remove ashley from the home.
app.locklear,detective arrey,and sergeant pitts each echoed that description of the theory,adding that they based their decision on their own training and experience.according to locklear,the targeted child scenario is very common.id.at.
despite its apparent prevalence in discussions of child abuse among these state officials,the theory seldom has been invoked before the courts.only one federal court has considered whether a targeted child or scapegoat theory justifies removal of children from a home without notice and a hearing.see taylor evans,d,finding it not unreasonable for a social worker to remove all three children from a home where one child had sustained serious injuries,there was no consistent explanation to explain those injuries,and the social worker had received an unbiased,specific report citing fear of child abuse.also,at least one state court has incorporated the theory into its substantive standard for determining whether children are abused.see in re marino,authorizing lower courts to make derivative findings of severe abuse under state law,predicated upon the common understanding that a parent whose judgment and impulse control are so defective as to harm one child in his or her care is likely to harm others as well.
the targeted child theory has some intuitive appeal,but the parties have provided us with precious little information about it.according to the studies described by campbell,abuse or serious concerns of abuse exist in nearly ha
