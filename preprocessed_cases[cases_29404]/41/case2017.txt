in this action,stephen herzog,the prosecuting attorney of bannock county,idaho,appeals the district court order denying his motion for partial summary judgment and granting the joint motion for partial summary judgment in favor of appellees jennie mccormack mccormack and richard hearn.
before the district court,jennie mccormack claimed that idaho code title,chapters the pain capable unborn child protection act pucpa and,which regulate the performance of abortions,violate various provisions of the united states constitution.mccormack attorney is hearn,who is also an idaho licensed physician who intends to provide his patients with medical abortions.hearn,as a third,also challenged the constitutionality of and,which fall within chapters and of idaho code title.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
this case had its genesis in an idaho state criminal prosecution when,on may,the then prosecuting attorney for bannock county,idaho,mark hiedeman filed a criminal complaint against jennie mccormack.the complaint charged mccormack with violating idaho code for knowingly submitting to an abortion not authorized under the statute,or purposely a pregnancy.mccormack admitted to the police that she an abortion after ingesting a pack of five pills a physician examined the fetus and estimated its gestational age to have been between nineteen and weeks,but with difficult certainty.
then on september,an idaho state judge dismissed the criminal complaint without prejudice for lack of probable cause.
on september,mccormack filed a class action in the united states district court for the district of idaho against the then prosecuting attorney hiedeman,seeking a determination that section,as well as other provisions of title,chapters and of the idaho code,which also regulate abortion s,violate various provisions of the united states constitution.
on november,chief united states district judge for the district of idaho,lynn winmill,granted mccormack motion for preliminary injunctive relief and enjoined then prosecuting attorney hiedeman from enforcing criminalizing submitting to an abortion,as interpreted together with the district court,however,held that mccormack did not have standing to challenge or 
on august,prosecuting attorney hiedeman determined that he would not a criminal complaint against mccormack for allegedly violating because he felt that it was unlikely that his office would develop additional evidence.about two months later,the prosecuting attorney offered mccormack transactional immunity from prosecution for the alleged december abortion.mccormack declined to sign the agreement.
on february,mccormack attorney,hearn,moved to intervene on his own behalf and on the behalf of his patients.hearn is a licensed physician as well as an attorney in idaho,and has stated his intent to provide medical abortions by prescrib ing fda approved medications to women in bannock county,idaho such as mccormack who seek to medically terminate their pregnancies prior to fetal viability in violation of the restrictions contained in idaho code title,chapters and.medical abortions induced by pills are distinct from surgical or therapeutic abortions which usually take place in a medical clinic or a hospital.since,hearn has continuously registered with the federal drug enforcement agency and the idaho state board of pharmacy,which allows him to legally prescribe medication in bannock county.hearn has not provided medical abortions in the past,does not have a medical office in which to treat patients,and has practiced as a attorney since.
the district court granted hearn motion to intervene.hearn filed an amended that similarly challenged the constitutionality of certain provisions of idaho code title,chapters and.pursuant to,hearn sought to enjoin the prosecuting attorney from criminally prosecuting or threatening to prosecute any woman who seeks an abortion or any health provider for violating idaho code title,chapters and.hearn also sought a declaratory judgment striking down the relevant idaho statutes criminal sanctions as unconstitutional facially and as applied to women seeking an abortion in bannock county,idaho,or any health provider who provides assistance to such women.
on september,we affirmed the district court grant of a preliminary injunction that enjoined the prosecuting attorney from prosecuting mccormack under and,and expanded the injunction to include because mccormack faced a genuine threat of prosecution under th is subsection of the statute.mccormack hiedeman,cir mccormack i.we limited the preliminary injunction,however,to affect only mccormack as opposed to all women affected by,id.at,and further held that mccormack lacked standing to seek relief against the enforcement of pucpa on the basis of future pregnancies,id.at.
on october,before the district court mccormack and hearn jointly moved for partial summary judgment to declare three idaho statutes,in conjunction with or in conjunction with or and,in conjunction with or unconstitutional,and to permanently enjoin the prosecuting attorney from enforcing the statutes.
on march,the district court granted mccormack and hearn joint motion for partial summary judgment and denied prosecuting attorney herzog for partial summary judgment.on march,mccormack and hearn moved to dismiss all remaining claims against herzog and to enter a final judgment.the district court granted the motion and entered final judgment on may,declaring the challenged statutes unconstitutional,and enjoining herzog from prosecuting mccormack or hearn under the challenged statutes.
herzog timely appeals the district court final judgment.

mccormack challenge to is not moot.
herzog asserts that mccormack challenge to is moot because the prosecuting attorney granted mccormack transactional immunity for the alleged abortion.
a case might become moot if subsequent events make it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.the heavy burden of persuading the court that the challenged conduct can not reasonably be expected to start up again lies with the party asserting mootness.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.herzog,therefore,must demonstrate that his office will never again prosecute mccormack under,or that the court is no longer capable of affect ing the rights of litigants in the case before it.lewis cont l bank,citing north carolina rice.
herzog office offered mccormack transactional immunity from prosecution for her alleged abortion,which mccormack declined to accept the district court questioned the validity of the offer of transactional immunity because the timing of the offer suggests an attempt to moot mccormack claims and thereby avoid this litigation and its challenge to the constitutionality of sections and.the district court further determined that other factors also suggested a live controversy 
the specific relief mccormack seeks declaratory relief that,interpreted with and,is facially unconstitutional is still available.
mccormack continues to assert that the provisions are unconstitutional.
prosecuting attorney herzog continues to assert that the provisions are not unconstitutional.
moreover,the district court determined that t here is a significant public interest in settling the legality of these provisions,and the existence of this interest militates against a mootness conclusion.citing olagues russoniello,cir.
mccormack argues that her claims are not moot because they fall under three exceptions to the mootness doctrine a voluntary cessation,b collateral legal consequences,and c capable of repetition,yet evading review.
a mccormack is correct that this case falls within the voluntary cessation exception.herzog acknowledges that under the voluntary cessation exception,it is that a defendant claiming that its voluntary compliance moots a case bears the formidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.friends of the earth,at.yet herzog argues that the court should presume that the government is acting in good faith,that the bannock county prosecuting attorney office decision against criminal charges was made in the interests of justice,and that the office sparse history of bringing criminal charges under demonstrates a lack of biased calculus.a presumption of good faith,however,can not overcome a court wariness of applying mootness under protestations of repentance and reform,especially when abandonment seems timed to anticipate suit,and there is probability of resumption.united states grant,quoting united states oregon state medical society.
furthermore,while a statutory change is usually enough to render a case moot,an executive action that is not governed by any clear or codified procedures can not moot a claim.bell city of boise,cir quoting chem.prod.and distrib.ass helliker,cir.even assuming defendants have no intention to alter or abandon the offer of transactional immunity,the ease with which the prosecuting attorney could do so counsels against a finding of mootness.id.at.the discretionary decision to not criminal charges against mccormack is neither entrenched nor permanent.id.
in addition to the suspicious timing of the offer of transactional immunity,the district court noted that herzog has never repudiated the statute as unconstitutional,and he did not cease mccormack prosecution because he believed the prosecution was unlawful.instead,herzog office first determined that it had insufficient evidence to criminal charges against mccormack.then,herzog office offered mccormack transactional immunity from prosecution after our court affirmed the district court decision that the idaho statutes imposed an undue burden on a woman ability to terminate her pregnancy.the offer of immunity does not by itself make it absolutely clear that the prosecution of mccormack would never recur.friends of the earth,at see also olagues,at finding a continuing case or controversy where the government did not voluntarily cease the challenged activity because it felt that the investigation was improper,but,r ather,the government terminated the investigation solely because it failed to produce evidence supporting any further investigative activities.
b the collateral legal consequences exception also applies.a lthough the primary injury may have passed herzog has offered transactional immunity to mccormack there still exists a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.fed.exp,cir quoting in re burrell,cir.herzog continues to maintain the constitutionality of,and declaratory relief remains available and unaffected.
c finally,as the district court determined,mccormack would also be eligible for the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to the mootness doctrine.like any other woman challenging a potentially applicable abortion law,mccormack may become pregnant again,and her term of pregnancy is of limited duration.herzog counters that mccormack lacks standing to challenge on the basis of future pregnancies.yet herzog is conflating the mootness of mccormack claim with her standing to bring the claim.as elaborated below,mccormack may not have standing to challenge the provision on the basis of future pregnancies,but that does not moot her current action.see friends of the earth,at explaining that a resolution will not moot an action,despite the fact that the plaintiff would have lacked initial standing had she filed the complaint after the resolution.
thus,the district court correctly held that mccormack claim is not moot.
mccormack has standing based on a lingering risk of prosecution under.
prosecuting attorney herzog asserts that mccormack lacks standing to challenge on the basis of future pregnancies.
article iii standing requires that mccormack establish that she personally has suffered an actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical injury as a result of the allegedly illegal conduct a causal link between her injury and the challenged action and that the injury must likely be redressed by a favorable decision of a federal court.lujan defenders of wildlife,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.a plaintiff who challenges a statute must demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute operation or enforcement.babbitt united farm workers union,citing littleton.
in mccormack i,we held that mccormack does not have standing to challenge pucpa based on a possible future pregnancy because in mccormack case there are too many possibilities that may not take place and all may not combine.at quoting roe wade.and mccormack conceded that roe and other related cases have held that the possibility of future pregnancy may be too speculative and conjectural for standing.
nevertheless,mccormack continues to have standing based on the ongoing risk of prosecution for the termination of her past pregnancy.the district court properly noted that a t the outset of this litigation,mccormack had standing to challenge the constitutionality of section in conjunction with both section and section because she faced prosecution and continued to be threatened with prosecution.and mccormack presently has standing to challenge and because,as discussed in section above,the prosecuting attorney offer of immunity does not guarantee that the prosecution of mccormack would never recur.because mccormack currently has standing based on a lingering risk of prosecution under,her injury is not conjectural or hypothetical.
lastly,the risk of continued enforcement of against mccormack is still redressable by declaratory relief.accordingly,mccormack has standing to challenge the enforcement of against her for her past alleged abortion.
hearn has standing to challenge and.
the district court properly found that hearn,as an idaho licensed physician intending to provide medical abortions,has standing to challenge and.we review the district court standing decision de novo.gospel missions of america city of los angeles,cir.to determine whether a physician has standing to assert the rights of patients in the abortion context,the panel must determine whether the physician alleges injury in fact to himself or herself and whether the physician is a proper proponent of the legal rights on which he or she bases the suit.singleton wulff.
herzog concedes that we have held that a physician possesses standing on his own behalf and on that of his patients to challenge the validity of another idaho abortion statute.planned parenthood of idaho,wasden,cir p hysicians and clinics performing abortions are routinely recognized as having standing to bring broad facial challenges to abortion statutes.the supreme court has also repeatedly held that a physician may assert the rights of women patients as against governmental interference in the abortion context.singleton,at recognizing that there seems little loss in terms of effective advocacy from allowing an assertion of a woman right to an abortion by a physician see also planned parenthood of se.casey,allowing abortion providers to challenge a state statute on behalf of women who seek abortion services griswold connecticut,holding that physicians have standing to assert the constitutional rights of patients to whom they prescribed contraceptive devices.
prosecuting attorney herzog attempts to distinguish hearn from other physicians who have been recognized as having standing.herzog asserts that hearn can not challenge the validity of and because he has not established that he can provide abortions in a medically appropriate manner.herzog claims that hearn seeks to provide access to abortifacients,medication to induce abortions,under a regime that has negative health and potentially consequences and a finding of standing can not be squarely adverse to the interests of the patient.
first,hearn has stated his clear intention to prescribe fda approved medications to women in bannock county,idaho such as plaintiff mccormack who seek to medically terminate their pregnancies in violation of the restrictions contained in idaho code title,chapters and prior to fetal viability.furthermore,hearn intends to perform medical abortions outside a clinical or hospital setting through the second trimester.we have recognized that a physician statement of intent is sufficient to establish standing,when the physician is at risk of criminal prosecution under the relevant statutes.wasden,at by stat ing his clear intent to continue to perform abortions a physician has alleged a sufficiently concrete and imminent injury possible prosecution and imprisonment to challenge the provisions that ban abortion providers from providing medical abortions to women prior to fetal viability.further,hearn need not even claim a specific intent to violate the statute.id.at noting that a plaintiff need only reasonable fear a statute would be enforced against it if it engaged in certain conduct citation omitted.
second,hearn intent to provide medication to women to terminate their pregnancies prior to fetal viability does not need to be supported by a demonstration of the medical appropriateness of his ability to provide medical abortions.whether hearn can provide medical abortions in an appropriate clinical setting is irrelevant to whether he,as an idaho licensed physician,can effectively represent the constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before viability.the supreme court has looked to the professional relationship between a physician and a patient,griswold,at,the economic harm on abortion providers,singleton,at,and a physician direct stake in the abortion process,diamond charles,when determining standing.but an inquiry into the medical appropriateness of an abortion provider practice is not only unprecedented,but is also too ambiguous,and thus unwarranted.
since,hearn has continuously been registered with the federal drug enforcement agency and the idaho state board of pharmacy.and his ability to legally prescribe abortion medication in bannock county is sufficient to demonstrate an actual and imminent injury the risk of criminal prosecution for prescribing abortion pills prior to viability.
accordingly,the district court properly determined that hearn has standing to assert his patients rights in cases challenging abortion restrictions,and we will consider hearn claims.
c.the statutes pose an undue burden on a woman ability to obtain an abortion,and the criminal sanctions for abortion providers are unconstitutionally vague.
a woman has a fourteenth amendment right to terminate a pregnancy,and to obtain it without undue interference from the state.casey,at.however,this right is not absolute,and the state may express its interest in potential life by regulating abortions,so long as the regulations do not pose an undue burden on a woman ability to seek an abortion before the fetus attains viability.id.at.although the state may ensure that the woman choice is informed,and protect the health and safety of a woman seeking an abortion,the state may not prohibit a woman from making the ultimate decision to undergo an abortion.id.at.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.nunez city of san diego,cir.a facial challenge to an abortion statute will succeed where,in a large fraction of the cases in which the statute is relevant,it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman choice to undergo an abortion.wasden,at internal quotation marks,brackets,and citation omitted.and the large fraction is computed by focusing on those upon whom a challenged law would have some actual effect,rather than all women seeking an abortion.id.there is also a heightened need for definiteness when the ordinance imposes criminal penalties on individual behavior or implicates constitutionally protected rights.nunez,at.
section is facially unconstitutional because it categorically bans some abortions before viability.
section prohibits abortions of fetuses of twenty or more weeks postfertilization.the ban applies regardless of whether the fetus has attained viability.
the supreme court reaffirmed in casey that an undue burden exists if the purpose or effect of a provision of law places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus obtains viability.casey,at.in planned parenthood of cent.danforth,the court further explained that it is not the proper function of the legislature or the courts to place viability,which essentially is a medical concept,at a specific point in the gestation period.because places an arbitrary time limit on when women can obtain abortions,the statute is unconstitutional.we also recently held unconstitutional an arizona law banning abortions after the twenty week gestational age because the law operated as a ban on a woman constitutional right a to abortion.isaacson horne,cir.
prosecuting attorney herzog concedes that n o dispute exists that medical induction abortions can occur between the twentieth week of pregnancy and fetal viability.yet herzog attempts to reframe the issue as whether the statute imposes an undue burden on hearn proposed plan to provide medical abortions in the patient home after the twentieth week of pregnancy.although hearn proposed plan would be detrimentally affected by the enforcement of,the broader effect of the statute is a categorical ban on all abortions between twenty weeks gestational age and viability.this is directly contrary to the court central holding in casey that a woman has the right to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the state.casey,at emphasis added.
thus,the district court did not err in finding facially unconstitutional.
section is facially unconstitutional because it requires hospitalizations for all abortions.
section requires that all abortions occur in a hospital.if the licensed medical provider fails to abide by,he or she will be subject to civil and criminal penalties,as outlined in.
the supreme court has twice invalidated requirements that physicians perform all abortions in hospitals.see planned parenthood ass of kansas city,ashcroft,city of akron akron center for reproductive health,overturned on other grounds.s uch a requirement unreasonably infringes upon a woman constitutional right to obtain an abortion.planned parenthood ass of kansas city,at internal quotation marks omitted.
prosecuting attorney herzog attempts to distinguish the present case from this controlling supreme court precedent by arguing that both the absolute and percentage terms of second trimester abortions in idaho are quite small.between and,about percent of abortions in idaho were performed during or after the fourteenth week of pregnancy and only about percent of those abortions were.but herzog draws the court attention to irrelevant figures.the percentage of second trimester abortions is certainly small,but for a large fraction of the cases in which the statute is relevant,required hospitalization will operate as a substantial obstacle.casey,at.
herzog also asserts that hearn is not competent professionally to provide medical abortions outside of a hospital setting.however,we think that an inquiry into the medical appropriateness of hearn proposed prescriptions of abortion pills is not properly part of our analysis,especially given the vagueness of that phrase.
therefore,the district court did not err in finding facially unconstitutional.
