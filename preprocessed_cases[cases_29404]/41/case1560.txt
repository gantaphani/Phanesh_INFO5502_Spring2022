rinaldi is an orthodontist with offices in springfield and edwardsville,illinois.on january,the grand jury issued a subpoena to rinaldi,demanding the production of records related to rinaldi orthodontic practice by february.the subpoenaed records included,inter alia,patient sheets,daily schedules,calendar schedules of patients,and patient charts.following several informal conferences between the government and rinaldi,numerous documents demanded by the subpoena remained outstanding.specifically,the government required production of a original case files and claim forms for patients b the original explanation medical benefit forms for these patients c rinaldi appointment books for the years and d the sheets,daily and weekly appointment logs,and daily cancellation sheets for the years.the district court ordered rinaldi to appear personally on june,to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for failing to comply with the grand jury subpoena by producing the documents.on june,the district court ordered rinaldi to comply with the subpoena in full and produce the documents.pursuant to an agreement between rinaldi and the government,rinaldi was granted an extension until july,but rinaldi never produced the documents.on july,the district court held a contempt hearing regarding rinaldi failure to comply with the june order.
at that hearing,fbi special agent kirk staats testified that a consensual search of rinaldi springfield office was executed on june,and of his edwardsville office on july.agent staats testified that the july search was scheduled to begin at.at approximately,law enforcement officials observed rinaldi place a box in a dumpster outside of the mcdonald restaurant next to his office.agent staats testified that fbi agents recovered the box from the dumpster and found within the box several sheets covered by the subpoena.agent staats stated that rinaldi had previously denied the existence of these sheets.
the government also called judy keran to testify.she stated that she has worked for rinaldi at his springfield office since may,and addressed the accumulation and storage of sheets prior to january.keran testified that the sheets would initially be left at the springfield office reception desk.on a daily basis,keran would then transfer the sheets to a desk drawer.when a significant amount of sheets accumulated in that drawer,keran dated,banded,and placed the sheets in a closet in the springfield office.keran testified that the sheets remained in that closet from may until approximately march or april.keran also testified that appointment books from through the current year were located in the closet prior to january.
keran then testified that sometime after january,rinaldi removed all the sheets and appointment books that were stored in the closet.keran noted that she went into the closet on a daily basis and that the sheets and appointment books were removed from the closet definitely after the issuance of the subpoena on january.keran stated that she asked rinaldi about their removal,and that rinaldi told her that he had removed the sheets and appointment books.keran was then asked whether rinaldi had destroyed any records on any previous occasion.keran responded,a bsolutely not.rinaldi did not want us to destroy anything.he likes to keep everything down to the simplest items and that rinaldi saved records just in case they were needed in the future.
rinaldi then testified on his own behalf.he stated that he had not destroyed or removed any sheets since the service of the subpoena.rinaldi testified that he had placed the box in the dumpster because he deemed the material personal and not responsive to the subpoena.he then stated that contrary to keran testimony,all the sheets were systematically destroyed within one or two months after their creation.therefore,rinaldi concluded,he could not produce any responsive documents because the documents no longer existed.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the court made several factual findings and credibility determinations.specifically,the court noted that it gave absolutely no credence to rinaldi testimony and found that rinaldi ha d lied and h ad not been truthful with th e court.further,the court found that the records did exist because t he fact that rinaldi had been observed taking a box of records out of his office and putting them in or by the dumpster persuade d the court that rinaldi ha d these records in his possession but was not turning them over.further,the court noted that there had been no accounting for the boxes of records that judy keran put together and put in the springfield closet.the court then stated that there had been no evidence that rinaldi destroyed the evidence.therefore,the court concluded that it found that the documents were in still existence,that they were in rinaldi possession or control,and that rinaldi would not produce the records voluntarily.
the court then ordered the following 
i do believe rinaldi is ever going to furnish these records voluntarily,because rinaldi does think the government has a right to them.and i think he in wilful contempt of this court order requiring him to produce these records by july,and the court w ill sentence the defendant to the custody of the marshal for up to six months and to be released sooner upon his furnishing the records called for to the united states attorney office.
emphases added.the court also issued an order fining rinaldi per day starting and continuing until rinaldi complie d with the grand jury subpoena.the initial order stated that the district court found rinaldi in criminal contempt,but the district court amended the order to an order of civil contempt on july.
on august,the district court denied rinaldi motion for reconsideration.the district court reaffirmed its earlier order of civil contempt and recommitted rinaldi to to his compliance with the district court order to produce the responsive documents.the court stated that it did not want to keep rinaldi in jail one minute and that rinaldi would be released if he produced the documents or convinced the court that the documents no longer existed.
rinaldi appeal argued that he was found guilty of criminal contempt,not civil contempt,and was denied the appropriate criminal procedural safeguards.in the alternative,rinaldi argued that even if he was found in civil contempt,a there was insufficient evidence to support such a finding b the imprisonment and fine imposed have lost their coercive effect,and the contempt has therefore become criminal c he may not be both fined and imprisoned for civil contempt and d the fine was excessive and arbitrary under the eighth amendment.
ii.analysis 
civil or criminal contempt 
rinaldi first asserted that the district court found him in criminal contempt,and thus that he was denied the appropriate procedural safeguards afforded a criminal defendant.we first determined that the district court found rinaldi in civil contempt.we noted that we were not bound by the trial court designation of whether the sanction was civil or criminal see united states lippitt,cir.the test for determining whether a contempt order is civil or criminal is.a contempt order is considered civil if the sanctions imposed are designed primarily to coerce the contemnor into complying with the court demands,and criminal if its purpose is to punish the contemnor,vindicate the court authority,or deter future misconduct.see id.at.as most sanctions contain both coercive and punitive elements,we examine the character of the relief itself.see id.at.if the contemnor retains the ability to purge the contempt and obtain his release by committing an affirmative thereby carries the keys of his prison in his own
