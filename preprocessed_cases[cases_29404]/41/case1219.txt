anna marie bowling irrevocable trust dated june,the trust,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of,spectrum health continuing care group spectrum.the district court found that spectrum lien on the proceeds of a malpractice settlement was valid and enforceable,despite the fact that spectrum already had accepted medicaid payments for the care provided to anna marie bowling bowling.in its appeal,the trust argues that the lien violates medicaid prohibition,and therefore is invalid.in its,spectrum argues that the issue of the validity of the lien is precluded by two prior judgments approving the malpractice settlement.upon review,we conclude that the issue is not precluded by either of the judgments,and that the lien on the settlement is prohibited by federal and state medicaid law.therefore,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of spectrum and remand the case with instructions to the district court to enter judgment in favor of the trust.
background 
the material facts in this case are undisputed.on november,while undergoing surgery in a new york hospital,bowling suffered a severe anoxic brain injury due to the improper administration of anesthesia.as a result of her injury,bowling has little or no control of her limbs and is unable to speak.she requires hour assistance with all daily activities.bowling filed a suit against the anesthesiologist and the hospital in the state of new york through her trial attorney,joseph dubinsky dubinsky,with linda serving as guardian ad litem in the suit.
following the injury,bowling sought care in grand rapids,michigan,where her sister resides.spectrum is the parent company of a group of providers of rehabilitation and nursing services,including spectrum health continuing care center,formerly known as grand valley health center gvhc.spectrum agreed to admit bowling to gvhc on the condition that bowling representatives provide written acknowledgment of a lien on the proceeds of a settlement or verdict in the malpractice suit to cover her medical costs.on november,dubinksy sent a letter to spectrum counsel acknowledging a lien on the proceeds owed anna bowling her estate obtained either by settlement or verdict in the malpractice lawsuit.joint appendix at letter from dubinsky to william miller,bowling guardian ad litem in the malpractice suit,also signed the letter acknowledging the lien.
bowling was admitted to gvhc in december,where she remained until september.in april,she became eligible to receive benefits from michigan medicaid program.anticipating delay in realizing its lien on the medical malpractice lawsuit,spectrum applied for and accepted medicaid payments for bowling care.at compl.at.specifically,gvhc received from medicaid for services provided to bowling from may through september,along with monthly medicaid from bowling representatives of.the total customary cost of spectrum services provided to bowling during the time she resided at gvhc was,leaving a shortfall of approximately at spectrum chart of monthly charges.
on july,the parties in bowling suit reached a settlement agreement.that same day,the probate court of kent county,michigan,entered a protective order approving the settlement and establishing the trust for bowling benefit.on october,the supreme court of the state of new york approved the settlement in the malpractice suit which included p ayment of anna bowling outstanding healthcare liens.at.order at.specifically,the court allocated the amount to the various healthcare liens,including to gvhc.the amount reflected the shortfall between spectrum customary cost for its services and the amount paid already by medicaid.on february,pursuant to the settlement agreement,dubinsky sent spectrum a check for.spectrum refunded to the trust to reach the proper shortfall amount of.the settlement proceeds were also used to reimburse michigan medicaid agency approximately.
of the trust later objected to the payment of funds from the settlement proceeds to spectrum on the ground that federal and state law prohibit a service provider from receiving additional money for services which have already been paid for by medicaid.the parties agreed to place the disputed amount in an trust account pending resolution of the issue.on may,spectrum filed a declaratory judgment action against the trust in the circuit court of kent county,michigan,seeking to clarify its right to enforce the lien.pursuant to,the trust removed the action to the united states district court for the western district of michigan and filed a counterclaim alleging that federal medicaid law renders the lien invalid and unenforceable when the lien holder has already accepted medicaid payments for the services provided.the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on their respective declaratory judgment claims.
on february,the district court issued its opinion.first,the court held that the issue of the validity of the lien was not precluded by either of the decisions approving the malpractice settlement.under both michigan and new york law,the court found that the requirements for issue preclusion had not been met.second,the court held that under federal and state medicaid law,the lien was valid and enforceable.the district court held that the additional money was recovered not from the beneficiary,but rather from the tortfeasor,and therefore the recovery was not prohibited by the prohibition.moreover,the lien only attached to the portion of the award specifically allocated for medical expenses,and therefore did not interfere with bowling personal property.as a result,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of spectrum.both parties appeal from the district court ruling.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the district court summary judgment determinations under federal rule of civil procedure de novo.hoge honda of am,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.for for summary judgment,we must evaluate each motion on its own merits and view all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the party.beck city of cleveland,cir internal quotation omitted.we have noted,however,that t he filing of for summary judgment does not necessarily mean that an award of summary judgment is appropriate.id.
issue preclusion 
we first consider whether summary judgment in spectrum favor is proper on the ground that the doctrine of issue preclusion bars the trust declaratory judgment claim.because we conclude that spectrum has failed to meet the requirements for issue preclusion under both michigan and new york law,we affirm the district court ruling on this ground.
the full faith and credit act mandates that judicial proceedings shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the united states as they have by law or usage in the courts of such state from which they are taken.the united states supreme court has interpreted the act as requiring that a federal court must give to a judgment the same preclusive effect as would be given that judgment under the law of the state in which the judgment was rendered.migra warren city sch.dist.bd.of,d.in this case,spectrum argues that the michigan and new york judgments approving the malpractice settlement preclude the trust claim.accordingly,we must examine the laws of each of the respective states to resolve spectrum argument.
issue preclusion under michigan law 
under michigan law,issue preclusion,known as collateral estoppel,precludes relitigation of an issue in a subsequent,different cause of action between the same parties where the prior proceeding culminated in a valid,final judgment and the issue was actually litigated,and necessarily determined.people gates,cert.denied,d.t he party asserting preclusion bears the burden of proof.united states dominguez,cir,cert.denied,d.therefore,to prove preclusion,spectrum must demonstrate that 
the parties in both proceedings are the same or in privity,
there was a valid,final judgment in the first proceeding,
the same issue was actually litigated in the first proceeding,
that issue was necessary to the judgment,and 
the party against whom preclusion is asserted or its privy had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue.
id.citing gates,at.in this case,the district court found that preclusion was inappropriate because spectrum failed to meet several of the preclusion requirements.upon review,we conclude that spectrum has not satisfied any of the last three requirements,and therefore,is not entitled to preclusion under michigan law on this issue.
first,michigan courts have held that a question has not been actually litigated until put into issue by the pleadings,submitted to the trier of fact for a determination,and thereafter determined.vandeventer.bank.the courts have held that an issue which was uncontested or indirectly referenced in the prior judgment was not actually litigated for collateral estoppel purposes.see,lichon am.universal ins,holding that an underlying issue was not actually litigated in a prior criminal trial where the party entered plea of nolo contendere cogan cogan,holding that issue of paternity was not actually litigated in the original divorce proceeding which awarded child support.
applying those principles to this case,we conclude that spectrum has failed to demonstrate that the validity of its lien was actually litigated in the michigan proceeding.bowling was simply seeking a protective order to certify that the settlement was in her best interest and to establish the trust.while approval of the whole settlement necessarily encompasses spectrum lien,there is no evidence in the record that the lien was ever specifically challenged or medicaid prohibition ever raised.spectrum lien was never mentioned specifically in the order.the court only referenced the lien as part of the collective amount owed,noting that the settlement provides for payment of all liens associated with bowling medical care and that the settlement proceeds should be paid to the trust after satisfaction of the existing liens.at.prob.order at.therefore,because the specific issue was never put forth and determined by the trier of fact,we conclude that it was not actually litigated in the michigan proceeding.
furthermore,as the district court noted,the validity of spectrum lien was unnecessary to the determination that the malpractice settlement was in bowling best interest or to the establishment of the trust.the probate court evaluated the settlement pursuant to michigan court rule,which requires prior court approval for settlements involving legally incapacitated individuals.the comment to the rule lists factors that a court should consider in reaching its decision,but does not include the validity of any liens on the settlement.see.cmt.to am.moreover,in reaching its decision,the michigan court assumed that the spectrum lien was enforceable,yet still found the settlement to be in bowling best interest.if the lien was unenforceable and spectrum was limited to the medicaid payments,it stands to reason that the benefits of the settlement agreement to bowling would not be diminished because the trust would,at the least,receive the amounts specifically allocated to it.therefore,we conclude that the enforcement of spectrum lien was not necessary to the judgment in the michigan proceeding.
finally,we conclude that the trust did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the michigan court.the issue of the enforcement of the lien was never raised before the probate court and was unrelated to the court determination.moreover,spectrum was not a party to the action nor in privity with a party to the action in the michigan court therefore,the trust never had a full and fair opportunity to challenge the enforcement of the lien in the michigan proceeding.
because spectrum has failed to satisfy several of the collateral estoppel requirements under michigan law,we conclude that the issue of the validity of the lien is not precluded by the michigan court judgment.
issue preclusion under new york law 
under new york law,t he doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes a party from relitigating an issue which has previously been decided against him in a proceeding in which he had a fair opportunity to fully litigate the point.kaufman eli lilly,internal quotation omitted.two requirements must be satisfied before the doctrine is invoked f irst,the identical issue necessarily must have been decided in the prior action and be decisive of the present action,and second,the party to be precluded from relitigating the issue must have had a full and fair opportunity to contest the prior determination.id.new york courts have noted,however,that collateral estoppel is an equitable doctrine,grounded on concepts of fairness and should not be rigidly or mechanically applied.cent.mut.fire ins.in the end,the fundamental inquiry is whether relitigation should be permitted in a particular case in light of what are often competing policy considerations,including fairness to the parties,conservation of the resources of the court and the litigants,and the societal interests in consistent and accurate results.staatsburg water staatsburg fire.applying these principles,we conclude that under new york law collateral estoppel is inappropriate in this case.
first,spectrum can not demonstrate that the issue of approval of the settlement agreement in the new york proceeding is identical to the enforceability issue to be adjudicated in this case.new york courts have held that i f the issue has not been litigated,there is no identity of issues between the present action and the prior determination.kaufman,at.thus,to be given preclusive effect,the issue must have been actually litigated,squarely addressed and specifically decided.ross med.liab.mut.an issue is not actually litigated if,for example,there has been a default,a confession of liability,a failure to place a matter in issue by proper pleading or even because of a stipulation.kaufman,at emphasis added.thus,where an issue is uncontested,such as an underlying point in a settlement agreement,the issue was not actually litigated in the prior proceeding and therefore is not precluded from a subsequent one.see also arizona california,d noting that consent agreements ordinarily are intended to preclude any further litigation on the claim presented but are not intended to preclude further litigation on any of the issues presented internal quotation omitted.
in this case,the matter before the new york state court was judicial approval of the settlement in the suit.see requiring prior judicial approval for settlements involving legally incapacitated individuals.the issue to be resolved was the fairness of the overall settlement to bowling,not the validity of any of the underlying liens.the new york court order approved the settlement agreement including the payment to spectrum.see at.order at.specifically,the court resolved the issue of whether a payment of out of the total settlement proceeds of million was in bowling best interest.because spectrum lien was never contested or questioned in that proceeding,the parties effectively stipulated to its validity for purposes of approving the settlement agreement.as a result,the issue was never actually litigated,squarely addressed and specifically decided in the new york proceeding.ross,at.
furthermore,the trust lacked a full and fair opportunity to litigate the point.new york courts have held that a party did not have a full and fair opportunity where the point was not the focus of the prior proceeding,but only indirectly related to the material issues.liddle,robinson shoemaker shoemaker.as we stated above,the focus of the new york proceeding was the fairness of the million settlement,not the validity of the individual liens.moreover,spectrum was neither a party nor in privity with a party to the proceeding.therefore,we conclude the trust did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue.
because the issue of the validity of the spectrum lien was not identical to the approval of the settlement and the trust did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the point,we conclude that under new york law,collateral estoppel is inappropriate in this case.
prohibition 
having determined that neither of the two judgments preclude this action,we turn to the merits of the trust claim.in its motion for summary judgment,the trust argues that spectrum lien on the settlement proceeds violates medicaid prohibition,and therefore is invalid.because we conclude that by accepting medicaid payments spectrum waived its right to its customary fee for services provided to bowling,we reverse the district court ruling on this ground.
in,congress established medicaid through title xix of the social security act,to provide medical care to families and individuals.barney holzer clinic,cir.the medicaid program is based on a scheme of cooperative federalism,king smith,d,in which a state elects to adopt a plan providing medical care to its citizens in return for the federal government subsidizing the bulk of the plan financial obligations.barney,at.a state is not required to participate in the program,but once it chooses to do so,the state plan must comply with federal statutory and regulatory standards.med.soc y snider,cir b.the state of michigan elected to participate in the medicaid program and therefore must comply with all aspects of federal law.see.comp.laws ann.
one of the federal statutory requirements is that a state plan must establish payment rates for the various services provided under the plan.a.the payment rates must be consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care and sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan.id.a provider is not required to participate in the medicaid program,but rather voluntarily contracts with the state to provide services to patients in return for reimbursement from the state at the specified rates.barney,at linton by arnold comm r of health env t,cir,cert.denied,d.though the medicaid rates are typically lower than a service provider customary fees,medical service providers must accept the medicaid payment as,and may not require that patients pay anything beyond that amount.barney,at.moreover,even when a third party is subsequently found liable for the medicaid beneficiary medical expenses,the service provider may not seek to collect from the individual or any financially responsible relative or representative of that individual payment of an amount for that service.a c.the accompanying federal regulations mandate that a state must limit participation in the medicaid program to providers who accept,as payment in full,the amounts paid by the agency plus any deductible,coinsurance or copayment required by the plan to be paid by the individual.consistent with this federal regulation,service providers in the michigan medicaid program must accept payment from the state as payment in full by the medically indigent individual for services received.comp.laws ann.b.moreover,a provider shall not seek payment from the medically indigent individual,the family,or representative of the individual for a uthorized services provided and reimbursed under the program.id.the restriction on a service provider prohibiting it from recovering the balance between its customary fee and the medicaid payment is commonly referred to as the prohibition against balance billing.palumbo myers,d.
in this case,spectrum is seeking enforcement of its lien on the settlement proceeds to recover,which it claims is the shortfall between its customary fee and the amount it already received from medicaid.the trust argues that the lien is balance billing and therefore,prohibited under the law.upon review,we agree.
all the courts which have considered the issue of whether a service provider,who has already accepted a medicaid payment,may recover additional sums after a patient has received damages in a personal injury lawsuit have denied the provider claim.see michael beard,the impact of changes in health care provider reimbursement systems on the recovery of damages for medical expenses in personal injury suits,am.trial advoc.in evanston hospital hauck,cir,cert.denied,d,a hospital provided a patient medical care in exchange for medicaid reimbursement at the state prescribed rates.after the patient was awarded a sizable judgment against a tortfeasor,the hospital sought to return the medicaid amount and sue the patient for its customary fee.id.at.in upholding the dismissal of the hospital suit,the seventh circuit stated 
but evanston hospital was not forced to abandon its right to sue hauck no one coerced the hospital into cashing a medicaid check from the taxpayers as partial reimbursement for hauck medical bills.rather,the hospital could have simply forsaken medicaid and taken its chances that hauck would somehow come up with the money to pay the bills himself.by opting for reimbursement from medicaid,evanston hospital bought certainty.it purchased a guarantee of partial payment in lieu of possibly full payment or possibly no payment at all evanston hospital wants out of its agreement with medicaid now only because its gamble,in retrospect,was unwise.
id.the court explained that to permit recovery would be to transform medicaid into an insurance program for hospitals rather than for indigent patients,because the hospital wants to be reimbursed when the patient is indigent and still retain the right to sue patients who later become classic example of wanting to both have and eat cake.id.at see also mallo pub.health trust,d,holding that the provision forces providers to make a calculated choice because once the provider has chosen medicaid,it is barred from billing the patient an amount in excess of the state medicaid disbursement.
similarly,in palumbo myers,a physician sued a patient to recover the difference between his customary fee and the medicaid payment after the patient received a sizable settlement from a tortfeasor,which included an allocation for the full payment of the fee.d at.the california appellate court held that though the liability provisions of the medicaid statute provide for the government recovery of its medicaid expenditures,the prohibition against balance billing bars the physician claim.id.at.see also lizer eagle air med,d,holding that a provider,who has already accepted medicaid,is prohibited from enforcing a lien against a tortfeasor to recover its customary fee olszewski scripps health,cal th,d,invalidating a state statute which authorized a provider to recover its customary fee through a lien against a judgment or settlement obtained by a medicaid beneficiary against a tortfeasor pub.health trust dade county sch,so d,holding that a state regulation which permits a provider to recover its customary fee after receiving a medicaid payment is invalid under supremacy clause.
applying these principles to this case,we conclude that the enforcement of spectrum lien on the proceeds of the malpractice settlement to recover the balance of its customary fee is prohibited by federal and state law.spectrum provided bowling with medical care from may through september,in exchange for which it received from medicaid.spectrum was not required to seek payment from medicaid instead,spectrum could have provided its services in exchange for enforcing its lien,which was the original agreement between the parties.having chosen to accept payment from medicaid however,spectrum abandoned all rights to further recovery of its customary fee from the lien.as we have stated,medicaid is a contract between a service provider and the government,in which the medicaid recipient is a beneficiary.linton,at.by accepting the medicaid payment,the service provider accepts the terms of the that the medicaid amount is payment in full.a c.comp.laws ann.b.if this arrangement is not acceptable to service providers,they should not take medicaid money in the first instance.evanston,at.
in its complaint,spectrum states that it filed for medicaid reimbursement because it was a nticipating delay in realizing its lien on the medical malpractice lawsuit.at compl.at.nothing in the statute,however,allows for the program to be used as a financing entity,providing loans to service providers until the beneficiary payment arrives.congress certainly never intended such a result.moreover,spectrum also used medicaid as an insurance policy against an adverse outcome of the malpractice litigation.as dubinsky noted in his letter acknowledging the lien,in the world of litigation,no result can be guaranteed.at letter from dubinsky to wayne miller at.rather than risk the possibility of no recovery,spectrum relied on the taxpayers to insure against a total loss.similar to the seventh circuit,we reject the invitation to transform the medicaid program into an insurance program for hospitals rather than for indigent patients.evanston,at.
spectrum attempts to distinguish its case from the other cases cited above by arguing that its lien the malpractice settlement and that the lien was voluntarily agreed to by bowling representatives.appellee br.at.relying on contract principles,spectrum concludes that it should be entitled to the benefit of its bargain.the district court agreed with this reasoning,explaining that we have blessed such agreements between providers and patients.at dist.op.at.the district court reasoning however,omits the critical fact that there was a agreement between spectrum and the state of michigan as well.if spectrum had not received medicaid payments,the lien would be enforceable against the trust as a voluntary agreement entered into by willing parties,even though the patient was.barney,at.once it accepted the medicaid payment,however,spectrum had been paid in full for the services provided to bowling.the mere fact that a prior voluntary agreement existed is without consequence 
the district court attempted to distinguish this case by arguing that spectrum was not seeking to recover from bowling or the trust,but rather from the tortfeasor alone.the dissent also relies on this distinction,noting that federal law only prohibits a service provider from seeking to collect from the individual or any financially responsible relative or representative of that individual payment of an amount for that service.a c.similarly,michigan law states that a provider shall not seek payment from the medically indigent individual,the family,or representative of the individual.comp.laws ann.b.citing the california supreme court decision in olszewski scripps health,the dissent reasons that because the settlement allocated a portion of the proceeds for payment of the lien,enforcement is not prohibited by the prohibition.in further support of this reasoning,spectrum cites the eighth circuit recent decision in ahlborn.dep t of human,cir,for the proposition that a portion of a settlement award may be recoverable if specifically allocated for medical expenses.upon review,we conclude this argument is unpersuasive as well.
first,while the dissent is correct that the federal and state statutes only mention attempts to recover from the individual or his or her representative,spectrum lien on the settlement proceeds is seeking recovery from bowling for her medical care,and therefore falls within this prohibition.despite the line item allocation to spectrum in the settlement agreement,spectrum was not a party to the medical malpractice suit and the settlement allocation is not its property.similarly,once the settlement has been approved,the settlement proceeds are no longer the property of the tortfeasor either.instead,the entirety of the settlement,regardless of how it is allocated,belongs to bowling spectrum lien is merely an encumbrance upon that property see black law dictionary ed defining a lien as a legal right or interest that a creditor has in another property,lasting usu ally until a debt or duty that it secures is satisfied see also in re approximately forty acres in tallmadge township,a lien is a security interest for money owed by one party to another,and is separate from an underlying cause of action.internal citation omitted aetna cas.sur.starkey,a lien is not a property right in,or right to,the thing itself,but constitutes a charge or security thereon.therefore,by seeking to enforce its lien,spectrum is attempting to recover its customary fee from the medicaid patient herself in clear violation of both federal and state law.
furthermore,the federal and state statutes outlining medicaid prohibition can not be read in isolation.the federal regulation accompanying the statute explicitly limits participation in the medicaid program to providers who accept,as payment in full,the amounts paid by the agency.emphasis added.similarly,the michigan statute states that a provider shall accept payment from the state as payment in full by the medically indigent individual for services received.comp.laws ann.b emphasis added.the clear import of these words is that the medicaid payment is the total amount owed to the provider for the services rendered,and thus the provider may not attempt to recover any additional amounts elsewhere.rehab.ass of,kozlowski,cir,cert.denied,d see also lizer,d at this language prevents providers from billing any entity for the difference between their customary charge and the amount paid by medicaid.there is nothing in the statutes or regulations which suggests that a service provider may recover additional payment for those services.
the dissent concedes the reasonableness of this interpretation,but nevertheless reads into the law ambiguity where there is none in order to justify an alternative interpretation.in support of its argument,the dissent,like the district court below,relies heavily on a opinion letter from the acting director of the medicaid bureau of the health care financing administration hcfa,which the california supreme court discussed in olszewski 
in the letter,the acting director stated that f ederal law would not preclude the practice of providers pursuing payment in tort situations in excess of medicaid reimbursement as long as a state satisfies two conditions.first,the state must assure that medicaid is made whole before the provider recovers any money.second,the state must protect the assets of medicaid beneficiaries by limiting provider recovery to the portion of the award specifically allocated for the beneficiary medical expenses.
d,at.the dissent argues that there is no reason to suppose that the medicaid bureau clarification does not still represent agency policy,entitled to respectful consideration by the courts.dissent at.therefore,the dissent concludes that because the two conditions are met,the lien does not violate federal law.but see palumbo,d at.holding that a service provider was prohibited from collecting from a tortfeasor even after medicaid had been reimbursed and the settlement allocated funds for the full customary amount of medical expenses.we believe that such heavy reliance on this opinion letter in the face of clear statutory and regulatory language is misplaced.
first,the letter,dated june,is not included in the record.it is neither listed on the website for the centers for medicare medicaid services,the successor to hcfa,nor published elsewhere.see http listing agency letters written to state officials from.indeed,the lack of public availability alone raises doubts about whether this old opinion letter is still the policy of the federal government.
moreover,the agency letter is not entitled to judicial deference.the letter does not appear to be a product of the agency authority,and therefore was likely not subject to the rigors of the public process.see united states mead,d holding that agency action resulting from or formal adjudications is entitled to judicial deference.likewise,nothing in the medicaid statutory scheme reveals that congress intended that courts defer to the agency opinion letters.id.at.noting that the absence of administrative formality does not necessarily bar judicial deference if congress intended informal interpretations to have the force of law.instead,as the supreme court has held,i nterpretations such as those in opinion interpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines,all of which lack the force of not warrant deference.christensen harris county,d see also.dep t of health family servs.blumer,d holding that the hcfa interpretation of a federal statute outlined in a regional letter to state directors as well as a proposed rule only warrants respectful consideration.the sole exception to this rule is where an agency is seeking to interpret its own regulation,and the language of that regulation is ambiguous.christensen,at.citing auer robbins,d beck,at.in this case,however,there is nothing ambiguous about the language of the federal regulation,which limits participation in the medicaid program to providers who accept,as payment in full,the amounts paid by the state medicaid agency.moreover,the opinion letter does not serve to clarify anything about the language of that regulation,but instead authorizes reimbursement of a provider customary fee from tortfeasors.thus,t o defer to the agency position would be to permit the agency,under the guise of interpreting a regulation,to create de facto a new regulation.christensen,at.
finally,the letter is inconsistent with the statutory scheme congress enacted.to the extent that a third party is liable for the medical expenses of a medicaid beneficiary,federal law requires that the beneficiary assign his or her right to payment from the third party for medical expenses to the state medicaid agency.a h,a a see also ahlborn,at noting that the statutory scheme requires the state to be reimbursed for its medicaid payments from third parties who are liable to the medicaid beneficiary.thus,congress clearly envisioned a scenario in which a third party would be liable to a medicaid beneficiary for medical services,but specifically authorized recovery only to the state agency.the absence of a statutory provision providing for recovery for service providers of their customary fee coupled with the language limiting service providers to medicaid payments as payment in full,reinforces our conclusion that the approach in the opinion letter should not be adopted.see united states,d w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.internal citation omitted alteration in original.
in sum,because we hold that the language of the federal regulation and michigan law clearly limit service providers to the amount paid by the medicaid agency as payment in full,we decline to follow the letter suggested approach see christensen,at.declining to adopt an agency interpretation of an unambiguous regulation.moreover,given the extremely detailed nature of the medicaid scheme and the frequency with which it is amended,reliance on an opinion letter paraphrased by the supreme court of california is unwarranted.if service providers should be permitted to recover their customary fees from a beneficiary settlement with a tortfeasor,it is solely within the province of congress to allow it.for now,we will adhere to the clear language of the statute and the accompanying regulation.therefore,the trust is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
iii.conclusion 
in summary,we conclude that the issue of the validity of the lien is not precluded by either of the judgments,and the lien on the settlement proceeds is prohibited by federal and state medicaid law.therefore,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of spectrum and remand the case with instructions to the district court to enter judgment in favor of the trust.
concurring in part,dissenting in part 
i agree with my colleagues on the panel,and with the district court,that the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not bar bowling trust from challenging spectrum right to retain the funds earmarked for spectrum in the settlement of the tort action.i respectfully disagree with the majority conclusion that the tortfeasor promise to compensate spectrum for its services must be nullified and replaced by a obligation to compensate bowling trust for spectrum services.
if the funds received by spectrum pursuant to the settlement had come out of bowling would have been the case if spectrum had enforced its lien against settlement proceeds payable to is clear that spectrum would not have been entitled to keep the money.this is so because the relevant federal statute,a c,requires every state medical plan to provide that 
in the case of an individual who is entitled to medical assistance under the state plan with respect to a service for which a third party is liable for payment,the person furnishing the service may not seek to collect from the individual or any financially responsible relative or representative of the individual payment of an amount for that service emphasis supplied.
the required prohibition is commonly termed a ban on balance billing,a ban on the practice of billing patients for the balance remaining on a medical bill after deducting the amount paid by the state medicaid program.olszewski scrippshealth,d,aff in part and rev in part,cal th,d,emphasis supplied 
the structure of the federal statute suggests that the olszewski courts understanding of the scope of the required ban on balance billing is correct.after explicitly referring to the situation where a third party is liable for payment,the statute conspicuously refrains from saying that the entity furnishing the service may not seek to collect from the third party.instead,the statute simply says that the entity furnishing the service may not seek to collect from the individual,from the patient.
michigan law appears to be in accord.in compliance with the federal mandate for a ban,michigan has enacted.comp.laws b.this statute obligates a provider of medical services to meet the following requirement 
except for copayment authorized by the state department a provider shall accept payment from the state as payment in full by the medically indigent individual for services rendered.a provider shall not seek payment from the medically indigent individual,the family,or representative of the individual for a uthorized services provided and reimbursed under the program.emphasis supplied.
if the first sentence of b stood alone,it could be read in either of two ways.standing alone,the sentence might mean that the state settling of an indigent individual medical bill for as here something like cents on the dollar would not only extinguish any liability on the part of the individual,it would also extinguish any liability.or the sentence might mean that acceptance of payment from the state would constitute payment in full as far as the individual is interpretation that would leave open the possibility of the service provider seeking payment of the balance from an unrelated third party.
it seems to me that the second sentence of b illuminates the meaning of the first sentence.what the second sentence says,to repeat,is that a provider shall not seek payment from the medically indigent individual or his family or representative for services provided and reimbursed under the program.emphasis supplied.like its counterpart in the federal statute,this sentence is silent as to collection efforts against an unrelated third party.reading the two sentences together,as i think one must,i conclude that the first sentence in michigan ban was intended to provide that payment by the state must be accepted as payment in full as far as the medically indigent individual is concerned.
but what of the regulations do the federal medicaid regulations broaden the requirement for a ban on balance billing to require the state not only to insure that the entity providing the service not seek to collect from the individual,but to require that the provider not seek to collect from anyone else either even though the service is one for which,in the words of the statute,a third party is liable for payment 
the bare language of the pertinent regulation,unquestionably admits of this possibility.departing from the structure of the statute,the regulation couches the requirement in these terms 
a state plan must provide that the medicaid agency must limit participation in the medicaid program to providers who accept,as payment in full,the amounts paid by the agency plus any deductible,coinsurance or copayment required by the plan to be paid by the individual.
it would not be unreasonable for a state medicaid director to suppose that this language was intended to require that state plans unconditionally prohibit participating service providers from pursuing tortfeasors for payment.see rehabilitation services of virginia kozlowski,cir but in guidance provided to state medicaid directors by the health care financing administration medicaid bureau on june,the medicaid bureau explained that the agency had no such intent.as long as states assure preservation of certain principles,the medicaid bureau told the states,federal law would not preclude the practice of providers pursuing payment in tort situations in excess of medicaid reimbursement emphasis supplied.see olszewski,d at,where the text of the medicaid bureau policy clarification is quoted in extenso.
the medicaid bureau policy clarification goes on to spell out in detail the conditions under which payment in excess of medicaid reimbursement can be pursued from tortfeasors 
specifically,the state must assure that medicaid is made whole before providers can keep any monies.the state must also prohibit providers from pursuing money that has been awarded to the patient.in other words,the provider lien must be against the tortfeasor and not the general assets of the patient,the provider would be entitled to reimbursement from a tort judgment or settlement when the settlement specifically designates a set amount of money for medical expenses and then only if this amount is above the amount owed to medicaid.the provider could be reimbursed only if the money has not been allotted to the beneficiary in a court judgment or settlement.this would mean that if the lien were not perfected,the tortfeasor would stand to retain the money.id.emphasis supplied.
i am aware of no reason to suppose that the medicaid bureau clarification does not still represent agency policy,entitled to respectful consideration by the courts.indeed,in the california supreme court olszewski decision handed down more than a year after the parties to bowling malpractice action reached their settlement agreement and nearly four months after spectrum attorney received the allotted to spectrum in the california court relied heavily on the policy clarification in holding that certain sections of california welfare and institutions code were in conflict with federal law.in a passage worth quoting in full,the court declared that the policy clarification is entitled to considerable deference

under the factual circumstances presented in the case at bar,it does not appear to me that federal policy,as reflected in the pertinent statutory and regulatory law,precludes spectrum from being fully compensated by the third party whose alleged malpractice gave rise to bowling need for the care spectrum provided.among the relevant circumstances are these 
it is undisputed that michigan medicaid program was made whole by the tortfeasor payment of to the state of michigan in satisfaction of michigan medicaid healthcare lien 
spectrum received nothing out of the funds awarded to bowling and 
both the settlement and the judgment approving it specifically designate d a set amount of money for medical expenses,to use the medicaid bureau language,and the money has not been allocated to the beneficiary in a court judgment or settlement.
i believe it is evident,in short,that spectrum has not recovered anything from the patient.in this respect there is a crucial difference between the present case and the many cases in which courts including ours have either said generally that healthcare providers may not require patients to pay anything beyond what medicaid has paid or have held specifically that damages recovered by a medicaid patient in a tort suit may not be reached by a service provider that accepted payment from medicaid.see,barney holzer clinic,cir evanston hospital hauck,cir,cert.denied,d mallo public health trust,d,lizer eagle air med,d,
it is true that if the tort case had been settled on terms that called for a payment of money only to bowling or her representatives,a lien asserted by spectrum on the proceeds of such a settlement would have been a lien on bowling property.as such,the lien would have been unenforceable.but because the the court order approving a line item allocation to spectrum for the value of the services provided,it was not bowling money that spectrum received when the tortfeasor honored his contract a contract of which i presume spectrum was a beneficiary by paying spectrum bill.
we have no reason to suppose that the allocation of money to spectrum reduced bowling recovery pro tanto,and we have good reason to suppose it did not.under the law of new york the state where the injury occurred and where the alleged tortfeasor was sued,it is clear that bowling never had a claim against the tortfeasor for the fair value of spectrum services.new york does not follow the traditional,applying new york statutory law,new york highest court has held that a tort claimant may not recover as special damages the value of medical and nursing care furnished gratuitously.coyne campbell.thus it was held in a recent new york intermediate appellate court case that where a hospital wrote off a balance that remained on a hospital bill after the hospital received partial payment from medicaid and a insurer,the plaintiff in a wrongful death action could not recover the as an element of her damages.kastick of western michigan.
the ramifications for the present case are obvious.the new york trial attorneys who negotiated the settlement of bowling tort suit may not have been familiar with the federal medicaid law,but they must have been well aware of new york version of the collateral source rule.new york personal injury lawyers and new york defense counsel deal with this rule all the time.i believe that these new york lawyers knew perfectly well,when they negotiated their dollar settlement,that spectrum bill for services could not be an element of bowling damages under new york law.and they would probably be puzzled,as i am,about the source of this court authority to rewrite their settlement agreement so that instead of compensating spectrum for the services it provided,the defendant in the malpractice action will be paying the plaintiff several hundred thousand dollars to which new york law gives her absolutely no claim.
it seems clear to me,under the facts presented here,that spectrum collection of its bill from the tortfeasor can not properly be viewed as a collection from the patient herself.my colleagues on the panel having seen the matter differently,i respectfully dissent on this issue.
it is unclear from the record how bowling factor into the shortfall.spectrum states that its total customary cost was,of which medicaid paid,leaving a shortfall of.that value does not take into account bowling medicaid of,which would reduce the shortfall to.in addition,the trust states,without citation to anywhere in the record,that bowling private insurance paid spectrum an additional,which should further reduce the shortfall.appellant br.at.
the district court also found that spectrum could not satisfy the first requirement for collateral estoppel which requires mutuality.spectrum argues that under more recent michigan caselaw,mutuality is not required.we need not decide the i
