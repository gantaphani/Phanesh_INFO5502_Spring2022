background 
we review the entry of summary judgment de novo,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment,in this case whitman.gte wireless,cellexis int l,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
on july,while working as a cook on miles ship,the timberland,whitman had to be driven to a hospital after falling several times on the ship,burning herself while cooking,and experiencing other symptoms including fatigue,cold,numbness,and incontinence.following an mri,whitman was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis ms,an autoimmune disease that causes a person immune system to attack healthy tissue in the body.whitman has what is known as ms,which is characterized by symptoms that manifest themselves in sporadic,unpredictable exacerbations that flare up and then die down.sometimes the symptoms completely clear other times they do not.while not fatal,ms is a permanent disease with no known cure 
on august,whitman saw judd jensen for a visit.jensen noted significant improvement in whitman status since her hospital visit on july.jensen also reiterated that the mri findings were strongly suggestive of on august,whitman saw howard weiner for an evaluation.weiner,an ms specialist,described whitman initial symptoms and mri as classic for after a neurologic examination,weiner found that whitman had a normal gait and there were no other motor,cerebellar,or sensory findings.he also found that whitman was continent and only had some mild tingling feelings.
shortly after weiner august evaluation,whitman began taking betaseron,a medication that acts at the cellular level to alter the immune system response to on october,whitman saw jensen and complained of numbness and loss of balance.on november,whitman again visited jensen,who noted that the recent exacerbation had resolved in a couple of days,that her neurologic examination was essentially normal,and that she was asymptomatic.
since july,whitman has had several exacerbations,with symptoms including vision problems,memory loss,dizziness,lightheadedness,nausea,vomiting,numbness,leg spasms,partial paralysis to one side of her face,and foot drop.some,but not all,of these symptoms have faded or disappeared.whitman last exacerbation occurred in november.whitman also suffers from depression,for which she takes medication.depression is common among patients with 
through his insurer,miles paid whitman medical bills for her initial diagnosis and treatment.miles did not pay for any living expenses or treatment after the diagnosis.in august,whitman spoke by phone with patrick of acadia insurance company,which is miles insurer,and requested maintenance and cure benefits.in a letter dated august,acadia denied whitman benefits beyond the emergency treatment and initial diagnosis.on march,whitman filed suit in maine federal district court,seeking past and ongoing maintenance and cure count i,as well as attorney fees for unreasonable refusal to pay maintenance and cure count ii.on august,miles moved for summary judgment.

ii.discussion 
maintenance and cure 
maintenance and cure is the traditional form of compensation paid to a seaman who becomes ill or injured aboard a vessel.richards relentless,cir citing calmar taylor.the duty of paying maintenance and cure falls to the owner of the vessel.id.the term refers to the provision of,or payment for,food and lodging maintenance as well as any necessary expenses cure incurred during the period of recovery from an injury or malady.ferrara fishing,cir quoting leblanc,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the right to maintenance and cure applies only to seamen who are injured or fall ill while in service of the ship.leblanc,at.the right applies until the seaman is so far cured as possible.farrell united states.ferrara,at.
when a seaman condition has stabilized and further progress ended short of a full recovery,the seaman is no longer entitled to maintenance and cure.in re rjf int l for exoneration from or limitation of,cir.this point in time is known as the seaman maximum medical recovery.id.at citing vaughan atkinson,d.however,treatment that is more than simply palliative,and would improve the seaman medical condition is enough to support an award of maintenance and cure in aid of permanent improvement short of a complete cure.id.
whether ms can be improved through treatment 
whitman first argues that the district court erred in finding that ms is incapable of being improved through treatment.whitman bases this argument on the fact that she is being treated with betaseron,a drug that acts at the cellular level to alter the immune system response to whitman states that the goals of her treatment include slowing,stabilizing,arresting,or reversing her ms symptoms.relying on our decision in in re rjf,whitman argues that this treatment is not palliative and will improve her medical condition.
whitman reliance on in re rjf is misplaced.in that case,a seaman suffered severe,permanent brain damage with symptoms including muscle spasticity and contractions.id.at.the seaman physicians provided evidence that further treatment,including rehabilitation directed in part at the muscle spasms,would lessen the muscle ailments and result in further,although incomplete,cognitive improvement.id.at.because the evidence showed that further treatment would improve the seaman underlying condition,we found that the seaman had not reached the point of maximum medical recovery and that the shipowner duty of maintenance and cure continued.id.
in the instant case,whitman concedes that her ms is permanent.the question is whether whitman treatment would improve her medical condition such that she had not,as of august,reached the point of maximum medical recovery.the testimony of the doctors for both parties leaves no genuine issue of material fact that whitman treatment would,at best,slow or arrest the progression of her ms,but would not reverse her symptoms or improve her condition beyond the point of maximum medical recovery.
richard tenser,whitman treating physician,testified in his deposition that whitman condition had not improved and had probably worsened tenser testimony also indicated that,at best,he hoped treatment with betaseron would slow or arrest the progression of whitman ms to prevent her from becoming disabled 
would you agree with me that it is more likely than not that whitman will at some point in the future become disabled from her ms 
again,a tough question.i mean the whole goal of her treatment is to try to prevent that s he has pretty severe whether she will become disabled or not,i do know.obviously using the betaseron to try to prevent that,so do i want to acknowledge that the medication will fail,i reluctant to do that.i would just say that she certainly has a significant chance of becoming disabled.
moreover,whitman mentions several times that one of the goals of her treatment is to reverse her symptoms.however,tenser never testified that th
