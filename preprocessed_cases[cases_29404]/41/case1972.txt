the arkansas department of human services adhs appeals the district court decision to permanently enjoin it from repealing certain arkansas state medicaid plan state plan provisions relating to services provided under the child health management services program chms.we affirm in part,reverse in part and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
chms is the health care model that arkansas currently uses to provide early intervention diagnostic and therapy services to children between the ages of six months and six years in order to help make them ready for school.it is designed to serve children who have or are at increased risk for chronic physical,developmental,behavioral,or emotional conditions and who require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally.arkansas medicaid manual at.the services are provided under the state plan as part of the early and periodic screening,diagnosis,and treatment epsdt mandate in title xix of the social security act medicaid act,codified at a,a,a and r.
chms services may be divided into three categories diagnostic and evaluation services pediatric day treatment and therapies and other treatments.after a referral by a physician,chms clinic staff,including nurses,social workers,therapists,and psychologists,perform a diagnostic evaluation consisting of audiology,medical,behavioral,speech,language,and psychological assessments.using the results of these evaluations,a chms physician prepares an individual treatment plan and prescribes services and treatments for the child.these therapies and treatments are provided at the chms clinics and include nutrition services,behavior therapies,occupational and physical therapies,speech and language pathology services,psychological therapies,and early intervention day treatment.the model,in its current state,facilitates epsdt by providing the evaluation and therapies in clinical settings that allow children to receive all their therapies in one location.furthermore,the model provides an early intervention day treatment program to reinforce the skills children learn in individual therapies there are approximately chms clinics in the state,serving thirty of arkansas counties.on any given day,approximately arkansas children are eligible to receive chms services.
due to a budget shortfall,arkansas decided to reduce its medicaid expenditures by million.in november,adhs issued a press release that outlined suggested changes to the state plan and announced its intention to cut some of the services available under the chms program.with regard to epsdt services,the press release stated 
the department will amend the medicaid state plan to redefine the chms.this will change how treatment services are delivered to children who do have a serious medical problem,but are considered at risk.the department will continue to pay for diagnostic services,but will no longer pay for chms daycare and therapy services.programs such as head start and arkansas better chance are already providing day care services,and will continue to provide this service,in a more cost efficient manner than is available at chms.therapies that have been provided by chms are available from private providers it is estimated this action will save the medicaid program between million and million annually.arkansas is the only state that has been covering chms through the medicaid program.
appellant app.at as we understand the state proposal,it would leave the diagnostic and evaluation leg of chms intact,meaning that a physician would still refer a child to a chms clinic for an evaluation,the staff at the chms clinic would perform the evaluation,and a chms physician would recommend the needed therapies.however,the therapies and the early intervention day treatment services would no longer be part of the chms program thus,they would no longer be listed specifically in the state plan 
shortly after the state announced these cutbacks,pediatric specialty care,a provider of chms services,along with other chms providers provider plaintiffs and the parents of three recipients of chms services recipient plaintiffs filed suit under seeking temporary and permanent injunctive relief on the basis that the adhs proposed cutbacks would violate their federal right to epsdt services.
after a full hearing,the district court agreed with the plaintiffs and found that the medicaid act gives them an enforceable right to early intervention day treatment services.in its findings of fact,the court noted that the only early intervention day treatment services provided to children under the current state plan are those provided to children enrolled in chms.the court also found that even though therapy services would be provided by other sources if the budget cuts took place,therapy services not provided in conjunction with chms day treatment services will not result in the maximum reduction of their developmental disabilities or restoration of their best possible functional level,as mandated by a.pediatric specialty care,arkansas dep t of human,no,slip op.at.in its conclusions of law,the district court held that chms day treatment is a rehabilitative service,with both medical and remedial components under a.the court further stated that the day treatment provided through chms is treatment for the maximum reduction of disability and for a restoration of a developmentally delayed child to the best possible functional level.id.at quoting a.the court ultimately held that categorically needy children who request medical assistance under a,and for whom a physician recommends early intervention day treatment,have a federal right to the treatment.the court then granted a permanent injunction enjoining the chms cutbacks,reasoning that because early intervention day treatment is not provided for elsewhere in the state plan,the adhs may not cut its funding of chms day treatment.adhs appeals.
ii.discussion 
we consider three issues on appeal whether the district court erred in determining that the appellees may bring a cause of action whether the district court factual findings regarding day treatment services are clearly erroneous and whether the district court erred in determining that the medicaid act creates an enforceable right to chms day treatment services.
first,adhs argues that the medicaid act does not create a federal right that appellees may enforce through a action.section provides a federal cause of action against anyone who,acting pursuant to state authority,violates any rights privileges or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.a remedy is available under for violations of federal statutory and constitutional law.maine thiboutot,d.in order to bring a claim,however,a plaintiff must assert a violation of a federal right,not just a violation of a federal law.blessing freestone,d citation omitted.to determine whether the statute in question gives rise to a federal right,we consider three factors whether the provision in question was intend ed to benefit the putative plaintiff whether the interest the plaintiff asserts is not so vague and amorphous that it is beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce and whether the provision in question creates a binding obligation on the governmental unit.id.citations omitted.
the district court found that the plaintiffs met these requisites and properly asserted a federal right enforceable in a action.adhs now challenges the court holding that the provider plaintiffs are intended beneficiaries of the epsdt provisions.adhs concedes,however,that the recipient beneficiaries are intended beneficiaries of the statute.given this admission,even if we were to find that the provider plaintiffs are not the intended beneficiaries,the recipient plaintiffs may still enforce the federal statute.furthermore,adhs does not argue with the proposition that even without individual standing,the provider plaintiffs in this case have standing to assert the rights of their chms patients.see singleton wulff,d noting that where the relationship between the litigant and the third party is such that the former is fully,or very n
