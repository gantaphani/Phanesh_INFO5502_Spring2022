harry meyer katz was charged in a indictment with attempted or actual distribution of schedule iii and iv controlled substances outside of the scope of medical practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose in violation of and a.each count of the indictment related to a single prescription written by katz for various controlled substances,including xanax,darvocet,alprazolam,vicodin,and valium.a jury found katz guilty on counts of the indictment,and the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment,a fine,and forfeiture of katz appeals,alleging seven grounds for reversal.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
katz opened what could be considered an atypical medical practice in cedar hill,missouri,in.katz maintained office hours seven days a week and did not accept appointments.katz lived in his office and was amenable to opening his doors to a patient in need at any hour.he charged a flat fee,or,for all office visits,accepting payment in cash,check or charge he did not accept medical insurance.katz prescribed medications to patients upon request and was suspected of violating federal drug laws.katz was eventually indicted based upon prescriptions he wrote for fifteen people who all testified for the government at trial.
three of these individuals were undercover law enforcement officers sent into katz office,attempting to obtain a prescription for a controlled substance.officer mike otten visited katz four times,acting in an undercover capacity,and each time was equipped with an audio recording device.in each of otten visits,he requested a prescription for xanax,claiming that he wanted the pills to chill out.katz took his blood pressure,measured his height and weight then wrote otten a prescription for xanax.otten paid katz in cash.officer dawn molkenbur also visited katz,acting in an undercover capacity.she too requested a prescription for xanax,telling katz that she had used it before for personal reasons.katz wrote her a prescription,and molkenbur paid katz in cash.lastly,undercover officer cynthia scott visited katz,acting in an undercover capacity.scott asked katz for valium,stating that she liked the way it made her feel.katz wrote her a prescription for diazepam generic valium without conducting a medical examination.scott paid katz in cash.
daniel seay first saw katz in.seay testified that he suffered from back and knee pain.he also testified that he had problems with anxiety and panic attacks.katz prescribed seay acetaminophen with codeine for pain,alprazolam generic xanax,and propoxyphene generic darvocet on his first visit to katz office.katz wrote seay over prescriptions for controlled substances during the course of his treatment.
charles beck told katz that he wanted medication and specifically asked for hydrocodone generic vicodin,which he was immediately prescribed.beck continued to visit katz between and,complaining of various injuries and anxiety.during this time,katz wrote beck a total of prescriptions for controlled substances.on one occasion,katz wrote beck a prescription for vicodin days after he gave beck a prescription for vicodin tablets.on another occasion,katz wrote beck a prescription for vicodin days after he gave beck a prescription for vicodin tablets.on a third occasion,katz wrote beck a prescription for vicodin days after he gave beck a prescription for vicodin tablets.katz then expressed concern that beck had a problem with vicodin abuse,but katz continued to prescribe it for him.
pamela asher went to see katz after a car accident.she told katz that she needed medication,and he gave her prescriptions for darvocet and diazepam.pamela asher pretended to need medication and succeeded in getting katz to see her every weeks for years,during which time she received at least prescriptions for diazepam and darvocet.chad asher,pamela husband,first saw katz in.chad claimed that he was having stress and anxiety and a back problem.he specifically asked katz for diazepam and darvocet.chad continued to see katz every two weeks for the next four years.on occasion,chad would see katz more frequently than every weeks,each time receiving a new prescription.while seeing katz,the ashers each received the same prescriptions for the same medications.
dan bowen,saw katz for several years.initially,bowen talked to katz about stress and anxiety,resulting from his father death.katz prescribed xanax.bowen also told katz that he fell on ice and hurt his back and that he suffered from recurrent headaches.katz prescribed hydrocodone for the back pain and valium for the headaches.katz wrote bowen a total of prescriptions for controlled substances.peggy sue bowen,dan wife,saw katz for four to five years.she complained of migraine headaches.katz initially prescribed vicodin,but the prescription was later changed to fioricet and valium.over time,katz wrote her prescriptions for valium.angie luechtmann,daughter of the bowens,began receiving diazepam prescriptions from katz in.she told katz that she was under stress because she left her husband and her brother was in jail.she also received fioricet prescriptions from katz.katz was aware that luechtmann was a methamphetamine user,but he continued to write at least prescriptions for diazepam.dan bowen iii,son of the bowens,began seeing katz in,complaining of stress,and received at least prescriptions for diazepam.

william bradley,a college student,told katz that he had school stress and requested a prescription for xanax.he actually intended to use the xanax for personal pleasure.on one occasion,bradley told katz that he injured himself and requested pain medication.katz,without conducting an examination of the purported injury,prescribed darvocet.
maria taca gave testimony under federal rule of evidence b because her prescriptions were not charged in the indictment.at the time of trial,taca was indicted as a part of a heroin conspiracy and was testifying against katz in hopes of receiving a lighter sentence in connection with her own case.she testified that she began seeing katz in to obtain xanax.katz prescribed xanax and darvocet.taca visited katz at least every two weeks for about three years.sometimes,she would use an assumed name and get additional prescriptions.during one visit,katz told her that if she combined soma and librax together,they would produce the same effect as xanax.katz then gave her soma and librax prescriptions.
each testified that katz required no paperwork at their initial visit.further,katz never asked for medical or family history.there were usually no physical examinations conducted,and katz never referred any of these patients to a specialist or for a second opinion.all of the paid katz in cash and did not receive a receipt.
the government offered the expert testimony of ted parran.parran gave the jury an overview of the relationship in general.parran then addressed his review of katz patient charts for charles beck,daniel seay,chad asher and pamela asher.parran testified that the prescriptions written for these four patients were outside of the scope of legitimate medical practice and without a legitimate medical purpose.
ii.discussion 
katz advances the following arguments on appeal the district court erred in failing to grant his motion for judgment of acquittal or a new trial based on the sufficiency of the evidence the district court erred in admitting evidence relating to prescriptions not charged in the indictment the district court erred in admitting the testimony of maria taca pursuant to rule b the district court gave erroneous jury instructions the district court erred in allowing disputed portions of testimony from the government expert,parran,to be submitted to the jury the government rebuttal closing argument deprived him of a fair trial and the district court erred in failing to grant a mistrial following the inappropriate testimony of chad asher.
sufficiency of the evidence 
a prosecution under requires 
proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the doctor was acting outside the bounds of professional medical practice,as his authority to prescribe controlled substances was being used not for treatment of a patient,but for the purpose of assisting another in the maintenance of a drug habit or of dispensing controlled substances for other than a legitimate medical purpose,the personal profit of the physician.

katz contends that the record contained no evidence specific to of the counts and insufficient evidence supports the remaining counts of conviction.katz maintains that the government relied upon inadmissible evidence calculated to mislead the jury into convicting him based on a medical malpractice standard of negligence.specifically,katz argues he was prejudiced by the government lumping together all of the prescriptions written for a particular patient,which tended to negate the presumptive legality attached to each prescription.further,katz argues that the government must prove the relationship for each alleged illegal prescription.according to katz,evidence not connected directly to the writing of a charged prescription should have been considered irrelevant.lastly,katz points out that the government expert opined as to the contents of only four patient records.
this court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,with all reasonable inferences and credibility determinations made in support of the jury verdict.united states kelly,cir.we hold that sufficient evidence supports katz conviction.the prescriptions charged in the indictment represented individual prescriptions written to individuals who visited katz.each of these individual patients testified at trial.the district court admitted all prescriptions into evidence.each patient testified as to their relationship with katz and answered questions regarding their office visits with katz.each patient identified the prescriptions written for them by katz and verified that they received the prescriptions from katz.thus,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the government,we consider it sufficient to support katz conviction.
katz cites tran trong cuong,at,in support of his sufficiency argument.however,tran trong cuong is distinguishable,as that court based its holding of evidence insufficiency on the high percentage of counts that lacked patients to testify at trial.at.no patient testified as to of the counts in the indictment.id.the court held that a defendant is entitled to individual consideration of every count in an indictment by the jury and evidence sufficient to convict on each count beyond a reasonable doubt,if he is to be convicted.id.at.in this case,every patient who received a prescription charged in the indictment testified,enabling the jury to consider each individual count in the indictment.for those reasons,we affirm the district court denial of katz motion for judgment of acquittal or for a new trial.
admission of evidence under rule b 
we review the admissibility of evidence under rule b for abuse of discretion.the district court had broad discretion in admitting such evidence and will be reversed only if such evidence clearly had no bearing on the case and was introduced solely to prove the defendant propensity to commit criminal acts.united states voegtlin,cir quoting united states thomas,cir internal citation omitted.rule b provides that evidence of prior crimes or acts,while inadmissible to prove that a person acted in conformity with the prior act,may be admissible for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident.id.quoting.b.evidence is admissible under rule b if it is relevant to a material issue,similar in kind and close in time to the crime charged,proven by a preponderance of the evidence,and if the potential prejudice does not substantially outweigh its probative value.id.quoting thomas,at.
admission of prescriptions not charged in the indictment 
the government introduced evidence of at least prescriptions that were not charged in the indictment but were written for patients who testified at trial.katz argues that the mere fact that a prescription was written is not proof of wrongdoing.katz asserts that the government introduced the uncharged prescriptions only to impress upon the jury the number of prescriptions that he wrote.the government,in response,contends that the prescriptions were relevant and admissible under rule b as proof of knowledge and intent.the district court agreed and stated that the 
n prescriptions written to individuals named in the indictment appear relevant to the inquiry as to whether defendant had knowledge or intent to prescribe controlled substances to those individuals outside of the normal course of professional practice and without a legitimate medical purpose the issuance of prescriptions to the patients in question does bear on defendant treatment of those patients and is properly admitted under rule b.
we find no abuse of discretion in the district court ruling.first,evidence is admissible under rule b to show intent.in this case,a necessary element of the crime charged was whether katz wrote the prescriptions for a legitimate medical purpose.thus,the question of katz intent was central to the case and relevant to a material issue.second,the prescriptions not charged in the indictment were similar in kind and close in time to the crime charged.third,the prescriptions not charged in the indictment were proven by a preponderance of the evidence,as the patients to whom they were written testified that they did indeed receive the prescriptions from katz.lastly,the admission of these other prescriptions was not unfairly prejudicial.for those reasons,the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the prescriptions not charged in the indictment under rule b.see united states green,cir holding that the defendant substantial rights were not affected when the district court allowed nine victims to testify who were not specifically referenced in the indictment.
admission of testimony from maria taca 
katz argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the testimony of maria taca under rule b.he contends that the admission of taca testimony was intended solely to establish criminal propensity and tie him to a drug smuggler.katz submits that the prejudicial impact of taca testimony unquestionably outweighed what little probative value that it had.we find no abuse of discretion in the district court ruling on the admission taca testimony under rule b.taca testimony was admitted to show katz knowledge and intent in writing these prescriptions in order to establish that he did not have a legitimate medical purpose in writing them.
moreover,the testimony satisfies the test for the admissibility of rule b evidence.the testimony was relevant to the material katz wrote these prescriptions outside the usual course of medical practice and without a legitimate medical purpose.the government established by a preponderance of the evidence that katz wrote the prescriptions for taca.the potential prejudice did not substantially outweigh its probative value,and the other acts were similar in kind and close in time to the crime charged.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony of maria taca.
jury instructions 
we review the district court jury instructions for abuse of discretion,and this court will affirm if the instructions,taken as a whole,fairly and adequately submitted the issues to the jury.a district court has broad discretion in instructing the jury,and jury instructions do not need to be technically perfect or even a model of clarity.united states,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.
rule b instruction 
katz alleges that the district court gave a highly confusing instruction that did not tell the jurors how to properly
