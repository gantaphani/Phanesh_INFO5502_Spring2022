in a qui tam action in which the government intervened,a jury determined that tuomey healthcare system,did not violate the false claims act fca,the district court,however,vacated the jury verdict and granted the government a new trial after concluding that it had erroneously excluded excerpts of a tuomey executive deposition testimony.the jury in the second trial found that tuomey knowingly submitted false claims to medicare for reimbursement.the district court then entered final judgment for the government and awarded damages and civil penalties totaling.
tuomey contends that the district court erred in granting the government motion for a new trial.tuomey also lodges numerous other challenges to the judgment entered against it following the second trial.it argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,yet another new trial because it did not violate the fca.in the alternative,tuomey asks for a new trial because the district court failed to properly instruct the jury.finally,tuomey asks us to strike the damages and civil penalties award as either improperly calculated or unconstitutional.
we conclude that the district court correctly granted the government motion for a new trial,albeit for a reason different than that relied upon by the district court.we also reject tuomey claims of error following the second trial.accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment.
tuomey is a nonprofit hospital located in sumter,south carolina,a small,largely rural community that is a medically underserved area.at the time of the events leading up to this lawsuit,most of the physicians that practiced at tuomey were not directly employed by the hospital,but instead were members of independent specialty practices.
beginning around,doctors who previously performed outpatient surgery at tuomey began doing so in their own offices or at surgery centers.the loss of this revenue stream was a source of grave concern for tuomey because it collected substantial facility fees from patients who underwent surgery at the hospital outpatient center.tuomey estimated that it stood to lose to million over a period from the loss of fees associated with gastrointestinal procedures alone.to stem this loss,tuomey sought to negotiate employment contracts with a number of local physicians.
in drafting the contracts,tuomey was well aware of the constraints imposed by the stark law.while we discuss the provisions of that law in greater detail below,in broad terms,the statute,prohibits physicians from making referrals to entities where t he referring physician receives aggregate compensation that varies with,or takes into account,the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician for the entity furnishing the designated health services.c ii.pursuant to the stark law,a hospital may not submit for payment a medicare claim for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral.united states ex rel.drakeford tuomey healthcare,cir.
beginning in,tuomey sought the advice of its longtime counsel,nexsen pruet,on the stark law implications arising from the proposed employment contracts.nexsen pruet in turn engaged cejka consulting,a national consulting firm that specialized in physician compensation,to provide an opinion concerning the commercial reasonableness and fair market value of the contracts.tuomey also conferred with richard kusserow,a former inspector general for the united states department of health and human services,and later,with steve pratt,an attorney at hall render,a prominent healthcare law firm.
the employment contracts had substantially similar terms.each physician was paid an annual guaranteed base salary.that salary was adjusted from year to year based on the amount the physician collected from all services rendered the previous year.the bulk of the physicians compensation was earned in the form of a productivity bonus,which paid the physicians eighty percent of the amount of their collections for that year.the physicians were also eligible for an incentive bonus of up to seven percent of their earned productivity bonus.in addition,tuomey agreed to pay for the physicians medical malpractice liability insurance as well as their practice group share of employment taxes.the physicians were also allowed to participate in tuomey health insurance plan.finally,tuomey agreed to absorb each practice group billing and collections costs.
the contracts had terms,during which physicians could maintain their private practices,but were required to perform outpatient surgical procedures exclusively at the hospital.physicians could not own any interest in a facility located in sumter that provided ambulatory surgery services,save for a interest in a publicly traded company that provided such services.the physicians also agreed not to perform outpatient surgical procedures within a radius of the hospital for two years after the expiration or termination of the contracts.
tuomey ultimately entered into employment contracts with nineteen physicians.tuomey,however,was unable to reach an agreement with michael drakeford,an orthopedic surgeon.drakeford believed that the proposed contracts violated the stark law because the physicians were being paid in excess of their collections.he contended that the compensation package did not reflect fair market value,and thus the government would view it as an unlawful payment for the doctor referrals.
to address drakeford concerns,tuomey suggested a joint venture as an alternative business arrangement,whereby doctors would become investors in a management company that would provide management of the outpatient surgery center,and both tuomey and its would receive payments based on that management structure.drakeford,however,declined that option.
unable to break the stalemate in their negotiations,in may,tuomey and drakeford sought the advice of kevin mcananey,an attorney in private practice with expertise in the stark law.mcananey had formerly served as the chief of the industry guidance branch of the united states department of health and human services office of counsel to the inspector general.in that position,mcananey wrote a substantial portion of the regulations implementing the stark law.
mcananey advised the parties that the proposed employment contracts raised significant red flags under the stark law.in particular,tuomey would have serious difficulty persuading the government that the contracts did not compensate the physicians in excess of fair market value.such a contention,said mcananey,would not pass the red face test.mcananey also warned tuomey that the contracts presented an easy case to prosecute for the government.
drakeford ultimately declined to enter into a contract with tuomey.he later sued the hospital under the qui tam provisions of the fca,alleging that because the employment contracts violated the stark law,tuomey had knowingly submitted false claims for payment to medicare.as was its right,the government intervened in the action and filed additional claims seeking equitable relief for payments made under mistake of fact and unjust enrichment theories.
at the first trial,tuomey argued that mcananey testimony and related opinions regarding the contracts should be excluded as an offer to compromise or settle under federal rule of evidence because mcananey was mediating a dispute between tuomey and drakeford.alternatively,tuomey contended that because mcananey was hired jointly by tuomey and drakeford,he owed a duty of loyalty to both clients that precluded him from testifying.the district court sustained tuomey objection,although it did not articulate the ground for its ruling.
tuomey also objected to the government attempt to admit excerpts from the deposition testimony of gregg martin,tuomey senior vice president and chief operating officer.tuomey argued that the deposition testimony should be excluded because it contained martin recollections of a discussion he had with tuomey counsel concerning mcananey opinions regarding the employment contracts.according to tuomey,the testimony was merely a back doorway to get in mcananey opinions.the government countered that the deposition testimony was admissible to show tuomey state of mind and intent to violate the stark law.the district court again sustained tuomey objection.
the jury returned a verdict finding that,while tuomey had violated the stark law,it had not violated the fca.the government filed a motion for judgment on its equitable claims.it also moved for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure on the fca claim,or alternatively for a new trial under rule because of the district court decision to exclude mcananey testimony and opinions,as well as the martin deposition excerpts.
the district court denied the government motion for judgment as a matter of law.but the court agreed that it had committed a substantial error by excluding the martin deposition excerpts.it therefore granted the government motion for a new trial.notably,the district court decision was based solely on its error in excluding the martin deposition excerpts.
while the government asked for a new trial only on the knowledge element of the fca claim,the district court granted a new trial as to the entirety of the claim.notwithstanding the court decision to grant a new trial on the fca claim,the district court entered judgment for the government on its equitable claims based on the jury finding of a stark law violation,and ordered tuomey to pay damages in the amount of plus pre and interest.
on appeal,we vacated the judgment,concluding that the jury finding of a stark law violation was a common factual issue necessary to the resolution of both the equitable claims and the fca claim yet,because the district court rendered the jury verdict finding a stark law violation a legal nullity when it granted the government motion for a new trial,we held that the court deprived tuomey of its seventh amendment right to a jury trial by entering judgment on the equitable claims.drakeford,at.we remanded the case for a new trial as to all claims.
while the case was on appeal,the presiding judge passed away.at the second trial,the new presiding judge allowed the government to introduce the previously excluded martin deposition testimony,and also allowed mcananey to testify.the jury found that tuomey violated both the stark law and the fca.it further found that tuomey had submitted false claims to medicare with a total value of.the district court trebled the actual damages and assessed an additional civil penalty,both actions required by the fca.a.from the resulting judgment of,tuomey appeals.
tuomey appeal presents these issues first,did the district court err in granting the government motion for a new trial on the fca claim if not,did the district court err in denying tuomey motion for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,for yet another new trial following the second trial and awarding damages and penalties against tuomey based on the jury finding of an fca violation we address each issue in turn,but first provide a general overview of the stark law.
the stark law is intended to prevent overutilization of services by physicians who stand to profit from referring patients to facilities or entities in which they have a financial interest.drakeford,at.the statute prohibits a physician from making a referral to an entity,such as a hospital,with which he or she has a financial relationship,for the furnishing of designated health services.a.if the physician makes such a referral,the hospital may not submit a bill for reimbursement to medicare.id.a b.similarly,the government may not make any payment for a designated health service provided in violation of the stark law.id.g.if a person collects any payment for a service billed in violation of the stark law,the person shall be liable to the individual for,and shall refund on a timely basis to the individual,any amounts so collected.id.g 
inpatient and outpatient hospital services are considered designated health services under the law.id.h.a referral includes the request by a physician for the item or service.id.h a.a referral does not include any designated health service personally performed or provided by the referring physician.however,there is a referral when the hospital bills a facility fee also known as a facility component or technical component in connection with the personally performed service.medicare and medicaid programs physicians referrals to health care entities with which they have financial relationships,see also medicare program physicians referrals to health care entities with which they have financial relationships phase ii.
a financial relationship constitutes a prohibited indirect compensation arrangement,if there exists an unbroken chain of any number of persons or entities that have financial relationships between them,t he referring physician receives aggregate compensation that varies with,or takes into account,the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician for the entity furnishing the designated health services,and the entity has knowledge that the compensation so varies.c see also drakeford,at c ompensation arrangements that take into account anticipated referrals implicate the volume or value standard.the statute,however,does not bar indirect compensation arrangements where the referring physician is compensated at fair market value for services and items actually provided the compensation arrangement is not determined in any manner that takes into account the volume or value of referrals the compensation arrangement is commercially reasonable and the compensation arrangement does not run afoul of any other federal or state law.p drakeford,at.
once a relator or the government has established the elements of a stark law violation,it becomes the defendant burden to show that the indirect compensation arrangement exception shields it from liability.see united states ex rel.kosenske carlisle hma,cir.
we first address the district court decision to grant the government a new trial on the fca claim.the government pressed two grounds in support of its motion.first,it argued that the district court erred by excluding mcananey testimony,along with all evidence containing the views he expressed to the parties on the potential stark law liability surrounding the contracts.second,the government argued that the district court erroneously excluded the martin deposition excerpts.while the district court granted a new trial on the latter ground,we instead affirm the district court on the basis of its more glaring error,the exclusion of mcananey testimony and related evidence.
we review a district court decision to grant a new trial for abuse of discretion.cline wal mart stores,cir.we apply the same standard to the district court decision to exclude evidence.buckley mukasey,cir.by definition,a district court abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.rzs holdings avv pdvsa petroleo,cir.even so,we may reverse a district court only if its evidentiary error affects a party substantial rights.buckley,at.and,of course,we may affirm a district court ruling on any ground apparent in the record.republican party of martin,cir.
we believe that the district court abused its discretion in granting a new trial on the ground that it had improperly excluded the martin deposition excerpts.even if the district court should not have excluded this evidence in the first instance,an evidentiary error is harmless when it does not affect a party substantial this case,whether it can be said with a high probability that the error did not affect the judgment.taylor.union,cir en banc,abrogated on other grounds by desert palace,costa,daskarolis firestone tire rubber,f d,cir noting that even if the district court believed that it had excluded admissible evidence,the erroneous exclusion could not be grounds for a new trial because it did not affect the substantial rights of the parties.the district court made no effort to assess the alleged error under this stringent harmless error standard.furthermore,because the exclusion of the martin deposition testimony was,in fact,a harmless error,the district court abused its discretion in granting a new trial on this ground.
in its motion for a new trial,the government argued that martin testimony was necessary evidence supporting the scienter element of its fca claim.specifically,the government contended that martin,tuomey agent,received and ignored mcananey warnings that the employment contracts raised significant stark law compliance issues.thus,says the government,the evidence would have demonstrated tuomey reckless disregard of the legal minefield that it was traversing.we think,however,that the probative value of this particular evidence is weak at best,and excluding it did not negatively affect the government substantial rights.
the deposition excerpts predominantly focus on martin recollection of a discussion he had with tuomey lawyer,tim hewson.hewson recounted to martin the details of a conference call between hewson,mcananey,and drakeford lawyer,greg smith specifically,hewson told martin that mcananey had stark law compliance concerns with both the proposed employment contracts as well as the joint venture arrangement which martin referred to as the under arrangement.however,martin was unable to remember specifics about the conversation,and often confused mcananey concerns with issues raised by steve pratt.
martin did vaguely recall that hewson had told him that mcananey said the proposed arrangements would raise red flags with the government.yet,martin could not remember whether mcananey warnings were particular to the employment contracts,the joint venture arrangement,or both.indeed,in martin recollection it was hard to separate the two.to the extent that martin could distinguish the two proposed arrangements,he recalled being warned of greater problems with the joint venture arrangement.
with respect to mcananey concerns about the employment contracts,martin had a vague recollection of some issues related to fair market value,but was unable to offer more detail.ultimately,martin acknowledged that there was a difference of opinion between mcananey and hewson,but decided to trust hewson opinion that the contracts posed no stark law concerns.
that martin deposition testimony was hazy is not at all surprising,given that he was being asked to recall nearly four years after the fact the substance of a conversation with tuomey lawyer,who himself was recalling an earlier conference call with mcananey.standing alone,we fail to see how the government was substantially prejudiced by the district court decision to exclude this evidence.thus,we hold that the district court abused its discretion in relying on this ground to grant the government motion for a new trial.
nonetheless,we affirm the district court order granting a new trial on the alternative ground urged by the it was prejudiced by the exclusion of mcananey testimony and other related evidence of his warnings to tuomey regarding the legal peril that the employment contracts posed to make its case that tuomey knowingly submitted false claims under the fca,the government needed to show that tuomey knew that there was a substantial risk that the contracts violated the stark law,and was nonetheless deliberately ignorant of,or recklessly disregarded that risk.in our view,mcananey testimony was a relevant,and indeed essential,component of the government evidence on that element,and tuomey offered no good reason why the jury should not hear it.
the district court has now presided over two trials in this case,with strikingly disparate results.in the first trial,the jury did not hear from mcananey and found for tuomey on the fca claim.when the case was retried,mcananey was allowed to testify and the jury found for the government.coincidence we think not.rather,we believe that these results bespeak the importance of what the jury in the first trial was not allowed to consider.
and this is so even while acknowledging that mcananey was a looming presence throughout the first trial.for example,the jury heard audio of a tuomey board meeting,where a board member mentioned that mcananey had voiced concerns with the employment contracts.left unsaid,however,was the precise nature of those concerns or the weight and seriousness that mcananey attached to them.the jury also knew that hewson tuomey counsel at nexson pruet was generally aware of mcananey views on the employment contracts,but that he dismissed them as not credible because,in his view,drakeford was deliberately seeking to cherry pick a legal opinion that would undermine the entire deal.
the jury was also aware that wrote to tuomey board summarizing mcananey opinions.the district court,however,excluded drakeford letter,although it did allow the jury to consider the board response wherein it summarily rejected drakeford unspecified objections.finally,the jury heard that tuomey refused to allow mcananey to prepare a written opinion discussing his concerns regarding the contracts,and subsequently terminated mcananey engagement altogether on september.
while certainly not insubstantial,the sum of the evidence at the first trial regarding mcananey was that tuomey was aware that mcananey had unspecified concerns about the employment contracts refused to allow mcananey to relay his concerns in writing and later terminated mcananey joint representation.yet,under the fca,the government had to prove that tuomey knew of,was deliberately ignorant of,or recklessly disregarded the falsity of its claims that its claims violated the stark law.we think that mcananey specific warnings to tuomey regarding the dangers posed by the contracts were critical to making this showing.
mcananey warned tuomey that procuring fair market valuations,by itself,was not conclusive of the accuracy of the valuation.he emphasized that it would be very hard to convince the government that a contract that paid physicians substantially above even their collections,much less their collections minus expenses,would constitute fair market value.according to mcananey,compensation arrangements under which the contracting physicians are paid in excess of their collections were basically a red flag to the government.id.he noted that similar cases had previously been prosecuted before,although all of them ultimately settled.
mcananey also pointed out that the term of the contracts,combined with the,noncompete provision would reinforce the government view that tuomey was paying the physicians above fair market value for referrals.j.he concluded that the contracts did not pass the red face test,and warned that the government would find this an easy case to prosecute.
we think the importance of mcananey testimony to the government case is.indeed,it is difficult to imagine any more probative and compelling evidence regarding tuomey intent than the testimony of a lawyer hired by tuomey,who was an undisputed subject matter expert on the intricacies of the stark law,and who warned tuomey in graphic detail of the thin legal ice on which it was treading with respect to the employment contracts 
tuomey urges,however,that mcananey testimony and other evidence containing his views were properly excluded under federal rule of evidence.that rule,however,mandates the exclusion of evidence relating to offers to compromise or settle disputed claims if the evidence is being offered to prove liability on the claim.bituminous,rucker,cir.we are not persuaded that mcananey was retained to help drakeford and tuomey compromise or settle a disputed claim.rather,the record unambiguously shows that drakeford and tuomey hired mcananey to advise them of the stark law risks posed by the employment contracts.as a result,rule does not support the district court decision to exclude mcananey testimony see icap,global digital satellite,wl,at cir unpublished table opinion finding rule inapplicable where the parties communications involved contract negotiations rather than settlement negotiations.
nor do we find merit in tuomey objection based on mcananey supposed duty of loyalty to his clients.at trial,tuomey never suggested which evidentiary rule supported exclusion on this ground,although it now characterizes this argument as a claim for exclusion under rule.that rule of course allows a district court to exclude relevant evidence,but only if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following unfair prejudice,confusing the issues,misleading the jury,undue delay,wasting time,or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.left unsaid by tuomey is precisely how the probative value of mcananey compelling testimony was substantially outweighed by the countervailing factors set out in rule.
in sum,tuomey has offered no good reason why the jury in the first trial was not allowed to hear from mcananey.and we agree with the government that this evidence was critical to its ability to satisfy its burden to prove that tuomey acted with the requisite intent under the fca.we therefore affirm the district court order granting a new trial on the fca claim.
we turn now to tuomey challenges to the judgment entered following the second trial.tuomey asks for judgment as a matter of law because a reasonable jury could not have found that the employment contracts violated the stark law,or tuomey knowingly submitted false claims.alternatively,tuomey asks for a new trial because of the district court refusal to tender certain jury instructions.
we review the district court denial of tuomey motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.austin paramount parks,cir.we view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.konkel bob evans farms,cir.we will reverse the district court if a reasonable jury could rule only in favor of the moving party.dennis columbia colleton med,cir i f reasonable minds could differ,we must affirm.
tuomey argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the contracts between it and the physicians did not run afoul of the stark law.as we explain,however,a reasonable jury could find that tuomey violated the stark law when it paid aggregate compensation to physicians that varied with or took into account the volume or value of actual or anticipated referrals to tuomey.
to begin with,we note that the stark law volume or value standard can be implicated when aggregate compensation varies with the volume or value of referrals,or otherwise takes into account the volume or value of referrals.c ii.that is precisely what the district court directed the jury in the second trial to assess.tuomey insists,however,that our earlier opinion in this case foreclosed the jury consideration of whether the contracts varied with the volume or value of referrals.instead,says tuomey,the only question that should have been put to the jury was whether the contracts,on their face,took into account the value or volume of anticipated referrals.drakeford,at.
we disagree.the district court properly understood that the jury was entitled to pass on the contracts as they were actually implemented by the parties.we said as much in our earlier opinion,where 
we emphasize d that our holding was limited to the issues we specifically address ed.on remand,a jury must determine,in light of our holding,whether the aggregate compensation received by the physicians under the contracts varied with,or took into account,the volume or value of the facility component referrals.
id.at emphasis added.
a reasonable jury could have found that tuomey contracts in fact compensated the physicians in a manner that varied with the volume or value of referrals.there are two different components of the physicians compensation that we believe so varied.first,each year,the physicians were paid a base salary that was adjusted upward or downward depending on their collections from the prior year.in addition,the physicians received the bulk of their compensation in the form of a productivity bonus,pegged at eighty percent of the amount of their collections.
as tuomey concedes,the aggregate compensation received by the physicians under the contracts was based solely on collections for personally performed professional services.appellant br.at.and as we noted in our earlier opinion,there are referrals here,consisting of the facility component of the physicians personally performed services,and the resulting facility fee billed by tuomey based upon that component.drakeford,at.in sum,the more procedures the physicians performed at the hospital,the more facility fees tuomey collected,and the more compensation the physicians received in the form of increased base salaries and productivity bonuses.
the nature of this arrangement was confirmed by tuomey former chief financial officer,william paul johnson,who admitted that every time one of the physicians did a legitimate procedure on a medicare patient at the hospital pursuant to the agreement,the doctor got more money,and the hospital also got more money.we thus think it plain that a reasonable jury could find that the physicians compensation varied with the volume or value of actual referrals.the district court did not err in denying tuomey motion for judgment as a matter of law on this ground 
tuomey next argues that the district court erred in not granting its motion for judgment as a matter of law because it did not knowingly violate the fca.specifically,tuomey claims that because it reasonably relied on the advice of counsel,no reasonable jury could find that tuomey possessed the requisite intent to violate the fca.because the record here is replete with evidence indicating that tuomey shopped for legal opinions approving of the employment contracts,while ignoring negative assessments,we disagree.
the fca imposes civil liability on any person who knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to an officer or employee of the united states government.a a,b a i.under the act,the term knowingly means that a person,with respect to information contained in a claim,has actual knowledge of the information acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information or acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information.id.b.the purpose of the fca scienter requirement is to avoid punishing honest mistakes or incorrect claims submitted through mere negligence.united states ex rel.owens first kuwaiti trading contracting,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the record evidence provides ample support for the jury verdict as to tuomey intent.indeed,mcananey testimony,summarized above,is alone sufficient to sweep aside tuomey claim of error we agree with the district court conclusion that a reasonable jury could have found that tuomey possessed the requisite scienter once it determined to disregard mcananey remarks.a reasonable jury could indeed be troubled by tuomey seeming inaction in the face of mcananey warnings,particularly given tuomey aggressive efforts to avoid hearing precisely what mcananey had to say regarding the contracts.
nonetheless,a defendant may avoid liability under the fca if it can show that it acted in good faith on the advice of counsel.united states painter,cir holding,in a case involving fraud,that i f in good faith reliance upon legal advice given him by a lawyer to whom he has made full disclosure of the facts,one engages in a course of conduct later found to be illegal,the trier of fact may in appropriate circumstances conclude the conduct was innocent because the guilty mind was absent.however,consultation with a lawyer confers no automatic immunity from the legal consequences of conscious fraud.id.at.rather,to establish the defense,the defendant must show the a full disclosure of all pertinent facts to counsel,and b good faith reliance on counsel advice.united states butler,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
tuomey contends that it provided full and accurate information regarding the proposed employment contracts to hewson,who in turn advised tuomey that the contracts did not run afoul of the stark law.but as the government aptly notes,i n determining whether tuomey reasonably relied on the advice of its counsel,the jury was entitled to consider all the advice given to it by any source.appellee br.at.
in denying tuomey motions,the district court we a reasonable jury could have concluded that tuomey was,after september,no longer acting in good faith reliance on the advice of its counsel when it refused to give full consideration to mcananey negative assessment of the employment contracts and terminated his representation tuomey defends its dismissal of mcananey warnings by claiming that his opinion was tainted by undue influence exerted by drakeford and his counsel.but there was evidence before the jury suggesting that tuomey also tried to procure a favorable opinion from mcananey.indeed,tuomey counsel admitted that he was trying to steer mcananey towards tuomey desired outcome and that tuomey needed to continue playing along and influence the outcome of the game as best we can.thus,a reasonable jury could conclude that tuomey ignored mcananey because it simply did not like what he had to say.
tuomey points to the fact that it retained steve pratt,a prominent healthcare lawyer,and richard kusserow,former inspector general at the united states department of health and human services,as further evidence that it acted in good faith and did not ignore mcananey warnings.pratt rendered two opinions that generally approved of the employment contracts.but he did so without being told of mcananey unfavorable assessment,even though tuomey had that information available to it at the time.in addition,pratt reviewed and relied on the view of tuomey consultant that the employment contracts would compensate the physicians at fair market value,but he did not consider how the consultant arrived at its opinion.nor did he know how much the doctors earned prior to entering into the contracts,or that the hospital stood to lose million a year,not taking into account facility fees,by compensating the physicians above their collections.we thus think it entirely reasonable for a jury to look skeptically on pratt favorable advice regarding the contracts.
the same can be said of the kusserow advice.was called by the government to rebut tuomey tuomey regarding the employment contracts about eighteen months before the parties retained mcananey.as was the case with pratt,he received no information regarding the fair market value of the employment contracts,information that kusserow considered vital to be able to do a full stark analysis of the proposed contracts.and although kusserow did say in a letter to tuomey counsel that he did not believe the contracts presented significant stark issues,he hedged considerably on that view because of potentially troubling issues related to the productivity and incentive bonus provisions in the contracts that have not been fully addressed.
as the district court observed,the jury evidently rejected tuomey advice of counsel defense as of the date that tuomey received mcananey warnings,grounded on the fact that the jury excluded damages from before the termination of mcananey engagement in making its determination of the civil penalty and damages.thus,while kusserow advice was certainly relevant to tuomey defense,a reasonable jury could have determined that mcananey warnings and tuomey subsequent inaction were far more probative on the issue.
in sum,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,we have no cause to upset the jury reasoned verdict that tuomey violated the fca.
next,tuomey raises several challenges to the district court jury instructions.we review a district court decision to give or not give a jury instruction and the content of an instruction for abuse of discretion.united states russell,cir.our task is to determine whether the instructions,construed as a whole,and in light of the whole record,adequately informed the jury of the controlling legal principles without misleading or confusing the jury to the prejudice of the objecting party.spell mcdaniel,cir.we will reverse the district court decision not to give a party proposed instruction only when the requested instruction was correct was not substantially covered by the court charge to the jury and dealt with some point in the trial so important,that failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired that party ability to make its case.noel artson,cir internal quotation marks omitted 
first,tuomey urges us to grant it a new trial because the district court failed to give jury instructions consistent with our analysis in the first appeal.specifically,tuomey claims that the district court ignored our admonition that the question,which should properly be put to a jury,is whether the contracts,on their face,took into account the value or volume of anticipated referrals.drakeford,at.according to tuomey,the district court failure to so instruct the jury erroneously permitted the jury to consider extrinsic evidence of intent in determining whether the physicians compensation took into account the volume or value of referrals.
as the district court correctly determined,however,we did not mean to limit the government ability to present evidence as to tuomey intent to violate the fca.rather,we sought to emphasize that the government could not rely on such evidence alone to show a violation.see id.at we agree with united states ex rel.villafane solinger,d,that intent alone does not create a violation.however,that does not aid tuomey if the jury determines that the contracts took into account the volume or value of anticipated referrals.thus,the district court did not err in declining to give this instruction.
tuomey next argues that the district court erred in not separately instructing the jury on the knowledge element in the stark law regulations definition of an indirect compensation arrangement.as tuomey correctly notes,the stark law requires that t he entity furnishing designated health services must ha ve actual knowledge of,or act in reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of,the fact that the referring physician receives aggregate compensation that varies with,or takes into account,the volume or value of referrals.c iii.
here,however,the district court instructed the jury that tuomey would have acted knowingly under the fca if it realized what it was doing and was aware of the nature of its conduct and did not act through ignorance,mistake or accident.given that a jury found tuomey possessed the requisite scienter under the fca,it necessarily also found tuomey knew that its contracts varied with or took into account referrals.therefore,the district court error if any in not separately instructing the jury as to the knowledge component of the stark law was harmless.
third,tuomey argues that the district court erred by refusing to charge the jury that claims based upon differences of interpretation of disputed legal questions are not false under the fca.for this proposition,it cites to our decision in united states ex rel.wilson kellogg brown root,cir,in which we said as much.however,we also held there that for a claim to be false under the fca,the statement or conduct alleged must represent an objective falsehood.id.at.
when submitting its claims to the government,tuomey was required to certify its compliance with the stark law.see united states ex rel.thompson healthcare,cir w here the government has conditioned payment of a claim upon a claimant certification of compliance with a statute or regulation,a claimant submits a false or fraudulent claim when he or she falsely certifies compliance with that statute or regulation.united states ex rel.pogue diabetes treatment ctrs.of,d.here,tuomey either complied with the stark law or it did.this is an objective inquiry.and the jury found that tuomey,in fact,violated the stark law.as a result,tuomey certification that it complied with the stark law was false.the subjective tuomey knew that its claims were in violation of the stark lawis covered under the knowledge element therefore,the district court did not err in refusing to give this instruction.
for their last jury instruction challenge,tuomey contends that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that tuomey was entitled to rely on legal advice even if it turned out to be wrong.however,the district court instructed the jury that knowledge does not include actions taken through ignorance,mistake or accident.it later emphasized that the jury could not conclude that tuomey had knowledge from proof of mistake,negligence,carelessness or a belief in an inaccurate proposition.id.emphasis added.because the import of tuomey proposed charge was covered by the district court instructions,we reject tuomey claim of error.
finally,tuomey makes several challenges to the judgment entered against it.first,it argues that the district court improperly calculated the civil penalty.next,it claims that the district court used the incorrect measure of actual damages.finally,it brings constitutional challenges to the award under the fifth and eighth amendments.
a defendant found liable under the fca must pay the government a civil penalty of not less than and not more than plus times the amount of damages which the government sustains because of that person.a a in this case,the jury found that tuomey had submitted false claims,for which it awarded actual damages of,which the district court trebled.the district court then added a civil penalty of to that sum,which it calculated by multiplying the number of false claims by the statutory minimum penalty.
ordinary,we review a court calculation of damages for clear error.universal furniture int l,collezione europa usa,cir.however,to the extent the claim is that the calculations are influenced by legal error,our review is de novo.id.likewise,the constitutionality of a damages award is a legal question that we review de novo.see cooper,leatherman tool.
according to tuomey,the civil penalty assessed was improperly inflated because the jury was permitted to take into account both inpatient and outpatient procedures performed by the contracting physicians.instead,relying on our earlier opinion in this case,tuomey claims that the only relevant claims were those tuomey presented,or caused to be presented,to medicare and medicaid for payment of facility fees generated as a result of outpatient procedures performed pursuant to the contracts.appellant br.at alterations omitted quoting drakeford,at.tuomey is incorrect.
it is true that the contracts solely addressed compensation for outpatient procedures.that is,the physicians collections which form the basis for both their base salaries and their productivity bonuses do not account for the volume or value of inpatient procedures performed.tuomey,however,takes out of context language from our earlier opinion recognizing this fact to suggest that we commanded that the relevant claims be limited to those seeking payment for outpatient procedures.we said nothing of the sort.
if a physician has a financial relationship with a hospital,then the stark law prohibits the physician from making any referral to that hospital for the furnishing of designated health services,united states ex rel.bartlett ashcroft,d,because a compensation arrangement existed between physician defendants and the hospital,the stark law prohibited physician defendants from making any patient referrals to the hospital for designated health services.emphasis added.inpatient hospital services are designated health services.h.and a referral includes the request or establishment of a plan of care by a physician which includes the provision of the designated health service.id.h.plainly,then,inpatient services constitute a prohibited referral for the furnishing of designated health services,and the district court properly instructed the jury to factor them into the damages calculation.
tuomey also asserts that the jury damage award is flawed because the government failed to present sufficient evidence of referrals.specifically,tuomey contends that the government did not identify the referring physician,and thus failed to prove that the alleged false claims came about through a prohibited referral.
the government proof on this point came in the form of summary evidence and testimony detailing the claims submitted by tuomey.we agree with the district court that the government evidence was sufficient to support the jury verdict.we note also,as did the district court,that tuomey was entitled to offer its own expert and its own alternate damages calculations,but elected not to do so.
in any case,tuomey offers no authority to support its argument that the claims must explicitly identify the referring provider.conversely,several courts have accepted that the physician identified in form ub qualifies as a referring physician.united states rogan,d,see also united states halifax hosp,cv orl,wl,at,finding that the fact that one of the physicians with whom the hospital has a financial relationship is identified as an operating or attending physician is sufficient evidence that the physician was also the referring physician absent evidence to the contrary.given the lack of support for tuomey position,we conclude that the jury had sufficient evidence to identify the prohibited referrals.
tuomey next argues that the district court erroneously assessed the penalty based on the ub forms tuomey submitted to medicare for reimbursement.instead,tuomey asserts that the number of false claims should be limited to four medicare cost reports that it submitted 
tuomey provides no stark law case to support its argument.rather,it cites to fca cases where the ub forms themselves were not fraudulent,but were submitted as part of an ongoing fraudulent scheme.in those cases,the fraud was consummated only when the cost report was submitted.see united states ex rel.hockett healthcare,d,visiting nurse ass of brooklyn thompson,d.
but even those cases suggest that a ub form can constitute a discrete fraudulent claim under the fca when the government proves that the forms were,in fact,false or fraudulent.see hockett,d at visiting nurse ass n,d at.this occurs when the provider knowingly asks the government to pay amounts it does not owe.united states ex rel.clausen lab.of,cir.
here,each time tuomey submitted to medicare a ub form asking for reimbursement for a prohibited referral,it was knowingly asking the government to pay an amount that,by law,it could not pay.consequently,we find the district court did not err in finding that each ub form constituted a separate claim.
tuomey also challenges the district court measure of actual damages.it argues that the true measure is not the sum total of all claims the government paid as the court instructed the jury,but rather the difference if any between the true value of the services provided by tuomey and what the government actually paid.according to tuomey,since there was no evidence that the government did not get what it paid for,there were no actual damages under the fca.appellant br.at.here again,tuomey view of the law is incorrect.
the stark law prohibits the government from paying any amount of money for claims submitted in violation of the law.g.compliance with the stark law is a condition precedent to reimbursement of claims submitted to medicare.when tuomey failed to satisfy that condition,the government owed it nothing.united states rogan,cir.
the stark law expresses congress judgment that all services provided in violation of that law are medically unnecessary.by reimbursing tuomey for services that it was legally prohibited from paying,the government has suffered injury equivalent to the full amount of the payments.united states mackby mackby ii,cir finding that the fact that the defendant actually rendered the service billed did not negate the government injury,as d amages under the fca flow from the false statement.in this case,the damage from the false statement came from the payment to an entity that was not entitled to any payment at all.accordingly,we reject tuomey claim of error 
finally,tuomey argues that the district court award of,consisting of damages and a civil penalty,is unconstitutional under the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment and the due process clause of the fifth amendment.while the award is substantial,we can not say that it is unconstitutional.
the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment prohibits the government from imposing excessive fines as punishment.korangy fda,cir.civil fines serving remedial purposes do not fall within the reach of the eighth amendment.id.but where a civil sanction can only be explained as serving in part to punish,then the fine is subject to the eighth amendment.id.quoting austin united states.in such a case,the fine will be found constitutionally excessive only if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of the offense.id.alteration in original quoting united states bajakajian.we have said,however,that instances in which the penalty prescribed under the fca is unconstitutionally excessive will be infrequent.united states ex rel.bunk gosselin world wide moving,cir.
by contrast,the due process clause imposes substantive limits beyond which penalties may not go.txo prod.alliance res,internal quotation marks omitted fourteenth amendment case morgan woessner,cir finding that the supreme court analysis under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment applies equally under the fifth amendment,cited with approval in eeoc fed.express,cir.like the eighth amendment,the due process clause does not apply to compensatory damage awards.this is because compensatory damages redress the concrete loss the plaintiff has suffered by reason of the defendant wrongful conduct,and the assessment of the plaintiff injury is essentially a factual determination.cooper,at.on the other hand,punitive damages are essentially private fines intended to punish the defendant and to deter future wrongdoing.id.consequently,there must be procedural and substantive constitutional limitations on these awards.see state farm mut.auto ins.campbell.thus,the due process clause imposes limits on grossly excessive monetary penalties that go beyond what is necessary to vindicate the government legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence.bmw of,gore.
the fca imposes damages that are essentially punitive in nature.agency of natural res.united states ex rel.stevens.but the supreme court has also noted that the treble damages provision of the statute has a compensatory aspect,in that they account for the fact that some amount of money beyond actual damages is necessary to compensate the government completely for the costs,delays,and inconveniences occasioned by fraudulent claims.cook,united states ex rel.chandler.additionally,the provision allows the government to recover some measure of the amount it must pay to compensate relators in qui tam actions.see also d if the government proceeds with an action brought by a relator,the relator shall receive at least percent but not more than percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim.on the other hand,the civil penalty is completely punitive.united states mackby mackby i,cir.
the supreme court has instructed courts to consider three guideposts when reviewing punitive damages awards under the due process clause the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant misconduct the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award and the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.state farm,at.there is no reason to believe that the court approach to punitive damages under the fifth amendment would differ dramatically from analysis under the excessive fines clause.rogan,at.
the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct is p erhaps the most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award.gore,at.of course,in this case the damages and penalties assessed against tuomey are congressionally prescribed.a.as we have previously stated,the stark law expresses congress judgment of the reprehensibility of the conduct at issue by deeming services provided in violation of the law worthless.and t he fact that congress provided for treble damages and an automatic civil monetary penalty per false claim shows that congress believed that making a false claim to the government is a serious offense.mackby ii,at rogan,o ne would think that a fine expressly authorized by statute could be higher than a penalty selected ad hoc by a jury.
in addition,the supreme court has directed courts to evaluate the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct by considering whether 
the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic the tortious conduct evinced an indifference or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident and the harm was the result of intentional malice,trickery,or deceit,or mere accident.
state farm,at.while tuomey conduct in this case does not implicate the first three factors,we think the last two are relevant here.see saunders branch banking trust of,cir finding that even the presence of a single state farm factor can provide justification for a substantial award of punitive damages.
clearly,tuomey conduct involved repeated actions,state farm,at,as it submitted false claims.thus,while the penalty is certainly severe,it is meant to reflect the sheer breadth of the fraud tuomey perpetrated upon the federal government.bunk,at explaining that the court was comfortable assessing high civil penalties in fca actions involving a large number of claims.as we have said,w hen an enormous public undertaking spawns a fraud of comparable breadth high penalties help to ensure what we reiterate is the primary purpose of the fca making the government completely whole.id.substantial penalties also serve as a powerful mechanism to dissuade such a massive course of fraudulent conduct.see id.at.and the government has a strong interest in preventing fraud because f raudulent claims make the administration of medicare more difficult,and widespread fraud would undermine public confidence in the system.mackby ii,at.
nor were tuomey actions in this case the result of a mere accident.state farm,at.rather,the jury determined that tuomey submitted false claims for medicare reimbursement knowingly,that is,with actual knowledge,in deliberate ignorance,or with reckless disregard that the claims violated the stark law.under the circumstances,we agree with the government that strong medicine is required to cure the defendant disrespect for the law.gore,at.
next,we consider the disparity between actual harm and the punitive damages award.specifically,we compare the actual damages assessed against tuomey to the civil penalty and the portion of treble damages that can be considered punitive.here,we can properly regard the entire civil penalty,as punitive.on the other hand,the actual damages of are entirely compensatory.as discussed above,the additional sum of resulting from the trebling of actual damages is a hybrid of compensatory and punitive damages.
although the supreme court has not told us where to draw the line,see chandler,at,we may safely assume that the portion of the trebled award allocated to the relator is compensatory.see id.assuming further that drakeford receives the minimum amount allotted by the is fifteen percent of the total relator would be entitled to of the trebled award,leaving to be allocated to punitive damages.by this calculation,the portion of damages that is compensatory is and the balance is punitive.
while the court has been reluctant to fix a ratio that punitive damages can not exceed for purposes of the due process clause,it has suggested that an award of more than four times the amount of compensatory damages might be close to the line of constitutional impropriety.state farm,at.here,the ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages is approximately to,which falls just under the ratio the court deems constitutionally suspect we therefore conclude that the damages award is constitutional under the fifth and eighth amendments.
finally,we do not discount the concerns raised by our concurring colleague regarding the result in this case.but having no found no cause to upset the jury verdict in this case and no constitutional error,it is for congress to consider whether changes to the stark law reach are in order.
because tuomey opened the door to the admission of kevin mcananey testimony by asserting an advice of counsel defense,and because i can not say,based on the record before me,that no rational jury could have determined that tuomey violated both the stark law and the false claims act,i concur in the outcome today.
but i write separately to emphasize the troubling picture this case paints an impenetrably complex set of laws and regulations that will result in a likely death sentence for a community hospital in an already medically underserved area.
regarding the issue of whether the district court correctly granted a new trial,we review such a decision for abuse of discretion.cline wal mart stores,cir.similarly,we review a trial court rulings on the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion,and we will overturn such a ruling only if it is arbitrary and irrational.united states cole,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.
judge perry,who presided over the first trial,excluded mcananey testimony pursuant to evidence rule,which can be used to exclude evidence of settlement negotiations.under rule,conduct or a statement made during compromise negotiations about a disputed claim is generally inadmissible when used to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a disputed claim.a.
it is unclear to me that the district court abused its discretion in determining that mcananey testimony could be excluded under rule.in his deposition testimony,mcananey described himself as a tie breaker who was jointly hired by drakeford and tuomey when they could not agree about whether the contracts violated the stark a disputed claim.tuomey and drakeford dispute about the legality of the contracts reached impasse and ended in drakeford acting as a relator of this qui tam action only three months later.had drakeford and tuomey been able to reach an agreement,drakeford presumably would not have filed this suit,in which the government,having intervened,now stands in drakeford shoes.
rule exclusionary provision applies where a dispute or a difference of opinion exists,not just when discussions crystallize to the point of threatened litigation.affiliated,aluminum of,cir.when viewed thusly,it is hard to say that judge perry acted either arbitrarily or irrationally in deeming mcananey testimony excludable.
crucially,however,evidence subject to exclusion under rule is so excludable only if the evidence is offered to prove either liability for or invalidity of a claim or its amount otherwise,it may come in.bituminous,rucker enterprises,cir emphasis added.b the court may admit this evidence for another purpose.stated differently,s ince the rule excludes only when the purpose is proving the validity or invalidity of the claim or its amount,an offer for another purpose is not within the rule.weinstein fed.evid.quotation marks and citation omitted.therefore,if the mcananey evidence was admissible for a purpose beyond the validity or amount of a disputed claim,rule would provide no basis for barring it wholesale from the first trial.
the government argues,among other things,that the mcananey evidence went to the heart of an issue wholly beyond the scope of rule limited exclusionary,tuomey advice of counsel defense.with this,i must agree.
as explained by a district court in this circuit in the context of a false claims act fraud claim,good faith reliance on the advice of counsel may contradict any suggestion that a defendant knowingly submitted a false claim.united states newport news shipbuilding,d.i f a defendant seeks the advice of counsel in good faith,provides full and accurate information,receives advice which can be reasonably relied upon,and,in turn,faithfully follows that advice,it can not be said that the defendant knowingly submitted false information or acted with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of its falsity,even if that advice turns out in fact to be false.id.see also,united states butler,cir identifying the elements of the advice of counsel defense as a full disclosure of all pertinent facts to a lawyer,and b good faith reliance on the lawyer advice.
when a party raises an advice of counsel defense,however,all advice on the pertinent topic becomes fair game.it has become established that if a party interjects the advice of counsel as an essential element of a claim or defense,then all advice received concerning the same subject matter is discoverable,not subject to protection by the privilege,and,by logical extension,admissible at trial.mccormick on evid.ed.see also,in re echostar commc ns,once a party announces that it will rely on advice of counsel the privilege is waived.the widely applied standard for determining the scope is that the waiver applies to all other communications relating to the same subject matter thus,when echostar chose to rely on the advice of counsel,it waived the privilege with regard to any communications relating to the same subject matter,including communications with counsel other than counsel,which would include the advice of outside counsel.quotation marks and citation omitted.
here,there can be no doubt that tuomey pressed an advice of counsel defense.tuomey argued to the first jury,for example,that t he lawyers were the ones running the show all tuomey did was accept their recommendations and vote on them if they thought that it was something that would be good for the hospital.advice of counsel is a very,very good defense.it is one that the law recognizes,and it is one that fits perfectly in this situation.trial i,transcript for,at.
further,the district court instructed the jury on the advice of counsel defense,making clear that it provided a vehicle for absolving tuomey of false claims act liability.the court instructed,among other things,that the defendant has asserted an affirmative defense of advice of counsel to the united states allegation that it acted in violation of the false claims act.an affirmative defense is an argument that,if true,will defeat the government claim.trial i,transcript for,at.regarding what tuomey needed to show to succeed with that defense,judge perry instructed that in order for the defendant to prevail on its affirmative defense of advice of counsel,tuomey must prove the following one,that the advice was sought in good faith two,that tuomey provided full and accurate information to the attorney three,the advice could be reasonably relied upon and,four,tuomey faithfully followed the attorney advice.id.
having put the advice it got from its lawyers squarely at issue,tuomey should not have been permitted to which advice of counsel the jury was permitted to hear.instead,the jury should have been allowed to consider all the advice of all tuomey mcananey.
the record makes clear that,whatever else mcananey assessment was,it was also advice of counsel.mcananey engagement letter to tuomey and drakeford,who had hired him jointly,stated that mcananey,a lawyer,had been retained to review and advise the parties with respect to a proposed business relationship.j.mcananey committed to being guided by the parties instructions in carrying out the representation and reporting to the parties his conclusions and any potential compliance issues.id.in other words,mcananey was tuomey counsel,and he advised tuomey about the contracts at the heart of this case.
the record makes similarly clear that tuomey did not follow mcananey advice.mcananey advised tuomey that the proposed contracts raised significant red flags under the stark law.mcananey advised that tuomey would have difficulty persuading the government that the contracts did not compensate the physicians in excess of fair market value.and mcananey warned tuomey that the contracts presented an easy case to prosecute for the government.rather than heed this advice and back away from the contracts,however,tuomey told mcananey not to put his conclusions in writing and ended his engagement.
allowing mcananey testimony into evidence to show the advice he gave in light of tuomey advice of counsel defense would have been outside of rule limited exclusionary ambit.in other words,by pressing an advice of counsel defense,tuomey itself opened the door for mcananey testimony to come in,even if it otherwise might have been excludable under rule.see.b.despite this,the district court barred mcananey testimony wholesale.
in keeping mcananey out of the first trial,the district co
