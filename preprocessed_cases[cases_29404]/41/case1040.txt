seizing on a few vague statements from management,the plaintiffs try to turn bad corporate news into a securities class action.
because the private securities litigation reform act pslra forbids such alchemy,we generally affirm the district court dismissal,although we reverse its disposition regarding the claims brought under the securities act of.
background 
general information 
defendant omnicare,is the nation largest provider of pharmaceutical care for the elderly,handling medication distribution for nearly million patients across most states and in canada.reflecting the size of its operations,omnicare pharmacy services generated billion in net sales in alone 
the plaintiff class plaintiffs consists of omnicare investors who purchased securities between august,and july.the laborers council was selected as lead plaintiff under the pslra.see a b,a b.it purchased omnicare securities throughout december and january,and sold all of them at the end of january.
also implicated in this case are several individual defendants.three of these defendants are officers of omnicare ceo,president,and director joel gemunder,cfo and senior vice president david froesel,and secretary and senior vice president cheryl hodges.the remaining individual defendants are board members chairman edward hutton and director sandra laney.
plaintiffs allege that the defendants committed fraud in violation of b of the securities and exchange act of,as well as rule.plaintiffs also allege liability for gemunder,froesel,and hodges under a,a,and liability for all defendants under of the securities act of sa.
the parties pull four sets of b fraud claims out of plaintiffs sprawling and repetitive first amended consolidated complaint.briefly,these claims concern misleading statements or omissions relating to medicare part d preparedness,a contract dispute with united health group uhg,violations of generally accepted accounting principles gaap,and the legality of omnicare alleged drug recycling program and drug substitution program.the claim under also relates to the alleged gaap violations.we summarize each set of claims in turn.
medicare part d preparedness 
in,the medicare prescription drug,improvement and modernization act created medicare part d,a voluntary prescription drug benefit program for seniors.under this program,private entities typically insurance providers contract with the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms,a division of the department of health,to offer approved prescription drug plans pdp.pharmacies such as omnicare contract with the pdp providers to supply the enrollees with the required prescription drugs.the pdp providers are compensated through a combination of enrollee premiums and reimbursement for the drugs provided at an mark up from the cms.
in late,omnicare was preparing for the industry transition to medicare part d on january.plaintiffs aver that omnicare,on two separate dates,misled the public about its readiness for this transition on several occasions.
first,in an august,press release,gemunder stated 
there are still many specifics yet to be determined through guidance by cms,as well as the approval of specific pdps by cms all things considered,we see nothing materially adverse about the regulations at this time and believe we are to add value under the new medicare part d benefit.we will monitor developments and continue to ready our company as the year progresses.
during a conference call on the same day,gemunder elaborated 
we have been extremely busy in the last couple of months,working with potential pdp to familiarize them about the specialized services required and the nuances of providing pharmacy services to care residents and negotiating agreements for our participation in their pharmacy networks to serve the care market w e pretty confident that we not going to be hurt by moving into the part d structure,where we are now.
second,plaintiffs allege that gemunder made further misleading statements on november.in a press release,gemunder stated 
we remain highly focused on the upcoming implementation of the medicare drug benefit.while bringing about sweeping change in our industry,we believe we are to add value under the new medicare part d benefit as the enrollment process begins,we are busy educating our care facility clients and their residents on the availability and implementation of the new drug benefit 
gemunder reiterated these points in a conference call that same day 
so we have been focused this quarter on training and on educating our employees,and seeing to the operational issues,related to the implementation of the new drug benefit.and with the enrollment period beginning november,we have also been heavily been sic engaged in educating our care facility clients and their residents,on the availability of the new benefit,as well as working with them on the implementation process 
plaintiffs complain that these statements,and others,were misleading because omnicare failed to sufficiently monitor developments including performance of a crosscheck of their databases against a national database and neglected to properly educate the suppliers on pharmacy care practices.the result was a rocky transition to part d,costing approximately million in overtime and related expenses.
uhg contract dispute 
next,plaintiffs assert that omnicare positive earnings growth predictions were misleading in light of an undisclosed contract dispute with uhg,a major pdp sponsor.on february,gemunder commented on the results by stating that as we enter our year as a public company,omnicare revenue and earnings growth outlook remains positive given our strong underlying fundamentals and our proven growth strategy.in an april,statement regarding omnicare first quarter results,gemunder repeated that omnicare revenue and earnings growth outlook remains positive given our strong underlying fundamentals and our proven growth strategy.
plaintiffs argue that these statements were false and misleading because gemunder did not disclose a developing dispute with uhg.uhg,a supplier responsible for about a third of omnicare part d business,had recently completed a merger with pacificare health services.pacificare also had a contract with omnicare,but it was less profitable.some time in february,uhg informed omnicare that,as a result of the merger,it would be withdrawing from its original contract and switching to the less favorable pacificare agreement.this change reduced omnicare profits for the second quarter of 
plaintiffs claim that gemunder growth predictions were misleading absent a disclosure of this development.the contract dispute was not revealed until may,when omnicare filed suit against uhg in response to the filing,omnicare stock dropped from to.
gaap violations 
from the second quarter of,to the first quarter of,omnicare reported large,sometimes record,revenues.commenting on the second quarter revenues,gemunder stated that o ur sales once again hit record highs,and our operating margins improved on a sequential basis,reflecting the growing benefits of our cost reduction and productivity enhancement initiatives.hodges added that revenue per patient was up over prior years.similar sentiments were expressed in relation to later quarters and filings certified by gemunder and froesel also reflected this revenue growth.
plaintiffs allege that these statements were misleading because omnicare revenue numbers for and early were inflated by with gaap.they allege improper revenue recognition,overvaluation and improper recognition of receivables,overvaluation of inventories,and the failure to establish,in a timely manner,litigation settlement reserves with respect to several government investigations discussed below.
false assurances of legal compliance 
finally,plaintiffs accuse omnicare of falsely claiming that the company complied with the law when it was involved in two illegal practices improper drug recycling and improper drug substitution.as to the former allegations,plaintiffs say that omnicare was repackaging and reshipping drugs with varying expiration dates,including some expired drugs.the latter allegation relates to a scheme to replace cheaper doses of certain medicines with more expensive doses,capsules for tablets in order to increase revenue 
in light of these practices,plaintiffs allege that omnicare made materially misleading statements on a number of occasions when it assured the public that it was complying with the law.for example,a november,a press release explained that omnicare policy is to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations.to the best of our knowledge,our purchases of pharmaceuticals comply with all applicable laws and regulations and are consistent with omnicare goal of providing appropriate pharmaceutical care for the seniors we serve.similar statements were allegedly made in january and february.
in january,several government raids were conducted on omnicare facilities.by late,two settlements had resulted.the first involved one of omnicare michigan subsidiaries,specialized pharmacy,whose president was charged with fraud.this case was settled for million.the second settlement was with the attorney generals of states and involved omnicare alleged substitution of dosage forms on several generic drugs,tablets with capsules.this settlement obligated omnicare to pay million.
district court ruling 
finding the facc insufficient,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss.the court began with the b and rule claims,dismissing the part d statements and the gaap violations for a failure to plead loss causation.turning to the statements regarding legal compliance,the court noted that loss causation might also be lacking,but dismissed the action on other grounds.first,it held that any statements concerning legality of a company actions were soft statements,for which disclosure was not required.second,the court discounted the value of the confidential witness testimony in the complaint and held that no strong inference of scienter existed.
with respect to the uhg contract dispute,the court found that the laborers council,the lead plaintiff,had sold its securities before the relevant disclosure and therefore lacked standing.the district court also denied a motion to intervene by alaska electrical pension fund a party ostensibly possessing standing,holding that a further amendment was barred by the pslra and,alternatively,concluding that any intervention was futile in light of the lack of scienter.
next,the district court dismissed plaintiff action.in a footnote,the court explained the section claim,which also sounds in fraud and is based on the alleged accounting violations,fails on the same grounds,failure to allege loss causation.
having dismissed all claims of primary securities violations,the court rejected application of liability under.

iii.analysis 
securities and exchange act claims b and rule 
section b of securities and exchange act and rule prohibit fraudulent,material misstatements in connection with the sale or purchase of a security.zaluski,at quoting pr diamonds,chandler,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a private right of action for violations exists where a plaintiff can demonstrate the following elements a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission economic loss and loss causation.stoneridge inv.partners,llc,d see also brown earthboard sports usa,cir.
because b claims sound in fraud,the pleading strictures of federal rule of civil procedure b apply.frank dana,cir.thus,the complaint must specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent,identify the speaker,state where and when the statements were made,and explain why the statements were fraudulent.id.at quoting gupta terra nitrogen,d.
bolstering this rule of specificity,the pslra imposes further pleading requirements.id.citing tellabs,makor issues rights,d.first,the complaint must specify each statement alleged to have been misleading along with the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading.b.second,plaintiffs must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.see frank,at.
uhg dispute 
in order to recover under b and rule,a plaintiff must show both an omission or misstatement and its materiality.zaluski,at.materiality can be established by proof of a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.id.quoting basic levinson,d.when a company chooses to speak,it must provide complete and information.rubin schottenstein,zox dunn,cir.however,liability does not attach to mere corporate puffery or statements of corporate optimism.in re ford motor.sec,cir.further,a excuses liability for defendants projections,statements of plans and objectives,and estimates of future economic performance.helwig vencor,cir en banc citing i.this protection is overcome only if the statement was material if defendants had actual knowledge that it was false or misleading and if the statement was not identified as or lacked meaningful cautionary statements.id.at citing c.
with regard to the uhg dispute,plaintiffs do not explain why,as a general matter,omnicare had a duty to disclose its contractual dispute with uhg any earlier than it did.rather,plaintiffs focus on a statement made by gemunder on two occasions omnicare revenue and earnings growth outlook remains positive given our strong underlying fundamentals and our proven growth strategy.according to plaintiffs,this predictive statement was misleading absent disclosure of the contract dispute.
the problem with this argument,however,is that gemunder comments are statements entitled to protection.indeed,not only does the statement itself call attention to its predictive character growth outlook but even the complaint identifies it as a positive outlook on future revenue.further,to the extent that the reference to the outlook remaining positive implies some present circumstances,that is not enough to take this statement out of the safe harbor.see miller champion enterprises,cir relying on i d and finding reference to use of term continuation in phrase continuation of outstanding earnings growth did not transform an otherwise prediction into an unprotected mixed statement.
even putting that exception aside,gemunder statements can not be deemed material.courts have consistently found immaterial a certain kind of rosy affirmation commonly heard from corporate managers and numbingly familiar to the optimistic statements that are so vague,so lacking in specificity,or so clearly constituting the opinions of the speaker,that no reasonable investor could find them important in re ford motor.sec,class action,cir quoting shaw digital equip,cir.gemunder comments fall squarely within this realm of corporate puffery,as they do nothing more than vaguely predict positive future results,a claim so banal and ubiquitous that it can not engender reliance by reasonable investors.see san leandro emergency med.group profit sharing plan philip morris,cir statements of optimism about earnings and claim predicting income growth consistent with historically superior performance were puffery.
therefore,we find that the complaint fails to allege a material misstatement or omission 
part d implementation 
plaintiffs allege that gemunder statements and predictions concerning omnicare transition to part d were misleading in light of omnicare allegedly insufficient and untimely t
