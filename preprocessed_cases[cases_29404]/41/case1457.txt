protestant memorial medical center,doing business as memorial hospital memorial,brought this action against barry maram,the director of the illinois department of public aid now known as the illinois department of healthcare and family services department and a federal agency,the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms.the complaint alleged that the defendants had violated the constitution of the united states and the medicaid statutes,et,when they approved and implemented a amendment to the state of illinois medicaid plan.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
memorial is a hospital located in belleville,illinois.it is licensed to provide health care services,including services to medicare and medicaid patients.the medicaid program is a program jointly funded by the states and the federal government.it provides medical assistance to individuals and families whose resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.see et.to qualify for federal matching funds,a state must submit to the secretary of health and human services secretary a plan that describes the nature and scope of the state medicaid program.see id.a.if a state plan satisfies the requirements of the federal statute and regulations,the secretary shall approve the state plan.see id.b.the secretary has delegated his authority to approve state medicaid plans to the regional administrators of cms,but has retained the final authority to disapprove a state plan.see b c.
in the late and early,states began to take advantage of a loophole in the medicaid program that allowed states to gain extra federal matching funds without spending more state money.states desiring to avail themselves of this statutory loophole would make payments to hospitals and collect the federal matching funds.the state would then recoup a portion of the state funding from the hospital,often in the form of a tax.see generally ashley county med.ctr.thompson,d,noting that t he result of this was that the state could draw additional federal matching funds without having to contribute additional state money.
congress addressed this problem in the medicaid voluntary contribution and tax amendments of,stat.codified at w.through this legislation,congress instructed the secretary to reduce federal matching funds to a state by the amount of any revenue received from a health care related tax that hold s harmless the health care provider upon whom the tax falls.w a iii.states still may fund their share of medicaid expenses by assessing taxes on health care related items,services or providers,as long as the tax is uniform,and the tax contains no hold harmless provision.see id.w a ii iii.
a health care related tax is either a tax that treats providers or purchasers of health care items or services differently from other individuals on whom the tax falls,or it is a tax in which at least percent of the tax burden falls on those who provide or purchase health care items or services.see w a.a health care related tax contains a hold harmless provision when it provides some sort of payment to the taxpayer that is tied to the amount of the health related tax paid.see id.w.one way a health care related tax will include a hold harmless provision is if the tax provides a direct payment to the taxpayer based on either the amount of the tax paid or the difference between the amount of the tax paid and the amount the taxpayer receives as payments under the state medicaid plan.see id.w a.a health care related tax also will include a hold harmless provision if payments that the taxpayer receives under the state medicaid program are tied to the total health care related tax paid.see id.w b.lastly,if the state promises to hold the taxpayer harmless for a portion of the cost of the tax through a direct payment or exemption from the tax,that promise also constitutes a hold harmless provision.see id.w c.
on february,the illinois general assembly approved legislation that amended the state medicaid program to impose a tax on health care providers.under this legislation,hospitals were charged a tax equal to the product of times the hospital occupied bed days,the total number of days each hospital bed was occupied by a patient during calendar year.see ilcs,a west.another part of this legislation provided adjustments to payments from illinois to certain hospitals.see ilcs west.these adjustments provided payments to the hospitals above the basic rate for inpatient hospital services,including a medicaid inpatient utilization rate adjustment.see id.these payments were to be funded through the new tax imposed by the legislation.
on february,the department submitted for approval to cms a proposed amendment to its state medicaid plan plan amendment.the object of the amendment was to permit illinois to receive matching federal funds for the increased payments to certain hospitals anticipated by the legislation.the department argued that the payments did not constitute a hold harmless provision for the new occupied bed days tax under the medicaid statutes.the net effect of the legislation and the plan amendment would be to permit illinois to collect the new tax imposed by the legislation while receiving full federal matching funds for its own increased payments.by its terms,the plan amendment would expire on june.
cms approved the plan amendment on december,to cover retroactively the period from may,until june.under this plan,memorial would receive payment of million,which exceeds the amount of tax it paid to the state of illinois by.all payments under the plan amendment were distributed by april.as noted earlier,the plan amendment expired by its own terms on june.
district court proceedings 
on january,memorial filed this action against cms and barry maram,director of the department director it sought to block implementation of the plan amendment.the second amended complaint,the operative pleading,alleges a number of claims.memorial asserts that the plan amendment violates the hold harmless prohibitions of and f because the payments made to hospitals are correlated positively to the amount of tax paid by the hospitals.see at.memorial further asserts that the plan amendment provides payments to hospitals to pay for services to patients,in violation of and payments to hospitals in excess of their medicaid costs plus uninsured costs,in violation of and some medicaid hospitals higher payments than hospitals,in violation of a a,and sections and of the social security act id.at.memorial further alleges violations of its rights to substantive due process,procedural due process and equal protection.id.at.memorial also claims that the department and cms had violated memorial eleventh amendment rights by failing to follow applicable federal statutes and regulations when the plan amendments were submitted and approved finally,memorial alleges a violation of against both cms and the director.id.at.

cms,the director and the moved to dismiss memorial complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and,in the alternative,failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.at.the district court first addressed the defendants claim that memorial lacked subject matter jurisdiction.the district court first focused on the mootness doctrine.it noted that the relief requested by memorial in its complaint included an order declaring that the plan amendment is invalid and void,an order declaring that cms approval of the plan amendment is invalid and void,and an injunction preventing the director from making payments pursuant to the plan amendment.id.at.the district court concluded that these requests are moot
