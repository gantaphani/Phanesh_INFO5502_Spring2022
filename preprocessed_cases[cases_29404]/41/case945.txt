facts and proceedings 
background 
from july of until october of,richardson worked in the customer service department of monitronics,a monitoring company for residential and commercial alarm systems.this is the second fmla suit that richardson has filed against monitronics.
b.the first suit 
in january,richardson physician diagnosed her as suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome.she applied for fmla leave,but monitronics denied her request because she had not yet worked for monitronics for one year,which is necessary for an employee to be entitled to fmla leave.consequently,richardson took a paid leave under monitronics occupational injury program.in addition to her leave under that program,richardson accumulated absences and tardies during the first four months of.as a result of her attendance record,monitronics suspended richardson and issued her a warning for her attendance problems.
in april,richardson successfully applied for and was granted fmla leave.during her absence,monitronics implemented a new software program.when richardson returned from leave,monitronics restored her to the same job title,rate of pay,and position that she had when she took leave.monitronics,however,prohibited richardson from working overtime on weekends until she was trained on the new software program.once richardson completed the training,monitronics permitted her to work overtime.
in september,richardson sued monitronics for violating her rights under the fmla.specifically,richardson alleged that monitronics unlawfully denied her fmla leave from january to march and unlawfully disciplined her for absences incurred during that period,and monitronics restricted her ability to work overtime in retaliation for taking fmla leave.the district court found no violation of richardson fmla rights,and we affirmed.
chronological background underlying the present suit 
april oral warning 
richardson continued to have attendance problems in addition to those at issue in her first lawsuit.in april alone,richardson incurred four absences and five tardies.as a result,her supervisor,demekia green,issued richardson an oral warning.
the new monitronics time and attendance policy 
in may,monitronics instituted a new policy embodying a rolling period to evaluate employee attendance.under this policy,one absence or two tardies constitutes an occurrence.the policy specifies that arriving late,leaving early,exceeding a scheduled break,and violating the dress code count as tardies.if,in any period,an employee incurs an occurrence,monitronics issues an oral warning two occurrences result in a written warning three occurrences warrant a final warning and four occurrences are cause for termination.the policy expressly states that employees may not leave work early without a supervisor approval,and that employees must request supervisory approval to be absent from work at least hours in advance.fmla leave is not considered an occurrence for the purposes of the attendance policy.
may written warning 
early in may,richardson incurred four tardies may leaving early,may leaving early,may exceeding her scheduled break,and may away from her desk for an unacceptable period of time.this earned her two occurrences under the policy.green issued a written warning to richardson.
richardson request for fmla leave 
on may,richardson completed paperwork requesting intermittent fmla leave because of her carpal tunnel syndrome.she did not,however,specify the dates on which she would need leave.monitronics human resources manager,regina sconyers,nevertheless approved richardson request.
summer final warning 
from the end of may to august,richardson was tardy five times may,june,june,june,and august.she contested the may,june,and june tardies as by her lead,dora duran.richardson provided calendar for her june tardy was.as the calendar shows that pam left per,monitronics removed that tardy from her record.the calendar did not include the same notation for the other disputed date in june,however,and richardson presented nothing else to substantiate her claim that duran had approved the other disputed tardies.accordingly,monitronics did not remove those tardies from richardson attendance record.in the end,richardson record reflected that she was tardy four times.richardson thus accrued two more occurrences over the summer,bringing her total number of occurrences under the policy to four.green issued richardson a final warning,which stated that a repeat violation would result in immediate termination.
october termination 
on october,richardson incurred her final infraction.that day,monitronics sponsored a workshop.the details on the informational flyer recommended clothing for the workshop,so richardson wore a polo shirt to the session.she returned to her shift after the workshop without changing her clothes.as polo shirts are expressly prohibited under the monitronics dress code,richardson was sent home.by this time,richardson had accrued four and a half occurrences.monitronics suspended richardson for three days to determine the appropriate course of action with regard to her continued employment with the company.when richardson suspension ended,monitronics fired her.
d.the present lawsuit 
after her termination,richardson sued monitronics alleging that she was fired in retaliation for her first fmla lawsuit.monitronics filed a motion for summary judgment to have the suit dismissed,assuming for the sake of argument that richardson had established a prima facie case of retaliation under the fmla,and the court,employing the traditional framework,granted monitronics motion on the ground that richardson failed to present sufficient evidence to rebut monitronics assertion that it fired her for attendance policy violations.on appeal,richardson contends that the district court should have applied the modified known as the her case.she argues that,even though retaliation was not the sole reason for her termination,it was a motivating factor in it.richardson further contends that,under the framework,monitronics is not entitled to summary judgment.we have appellate jurisdiction under.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of monitronics de novo we will affirm the district court if there is no genuine issue of material fact,and monitronics is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law we consider the evidence in a light most favorable to richardson,the,but she must point to evidence showing that there is a genuine fact issue for trial 
b.the fmla 
the fmla prohibits employers from interfer ing with,restrain ing,or deny ing the exercise or the attempt to exercise,any right provided under the act concomitantly,the fmla prohibits employers from discharg ing or in any other manner discriminat ing against an individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by the act to make a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge,the employee must show that she engaged in a protected activity,the employer discharged her,and there is a causal link between the protected activity and the discharge 
when there is no direct evidence of discriminatory intent,we have typically relied on the familiar burden shifting framework to determine whether an employer discharged an employee in retaliation for participating in activities specifically,once the employee establishes a prima facie case of retaliation,the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action if the employer succeeds in doing so,the burden shifts back to the employee to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer articulated reason is a pretext for discrimination here,the district court granted monitronics motion for summary judgment under the traditional framework,concluding that richardson failed to
