backgrounda.section proceedings 
in july,a grand jury sitting in the northern district of illinois returned a indictment charging tony lapi with bank robbery.see a.on august,defense counsel filed a motion requesting an expert evaluation for the purpose of determining whether lapi was competent to stand trial.the district court granted this motion and,pursuant to a,remanded lapi to the custody of the attorney general of the united states for a competency evaluation.lapi subsequently was transferred to the fmc in rochester,minnesota.
after a commitment,lapi treating psychiatrist at the fmc,kelly ball,expressed the opinion that lapi was suffering from schizoaffective disorder,a severe and chronic psychotic illness that requires psychiatric intervention,and that,as a result,he was unfit to proceed with the adjudication process.at summarizing ball findings.on the basis of ball evaluation,the district court found lapi mentally incompetent to stand trial under d.he was civilly committed to the fmc for a period not to exceed four months.see see also d mandating that,upon finding a defendant incompetent,he should be hospitalized by the attorney general for such a reasonable period of time,not to exceed four months,as is necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that in the foreseeable future he will attain the capacity to permit the trial to proceed.at the end of this period,ball recommended a extension of lapi commitment,opining that,with further treatment,there is a substantial probability in the foreseeable future that lapi could attain the capacity to proceed with this case.at summarizing ball recommendation.the illinois district court granted this request on march.see see also d permitting hospitalization for an additional reasonable period of time if the court finds that there is a substantial probability that within such additional period of time he will attain the capacity to permit the trial to proceed.
at the end of the additional period,ball confirmed her earlier diagnosis that lapi suffered from schizoaffective disorder and expressed the opinion that there was not a substantial probability that lapi would be restored to competency in the foreseeable future.the district court therefore ordered that lapi should remain in the custody of the attorney general of the united states pending resolution of proceedings under in the district court of minnesota.see at see also id.d providing that,upon a finding of,a defendant becomes subject to the provisions of section.
section and related proceedings 
section requires that,upon the expiration of a defendant commitment under,the director of the facility in which the defendant is hospitalized shall file a certificate of mental disease or defect and dangerousness with the district court in the district in which the person is confined if the following two requirements are met 
a the defendant is presently suffering from a mental disease or defect as a result of which his release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another,and b suitable arrangements for state custody and care of the person are not available.
id.a.upon the filing of this certificate,the statute provides that the court shall order a hearing to assess the defendant dangerousness.id.
on july,believing lapi to be suffering from a mental disease that created a substantial risk of bodily injury or property damage and not yet having found suitable arrangements for state custody,the fmc warden filed a certificate of mental disease or defect and dangerousness in the district court for the district of minnesota,the district in which lapi was confined at that time.id.this petition,however,was withdrawn by the government when lapi was accepted for placement at the elgin mental health center in his home state of illinois.he was transferred to this facility in october.the elgin mental health center,however,released lapi after approximately thirty days,having determined that he no longer required hospitalization.he was transferred to a group living facility and then to a nursing home.
in may,the government filed a motion in the northern district of illinois requesting a second competency evaluation.the district court denied this motion on september,holding that it did not have the statutory authority to reassess lapi competency to stand trial however,the district court ordered lapi,who it classified as a fugitive because he was released without any bond ever being set,to appear in court.at.upon appearing,the district court committed lapi to the custody of the united states marshal service he was released on a recognizance bond.
on february,the government filed a motion to dismiss lapi indictment.on march,the defense also filed a motion to dismiss.the district court denied the defendant motion,but has yet to address the motion to dismiss filed by the government 
on may,in the absence of a motion by the government or the defendant,the illinois district court ordered that a hearing be held to determine whether lapi posed a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another.a.it held that the district court for the district of minnesota erred in failing to hold a hearing once the fmc warden filed a certificate of dangerousness with that court 
in the instant case,a certificate of mental disease or defect and dangerousness was filed in the united states district court for the district of minnesota a hearing was required to determine whether lapi was then suffering from a mental disease or defect c ontrary to the requirements of section a,a hearing was not held to determine whether lapi was then suffering from a mental disease instead,he was transferred to a facility in elgin,illinois and lapi was released to that facility.however,section does not provide for the release of the defendant after the certificate has been filed until a hearing is held and it is determined if the defendant release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another or serious damage to the property of another.
in october,although the hearing had neither been scheduled nor conducted,the illinois district court entered a finding of dangerousness and ordered that lapi be taken into the custody of the attorney general.lapi subsequently was arrested and detained 
lapi appealed his detention to this court and filed an emergency motion for release in a criminal
