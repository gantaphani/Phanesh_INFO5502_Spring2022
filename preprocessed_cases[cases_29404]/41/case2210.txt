order and amended dissent 
the opinion issued on november,is amended by inserting the following after the first paragraph of judge dissent on page,wl 
subsequent to our decision in this case,the government petitioned for rehearing en banc,arguing that the rule is invalid because it is contrary to both statute and supreme court precedent.vasquez did not respond to the government arguments in detail,and so i do not opine whether the government is right.however,the case appears strong.the government asserts that under the social security act,the a federal the factfinder.see g findings of commissioner are conclusive so long as substantial evidence supports them.while the statute prohibits a claimant testimony concerning pain or other symptoms alone from establishing a disability,this appears to be exactly what the rule would require.d a an individual statement as to pain or other symptoms shall not alone be conclusive evidence of disability as defined in this section there must be medical signs and findings which show the existence of a medical impairment which could reasonably be expected to produce the pain or other symptoms alleged and which,when considered with all evidence would lead to a conclusion that the individual is under a disability.emphasis added.the government notes that the general rule subject to rare exceptions is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.ins ventura,d per curiam.we do not in only rare cases according to the government,we took some factfinding responsibility away from the commissioner in at least cases during and.
the government finally notes that other circuits will remand for determination of benefits only in narrow circumstances.see,faucher sec y of health human,cir if a court determines that substantial evidence does not support the secretary decision,the court can reverse the decision and immediately award benefits only if all essential factual issues have been resolved and the record adequately establishes a plaintiff entitlement to benefits.see also miller chater,cir remanding for a fifth administrative hearing,but warning that the secretary is not entitled to adjudicate a case ad infinitum until he correctly applies the proper legal standard and gathers evidence to support his conclusion internal quotation marks omitted.if,as the government argues,is a de facto finding of disability,then our circuit precedent is badly misaligned with that of other circuits.
of course,because the rule is part of our circuit law,only an en banc court can change it.although no judge has chosen to call for en banc rehearing in this case,i am hopeful that the en banc court will consider the argument when it is presented more directly in another case,one where there is an explicit remand for immediate payment of benefits based on the rule.because the rule applies in every case where a court finds no substantial evidence to support the commissioner decision,the issue is of exceptional importance.this is particularly so because the social security hearing system is probably the largest adjudicative agency in the western world.heckler campbell,d noting that million claims for disability benefits were filed in.

priscilla vasquez vasquez appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment for the commissioner of social security the commissioner upholding a denial of disability insurance benefits under et and supplemental security income benefits under et.vasquez claims that the commissioner improperly discounted her symptom reporting,failed to consider evidence of her severe mental impairment,and improperly applied principles of res judicata.
we vacate the district court judgment and remand to the commissioner for a hearing on the issue of whether vasquez is entitled to benefits.
factual background 
vasquez applied for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income benefits in september,alleging an inability to work since october because of low back pain and other musculoskeletal impairments.the application was denied initially and again on reconsideration.at the initial hearing,administrative law judge alj richard stacy alj stacy also found that vasquez was not disabled and denied her application.the decision of alj stacy discussed vasquez back injuries and limited education,but did not discuss whether vasquez may have also suffered from cognitive impairments because vasquez did not raise that issue in her application.the social security administration ssa appeals council denied review of alj stacy decision.
vasquez subsequently filed a new application for benefits,alleging an inability to work since november.after the commissioner denied her application,she requested an alj hearing.vasquez application specified that she suffered from ongoing problems due to a back injury,as well as cognitive impairments resulting in significant learning problems.
alj sandra rogers alj rogers,or the alj found that while vasquez was not able to perform her past work as a housekeeper due to a severe back disorder,she retained the residual function capacity to perform light exceptional work activity and therefore was not disabled.although alj rogers did not make any explicit findings regarding vasquez alleged cognitive impairments,she discussed the mental health and capacity evidence presented,and seems to have implicitly found that these impairments were not severe did not impact vasquez residual function capacity.
in appealing this decision to the ssa appeals council,vasquez presented additional evidence of psychological testing from ubaldo sanchez sanchez to bolster her claims of cognitive impairment.the appeals council reviewed the alj findings as well as the additional evidence and found that sanchez report did not warrant any change in the alj decision.the district court affirmed the alj decision when it granted summary judgment in favor of the commissioner and declined to set aside the alj denial of benefits.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court order affirming denial of benefits de novo.schneider comm r of soc.sec,cir.it may set aside the commissioner denial of benefits when the alj findings are based on legal error or are not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.id.substantial evidence means more than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.andrews shalala,cir.this court review s the administrative record as a whole to determine whether substantial evidence supports the alj decision.id.the alj is responsible for determining credibility,resolving conflicts in medical testimony,and for resolving ambiguities.id.w here the evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation,the alj decision must be affirmed.id.at.
credibility of vasquez symptom reporting 
vasquez argues that alj rogers did not properly credit her symptom reporting when she found that vasquez allegations as to the intensity,persistence,and limits effects of her symptoms were not well supported by the probative evidence and were not wholly credible.
in evaluating the credibility of a claimant testimony regarding subjective pain,an alj must engage in a analysis.lingenfelter astrue,cir.first,the alj must determine whether the claimant has presented objective medical evidence of an underlying impairment which could reasonably be expected to produce the pain or other symptoms alleged.id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the claimant is not required to show that her impairment could reasonably be expected to cause the severity of the symptom she has alleged she need only show that it could reasonably have caused some degree of the symptom.id.quoting smolen chater,cir.if the claimant meets the first test and there is no evidence of malingering,the alj can only reject the claimant testimony about the severity of the symptoms if she gives specific,clear and convincing reasons for the rejection.id.
vasquez testified that she is in chronic pain.she stated that it hurts to sit in chairs and hurts walking.in the pain questionnaire she filled out as part of her benefits application,she specified that she feels a stabbing pain in her back,which spreads to her legs and toes,brought on by movement and seeming to worsen when she sits or walks,everyday throughout the day.complaints of ongoing,unrelieved pain were also recorded by her physicians and incorporated in vasquez medical reports.
after finding that vasquez has a back disorder which is a severe impairment,the alj acknowledged that vasquez injuries could reasonably be expected to produce some of the pain and other symptoms alleged.emphasis added.this satisfied the first prong of the alj inquiry regarding the credibility of vasquez complaints.see lingenfelter,at.
the alj went on,however,to reject vasquez allegations,stating 
after carefully considering all of the medical and documentary evidence,the undersigned finds that,in light of discrepancies between the claimant assertions and information contained in the reports of the treating and examining physicians,the allegations by the claimant as to the intensity,persistence,and limiting effects of his sic symptoms were not well supported by the probative evidence and are not wholly credible.the claimant complaints regarding the frequency,severity and duration of her back pain and lower extremity pain are not consistent with the objective medical evidence and are generally consistent sic with the limitations found.
this statement does not comport with the requirements laid out by the court in lingenfelter,at.the alj did not cite any evidence of malingering,and therefore,her adverse credibility findings may only be supported by specific,clear and convincing reasons.id.however,the alj made no specific findings in support of her conclusion that vasquez claims were not credible,other than the vague allegation that they were not consistent with the objective medical evidence.
to support a lack of credibility finding,the alj was required to point to specific facts in the record which demonstrate that vasquez is in less pain than she claims.dodrill shalala,cir.the commissioner argument that the alj found that claimant complaints were inconsistent with the findings reported by capen and singh is not supported by the record.the cited portion of the alj opinion does discuss the findings of capen and singh,but the alj did not discuss these findings,or any specific medical evidence when she rejected vasquez subjective complaints of pain 
the commissioner argument that the alj findings were proper under c and c is similarly incorrect.both regulations deal with evidence the commissioner should consider in determining how a claimant symptoms may affect her capacity to function under the guidelines neither describe what findings are required before an alj can reject a claimant allegations of disabling pain in any event,it does not appear that the alj complied either with the requirements laid out by this court,see lingenfelter,at dodrill at,or its own regulations,see c and c,in assessing vasquez subjective complaints of disabling pain.
the appropriate judicial response in situations where the alj fails to give an adequate justification for rejecting a claimant pain testimony was first discussed in varney secretary of health and human services varney ii,cir.there,we adopted the eleventh circuit rule,holding that the commissioner must accept,as a matter of law,a claimant subjective pain testimony if the alj fails to articulate sufficient reasons for refusing to credit it.id.however,the holding in varney ii was specifically limited to cases where there are no outstanding issues that must be resolved before a proper disability determination can be made,and where it is clear from the administrative record that the alj would be required to award benefits if the claimant excess pain testimony were credited.id.at.
since varney ii,a split in authority has developed over whether the rule is mandatory or discretionary in this circuit.compare,lester chater,cir holding that when an alj improperly rejects a claimant testimony regarding his limitations,and the claimant would be disabled if his testimony were credited,the testimony must be credited as a matter of law with connett barnhart,cir discussing the circuit conflicting case law and holding that the doctrine is not mandatory because the court has some flexibility in applying the crediting as true theory internal quotation marks omitted.it is not necessary for us to resolve the conflict at this time,however,because,unlike varney ii or lester,here there are outstanding issues that must be resolved before a proper disability determination can be made see varney ii at declining to address whether the rule should be adopted in cases where a remand for further proceedings is required before a disability determination can be made lester,at holding that the rule is mandatory,but only where the claimant would be disabled if his testimony were credited.
this court has recognized that there are other factors which may justify application of the rule,even where application of the rule would not result in the immediate payment of benefits.in hammock bowen,cir,we compared the limited application of the rule in varney ii with the rule in the eleventh circuit,which credits the claimant pain testimony whenever the alj fails to articulate its reasons for doing so.id.at citing hale bowen,cir.without adopting a general rule,we found that,because claimant was of advanced age and had already experienced a severe delay in her application,it was appropriate to apply the rule in that case.id.at.we applied the rule even though we remanded for a further determination of whether benefits were due,and in doing so instructed the alj to credit the claimant symptom testimony.id.at.
similar facts are present in this case.vasquez filed her application for benefits in october.at present,she is years old.further,as we noted in varney ii,the purpose of the rule is to discourage aljs from reaching a conclusion about a claimant status first,and then attempting to justify it by ignoring any evidence in the record that suggests an opposite result.varney ii,at.by requiring the alj to specify any factors discrediting a claimant at the first opportunity,the rule ensures that pain testimony is carefully assessed,and helps prevent unnecessary duplication in the administrative process.id.
for all these reasons,we follow hammock in applying the rule in this instance.on remand,the alj is instructed to accept vasquez symptom testimony as true in determining whether she is entitled to benefits.
evidence vasquez was severely impaired 
in the sequential process used to evaluate an applicant disability status,step two consists of determining whether a claimant has a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments.bowen yuckert,d.vasquez argues that the alj finding of no mental impairment was improper and not supported by substantial evidence.we hold that the alj should have been afforded an opportunity to consider additional evidence generated between the alj decision and the appeals council hearing,and remand for that purpose.
the medical evidence confirms at least some degree of cognitive impairment.in february,owen lum,lum interviewed and evaluated vasquez without administering any tests.lum diagnosed vasquez as having adjustment disorder with mixed moods and assessed a global assessment of functioning gaf level of.this number indicates an assessment of mild symptoms and some difficulty functioning assessing her functional capacity,lum wrote that vasquez is able to perform simple and repetitive tasks,and in the absence of major psychiatric problems,could perform detailed tasks.he stated that she is able to accept instructions from supervisors and interact with coworker s and the public,and further,that she could work on a consistent basis and attend a regular work situation,secondary to the absence of major cognitive deterioration.
the month after lum interview,vasquez was interviewed and tested by psychologist ute kollath,kollath.kollath administered,and examinations.she reported that vasquez iq score was a,placing her in the mildly mentally retarded range however,kollath further stated that this appears to be an underestimate of her intellectual level of functioning and variable motivation might account for this.her clinical impression was that vasquez placed in at least the borderline range.her global measure of impairment gmi score was less than,which demonstrates a memory in the impaired range however,kollath reported that this score appears to be an underestimate of her memory functioning because she was able to recall some,detailed autobiographical information.
kollath stated that her overall impression was of an individual who could well have cognitive impairment,but stated that vasquez limited engagement towards the testing process interfered with a full assessment.kollath diagnosed an adjustment disorder with depressed mood,learning disorder nos,and a gaf of.this gaf score indicates moderate symptoms or moderate difficulty in social,occupational,or school functioning.dsm.she specifically noted that vasquez appeared to be able to maintain concentration,persistence,and pace,was able to relate well in the interview and would be able to appropriately interact with supervisors and in a job setting.she found her able to perform simple repetitive tasks,but unable to perform detailed and complex tasks.
the alj referenced the findings of lum and kollath in her decision,though she made no specific findings regarding vasquez mental health.in assessing the objective evidence of impairment obtained from kollath testing,the alj noted kollath observations that the scores were likely underestimates of her true abilities.
after the alj issued her decision denying benefits,vasquez was seen by sanchez for further psychological evaluation and testing.vasquez argues that this additional evidence,which she submitted to the appeals council,clearly demonstrates that she did suffer from a mental impairment during the relevant time period 
sanchez reviewed vasquez records and administered the following examinations adult intelligence scale memory scale wide range achievement test reyes items and a mental status examination.his report noted that she put forth full effort during the evaluation,demonstrated no indication of malingering during the reyes items test,and appeared as a credible claimant.
sanchez report indicates that vasquez full scale iq score is a,which indicates that she is currently functioning in the mentally retarded range of measured intelligence.it further states that,
all of her scores fall within the borderline and mentally retarded range indicating limited general verbal intelligence conceptual thinking numeric manipulation immediate auditory recollection general knowledge social judgment,common sense,reality awareness,judgment in practical situation limited ability to differentiate between essential and details limited capacity for sustained effort,attention,concentration and mental efficiency 
her scores on the memory examination demonstrated significantly below average memory skills.sanchez assessed that vasquez could read at a third grade level,spell at a fourth grade level,and perform arithmetic at a first grade level.he diagnosed major depressive disorder,pain disorder,reading disorder,disorder of written expression,mathematics disorder,and borderline intellectual functioning,with an overall gaf of.the gaf score indicates an assessment that sanchez suffered from serious symptoms or a serious impairment in social,occupation,or school functioning.dsm.
sanchez further stated that while vasquez would not have any difficulty being socially appropriate,s he would have moderate difficulty in concentrating,focusing and keeping up with the pace of a working environment given her preoccupation with pain and her current level of emotional functioning.he stated that she was viewed as being able to perform simple and repetitive tasks,but was not able to determine whether she would be able to tolerate the stress of an day,week on a consistent basis.
sanchez report suggests that vasquez may suffer from cognitive impairments.while kollath reported vasquez iq score at,she noted that the score appear ed to be an underestimate of her intellectual level of functioning.she further stated that while vasquez appeared to be an individual who could well have cognitive impairment,her limited engagement towards the testing process interfered with a full assessment.in comparison,sanchez reported that vasquez was a credible claimant and found that vasquez iq was slightly higher a full scale score of but still within the mentally retarded range of measured intelligence.
if credited,sanchez statements could certainly support a finding of mental impairment.his report plainly states that vasquez has significantly below average memory skills,and test scores indicating limited social judgment,common sense,capacity for sustained effort,attention and mental efficiency.further,his gaf assessment indicates serious symptoms or a serious impairment in social,occupation,or school functioning.see dsm.
the commissioner argues that sanchez findings are contrary to the evidence presented to the alj,the testimony of lum and kollath,and therefore,should not be credited.however,if the appeals council had remanded the case for additional review,sanchez findings would have enhanced the information available to the alj and provided additional,rather than contradictory,evidence of vasquez condition.
though the alj expressed some hesitancy regarding the credibility of kollath findings,as explained above,sanchez arrived at a similar diagnosis.because sanchez findings are based on objective clinical tests,and buttressed by his statement that vasquez appeared to be a credible claimant,they could be sufficient to show a mental impairment.see magallanes bowen,cir quoting miller heckler,cir where a nontreating physician opinion rests on objective clinical tests,it must be viewed as substantial evidence.moreover,to the extent kollath and sanchez testimony supports a finding of mental impairment that would not have been supported by lum testimony,the court may conclude that the evidence is not actually contradictory,because lum did not perform any of the clinical tests on which kollath and sanchez based their opinions.
when viewed as a whole,the medical reports suggest that vasquez may suffer from a cognitive impairment.because the alj did not have access to sanchez reports in deciding otherwise,she also did not account for vasquez mental impairments in determining her residual functioning capacity at step four of the disability determination.see noting that where a claimant has a combination of impairments,the combined impact of the impairments will be considered throughout the disability determination process noting that where a claimant has more than one impairment,the ssa will consider all of them,even those that are not severe,in determining the claimants residual functioning capacity.
neither party has presented any argument regarding how vasquez impairments would affect a determination of her residual functioning capacity under the guidelines thus,there are no facts presented that clearly indicate the proper outcome of steps four and five of the disability determination evaluation.for this reason,the court can not find vasquez disabled and order an immediate payment of benefits.see harman apfel,cir allowing an immediate award of benefits directed when,among other things,it is clear from the record that the alj would be required to find the claimant disabled if the evidence is credited.rather,in cases such as these,where the testimony of the vocational expert has failed to address a claimant limitations as established by improperly discredited evidence,this circuit has consistently remanded for further proceedings rather than payment of benefits.id.
accordingly,we remand to allow the alj to consider sanchez reports in determining whether vasquez suffers from a mental impairment,and to consider how these limitations affect her residual functioning capacity and ability to perform other work at steps four and five of the disability determination sequence.
res judicata 
t he principle of res judicata should not be rigidly applied in administrative proceedings.lester chater,at citing gregory bowen,cir.normally,an alj findings that a claimant is not disabled creates a presumption that the claimant continued to be able to work after that date.id.at quoting miller,at.however,the presumption does not apply where the claimant raises a new issue,such as the existence of an impairment not considered in the previous application.id.
in lester,the court found that the commissioner could not apply res judicata principles to an earlier alj decision in determining a claimant eligibility where the claimant alleged a mental impairment not raised in his earlier application and turned after the date of the earlier decision and thus entered the approaching advanced age category as defined by the applicable regulations.id.at.the facts in this case are exactly parallel to lester in that vasquez did not raise the issue of her mental impairment during her application before alj stacy,but did raise the issue during her application before alj rogers.
additionally,vasquez turned after the date of alj stacy decision and entered the closely approaching advanced age category.thus,alj rogers improperly applied res judicata.alj rogers explicitly noted that she gave weight to the prior determination of alj stacy in reaching her determination,and because vasquez was unable to provide evidence of changed circumstances,applied principles of res judicata in her decision.however,because vasquez raised a new issue not before alj stacy and entered the closely approaching advanced age category,it was improper for alj rogers to apply a presumption of continuing when deciding vasquez second application.see id.at 
where an alj has committed legal error,this court may set aside the commissioner denial of benefits.schneider,at.however,for the reasons outlined above,we believe that,after crediting vasquez pain testimony and taking into account the evidence of her mental impairment,the alj should make a determination as to vasquez residual functioning capacity and entitlement to benefits in the first instance.the alj is further instructed that the principles of res judicata are not applicable in this case,and therefore,that alj stacy previous decision is not entitled to any degree of deference in the ultimate decision as to whether vasquez is entitled to an award of benefits.
conclusion 
we grant vasquez petition and remand with instructions to remand to the commissioner for a further determination of whether benefits are due.
vacated and remanded.costs on appeal to appellant.
introduction 
this case involves application of the rule.when an administrative law judge alj makes an adverse credibility finding with respect to a witness testimony in a social security case,he or she must make specific findings justifying that decision.hammock bowen,cir citing varney sec y of health and human servs.varney i,cir,modified on reh g,varney ii cir cotton bowen,cir.according to the rule,when an alj fails to provide specific,articulable reasons to support an adverse credibility finding,this court should not remand solely to allow the alj to make specific findings regarding that testimony.rather,it should take that testimony to be established as true.id.quoting varney ii,at.
i concur with the entirety of judge selna opinion,including application of the rule in this case.in the dissent view,however,there is an internal conflict among ninth circuit case law that makes resolution of the issue impossible here.i write separately to clarify why application of the rule is appropriate and why this case does not present an opportunity for en banc review of the conflict identified by the dissent.
ii.discussion 
this court first articulated the rule in varney ii.there we stated that when an alj has not provided specific reasons for disbelieving a claimant testimony,a credibility hearing is insufficient,in itself,to warrant further proceedings.id.at.thus 
i n cases where there are no outstanding issues that must be resolved before a proper disability determination can be made,and where it is clear from the administrative record that the alj would be required to award benefits if the claimant excess pain testimony were credited,we will not remand solely to allow the alj to make specific findings regarding that testimony.
id.at.instead,the testimony will be established as true as a matter of law,and the case will be remanded with instructions to grant benefits.id.
a later panel concluded that the crediting as true doctrine is not mandatory in the ninth circuit.connett barnhart,cir.surveying conflicting cases,connett determined that there was no other way to reconcile those cases than to hold that i nstead of being a mandatory rule,we have some flexibility in applying the crediting as true theory.id.at.accordingly,the court declined to enter judgment instructing the alj to award benefits and instead remanded the case for the sole purpose of determining whether connett testimony should be credited as true.id.
while varney ii and connett do appear to be in conflict over the applicability of the rule where there is no other reason to remand the case to the alj,this case does not and should not provide an opportunity to resolve that dispute en banc.varney ii expressly reserve d judgment as to whether to follow the rule in cases in which a remand is required for other reasons.id.there is no conflict over the rule as applied to cases that require remand for other reasons.because this case requires remand regardless of application of the rule,it does not implicate any conflict between varney ii and connett.
we first addressed the question left open by varney ii in hammock bowen,cir,where we considered a case in which further proceedings other than a credibility determination were necessary before benefits could be granted.there,we extend ed varney ii to cover the present case because the delay experienced by hammock has been severe and because of hammock advanced age.id.at.we therefore accept ed as a matter of law the truth of the claimant testimony and remanded for further proceedings.id.
the dissent argues that hammock also conflicts with connett.that would be true only if hammock announced a binding extension of varney ii rule to all cases in which an alj had not provided specific reasons for disbelieving a claimant testimony,regardless whether further proceedings other than a credibility determination were required.hammock has not and can not be interpreted so broadly.
to support its claim of a conflict in this case,the dissent asserts that because disabilities disproportionately affect older individuals,any effort to limit hammock holding to the facts of that case is unavailing.it also cites lester chater,cir,harman apfel,cir,and benecke barnhart,cir,to argue that later panels of this court have interpreted hammock broadly to apply to all cases,regardless of the need for remand.dissent at.neither of these arguments holds water.
first,hammock says in plain language that the rule should apply only in the present case because the delay experienced by hammock has been severe and because of hammock advanced age.at emphasis added.nothing in hammock indicated the court intended to establish a rule applicable beyond the limited factual context of that particular case.the dissent empirical observation that the factors motivating hammock are common to most social security cases does not render that court decision logically categorical.it only makes it more likely that future panels will exercise their discretion to apply the rule when remand is necessary for other reasons.this is one such case.that social security claimants are commonly elderly and their benefits typically delayed is therefore beside the point.
nor do lester,harman,and benecke provide a basis for concluding otherwise.the dissent argues that lester stands for the broad proposition that w here the commissioner fails to provide adequate reasons for rejecting testimony,we credit that testimony as a matter of law,at,regardless of the need for remand on other issues.dissent at.setting aside whether such an expansive interpretation of that statement has any merit,it simply was not relevant to the outcome of that case.there,after applying the rule,the lester panel remand ed for payment of benefits because no other proceedings were necessary.id.at.thus,even assuming arguendo that lester concluded hammock extended varney ii across the board,that conclusion had no bearing on the result in that case and is therefore nonbinding dicta.see coalition of clergy,lawyers,and professors bush,cir analysis that is in no way relevant to any holding is dicta which does not bind future panel s of this court.
harman provides even less support for the conclusion that varney ii has been extended to all cases like this one.there,we expressly addressed the circumstances under which evidence should be credited and an immediate award of benefits directed.harman,at emphasis added.we concluded that testimony should be credited as true only when 
the alj has failed to provide legally sufficient reasons for rejecting such evidence,there are no outstanding issues that must be resolved before a determination of disability can be made,and it is clear from the record that the alj would be required to find the claimant disabled were such evidence credited.
id.quoting smolen chater,cir.in conformity with varney ii,we determined that if these three elements were met,then remand for determination and payment of benefits would be warranted regardless of whether the alj might have articulated a justification for rejecting the testimony.id.but,we concluded,application of the rule was not appropriate in that particular case because the vocational expert had not addressed the limitations posed by the conditions sought to be established by application of the rule.id.at.accordingly,t he appropriate remedy was to remand this case to the alj.id.thus if harman demonstrates anything,it is that hammock established judicial discretion to apply or not apply the rule in cases where remand is necessary for other reasons.certainly it can not be read to mean what the dissent we must apply the rule in cases where remand is necessary for other reasons.
benecke is also readily distinguishable.the dissent is correct to note that the benecke panel appl ied the rule and only then discuss ed whether there were outstanding issues that must be resolved before a determination of disability could be made dissent at quoting benecke,at.it would be dubious at best,however,to interpret benecke misconstruction of the harman test as a binding extension of varney ii to cases in which remand is still necessary.but in any event,again assuming arguendo that such an interpretation had merit,it still would be dicta since the benecke court conclude d that there are no outstanding issues that must be resolved before a determination of disability can be made and remanded with instructions to grant benefits.benecke,at emphasis added.
iii.conclusion 
according to hammock,we are free to exercise our discretion but not required to apply the rule in this case.this conclusion conflicts with neither varney ii nor connett.whatever the merits of the claim that the en banc court should resolve the conflict between varney ii and connett,this case simply does not provide an opportunity for doing so.
because i believe that this circuit precedents can not be reconciled,i must respectfully dissent from that part of the court opinion slip op.at that discusses the rule.in my view,this issue can only be resolved by the court en banc.i do agree with the court treatment of the remaining issues,including its conclusion that the administrative law judge improperly rejected vasquez testimony and that the case should be remanded for consideration of vasquez ability to perform other work during steps four and five of the disability determination process.
subsequent to our decision in this case,the government petitioned for rehearing en banc,arguing that the rule is invalid because it is contrary to both statute and supreme court precedent.vasquez did not respond to the government arguments in detail,and so i do not opine whether the government is right.however,the case appears strong.the government asserts that under the social security act,the a federal the factfinder.see g findings of commissioner are conclusive so long as substantial evidence supports them.while the statute prohibits a claimant testimony concerning pain or other symptoms alone from establishing a disability,this appears to be exactly what the rule would require.d a an individual statement as to pain or other symptoms shall not alone be conclusive evidence of disability as defined in this section there must be medical signs and findings which show the existence of a medical impairment which could reasonably be expected to produce the pain or other symptoms alleged and which,when considered with all evidence would lead to a conclusion that the individual is under a disability.emphasis added.the government notes that the general rule subject to rare exceptions is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.ins ventura,d per curiam.we do not in only rare cases according to the government,we took some factfinding responsibility away from the commissioner in at least cases during and.
the government finally notes that other circuits will remand for determination of benefits only in narrow circumstances.see,faucher sec y of health human,cir if a court determines that substantial evidence does not support the secretary decision,the court can reverse the decision and immediately award benefits only if all essential factual issues have been resolved and the record adequately establishes a plaintiff entitlement to benefits.see also miller chater,cir remanding for a fifth administrative hearing,but warning that the secretary is not entitled to adjudicate a case ad infinitum until he correctly applies the proper legal standard and gathers evidence to support his conclusion internal quotation marks omitted.if,as the government argues,is a de facto finding of disability,then our circuit precedent is badly misaligned with that of other circuits.
of course,because the rule is part of our circuit law,only an en banc court can change it.although no judge has chosen to call for en banc rehearing in this case,i am hopeful that the en banc court will consider the argument when it is presented more directly in another case,one where there is an explicit remand for immediate payment of benefits based on the rule.because the rule applies in every case where a court finds no substantial evidence to support the commissioner decision,the issue is of exceptional importance.this is particularly so because the social security hearing system is probably the largest adjudicative agency in the western world.heckler campbell,d noting that million claims for disability benefits were filed in.
when a panel is faced with an irreconcilable conflict in the law of the circuit,it is required to make a sua sponte call for en banc review.in atonio wards cove packing,the en banc court held that the panel facing conflicting circuit precedent erred in relying on one line of the court authority on the basis that it expressed the correct view or,alternatively,because it was the decision first in line,cir en banc.rather,the court stated that the appropriate mechanism for resolving an irreconcilable conflict is an en banc decision.a panel faced with such a conflict must call for en banc review.id.at emphases added.the en banc court later affirmed this holding in united states hardesty,cir en banc per curiam.in hardesty,the court specifically rejected the view that where there are two opposing lines of authority,a panel may,without calling for en banc review,follow the rule which has successfully posed as the law of the circuit for long enough to be relied on.at overruling greenhow sec.of health human,cir.
the rule cre
