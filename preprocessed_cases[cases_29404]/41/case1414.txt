john john,by and through his parents and next friends,christine and michael,filed this action seeking relief under the individuals with disabilities in education act idea,as amended by the individuals with disabilities in education improvement act ideia.he alleged that evanston township high school district,its board of education and its superintendent collectively the school district had denied john a free,appropriate public education fape as required by the legislation.in response to john motion for enforcement of the statute provision,which requires generally that a child remain in the same educational placement pending any proceedings,see j,the district court entered a preliminary injunction.
for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we have concluded that the injunction can not stand in its present form because it addresses matters beyond the provision and does not apply the correct standards when it does address the provision.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
backgrounda.
john is a sophomore in high school who has down syndrome.he is enrolled in the school district as a student at evanston township high school eths,a public school that receives federal funding and that is subject,therefore,to the requirements of the idea and the ideia.before beginning his high school career at eths,john had attended haven middle school,district haven.students from haven normally transition to eths to continue their education.
while john was a student at haven,he pursued his middle school education under the terms of an individualized education program iep.this plan,often referred to in this opinion as the may iep,had been formulated in may.while at haven,john had received a service that the parties refer to as.the phrase did not appear in the may iep.
in spring,john parents and representatives of eths met to formulate an iep for john coming freshman year at eths representatives from haven also attended the first two sessions of these meetings.during this process,eths stated that it would not be able to provide the same sort of services that haven had provided to john during his middle school education.instead,eths proposed to afford john minutes per week of special education services.the proposed eths iep also provided that john special education teacher would observe him in his general education classes of english,history,algebra and biology for to additional minutes per week.eths iep also provided for various speech therapy services,social work services,physical therapy and occupational therapy.it did not provide,however,for a circle of friends type social and speech therapy that john had received at haven and that his parents believed was very beneficial to him during his time there.
because john parents did not believe that the proposed iep fulfilled the school district statutory responsibility to their son,they requested an administrative hearing.the hearing officer determined that the iep complied with statutory requirements.he also concluded that eths had complied fully with the requirements of the placement 
john then filed an action in the district court seeking review of the hearing officer determination.while this action was pending,john filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to enforce the placement and a motion to supplement the administrative record and present additional evidence 
in his motion for a preliminary injunction,john sought to maintain the status quo,the may middle school iep,while the litigation over the proposed high school iep was under consideration by the district court.
although ostensibly ruling on the request,the district court addressed extensively the merits of the proposed high school iep and determined that the school district,as a practical matter,offered only two options to john a mainstream class without a or placement in a separate special education classroom.the district court then concluded that the school district essentially had defaulted john into the special education class because his disability prevented him from participating in the mainstream classes.the district court held that this situation was a violation of the statute because it denied john an individual assessment.the district court,therefore,vacated the hearing officer decision to the extent that it was inconsistent with the district court determination that the proposed high school iep did not offer john a fape.the district court then entered a preliminary injunction that required the school district to provide john with an education based on its proposed high school iep with additional features specified by the court 
the school district then filed a motion to stay the district court judgment pending appeal.see.c.the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part.the district court agreed with the school district that the part of its order that required the plaintiffs and defendants to work together to create a new iep crossed the line from enforcement of the placement to a preliminary injunction.it therefore stayed subsection of its order,but denied the stay with respect to the remainder of the order.
discussiona.
john first submits that the district court erred when,while ruling on his motion for a preliminary injunction to enforce the statute provision,it vacated,sua sponte,the hearing officer decision on the merits.
after john appealed the merits of the hearing officer decision to the district court,he filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to enforce the provision of the statute.in ruling on john motion for preliminary injunction on the placement,the district court,sua sponte,vacated the decision of the hearing officer and ordered the implementation of a regimen that employed the proposed high school iep as its base and added other requirements,including a services component.the school district submits that the district court exceeded the bounds of the motion and,by addressing the underlying merits,deprived the school district of the right to be heard.
the school district is correct.the motion for a preliminary injunction to enforce the provision had not placed the merits of the hearing officer decision before the district court.in asking for preliminary injunctive relief,john sought to enforce only the placement provision of the statute while he litigated,in the district court,the correctness of the hearing officer decision.upon the filing of the motion for a preliminary injunction,the school district simply was not on notice that the district court planned to address,in its consideration of that motion,the underlying merits.consequently,the school district did not have an adequate opportunity to submit evidence with respect to the appropriateness of the proposed high school iep.the school district simply was not given an adequate opportunity to defend itself on the merits.accordingly,we must conclude that it was error for the district court to amend sua sponte the iep and to vacate the hearing officer decision.
our determination is simply an application of the general rule that sua sponte judgments are generally disfavored.see southern illinois riverboat casino cruises,triangle insulation sheet metal,cir.at a minimum,sua sponte judgments are proper only when the litigants have proper notice that the district court is contemplating entering such a judgment and have a fair opportunity to submit evidence prior to the entry of such a judgment.inland paperboard packaging,cir.
we now must examine whether the district court erred when it held that was required as part of john placement.
in enacting the provision,congress intended to strip schools of the unilateral authority they had traditionally employed to exclude disabled students from school.honig doe,d emphasis in original.the statute provision requires that a child remain in the same educational placement pending the outcome of any proceedings brought pursuant to section,unless the parents and the school district otherwise agree.bd.of educ.of cmty.high sch.dist.illinois state bd.of,cir.the term educational placement is not statutorily defined,so that identifying a change in this placement is something of an inexact science.id.indeed,we have admitted to a hesitancy to establish in any definitive and rigid way the meaning of educational placement.rather,we have seen wisdom in,and therefore have adopted,the approach employed by our sister circuits.id.at.in board of education of community high school district illinois state board of education,cir,we recognized that within the term there must be enough room to encompass the child experience.id.we recognized that the educational status quo for a growing,learning young person often makes rigid adherence to particular educational methodologies an impossibility.id.under these circumstances,respect for the purpose of the provision requires that the former iep be read at a level of generality that focuses on the child educational needs and goals.id.
as we pointed out in high school district,our colleagues in the second circuit have interpreted educational placement along the same lines.they have described it to refer to the general educational program in which a child who is correctly identified as handicapped is enrolled,rather than mere variations in the program itself.concerned parents citizens for the continuing educ.at malcolm x ps new york city bd.of,cir.in a similar vein,the court noted that,the regulations implementing the idea also interpret the term placement to mean only the general program of education.id.by contrast,the judges likened a change in educational placement to involve moving a child from a special class in a regular school to a special school.id.a more rigid interpretation of educational placement,the court pointed out,would impede the school board ability to make even minor discretionary changes within the educational programs provided for its students.id.at 
this perspective is shared as well by our colleagues in the ninth circuit.they have stated,in johnson ex rel.johnson special education hearing office,cir,that all educational placement requires is comparable placement.id.at.in s ex rel.vashon island school district,cir superseded by statute on other grounds,the court spoke directly to the situation before progression of a child from one level of education to another.when a child progresses from preschool to elementary school,from elementary school to middle school or from middle school to high school,the status quo no longer exists.id.at.under these circumstances,the obligation of the new district is to provide educational services that approximate the student old iep as closely as possible.id.at.
we believe that these cases recognize the need for some degree of flexibility in interpreting the last iep in a situation.in complying with the provision,we must interpret educational placement to incorporate enough flexibility to encompass the child experience.high sch.dist,at.a child interim educational regime must produce as closely as possible the overall educational experience enjoyed by the child under his previous iep.to achieve that result,we must recognize that educational methodologies,appropriate and even necessary in one educational environment,are not always effective in another time and place in serving a child continuing educational needs and goals.
nevertheless,when asked to approve an alteration in educational methodology in a order,we must give careful attention to the purpose of the provision.the recognized and defined special needs of the child and the educational goals originally set by the parents and by professional educators must be respected.protestations that educational methodologies proven to be helpful to the child in the past are now impossible must be evaluated with a critical eye to ensure that motivations other than those compatible with the statute,such as bureaucratic inertia,are not driving the decision.suggestions for methodological change that would dilute the statute policy of mainstreaming disabled children to the maximum extent appropriate,a a,deserve particular scrutiny.see casey ex rel.norman anne comty.high sch.dist,cir.the removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or the severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aid and service can not be achieved satisfactorily.bd.of educ.rowley,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
on remand,the district court must revisit the request for interim injunctive relief under the provision.its starting point must be the may iep that governed john middle school education.this document,as the last educational plan agreed upon by the parents and the professional educators,is the appropriate basis for relief.generally,the terms of this iep should be enforced,without exception,as the relief.
in examining the may iep,the district court must note with particular care the precise requirements of the iep.even if a school has provided a particular service in the past,it need not be provided in a situation if it was not within the governing iep.see cordrey euckert,cir gregory longview sch,cir.if the parties dispute what the iep requires,as they do here with respect to,the court must evaluate the iep as a whole and determine whether such a methodology is required under the terms of the iep.under usual circumstances,the court should find it unnecessary to go beyond the four corners of the document in order to make that determination.however,vagueness in the instrument with respect to how its goals are to be achieved may require that the court turn to extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of those who formulated the plan.see doe defendant i,cir noting that it would exalt form over substance to ignore information known to parents and administrators simply because it was not contained in the four corners of the iep.a methodology not mentioned in the plan may well indicate that those who formulated the plan did not consider that particular methodology a necessary component to the they well may have intended that some comparable methodology be implemented.see erickson albuquerque pub,cir holding that,when iep simply required occupational therapy,the substitution of one type of occupational therapy for another was permissible.here,the term is not mentioned in the may iep itself.therefore,the district court ought to determine,after evaluating the entire may iep as a totality,whether the parties regarded this methodology as an essential part of the plan or as simply one of several ways by which the plan could be implemented.as we noted earlier,in answering this question,the court will need to explore precisely how the plan was implemented at haven.the exact method of implementation is not apparent on this record and the accounts of the parties are not compatible.
knowledge of precisely how this feature of the plan was implemented at haven is important for another reason.in examining the manner in which the plan was implemented in the middle school environment,the district court will be able to gauge far more accurately the school district claim that implementation of that methodology in the institutional setting of a high school is not possible.as we have said earlier,if the district court finds that the methodology employed in the middle school is actually part of the may iep,the court must require very compelling evidence from the school district before permitting a deviation from the course already set.however,the court might determine nevertheless that the high school setting makes the use of such an approach counterproductive in terms of the goals of the iep or impossible to implement.the court then may allow the parties to propose an alternative.this alternative should be as close as possible to the approach used in the middle school but nevertheless compatible with the goals of the iep and the institutional demands of the high school setting.on the other hand,if the court determines that the methodology is not part of the iep but simply a methodology chosen by the middle school educational professionals,that particular methodology need not be included in the order.the district court should then permit the high school aut
