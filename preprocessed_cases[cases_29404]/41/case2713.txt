the pittsburg midway coal mining company p m petitions for review of a decision of the benefits review board affirming an administrative law judge award of survivor benefits under the black lung benefits act the blba or the act.the central issue on appeal is whether the claimant,dorothy cornelius,established that her husband death was due to pneumoconiosis as required by the act.after thorough review,we conclude that substantial evidence supports the administrative law judge conclusion that,under c of the act and its implementing regulation,cornelius was entitled to an irrebuttable presumption that her husband death was due to pneumoconiosis,and we therefore deny the petition for review.
an understanding of the relevant statutory and regulatory framework as well as the basic facts is essential to deciding this case.the black lung benefits act provides benefits to coal miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis and to the surviving dependents of miners whose death was due to such disease a.the act delegates to the secretary of labor secretary the task of prescribing standards for determining whether a miner total disability or death is due to pneumoconiosis,id.b,subject to several evidentiary presumptions.the most important of these presumptions is contained in c of the act,which provides that there shall be an irrebuttable presumption that the miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis or that the miner death was due to pneumoconiosis if the 
miner is suffering or suffered from a chronic dust disease of the lung which a when diagnosed by chest roentgenogram,yields one or more large opacities greater than one centimeter in diameter and would be classified in category a,b,or c in the international classification of radiographs of the pneumoconioses by the international labor organization,b when diagnosed by biopsy or autopsy,yields massive lesions in the lung,or c when diagnosis is made by other means,would be a condition which could reasonably be expected to yield results described in clause a or b if diagnosis had been made in the manner prescribed in clause a or b 
the secretary has,in turn,incorporated section c irrebuttable presumption into the black lung regulations at the secretary has incorporated into c,the general regulation establishing standards for determining whether a miner death is due to pneumoconiosis.section c provides in pertinent part 
d eath will be considered to be due to pneumoconiosis if any of the following criteria is met 
where competent medical evidence establishes that pneumoconiosis was the cause of the miner death,or 
where pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause or factor leading to the miner death or where the death was caused by complications of pneumoconiosis,or 
where the presumption set forth at is applicable.
however,survivors are not eligible for benefits where the miner death was caused by a traumatic injury or the principal cause of death was a medical condition not related to pneumoconiosis,unless the evidence establishes that pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of death.
this case arises from the death of clyde cornelius,a retired coal miner.cornelius worked in coal mines for approximately years,ending in.he died in at the age of.his death certificate listed congestive heart failure as the immediate cause of death and anemia as a contributing cause of death pneumoconiosis was not mentioned 
following cornelius death,his widow,dorothy cornelius,filed a claim for survivor benefits under the act.after identifying p m as the responsible employer,the department of labor dol adjudication officer issued a proposed decision and order finding that cornelius was entitled to benefits under the act.p m contested the proposed decision and requested a formal hearing before an administrative law judge alj.
at the formal hearing conducted by the alj,cornelius relied on the autopsy report and deposition testimony of mary louise,the pathologist who performed an autopsy of cornelius lungs.according to the autopsy report,gross examination revealed the following 
the pleural surfaces reveal moderate subpleural anthracotic type pigment deposition bilaterally.multiple grey black subpleural nodules measuring from up to cm are noted throughout all of the lobes.in addition,the right upper lobe reveals multiple,irregular,gray black areas of induration measuring up to cm.
dx,autopsy report at the autopsy report also stated that on microscopic examination found that 
s ections of the lungs demonstrate a focally thickened pleura with moderate subpleural anthracotic type pigment deposition.multiple scattered fibroanthracotic nodules measuring up to cm are seen.the nodular lesions consist of dense collagen and granular pigment many are stellate in appearance.their distribution is widespread pleural based interstitial perivascular and adjacent to the walls of respiratory bronchioles.these microscopic features are consistent with a complicated pneumoconiosis,as defined by the black lung program guidelines department of.
id.in a section titled final anatomical diagnoses,the autopsy report listed,among other things,f ibroanthracotic nodules bilateral lungs measuring up to cm,compatible with complicated pneumoconiosis,as defined by the black lung program guidelines department of.id.at.
during her deposition,said that the black lung program guidelines she referred to in her autopsy report had been sent to her by the dol employment standards administration during her evaluation of an earlier black lung case.the guidelines,which are contained in a letter dated august,from the employment standards administration to,state in pertinent part 
the presence of complicated pneumoconiosis is established if 
the gross examination of the cut lung revealed a marked degree of simple pneumoconiosis and progressive massive fibrosis massive lesions of the lung or large,dense fibrous masses was present and 
the microscopic examination revealed fibrotic mass or masses composed of carbon deposits and interlaced by bundles of dense fibrous tissues.
dx at.explained that her autopsy findings satisfied the guidelines requirements for complicated pneumoconiosis because of the size and extent of the nodules present.dx,dep.at.specifically,her gross examination 
revealed a marked degree of simple pneumoconiosis and larger areas of fibrosis that were one centimeter or greater in dimension,and that correlates with the ilo pulmonary lung classification for complicated,the larger nodules the microscopic examination also had the fibrotic masses.
id.at.finally,also averred that pathologists are best able to make a diagnosis of complicated pneumoconiosis when they perform both a gross and microscopic examination because the things you see grossly are not necessarily in toto represented on the slides id.at.in other words,a gross examination allows a pathologist to get an impression of the disease of the lung in toto that one may not fully appreciate from the microscopic.id.at.
to counter opinion,p m relied on the expert report of raphael caffrey and the expert report and testimony of ben branscomb.because he did not perform the autopsy,caffrey opinion was limited to reviewing the autopsy slides prepared by.caffrey reported that the largest nodule he could find on the slides was centimeters,and he,accordingly,concluded that cornelius did not have complicated pneumoconiosis even under the standard applied by.branscomb agreed with caffrey,opining that cornelius had only simple,not complicated,pneumoconiosis.he also testified that the term massive lesions usually refers to complicated pneumoconiosis,and that massive lesions are generally the size of a chicken egg,the size of of one lung,or the size of a tennis ball.hearing tr.at.finally,branscomb acknowledged that autopsy is more effective by far than for diagnosing coal workers pneumoconiosis.id.at.
based on opinion,the alj concluded that cornelius was entitled to the irrebuttable presumption of causation provided in,and,accordingly,awarded her benefits.see cornelius pittsburgh midway coal mining,slip.op.at.the benefits review board brb vacated that decision and remanded the case for further consideration,because the alj had not explained which of the three criteria in cornelius had satisfied.see cornelius pittsburg midway coal mining,brb bla,slip op.at,per curiam unpublished decision.
on remand,the case was assigned to a new alj.after reviewing the record of the original formal hearing,the alj concluded that testimony was the most persuasive and that her testimony satisfied the requirements of b and c.thus,the alj concluded that cornelius established that her husband died due to pneumoconiosis and awarded her benefits.see cornelius pittsburg midway coal mining,slip op.at july.the benefits review board affirmed the alj conclusion with respect to b,and,therefore,did not address his alternative conclusion that cornelius also satisfied c.see cornelius pittsburg midway coal mining,brb bla,slip op.at july,per curiam unpublished decision.
p m then timely petitioned this court to review the brb decision.we have jurisdiction over the petition because cornelius worked as a coal miner in alabama.see slatick director,owcp,cir.the director of the office of workers compensation programs,department of labor director is a named respondent in these proceedings,see k,and has elected to file a brief in support of cornelius.although cornelius was a respondent before the brb,she has chosen not to participate in the briefing or argument before this court.
the standard of review applied to the brb affirmance of an alj decision is by now 
decisions of the alj are reviewable only as to whether they are in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence in light of the entire record.this deferential standard of review binds both the brb and this court.because this court applies the same standard of review to alj decisions as does the brb,our review of brb decisions is de novo.substantial evidence has been defined as more than a scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion w hen the brb upholds the alj decision,this court limited review of the alj effectively cloaks the brb decision with the same deference to which the alj is entitled.thus,although the case comes to us from the brb,we begin our analysis by reviewing the decision of the alj.

to receive survivor benefits,a claimant must establish that the miner had pneumoconiosis,that his pneumoconiosis was caused by coal mine employment,and that his death was due to the disease.bradberry director,owcp,cir see also a only the third at issue here.
as we have already observed,the black lung regulations provide three distinct methods of proving causation a claimant must show either that the miner death was in fact caused by pneumoconiosis that pneumoconiosis was in fact a substantially contributing cause of the miner death or that the irrebuttable presumption of causation contained in applies.see c.here,the director does not argue that pneumoconiosis or complications of the disease in fact caused or were in fact a substantially contributing cause of cornelius death.consequently,cornelius can not establish causation under c or,and she must therefore rely on the irrebuttable presumption contained in.
p m argues that cornelius is not entitled to the irrebuttable presumption for two reasons.first,p m says that because cornelius principal cause of death was a medical condition not related to pneumoconiosis,cornelius must show that pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of death under c,a showing that she has not and apparently can not make.second,p m asserts that,even if c does not apply when is satisfied,opinion is insufficient to satisfy any of the three criteria found in.neither argument is persuasive.
to begin with,the regulation embodied in c states however,survivors are not eligible for benefits where the miner death was caused by a traumatic injury or the principal cause of death was a medical condition not related to pneumoconiosis,unless the evidence establishes that pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of death.c.according to p m,this provision is a that applies to all of the previous subsections of c,including c,the subsection incorporating the irrebuttable presumption contained in.p m interpretation creates an obvious conflict in the black lung regulations provides for an irrebuttable presumption,but c would allow that presumption to be rebutted if death was in fact caused by traumatic injury or a medical condition not related to pneumoconiosis and pneumoconiosis was not in fact a substantially contributing cause of death.
this seeming conflict is resolved easily by the plain language of the black lung benefits act.section c of the act,which largely parrots,unambiguously says that there shall be an irrebuttable presumption of causation if any of the three medical criteria in that section are met.c emphases added.any interpretation of the relevant regulation,c,that allows this mandatory irrebuttable presumption somehow to be rebutted would be inconsistent,indeed would collide with the plain language of c and is therefore invalid.see,united states larionoff,d r egulations,in order to be valid,must be consistent with the statute under which they are promulgated.lewis barnhart,cir per curiam where a regulation and statute conflict,the more specific and authoritative words in the statute govern ellis motors acceptance,cir r egulations can not trump the plain language of statutes.internal quotation marks omitted groves sons fulton county,cir r egulations must not be inconsistent with the statute that authorizes them.internal quotation marks omitted.
p m interpretation would yield precisely that unacceptable result.thus,for example,in this case,it is undisputed that cornelius died from congestive heart failure,a medical condition not related to pneumoconiosis,and it is undisputed that pneumoconiosis was not in fact a substantially contributing cause of death.according to p m interpretation,cornelius is not entitled to benefits even if she otherwise meets the requirements of c.but this result can not be squared with the plain language of c,which says that once one of the three criteria enumerated in that provision is met,the presumption of death due to pneumoconiosis is irrebuttable.since p m interpretation of c undeniably conflicts with the clear text of c,we reject it and hold that c does not apply to claimants who are entitled to an irrebuttable presumption of causation under.accord gray slc coal,cir b ecause both the statute and its interpretive regulation use the term irrebuttable,the director reconciliation of c with the statute appears to be legally sound.usx director,owcp,wl,at cir,unpublished decision adoption of the employer view would not only render the irrebuttable presumption of section rebuttable in traumatic injury cases,but also,under the language of section c,open the door to attempts at rebuttal whenever the principal cause of death was a medical condition not related to pneumoconiosis.the effect of this construction would be to create a plethora of possibilities where a presumption the regulations term irrebuttable would become rebuttable.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
finding no room to maneuver in the text of c,p m makes one final argument the amendments to the black lung benefits act implicitly require all claimants to show that pneumoconiosis played some part in the miner death.p m is plainly wrong.prior to the amendments,the act provided benefits to the survivors of miners who died due to pneumoconiosis or who were totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis at the time of death.the amendments to the blba eliminated the second basis for survivor benefits.see black lung benefits act amendments of,a,stat.accordingly,a survivor is no longer entitled to benefits simply because the miner was totally disabled during his lifetime the survivor must prove that the miner died due to pneumoconiosis.see bradberry,at explaining that,under the current version of the act,a lthough the issue of total disability is relevant to a claim by a miner,it is not relevant to a claim for survivor benefits.notably,however,the amendments did not repeal or in any way alter the critical language creating an irrebuttable presumption found in c.thus,the amendments do not change the fact that a survivor may be entitled to an irrebuttable presumption that the miner died due to pneumoconiosis if she can meet any of the three criteria set out in c,irrespective of whether pneumoconiosis contributed in any way to the miner death.
quite simply,once a claimant has established that the requirements of c are met,the irrebuttable presumption operates to establish conclusively that the miner died due to pneumoconiosis,and the claimant obligation to prove causation is therefore satisfied.
having failed to convince us that the plain language of the statute can be ignored,p m also argues that expert opinion is an insufficient foundation to establish any of the irrebuttable presumption three medical criteria.we remain unpersuaded.
under both the relevant statute c and regulation,a claimant is entitled to an irrebuttable presumption of causation if she shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the miner revealed opacities larger than centimeter in diameter c a a,that the miner autopsy or biopsy revealed massive lesions c b b,or that a diagnosis by other means reveals a condition that could reasonably be expected to yield opacities of greater than centimeter or massive lesions if the diagnosis had been made by or autopsy,respectively c c c 
the parties agree that cornelius did not produce evidence sufficient to satisfy a.the case,therefore,turns on whether substantial evidence supports the alj conclusion that b or c were met.notably,p m does not challenge the alj conclusion that opinion was entitled to more weight than p m expert witnesses,caffrey and branscomb.in light of that concession,the sole issue before us is whether testimony provides substantial evidence in support of the alj conclusion that cornelius satisfied either b or c.
our analysis begins and,as it turns out,ends with b,which creates an irrebuttable presumption that a miner died due to pneumoconiosis if an autopsy reveals massive lesions in his lungs.b see c b.the meaning of the term massive lesions is an issue of first impression in this circuit.based on the testimony of branscomb,p m argues that massive lesions refers to lesions the size of a chicken egg or of one lung,significantly larger than the centimeter lesion found by.the director,on the other hand,suggests that p m standard has no medical basis,and that t he term massive lesions is merely one of several ways of describing the condition known as complicated pneumoconiosis.respondent br.at.the director has the better of the argument 
neither the act nor the regulations defines the term massive lesions.although we would normally turn to the ordinary meaning of the words,dictionary definitions of the word massive are of little use here.therefore,we are obliged to examine other indicia of legislative intent,case law interpreting the black lung benefits act,and the regulatory history of the black lung regulations.all of these sources lend support to the director position that congress intended the term massive lesions to refer to the medical condition known as complicated pneumoconiosis.
the blba was originally passed as title iv of the federal coal mine health and safety act of the act,stat.title iv was renamed the black lung benefits act in.included in the legislative history of the act is a report of the surgeon general on coal workers pneumoconiosis.summarizing that report,the supreme court has explained that the medical community generally classifies pneumoconiosis as being either simple or complicated,with the latter form generally being more debilitating and producing more pronounced pathological effects 
simple pneumoconiosis,ordinarily identified by opacities of a limited extent,is generally regarded by physicians as seldom productive of significant respiratory impairment.complicated pneumoconiosis,generally far more serious,involves progressive massive fibrosis as a complex reaction to dust and other factors which may include tuberculosis or other infection,and usually produces significant pulmonary impairment and marked respiratory disability.this disability limits the victim physical capabilities,may induce death by cardiac failure,and may contribute to other causes of death.

the version of the bill that became the act compensated only the survivors of miners who suffered from complicated as opposed to simple pneumoconiosis,and that bill defined the term complicated pneumoconiosis using specific medical criteria.see,reprinted in,t his section provides for payments of compensation in respect of the death of an individual who,at the time of his death,was suffering from complicated pneumoconiosis.in conference,all references to complicated pneumoconiosis were eliminated and coverage was expanded to all miners who were totally disabled due to pnuemoconiosis and to the survivors of all miners who died due to pneumoconiosis,which the conference bill defined simply as a chronic dust disease of the lung arising out of employment in an underground coal mine,b,stat.the house definition of complicated pneumoconiosis was not ignored entirely,however.instead,the conference bill incorporated the house definition of complicated pneumoconiosis but not the term itself into the newly created c.see usery,at.noting that the house bill contained the diagnostic criteria presently embodied in c.thus,under the blba as enacted,a claimant is entitled to an irrebuttable presumption of causation under c if she satisfies the house definition of complicated pneumoconiosis,though the term complicated pneumoconiosis does not appear in the act.although a court must tread very carefully when reviewing the evolution of a statute prior to enactment,we believe this legislative history supports the director position that the term massive lesions is another way of referring to the medical condition known as complicated pneumoconiosis.
likewise,when discussing causation under the blba,the supreme court and this court have equated the criteria embodied in c with complicated pneumoconiosis.in usery,for example,the supreme court said that c provides that clinical evidence of a miner complicated pneumoconiosis gives rise to an irrebuttable presumption that his death was due to pneumoconiosis.at.see also id.at.under c,if a miner is shown by or other clinical evidence to be afflicted with complicated pneumoconiosis it is irrebuttably presumed that his death was due to pneumoconiosis.id.at.i f a miner can show by clinical evidence that he is afflicted with complicated pneumoconiosis then the miner is deemed to be totally disabled under c.pauley bethenergy mines,d describing c as creating an irrebuttable presumption when a miner present s medical evidence demonstrating complicated pneumoconiosis id.at.describing c as applicable to a miner for whom the medical evidence demonstrates the presence of complicated pneumoconiosis.
similarly,in alabama killingsworth,cir,this court noted that section c raises an irrebuttable presumption that a miner has died as a result of pneumoconiosis if the miner is clinically shown to have complicated pneumoconiosis.other circuits have made similar observations.see,freeman united coal min.foster,cir a ny miner suffering from complicated pneumoconiosis is irrebuttably presumed to be totally disabled by that disease.citing c peabody coal director,owcp,cir referring to the medical evidence of complicated pneumoconiosis set forth at lukosevicz director,owcp,cir same.although none of these decisions addressed the question we examine here,they support the director position that c refers to the diagnostic criteria for complicated pneumoconiosis.
finally,the regulatory history of the black lung regulations discusses c in terms of complicated pneumoconiosis.thus,for example,while amending the black lung regulations in,the department of labor described c as creating an irrebuttable presumption invoked by proof of complicated pneumoconiosis.regulations implementing the federal coal mine healt
