we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdicts.united states engler,cir.in,jacqueline started complete care.the complete care office was in jacqueline home and,for a time,in the northland office building in louis county.jacqueline,johnson,and silvers prepared the proposal for complete care to dhss.the proposal listed jacqueline and johnson as the owners of complete care and hayes as the vice president.dhss approved complete care proposal to provide services to clients.two written provider agreements between dhss and complete care were in effect from to june,and from july to june.barbara reuter,a quality assurance specialist with dhss,testified that dhss continued to deal with complete care as a provider of health services until july.trial tr.vol.ii.
in addition to owning complete care,jaqueline served as a supervisor.silvers was a supervisor at complete care and responsible for hiring and firing,training,handling employee and client files,working with nurses,and supervising staff.complete care documents also identify silvers as administrator.hayes was a supervisor at complete care and was responsible for receiving time sheets and billing.in addition to jaqueline,silvers,and hayes,some of the other individuals that worked at complete care are as follows ruth white buchanan ruth monica monica,silvers lawrence hayes lawrence,silvers nephew and hayes cousin earlean thelma thelma,silvers mother mary young young,a longtime friend of jacqueline lynette lynette,silvers cousin theresa theresa,silvers sister and hayes aunt sabrina silvers sabrina,silvers daughter and hayes cousin annie norman norman,the daughter of jacqueline and anthony johnson anthony,johnson husband.with the exception of norman,the district court determined that all of these individuals were the defendants coconspirators,regardless of whether they were indicted or not,and the defendants do not challenge this ruling on appeal.see trial tr.vol.vi.the coconspirators received immunity for their conduct related to this case in exchange for their cooperation.
ruth began working at vip in.while working there,ruth performed health services for her husband,silas buchanan,even though she knew that state regulations prohibited a personal care aid from providing services to a spouse thelma instructed ruth to use her maiden name white on all paperwork that she turned into vip and use her nondriver identification bearing her maiden name.silvers was present when thelma told ruth to use her maiden name,and silvers instructed ruth to use her maiden name on the time sheets that she completed for services to her husband.ruth did so for a number of years.
before ruth went to work at complete care,hayes brought a complete care application to ruth house and told her to fill it out exactly as she had her application at vip.ruth used her maiden name,white,on the complete care application,time sheets,and other documents.she testified that she signed the name white on any document associated with complete care.ruth turned in her time sheets at the complete care office on northland to hayes or whoever was in the office.ruth stated that she signed and submitted the time sheets in exhibit.each time sheet reflected five days of services that she provided to her husband.ruth again stated that she used the name white on the time sheets because she knew that missouri medicaid would not pay for services a wife rendered to her husband.see regs.ann.tit,h.on occasion,ruth mistakenly used her married name on time sheets.when this occurred,silvers would tear up the time sheet,give ruth another time sheet,and tell ruth to use her maiden name.silvers also asked ruth to sign time sheets for clients,other than silas buchanan,but ruth refused.silvers told ruth that she would find someone else to sign the time sheets.
ruth was present at the complete care office in jacqueline home when dhss conducted a monitoring visit.the monitors interviewed employees and reviewed documents,including personnel files.jacqueline pulled ruth to the side and told her to come into a bedroom.there,jacqueline told ruth to tell the monitors that her name was ruth white and use an address other than her own.hayes was present at jacqueline house when jacqueline made these statements to ruth,and hayes was in the room when state monitors interviewed ruth.ruth complied with jacqueline instruction during her interview with the state monitors.ruth also testified that she did not receive any training prior to providing services to her husband and did not receive the training reflected in exhibit,containing forms listing silvers as ruth.
monica testified that she initially worked at vip.however,she did not complete an application and was paid in cash so that the various types of public assistance she received would not be terminated or reduced.then,as vip was going out of business and monica was going to work at watkins loving care,silvers told monica that she could no longer be paid in cash because,if they kept the practice up,vip would be audited.monica and lawrence,at thelma suggestion and with silvers and earlean present,agreed that monica would perform services for clients,check the boxes of services she performed for clients on time sheets,and then lawrence would sign the time sheets.lawrence picked up the paychecks for the time sheets he signed for the work done by monica and split the money with monica.under this arrangement,monica continued working without her public assistance benefits being reduced or terminated.it is unclear from the record which company monica was working for under this arrangement.she testified that the company she was working for changed the name three times.trial tr.vol.v.thus,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdicts,engler,at,monica and lawrence operated under this arrangement at complete care and watkins loving care.after several months,the arrangement fell apart over a dispute as to the division of paychecks.
lawrence corroborated monica account of their arrangement.lawrence also testified that he did not actually perform any work at vip,but he signed time sheets at earlean and silvers request.they discontinued the practice because,according to lawrence,silvers stated that he was getting paid too much money.when silvers would not meet his price,lawrence stopped signing the time sheets.lawrence testified that he moved from one company to another and did not always know which company was operating out of different locations.although he is listed as providing services to clients on complete care time sheets in exhibit,complete care time sheets in exhibit,complete care time sheets in exhibit,and complete care time sheets in exhibit,lawrence testified that he did not sign the time sheets or provide services to the clients listed.lawrence further testified that he did not sign any of the documents in his complete care employment application,identified as exhibit.
earlean testified that she first worked at vip and then,in august,she began working at complete care.earlean advisors at complete care were hayes and jaqueline.earlean stated that she did not receive any training at complete care however,silvers signed a document,dated august,as earlean that stated that earlean had been provided training using a test client.earlean also testified that she did not go through a skills test with a test client as provided in the training waiver justification signed by silvers as earlean supervisor.
earlean identified exhibits,and as containing time sheets for three clients for whom she had never provided services and time sheets about six months of services for another client that she had served on only two occasions.the time sheets were initialed by hayes as earlean supervisor.earlean testified that hayes had talked to earlean about signing time sheets.hayes told earlean that she was the only one in the complete care office not signing blank time sheets which were later filled in to reflect services that the signatory had not performed and that earlean needed to do so.in compliance with hayes instruction,earlean began signing blank time sheets,and someone else completed them.in return,every pay period hayes gave earlean an envelope containing cash that was separate from her paycheck.
earlean also testified that her daughter,lynette,actually performed services for clients of complete care that complete care documents attributed to earlean.this was done so that the complete care records would show earlean receiving payment for those services,not lynette.earlean testified that this arrangement was a result of s ome kind of mixup with lynette social security numbers or something.trial tr.vol.iii.earlean further testified that she knew about the arrangement between lawrence and monica because earlean was at thelma earlean sister house when it was discussed.earlean stated that silvers and hayes discussed how much lawrence was to be paid to sign time sheets for monica.
lynette testified that she worked at complete care.she used a false social security number and listed other false information in her employment application,including listing her father address instead of her own.lynette stated that she was married when she began working for complete care and that she provided services to her husband.lynette testified that hayes knew that lynette was married.to conceal her marriage from dhss,lynette used her maiden name instead of her married name on her complete care application.lynette testified that she knew,at the time,that missouri medicaid would not pay for services that she provided to her husband.lynette testified that she used her maiden name on the time sheets in exhibit to conceal that she was providing services to her husband.although lynette name appears on time sheets in exhibit,she testified that she did not know the client,had never gone to the client home,and had not signed the time sheets.she also stated that she did not receive the required training as reflected in two pages of her complete care employment application these forms identify silvers as the.lynette testified that she also worked for watkins loving care.although lynette did not use a false social security number there,she and johnson agreed that lynette would provide services and johnson would pay lynette in cash so that lynette public assistance benefits would not be reduced or terminated.

on february,the jury returned its verdict.the jury convicted hayes on counts one and twelve and found her not guilty on the remaining eleven counts.the jury convicted silvers on all counts.on may,the district court sentenced hayes to months of imprisonment to be followed by months supervised release.the district court also ordered hayes to pay in restitution.on may,the district court sentenced silvers to months imprisonment on counts,to be served concurrently,and three years supervised release.silvers was also ordered to pay in restitution.appellants bring this appeal.
we first address hayes arguments on appeal,that the district court erred by denying the motion to dismiss the superceding indictment,batson challenge,objection to the deliberate ignorance jury instruction,motion for judgment of acquittal,and challenges to sentencing enhancements for her role in the offense and abuse of trust.
we review the district court denial of hayes motion to dismiss the superceding indictment de novo.see united states cvijanovich,cir.hayes asserts that in order for the superceding indictment to invoke the district court jurisdiction and to state the offense of health care fraud conspiracy it must sufficiently allege the existence of provider agreements between missouri medicaid and complete care because all allegations against her stem from her employment at complete care 
we first consider the district court jurisdiction.under,t he district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction,exclusive of the courts of the states,of all offenses against the laws of the united states.see also united states cotton,d a district court has jurisdiction of all crimes cognizable under the authority of the united states quoting lamar united states.pursuant to section,federal district courts possess original jurisdiction over all violations of federal law.united states watson,cir per curiam.the superceding indictment charges hayes with violating,and.because the indictment sufficiently alleges violations of laws of the united states,the district court had jurisdiction and correctly denied the motion to dismiss the superceding indictment on the ground that jurisdiction was lacking.see united states trotter,cir per curiam rejecting defendant argument that the district court erred in failing to dismiss his indictment for lack of jurisdiction b ecause the defendant was charged with an offense against the laws of the united states such that the court clearly had jurisdiction.
we next address whether the superceding indictment fails to state the offense of health care fraud conspiracy.
an indictment adequately states an offense if it contains all of the essential elements of the offense charged,fairly informs the defendant of the charges against which he must defend,and alleges sufficient information to allow a defendant to plead a conviction or acquittal as a bar to a subsequent prosecution.an indictment will ordinarily be held sufficient unless it is so defective that it can not be said,by any reasonable construction,to charge the offense for which the defendant was convicted.
united states sewell,cir.quotation omitted,cert.denied,d.furthermore,a n indictment is normally sufficient if its language tracks the statutory language.id.citing hamling united states,d.
count one charges that hayes,along with complete care,watkins loving care,jacqueline,johnson,silvers,and earlean,violated by participating in a conspiracy to commit a crime against the united states by defrauding a health care benefit program,see,and making false claims for health care benefit,see.section provides,in pertinent part 
if two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the united states,or to defraud the united states,or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose,and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy,each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years,or both.
the essential elements of a section conspiracy crime are that the defendants agreed with another,to commit crimes against the united states or violate the laws of the united states,and at least one overt act was committed in furtherance of the agreement.see id.
the superceding indictment specifies that the conspiracy took place in or about to in the eastern district of missouri and elsewhere indictment and provides that t he purpose of the conspiracy was to obtain medicaid reimbursement for services that were not provided or were provided by unauthorized or unqualified persons id.at.the superceding indictment also lists several overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy that jacqueline and complete care submitted an application to become a medicare provider,numerous examples of time sheets submitted by complete care that falsely reflected dates and times of service to clients and falsely identified persons purportedly providing the services,and receipt of medicaid funds for the false claims.id.at.because the superceding indictment tracks the language of the conspiracy statute,identifies the federal criminal laws that are the subjects of the conspiracy,alleges each of the essential elements of the crime of conspiracy,states the nature of the fraudulent scheme that was the subject of the conspiracy,specifies the approximate time period during which the conspiracy took place,states the place from which the scheme was allegedly operated,and specifies overt acts that furthered the conspiracy,the superceding indictment is sufficient as it pertains to the conspiracy charge.see sewell,at.
hayes asserts,without authority,that the superceding indictment fails to invoke the district court jurisdiction and to state the offense of health care fraud conspiracy because it does not contain sufficient allegations that a provider agreement existed between dhss and complete care.none of the statutes that hayes is charged with violating in the conspiracy count state that the existence of a provider agreement is a prerequisite for conviction or even mention a provider agreement.see.thus,the statutes provide no support for hayes assertion that such an allegation is required in the superceding indictment in order to sufficiently invoke the district court jurisdiction or state a health care fraud conspiracy offense in violation of the statutes listed in count one.
the missouri code of state regulations requires that an service provider have both a written provider agreement with missouri medicaid and that such an agreement is a prerequisite to obtaining reimbursement from missouri medicaid.indictment.however,it is undisputed that,regardless of what missouri regulations ordinarily require,complete care participated in the missouri medicaid program,sought reimbursement for services purportedly provided to disabled and elderly residents,and complete care was reimbursed by missouri medicaid.this occurred whether or not complete care had a provider agreement with missouri medicaid.we reject hayes argument that,absent the existence of a provider agreement between complete care and dhss,she was,essentially,free to make false statements to dhss,receive an unlimited amount of money,and be immune from prosecution.therefore,the lack of an allegation that a provider agreement existed between complete care and missouri medicaid at the time of hayes offenses does not render the superceding indictment insufficient in terms of jurisdiction or with respect to the stating of the offense of health care fraud conspiracy.accordingly,the district court did not err in denying hayes motion to dismiss the superceding indictment.
hayes next contends that the district court erred in denying her batson challenge to the government peremptory strike of venire person,an female,because the government explanation for striking her was not supported by the record.we review the district court batson ruling for clear error,keeping in mind that the ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with,and never shifts from,the party opposing the strike.united states bolden,cir.
courts evaluate batson challenges under a test.first,the defendant must make a prima facie case that the prosecution strike was motivated by race second,the prosecution must offer a reason for the strike and third,taking into account all the evidence,the trial court must find whether or not the prosecutor was motivated by purposeful discrimination.
kahle leonard,cir quotation omitted.
here,hayes raised a batson challenge when the government struck venire person.the district court determined that hayes had made a prima facie showing of a strike.the court then shifted the burden to the government to provide a reason for the strike.the government offered several reasons for striking venire person,one of which was that venire person was the only panel member that responded to the question about whether they would insist on hearing from everyone involved in the case and indicated that she would prefer to do so before making a decision in the case the government explained that her response tends to show that she would expect a high volume of proof,a high number of witnesses and comprehensive assessment by all witnesses which is,of course,not the government burden trial tr.vol.i.defense counsel responded,and,taking into account all of the evidence,the district court denied the batson challenge.
hayes asserts that the district court clearly erred because the government proffered reason was not supported by the record.however,the voire dire transcript provides that venire person expressed concern about whether everyone with information concerning the case would testify therefore,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in denying hayes batson challenge.
hayes also asserts that the district court abused its discretion in submitting a deliberate ignorance instruction to the jury because the government only presented direct evidence that she had actual knowledge of the scheme and no evidence that she was deliberately ignorant of the scheme we review the district court decision to give a jury instruction under the standard.our review of the district court decision to give a deliberate ignorance instruction must be done by viewing the evidence and any reasonable inference from that evidence in the light most favorable to the government.united states woodard,cir citation omitted.while a district court should not give the instruction when the evidence points solely to the defendant actual knowledge of the facts in question,the instruction is particularly appropriate when the defendant denies any knowledge of a criminal scheme despite strong evidence to the contrary.id.at quotation omitted see also united states whitehill,cir.a willful blindness instruction is not appropriate if the evidence implies the defendant could only have had either actual knowledge or no knowledge of the facts in question.quotation omitted,cert.denied,d.
at trial,hayes denied any involvement with or knowledge of the health care fraud conspiracy of which she was charged.however,the government presented evidence to the contrary.for example,earlean testified that,at one point,she had an exchange in the complete care office in which hayes told earlean that she was the only one in the office not signing time sheets,that they needed her to sign some time sheets for services that she had not provided,and that she did so.trial tr.vol.earlean stated that often she simply signed blank time sheets that were completed by those at the complete care office.id.at.earlean testified that every pay period,in addition to her paycheck,hayes paid earlean cash for the time sheets that earlean signed for services she had not performed.id.at.as another example,ruth testified that she completed her application for employment at complete care using her maiden name because hayes,who gave ruth the application at ruth home,instructed ruth to complete the application exactly as she had at vip.trial tr.vol.v.in addition to the evidence of hayes direct knowledge of the health care fraud conspiracy,the evidence showed that she was a supervisor and office manager at complete care,she was responsible for billing and time sheets,and she initialed,as supervisor,hundreds of time sheets that reflected services that had not actually been performed.trial tr.vol.iii.
in sum,hayes denied any involvement in or knowledge of the fraudulent scheme or the filing of false medicaid claims in the face of strong evidence to the contrary.in addition to the evidence of her actual knowledge of the scheme,hayes managed the complete care office and was responsible for submitting hundreds of fraudulent claims.therefore,the evidence justified a deliberate indifference instruction,see whitehill,at woodard,at,and the district court did not abuse its discretion in so instructing the jury.
hayes next asserts that the district court erred in denying her motion for judgment of acquittal.hayes raises the same arguments that we have already rejected in section ii.of this opinion,except that here she challenges her convictions based on the government failure to prove the existence of a provider agreement between complete care and missouri medicaid at trial rather than the sufficiency of the superceding indictment.as we have already determined that the government failure to allege the existence of such an agreement did not mar the superceding indictment,the same reasoning necessitates that we reject hayes contention.thus,we conclude that the district court did not err in failing to grant hayes motion for judgment of acquittal on this basis.furthermore,we note that barbara reuter,of dhss,testified that two written provider agreements between dhss and complete care were in effect from to june,and from july to june,and that dhss continued to deal with complete care as a provider of health services until july.trial tr.vol.ii.
hayes also argues that the government presented insufficient evidence for count to go to the jury.
we review de novo a district court denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal.we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and determine whether the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
united states clarke,cir quotation omitted.
count alleges that,in violation of,hayes and the other defendants,knowingly submitted a false statement in a matter involving a health care benefit program on or about august,
in that defendant gwen silvers completed and signed a training waiver justification form that falsely and fraudulently stated and represented that ruth buchanan had completed hours of training and had successfully completed a skills test on august,and have four hours of on the job training on august.
indictment.hayes does not dispute that the training waiver justification form is a false statement.rather,hayes contends that t here was no evidence that she was involved in or had any knowledge of this false statement with respect to the training waiver justification form.hayes br.in addition to section,the crime was also charged under an aiding and abetting theory,see,and the district court submitted an aiding and abetting instruction to the jury,without objection from hayes.hayes could be convicted under an theory if the government proved that she knew silvers was falsifying the training waiver justification form and committed an affirmative act to further silvers offense.see a see also united states mitchell,cir there are three essential elements of aiding and abetting the defendant associated herself with the unlawful venture the defendant participated in it as something she wished to bring about and the defendant sought by her actions to make it succeed.
the specific false representation alleged in count,the training waiver justification form,is contained in exhibit,the complete care employee file for ruth.hayes and silvers both signed off on forms included in ruth file.the only evidence as to the training waiver justification form,itself,was ruth testimony during the government direct examination.

trial tr.vol.v.
the government argues that the evidence was sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that hayes was guilty of aiding and abetting silvers falsification of the training waiver justification form because the evidence demonstrated that hayes,as supervisor and office manager,worked closely with all of the paperwork associated with complete care.the government also points to the fact that silvers signed off on the ruth training justification form,dated august,the same day hayes traveled to ruth home to have ruth fill out the complete care employment application portion of the file and instruct ruth to complete the application as she had at vip,to use her maiden name in order to hide that she was caring for her husband in violation of medicaid regulations.
despite the evidence of hayes involvement with the health care conspiracy at complete care and the fact that we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,there was no evidence that hayes knew silvers was falsifying the training waiver justification form or that hayes committed an affirmative act to further silvers offense.given the utter lack of evidence on either point,no rational juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that hayes aided and abetted the false statement.we therefore hold,as we must,that the district court erred in denying hayes motion for acquittal on the false statement charge.
hayes final contention is that the district court committed procedural error by incorrectly calculating her advisory guidelines range.see gall united states,d providing that we must ensure that the district court did not commit a significant procedural error,including improperly calculating the guidelines range.she argues that the court clearly erred by increasing her offense level by two levels,pursuant to united states sentencing commission,guidelines manual,c,on the ground that she was a supervisor of criminal activity and by two levels,pursuant to ussg,on the basis that she abused a position of trust in a manner that contributed to her offenses.
first,hayes asserts that the district court clearly erred in applying the supervisor enhancement.we review the district court decision to assess a sentencing enhancement based upon a defendant role in the offense for clear error united states,cir quotation omitted,cert.denied,d.ussg c provides that the sentencing court should increase the defendant offense level by two levels i f the defendant was an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor in any criminal activity involving less than five participants.hayes contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the enhancement because the record did not indicate that she had any decisionmaking authority at complete care.however,earlean testified that hayes was one of her supervisors at complete care and told her what to do and that hayes was also responsible for billing.trial tr.vol.iii.earlean also identified numerous time sheets with hayes initials as supervisor.id.at.in addition,ruth identified a complete care document in which hayes is titled office manager.id.at.also,hayes admits that she did the billing,worked with time sheets and made certain decisions about the business.hayes br.finally,complete care proposal to missouri medicaid identified hayes as complete care.trial tr.vol.ii.thus,the district court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement.
second,hayes contends that the district court erred in applying the enhancement.whether the defendant may occupy a position of trust is a question of law if so,whether she did is a question of fact.united states baker,cir.we review the legal component of the abuse of trust determination de novo and the district court factual findings for clear error.united states anderson,cir ussg provides that the sentencing court should increase the defendant offense level by two levels i f the defendant abused a position of public or private trust,or used a special skill,in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense 
determining what constitutes a position of trust for the purposes of is not a simple task.united states morris,cir quoting united states iannone,cir.
t he notion of trust embodied in the guideline is not the one contemplated by the ordinary dictionary concept of reliance or confidence for,in that sense,a bank trusts its tellers not to steal from the till.rather,as used in the guideline,position of public or private trust is a term of art,appropriating some of the aspects of the legal concept of a trustee or fiduciary.the lesser degree of direct supervision exercised over fiduciaries or senior employees as opposed to cashiers,and hence the greater difficulty in detecting their transgressions,may explain part,but not all,of the distinction where an individual makes himself particularly vulnerable by entrusting another with substantial authority and discretion to act on his behalf and then relies upon and defers to that person,a decision to take advantage of that trust and vulnerability is particularly abhorrent,as it undermines faith in one fellow man in a way that the ordinary pickpocket simply can not.

furthermore,b ecause there is a component of misplaced trust inherent in the concept of fraud,a sentencing court must be careful not to be overly broad in imposing the enhancement for abuse of a position of trust id.at quoting united states mullens,cir see also united states koehn,cir in every successful fraud the defendant will have created confidence and trust in the victim,but the sentencing enhancement is not intended to apply in every case of fraud.therefore,for the adjustment to apply in the fraud context,there must be a showing that the victim placed a special trust in the defendant beyond ordinary reliance on the defendant integrity and honesty that underlies every fraud scenario.united states williams,cir.
here,the primary victim of hayes fraudulent behavior is medicaid,a governmental program.in united states trice,cir per curiam,this court determined that the district court erred in applying the enhancement because the victim of the defendant offense,making a fraudulent statement,was the united states,and the defendant was not in a position of trust the united states id.at.in trice,the defendant,the president of a corporation formed to build a housing complex for handicapped individuals,pled guilty to making a fraudulent statement in violation of,after falsely stating on a united states department of housing and urban development hud form that he had never been convicted of a felony.id.the trice court explained that the enhancement did not apply because the relationship between trice and the united states was nothing more than an arm length business relationship.see united states septon,cir a n commercial relationship will ordinarily not suffice for the enhancement to apply baker,at w e agree with the fourth circuit that,as a matter of law,ordinary commercial relationships do not constitute a trust relationship sufficient to invoke the enhancement.quoting united states moore,cir.
within the health care fraud context,the majority of our sister circuits that have addressed the question have held that health care providers who defraud medicaid or medicare may be subject to the enhancement.see united states bolden,cir affirming the application of the enhancement because the defendant,the director of a nursing facility,occupied a position of trust with respect to medicaid because she possessed substantial discretionary authority,medicaid entrusted her with thousands of dollars in prospective payments to the nursing facility that were to be used for the benefit of its medicaid beneficiaries,a nd her abuse of that authority contributed significantly to the commission and concealment of the fraud scheme united states hoogenboom,cir affirming the application of the enhancement to psychologist who falsely billed medicare because m edical service providers occupy positions of trust with respect to private or public insurers such as medicare within the meaning of guideline united states gieger,cir affirming the application of the enhancement to owners of an ambulance transportation service provider convicted for conspiracy to submit false claims to medicare because the defendants carried out their fraud by abusing a position of trust united states wright,cir affirming the application of the enhancement where the defendants had embezzled funds from a residence facility because public funds were entrusted to the facility for the benefit of its patients,and the defendants,through their positions at the facility,had embezzled the funds without fear of timely detection by the government,who entrusted them with the funds for the of the intended beneficiaries.
however,the eleventh circuit has determined that,as a matter of law,a health care provider does not occupy a position of trust medicaid.see united states mills,cir,modified on reh g on other grounds,cir concluding that the defendants,officers and majority shareholders of a medicare services provider,were entitled to resentencing without the enhancement because a care provider does not occupy a position of trust medicare garrison,at remanding for resentencing,without enhancement,in part,because the defendant,the owner and chief executive officer of a home health care provider,did not hold a direct or position of public trust relative to the medicare program,the victim as statutory reporting requirements do not create a position of trust relative to a victim of the crime.
in denying hayes objection to the enhancement,the district court stated 
t he documents are replete with evidence that hayes signed off on a great many of the documents involved that were submitted to medicaid.medicaid relied on those documents.hayes set herself out as one who was in a position to execute those documents by signing off on them eith
