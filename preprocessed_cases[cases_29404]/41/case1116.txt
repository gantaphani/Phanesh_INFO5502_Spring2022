following a verbal,altercation with a female coworker in march of,eric jones was discharged from his post as a handler with the united states postal service usps.an arbitrator subsequently determined that jones dismissal was disproportionately harsh,which resulted in the usps returning him to active duty in july of.his reinstatement included backpay for all but days of wages and benefits lost during the period of his unemployment.despite having thus been made whole,jones filed the instant suit in federal district court seeking compensatory damages for having allegedly suffered emotional distress as a result of his earlier firing.he also sought attorney fees and costs.as grounds for the suit,jones alleged that his termination had been based on improper motives relating to his race,gender,physical disabilities,and prior litigious activity against the usps.
the district court granted summary judgment to the usps,holding that jones was unable to meet his burden of demonstrating that the usps articulated reason for his,its policy regarding violence in the a pretext designed to mask discrimination.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
jones employment with the usps began in,when he was hired as a mail handler.his employment has been marked by numerous as well as injuries followed by a corresponding number of workers compensation claims and changes in job status.in total,he has filed four claims,three of which have been allowed,and he has changed job title or status,full or limited duty no fewer than five times.
in,jones injured his cervical and thoracic spine while dumping bags of mail as part of his duties.he filed,and was allowed,a workers compensation claim for subluxation of the spine.at some point thereafter,the usps assigned jones to the position of handler.this job required minimal lifting and allowed jones to sit for eight hours a day.
in,he suffered new injuries as a result of a car accident,but was denied additional compensation because those injuries were unrelated to his accident.jones returned to status as a mail handler in late.but he reaggravated his preexisting injuries a little more than a year later while at work and was again placed on status as a handler.he was assigned to a different position in early,this time preparing flats of unbundled magazines.less than a month into his new job assignment,jones injured his wrist.he filed another workers compensation claim,which resulted in his being once again returned to the handler position.
usps policy required jones to support his claims and reassignments with medical documentation on an ongoing basis.for the most part,jones complied.but on two separate occasions near the end of,a workers compensation specialist in the akron office questioned why jones remained in the position,which was considered internally as having a lost production status.felton miller,jones supervisor,was promptly notified that jones had failed to properly document his claim of continuing problems in his neck,shoulder,and back.miller subsequently ordered jones off the clock for want of medical documentation at the end of january of.soon thereafter,jones filed a complaint with the eeoc.he was returned to his post as a handler a month later after his claim was resolved with the help of an eeo specialist.
the issues in the present appeal revolve around the events of march.that morning,unlike almost every other morning that had preceded it for the previous years,cynthia ortiz did not give jones a ride to work.the two had been intimately involved from through,but even after their relationship officially ended,ortiz continued to give jones a ride to and from work.they both worked for the same tour at the usps akron facility,and both were mail handlers.jones took exception to ortiz standing him up,and he confronted her once he eventually made his way in to work on the morning in question.
the parties strongly dispute what actually took place during this exchange,but for the purpose of this appeal from the grant of summary judgment,we must accept jones version of the events.in his testimony before the eeoc administrative law judge alj,jones recalled the confrontation with ortiz as follows 
i parked in the dock.i come in the building like i usually come in with cynthia.
and i said,thank you.
and she said,thank you for what 
i said,all i asked you was for a ride and if you could,to let me know.
and she was putting a package in an apc adjustable parcel container.
i was talking to her in her ear.i was close.
and she turned around and it knocked the coffee out of my hand.
and i said,that why we ca make it,is because you be acting so crazy.
she turned and put her hand in my face like,talk to the hand.
i moved her hand out of my face.
and she said,leave my work area,twice.
once she said it.and she said it loud.
i turned around and i walked away.
i went to my work area.
ortiz version of the confrontation indicates a much greater degree of misconduct by jones,including cursing and pushing.but even jones version concedes both that he initiated the confrontation with ortiz i said,thank you.and that he touched her at least once i moved her hand during the approximately two minutes that it lasted.
upon learning of the incident from an eyewitness and after talking personally with ortiz,supervisor miller sent both jones and ortiz home for the day.jones and ortiz subsequently gave several statements recounting their respective versions of the events.less than a week later,ortiz was placed on administrative leave with pay,but was not removed from duty.jones,however,was assigned to emergency placement without pay until further notice on the ground that he was injurious to others.in may of,jones received a notice of removal for having violated the usps policy regarding violence in the workplace.
the usps has a longstanding written policy that prohibits any and all forms of workplace violence.this policy provides in pertinent part as follows 
e ach and every act or threat of violence from this day forward,regardless of the people involved circumstances,will elicit a prompt investigation of facts and an appropriate response.while certain behaviors can lead to discipline or removal,our emphasis is on providing a safe and healthful workplace environment for each and every employee.
this zero tolerance policy places all employees on notice that threats,assaults,or other acts of violence committed against other postal employees or customers will result in severe disciplinary action.
procedural background 
jones filed several claims challenging his may termination as discriminatory.he first filed a grievance through the process set forth in the collective bargaining agreement between the usps and the national postal mail handlers union.this claim resulted in an arbitration award in jones favor that was issued in june of.the arbitrator determined,in essence,that jones punishment did not fit his crime.there was little doubt that jones actions,as an initial matter,fell within the scope of the usps policy.as the arbitrator explained 
despite his denials of having cursed the involved,called her a bitch or,even,to have forced her arm from his face pushed her against a mail container,his admissions of having entered her work area in a confrontational posture,having scolded her and having touched her,in doing so,had been sufficient misconduct for discipline purposes.
but these actions did not,in the arbitrator opinion,justify the severity of the discipline that the usps ultimately imposed on jones.instead,the evidence persuades that the behavior of the grievant had supported no more than a suspension penalty of days,which had long since elapsed.the arbitrator accordingly ordered the usps to reinstate jones and make him whole by awarding him lost wages and benefits for the period of his unemployment,less days.in july of,the usps complied with the order and returned jones to active status.
jones pending eeoc claim,which he had filed at the same time as his grievance,was ultimately resolved against him more than a year later.in that claim,he had alleged that his termination was the result of the usps discriminatory and retaliatory motives.following a hearing in november of,however,the alj determined that the usps policy on violence in the workplace constituted a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to fire jones.the alj further found that there was no evidence to indicate that jones race,gender,disability,prior litigious activity factored into the usps decision.
having properly exhausted his administrative remedies,jones filed suit in federal court.he again alleged discrimination on the basis of disability,race,and gender,as well as a retaliatory motivation.but as the district court noted,jones abandoned the race claim and minimized the gender and retaliation claims after the usps moved for summary judgment.his focus remained instead on his disability claim.accordingly,he argued that the rationale articulated by the usps for his,its policy regarding violence in the pretextual.
the district court disagreed,concluding that the evidence presented by jones was not sufficient to meet his burden of showing pretext.specifically,the court determined that the two affidavits that jones submitted from former coworkers kenneth johnson and geraldine smith were,respectively,nonsensical to the average juror and an isolated,remark which carries little weight towards proving a discriminatory animus.the court further noted that,because both affidavits require the to apply inferences to ascertain its meaning,they are not direct,competent evidence.jones presented no other evidence to demonstrate pretext,and the district court had already rejected his motion for a continuance that he claimed was necessary to allow him time to locate and add a potentially favorable witness.accordingly,the court granted summary judgment to the usps as to all of jones claims.this timely appeal followed.

standard of review for a grant of summary judgment 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.int l union cummins,cir.summary judgment is proper where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
standard of review for a claim of discrimination 
as a preliminary matter,jones argues that the district court erred in deferring to the decision of the eeoc administrative law judge,thereby denying jones a trial de novo in a district court.to be sure,the district court did note at the end of its opinion that,although it is not bound to do so,this court will grant due deference to these independent adjudicators the arbitrator and the alj,who,after hearing live testimony and assessing credibility of witnesses,found that the united states postal service had a legal,rational basis for imposing discipline upon eric jones.we need not rule on the merits of jones argument,however,because we must engage in the de novo inquiry that jones complains the district court failed to conduct.he is therefore assured of receiving the review that he alleges his claim is due.furthermore,jones insistence that he was specifically entitled to a trial de novo before a jury is misplaced because summary judgment,rule b dismissals,and all other accepted forms of pretrial disposition are specifically designed to weed out claims that lack merit as a matter of law.
the rehabilitation act,not the americans with disabilities act ada,constitutes the exclusive remedy for a federal employee alleging discrimination.see b i defining employers covered by the ada,but excluding the united states or a corporation wholly owned by the government peltier united states,cir t he rehabilitation act provides the remedy for federal employees alleging disability discrimination.under the rehabilitation act,n o otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance a.
to recover on a claim of discrimination under either the ada or the rehabilitation act,which in this circuit share the same substantive standard,a plaintiff must show that he is an individual with a disability he is otherwise qualified to perform the job requirements,with or without reasonable accommodation and he was discharged solely by reason of his handicap.monette data,cir see also macy hopkins county sch.bd.of,cir explaining that,unlike every other circuit save one,the sixth circuit continues to subject claims brought under either the ada or the rehabilitation act to the same substantive standard despite the linguistic differences between the two acts.
because jones attempts to meet this burden by presenting circumstantial,as opposed to direct,evidence of discrimination,we apply the familiar framework originally articulated in mcdonnell douglas green,d,and later refined in texas department of community affairs burdine,d.the initial burden rests with the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.monette,at.if the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case,the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged employment decision.burdine,at.should the employer carry this burden,then the burden returns to the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer proffered reason was in fact a pretext designed to mask illegal discrimination.see id.jones can defeat summary judgment only if his evidence is sufficient to create a genuine dispute at each stage of the mcdonnell douglas inquiry.see macy,at.
prima facie case 
although the district court granted summary judgment to the usps on the issue of pretext the third step under the mcdonnell douglas framework,the usps urges us to affirm the court decision instead on the ground that jones failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the rehabilitation act the first step.to do so,a plaintiff must establish each of the following five elements that he is disabled,that he is otherwise qualified for the job,with or without reasonable accommodation,that he suffered an adverse employment action,that his employer knew or had reason to know of his disability,and that,following the adverse employment action,either he was replaced by a nondisabled person or his position remained open.see timm wright state,cir see also monette,at setting forth the same prima facie elements under the ada.the final element may also be satisfied by showing that similarly situated employees were treated more favorably.talley bravo pitino,cir.
in the present case,the usps concedes that jones was disabled and that he suffered an adverse employment action.but the usps argues that jones was not otherwise qualified for the position of mail handler,that no similarly situated nonprotected employee was treated more favorably than he,and that his dismissal did not occur solely on account of his disability.
as an initial matter,the usps is correct in pointing out that,under de novo review,we may affirm on any grounds supported by the record even if different from the reasons of the district court.abercrombie fitch stores,am.eagle outfitters,cir.but its argument rests on an erroneous,and overly strict,understanding of jones prima facie burden at the summary judgment stage.his burden is not onerous,see burdine at,and requires less than a typical showing.as this court recently explained in macy,at 
in burdine,the supreme court stated that a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence the elements of a prima facie case in order to meet his burden under the first mcdonnell douglas step.burdine,at.however,the court was reviewing a bench trial,not a motion for summary judgment,and we have since made clear that a district court duty in reviewing a motion for summary judgment is to determine if a plaintiff has put forth sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find her to have met the prima facie requirements.cline catholic diocese of toledo,cir see also mary honor ctr.hicks,d stating that a question of fact remains for the jury if reasonable minds could differ as to whether a preponderance of the evidence establishes the facts of a prima facie case emphasis removed.
the district court acknowledged that jones could not,by his own admission,perform the job of a mail handler,but concluded that a jury could determine that he was qualified to perform the essential functions of a torn mail handler.but the job,the usps argues,was only a temporary position the job of mail handler was jones permanent position,and only permanent positions matter for the purposes of the otherwise qualified prong of the prima facie test.
we agree with the usps that jones was required to provide medical documentation on a regular basis to support his remaining in the position.absent such documentation,he was to be returned to his initial post.but this does not necessarily compel the conclusion that the position was not jones permanent job at the time that he was fired.he had,after all,been returned to that position two months before the incident with ortiz after only a brief stay among the regular mail handlers.in fact,since his first injuries in,jones had spent the majority of his time at the akron facility as a handler.at the very least,a jury could reasonably conclude that jones job was that of a handler and that he was therefore otherwise qualified to perform it.
whether jones was treated more harshly than similarly situated employees is a closer question.jones concedes that he can not show that he was replaced by a nondisabled person after his firing or that his position remained open,so we address only the alternative formulation of the final prong of the prima facie test.to be considered similarly situated,the individuals with whom the plaintiff seeks to compare treatment must have dealt with the same supervisor,have been subject to the same standards,and engaged in the same conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer treatment of them for it.gray toshiba am.consumer,cir quotation marks omitted.
jones identified as comparators ortiz and numerous other usps employees who had engaged in violence while at work.regarding ortiz,the district court concluded that she was not similarly situated to jones because of his own admission that he had been the instigator of their confrontation.she had not,in other words,engaged in the same conduct as he had.regarding the other usps employees who had engaged in workplace violence,the district court reiterated the conclusion of the alj that they were,in fact,treated the same as jones in that they were issued discipline,including notices of removal,for improper conduct.but this reasoning necessarily implies that not all of these employees were issued notices of removal.we therefore conclude that,at the very least,reasonable minds could differ as to whether a preponderance of the evidence establishes that jones was treated more harshly than similarly situated employees.see macy,at quoting hicks,at.
finally,the usps argues that jones can not establish that his dismissal occurred solely by reason of his disability.this argument,however,rests on an erroneous conflation of a plaintiff prima facie burden with his ultimate burden of prevailing under the rehabilitation act.to be sure,this court has stated on at least one occasion that a plaintiff seeking to establish a prima facie case under the rehabilitation act must show that the adverse employment decision that he suffered occurred solely by reason of his disability.peltier,at.but this formulation of the standard is inconsistent with this court seminal decision in monette electronic data systems,cir,and imposes too great of a burden upon the plaintiff at this early stage of the mcdonnell douglas inquiry.that inquiry,after all,applies only when the plaintiff lacks direct evidence of discrimination,as discussed in greater detail in part.below.
in monette,the court explained that p roof of these five facts constituting a prima facie case creates a mandatory inference that the employer intentionally discriminated against the disabled individual solely because of his or her handicap.at.an inference that the adverse action occurred solely by reason of the plaintiff disability,in short,is the result of the prima facie test,not an element of it.if the law were otherwise,the mcdonnell douglas framework would serve virtually no purpose in cases brought pursuant to the rehabilitation act and other statutes.
the usps argument is accordingly without merit.we agree with the district court that jones has raised genuine issues of material fact regarding his prima facie case that preclude a ruling in favor of the usps on this basis.
because the usps articulated a legitimate reason for its decision to fire jones that was unrelated to his disability,the remaining question is whether that reason was simply a pretext designed to mask discrimination.see burdine,at.demonstrating pretext is the employee burden.to satisfy his burden,jones must show by a preponderance of the evidence either that the proffered reasons had no basis in fact,that the proffered reasons did not actually motivate his discharge,or that they were insufficient to motivate discharge.manzer diamond shamrock chem,cir emphasis omitted.this court has typically grouped the first and third tests together because they are both direct attacks on the credibility of the employer proffered motivation for firing the employee and,if shown,provide an evidentiary basis for what the supreme court has termed a suspicion of mendacity.id.quoting hicks,at.the second test,by contrast,is of an entirely different ilk because the plaintiff admits the factual basis underlying the employer proffered explanation and further admits that such conduct could motivate dismissal.manzer,at emphasis in original.
jones effectively concedes that he can not prevail under the first test.the usps policy against workplace violence exists in writing,and jones conduct toward ortiz namely,pushing away her hand not only occurred by his own admission,but falls well within the policy scope.see id.the first type of showing is easily recognizable and consists of evidence that the proffered bases for the plaintiff discharge never happened,that they are factually false.emphasis and quotation marks omitted.regarding the third test,jones argues not that he can actually demonstrate that the policy was insufficient to motivate his firing,but simply that the district court erred in not allowing him to even attempt to do so.the district court indeed concluded that jones has available to him only the second method of showing pretext because the policy was in effect well before his confrontation with ortiz and because he was aware of its terms.
under this court caselaw,t he third showing is also easily recognizable and,ordinarily,consists of evidence that other employees,particularly employees not in the protected class,were not fired even though they engaged in substantially identical conduct to that which the employer contends motivated its discharge of the plaintiff.id.whether the district court erred in allegedly preventing jones from making this showing is immaterial,however,because we conclude that jones would not have been able to do so even if given the opportunity.this showing,in our view,is the flip side of the fifth prong of the prima facie test although jones was able to raise a genuine issue of material fact by showing that at least some similarly situated employees were treated more favorably,the fact that some were also treated identically by also receiving notices of removal indicates that his conduct was sufficient to motivate his firing.
the second test,then,indeed represents jones best opportunity to show pretext.his showing rests exclusively on the affidavits of johnson and smith.as noted earlier,the district court accorded l
