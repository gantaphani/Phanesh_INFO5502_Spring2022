plaintiff johnella richmond moses,as representative of the estate of marie,brings claims against defendants providence hospital and medical centers,the hospital and paul lessem pursuant to the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala,and common law negligence.plaintiff alleges that defendants violated emtala by releasing husband from the hospital ten days before he murdered.plaintiff appeals the district court decision to grant defendants motion for summary judgment and dismiss plaintiff claims.for the following reasons,we reverse the district court and remand for further proceedings with respect to the hospital,but affirm with respect to lessem.
background 
factual background 
on december,took howard to the emergency room of providence hospital in southfield,michigan because howard was exhibiting signs of illness.howard physical symptoms included severe headaches,muscle soreness,high blood pressure and vomiting.howard was also experiencing slurred speech,disorientation,hallucinations and delusions.reported these symptoms to the emergency room staff,and also informed them that howard had demonstrated threatening behavior,which made her fearful for her safety.joint appendix at.the emergency room physicians decided to admit howard to conduct more tests.among the physicians who evaluated howard during his stay at the hospital were mark silverman silverman,a neurologist lessem,a psychiatrist and djeneba mitchell mitchell,an internist.
silverman examined howard on december.silverman determined that howard was acting inappropriately and appeared to be somewhat obtunded,but had no overt outward signs of trauma.at.in addition to informing silverman of howard symptoms,also told him that howard had told her that he had bought caskets.at.silverman learned from that howard had recently tried to board a plane with a hunting knife.silverman ordered a magnetic resonance imaging exam,though it is unclear from the record whether the exam ever took place.silverman also felt that a psychiatric evaluation would be warranted,as well as a lumbar puncture.at.his notes from the evaluation indicate his belief that an acute psychotic episode must be ruled out.at.
lessem examined howard several times during howard stay at the hospital.on december,lessem determined that howard was not medically stable from a psychiatric standpoint,and decided that howard should be transferred to the hospital psychiatric unit called e ast to reassess him.at.according to lessem,east is intended for patients who are expected to be hospitalized and stabilized and who are acutely mentally ill.at.lessem felt howard could be more closely observed at east,and planned to conduct reality testing of howard there to determine the extent of howard delusions.at.lessem order notes from december,state,will accept patient to e ast if patient insurance will accept criteria and please observe carefully for any indications of suicidal ideation or behavior.at.under the heading orders for e ast,lessem wrote,suicide precautions.at.the notes also indicate that lessem believed howard had an atypical psychosis and depression.at.
howard was never transferred to the psychiatric unit,and instead was informed on december,that he would be released.a hospital clinical progress report signed by mitchell that day stated that patient declines e ast,wants to go home.his affect is brighter.no physical symptoms now.patient wishes to go home,wife fears him.denies any suicidality.at.howard stated in a deposition that he never declined going to east.in howard discharge summary form filled out on december,the hospital final diagnosis of howard,written by a resident,was that he had a migraine headache and an atypical psychosis with delusional disorder.at.a report dated december,signed by mitchell,indicated that howard would be discharged home today can not stay as he is medically stable and now does not need.at.howard was released on december,and on december,howard murdered.
on december,plaintiff filed a federal suit against the hospital and lessem,alleging a violation of emtala and various negligence claims.on january,defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint,on the ground that emtala only provides a right of action for a plaintiff who sought treatment as a hospital patient.on february,the district court denied defendants motion from the bench,stating,inter alia,that the plain language of the statute does not preclude a lawsuit by the injured third party.at.plaintiff filed an amended complaint on september.on january,defendants filed a complaint against howard.
ii.motion for summary judgment 
on may,defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.in their brief supporting their motion,defendants raised two arguments that plaintiff does not have standing to sue,because only the individual patient who seeks treatment at the hospital has standing under emtala and that emtala imposes no further obligation on a hospital once the hospital has admitted a person as an inpatient.defendants motion did not refer to any factual record,and they attached only the emtala statute and applicable regulations to their motion.
at oral argument before the district court on july,defendants argued for the first time that the hospital physicians,after conducting the proper screening,did not diagnose howard as having an emergency medical condition.at oral argument,defendants referred in general terms to the testimony and documentation of the hospital physicians who attended to howard to support this third argument,without producing the evidence they were referencing.neither the december,progress report stating that howard had no physical symptoms and denied suicidality,nor the december,progress report in which mitchell stated that howard was stable,was attached to defendants summary judgment motion however,both documents were attached to defendants response to a separate motion to compel discovery filed on april.during oral argument,defendants also referred to letters from howard insurance company indicating that the insurance company did not deny coverage for howard treatment until january,after howard had been released those letters were not submitted with defendants motion papers,nor are they included in the record on appeal.
following oral argument,the district court granted defendants summary judgment motion from the bench,dismissing the emtala claim and choosing not to exercise jurisdiction over the negligence claims.in dismissing the emtala claim,the district court stated that summary judgment must be granted regardless of the standing issue.at.the entirety of the district court reasoning for granting summary judgment was as follows 
first of all,the emtala statute was not designed or intended to establish guidelines for patient care or to provide a suit for medical negligence or malpractice.under the clear and unambiguous language of the statute,the plaintiff claim must be dismissed.the hospital admitted howard and did not turn him away,as was required by the sixth circuit in cleland bronson health care group,cir.the patient was undisputedly completely screened,as the statute requires,even if on the basis of a wrong diagnosis and he was thereafter admitted to the defendant hospital,and no emergency medical condition was recognized on the screening.so,for all of those reasons the motion of the defendants must be granted.
at.plaintiff timely appealed.
on appeal,plaintiff asserts that she did not receive fair notice that during oral argument defendants would rely on evidence that the doctors believed howard did not have an emergency medical condition.had plaintiff received proper notice,she asserts,she would have filed with her pleadings an expert report by harold bursztajn bursztajn,a professor of psychiatry at harvard medical school,who concluded that howard did have an emergency medical condition upon arriving at the hospital,and had not stabilized by the time he was discharged.bursztajn based his conclusion on lessem own notes from december,in which lessem had diagnosed howard as having an atypical psychosis and possibly suicidal behavior.bursztajn concluded that the symptoms and mental state described by lessem could not be resolved in one to two days,yet the decision to discharge howard was made one day later.at.bursztajn expert report was served and filed on october,as part of plaintiff reply materials in connection with an earlier motion to compel a mental examination of howard.plaintiff includes this expert report in the record on appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.monette electronic data,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.as the moving party,defendants bear the burden of showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact as to at least one essential element of plaintiff claim.see celotex catrett,d.plaintiff,as the party,must then present sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably find for her.see anderson liberty lobby,d.this court must then determine whether the evidence presents sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.id.at.in making this determination,this court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiff.see,smith,cir.
ii.overview of emtala 
for all hospitals that participate in medicare and have an emergency department,emtala sets forth two requirements.first,for any individual who comes to the emergency department and requests treatment,the hospital must provide for an appropriate medical screening examination to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition exists.a.second,if the hospital determines that the individual has an emergency medical condition,the hospital must provide either a within the staff and facilities available at the hospital,for such further medical examination and such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition,or b for transfer of the individual to another medical facility.b.thus,for any individual who seeks treatment in a hospital,the hospital must determine whether an emergency medical condition exists,and if the hospital believes such a condition exists,it must provide treatment to stabilize the patient.thornton sw.detroit,cir.
the statute defines emergency medical condition as a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity including severe pain such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in inter alia placing the health of the individual in serious jeopardy.e a i.to stabilize a patient with such a condition means to assure,within reasonable medical probability,that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to result from or occur during the transfer of the individual from a facility.e a.transfer is defined in the statute to include moving the patient to an outside facility or discharging him.e.
including the argument made for the first time during oral argument before the district court,defendants appear to have moved for summary judgment on three grounds plaintiff lacks standing to sue under emtala emtala requirements were satisfied when the hospital admitted howard on december,and because howard was indisputably screened and diagnosed as not having an emergency medical condition,emtala did not apply.because any one of these grounds would have been sufficient for the district court to grant summary judgment to the defendants,we address each of them in turn.
iii.standing 
in deciding defendants motion for summary judgment,the district court did not reach the issue of whether,as a,plaintiff has standing under emtala to bring a claim,although it did deny defendants previous motion to dismiss on that ground.because defendants prevailed below,this court may consider affirming summary judgment based on plaintiff lack of standing.see dandridge williams,d the prevailing party may,of course,assert in a reviewing court any ground in support of his judgment,whether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered by the trial court.
pursuant to emtala civil enforcement provision,a ny individual who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a participating hospital violation of a requirement of this section may,in a civil action against the participating hospital,obtain those damages available for personal injury under the law of the state in which the hospital is located,and such equitable relief as is appropriate.d a.neither this subsection,nor any other part of emtala,includes any mention of.moreover,this court is not aware of any federal appellate court that has addressed whether who allege harm as a result of a hospital violation of emtala have standing to sue.defendants cite two district court decisions from other circuits,which hold that the relatives of a patient who suffers harm can not sue a hospital in their individual capacities for harm suffered by the patient.see zeigler elmore county health care,d sastre hosp.doctor center,d rico.however,because the estate of the individual who suffered an actual personal injury brings the suit in this case,claiming personal harm as a direct result of the hospital decision,those decisions are inapposite and of limited persuasive value.
in the absence of an indication to the contrary,words in a statute are assumed to bear their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.walters metro.educ,d quoting pioneer inv.servs.brunswick ass ns,d.the plain language of the civil enforcement provision of emtala contains very broad language regarding who may bring a claim any individual who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a hospital emtala violation may sue.d a emphasis added.this language would seem to include plaintiff,whose suit alleges that death was the direct result of the hospital decision to release her husband before his psychiatric emergency medical condition had stabilized.
in arguing that only harmed patients may sue,defendants contend that the phrase any individual in d a must be read in the context of other parts of the statute.because the medical screening requirement in a refers to an individual who comes to the emergency department and the stabilization requirement in b refers to an individual who comes to a hospital,the term any individual in the civil enforcement provision should also be so limited.there are two problems with reading the statute this way.first,the medical screening requirement and the stabilization requirement do not refer to the same individual the medical screening requirement of a only applies to individuals who come to an emergency department,presumably a smaller subset of individuals than those who come to a hospital and are the subject of b.this differing language indicates that congress did not intend emtala entire statutory scheme to apply to the same individual in every part of the statute.second,the fact that the statute expressly limits the individual to whom the hospital owes its emtala obligations in a and b further indicates that the breadth of the civil enforcement provision was no accident.w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.russello united states,d see also united states,d.if congress had intended to limit the right of action to any individual who comes to a hospital as a patient,it could have done so,just as it did in other parts of the statute.see united states parrett,cir plain meaning is examined by looking at the language and design of the statute as a whole.
defendants also argue that emtala legislative history supports their narrower construct of the civil enforcement provision.the original bill,reported out of the house ways and means committee,extended the private right of action to any person or entity that is adversely affected directly by a participating hospital violation,pt,at,reprinted in.the bill was referred to the house judiciary committee,which amended the civil enforcement provision to a version essentially the same as its current form,changing adversely affected to suffers harm as a direct result,and changing person or entity to individual,pt.at,reprinted in.the report from the house judiciary committee states that as a result of its amendment to the bill,the only individual who can sue is the individual patient who suffers harm as a direct result of hospital failure to appropriately screen,stabilize,or properly transfer that patient.id.
however,where a house committee explanation of the meaning of a statute seems to differ from the statute actual wording,this court should not rely on that committee statement as the exclusive explanation for the meaning of the statute.see exxon mobil allapattah,d j udicial reliance on legislative materials like committee reports,which are not themselves subject to the requirements of article i,may give unrepresentative committee,worse yet,unelected staffers and the power and the incentive to attempt strategic manipulations of legislative history to secure results they were unable to achieve through the statutory text.in this case,the parties have not pointed to any further legislative history,other than the one statement from the report of the house judiciary committee,as proof of congress intent with respect to the scope of the civil enforcement provision.we have also failed to uncover any substantive debate over the provision on either the house or senate floors.as this court has previously noted in examining emtala legislative history,t he only clear guidance from the legislative history is that congress intended to prevent hospitals from dumping patients who suffered from an emergency medical condition because they lacked insurance to pay the medical bills.thornton,at.
regardless of the paucity of the legislative record on the standing issue,we believe that the civil enforcement provision,read in the context of the statute as a whole,plainly does not limit its reach to the patients treated at the hospital.we therefore need ought an isolated statement in a committee report.see united states choice,cir the language of the statute is the starting point for interpretation,and it should also be the ending point if the plain meaning of that language is clear.
we recognize that our interpretation of the civil enforcement provision may have consequences for hospitals that congress may or may not have considered or intended.however,our duty is only to read the statute as it is written,as we have in our past analysis of emtala.in cleland bronson health care group,cir,the defendants argued that because congress sought to protect the rights of the indigent and uninsured in enacting emtala,only the indigent or uninsured should be allowed to sue under the act.this court expressly rejected this narrow reading of the civil enforcement provision,stating that u nfortunately for this theory,congress wrote a statute that plainly has no such limitation on its coverage.id.similarly here,emtala plain language belies defendants argument that congress intended to deny the right to sue in every circumstance.
thus,for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that plaintiff has standing to sue pursuant to emtala.
iv.the hospital obligations upon finding an emergency medical condition 
defendants argue that,if howard did have an emergency medical condition when he came to the hospital,the hospital decision to admit him for six days and perform further testing satisfied its obligations under emtala to treat so as to stabilize the patient.we disagree.
contrary to defendants interpretation,emtala imposes an obligation on a hospital beyond simply admitting a patient with an emergency medical condition to an inpatient care unit.the statute requires such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition,b,and forbids the patient release unless his condition has been stabilized,c.a patient with an emergency medical condition is stabilized when no material deterioration of the condition is likely,within reasonable medical probability,to result from or occur during the patient release from the hospital.e b.thus,emtala requires a hospital to treat a patient with an emergency condition in such a way that,upon the patient release,no further deterioration of the condition is likely.in the case of most emergency conditions,it is unreasonable to believe that such treatment could be provided by admitting the patient and then discharging him.
in thornton,this court examined whether emtala requires hospitals to do more for patients with emergency medical conditions than just admit them.at.in that case,it was undisputed that the patient initially had an emergency medical condition when the defendant hospital admitted her to the emergency room for a stroke the issue was whether the hospital violated emtala by releasing her days later from the hospital regular inpatient care unit.id.although ultimately affirming summary judgment because the patient condition had stabilized prior to her release,this court first rejected the hospital argument that once it transferred the patient from the emergency room to inpatient care,its obligations under emtala were fulfilled 
congress sought to insure that patients with medical emergencies would receive emergency care.although emergency care often occurs,and almost invariably begins,in an emergency room,emergency care does not always stop when a patient is wheeled from the emergency room into the main hospital.hospitals may not circumvent the requirements of the act merely by admitting an emergency room patient to the hospital,then immediately discharging that patient.emergency care must be given until the patient emergency medical condition is stabilized.
id.at emphasis added.thus,the statute requires more than the admission and further testing of a patient it requires that actual care,or treatment,be provided as well.accordingly,defendants could not satisfy their emtala obligations merely by screening howard and admitting him to conduct further testing.
to support their narrower reading of emtala requirements,defendants point to a rule promulgated by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms,the agency responsible for implementing emtala,that effectively ends a hospital emtala obligations upon admitting an individual as an inpatient.d i.according to the cms regulation,i f a hospital has screened an individual under paragraph a of this section and found the individual to have an emergency medical condition,and admits that individual as an inpatient in good faith in order to stabilize the emergency medical condition,the hospital has satisfied its special responsibilities under this section with respect to that individual.id.
although a n agency construction of a statutory scheme that it is entrusted to administer is entitled to a degree of deference we must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent.gallagher croghan colonial bank,cir quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d.the cms rule appears contrary to emtala plain language,which requires a hospital to provide for such further medical examination and such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition.b a emphasis added.although treatment is undefined in the statute,it is nevertheless unambiguous,because it is unreasonable to believe that treatment as may be required to stabilize could mean simply admitting the patient and nothing further.moreover,the statute requires the patient to be stabilized upon release i f an individual at a hospital has an emergency medical condition which has not been stabilized the hospital may not transfer the individual unless the patient requests a transfer in writing or a physician or qualified medical person certifies that the risks of further treatment outweigh the benefits.c a.therefore,a hospital may not release a patient with an emergency medical condition without first determining that the patient has actually stabilized,even if the hospital properly admitted the patient.such a requirement would be unnecessary if a hospital only needed to admit the patient in order to satisfy emtala.because the cms rule i
