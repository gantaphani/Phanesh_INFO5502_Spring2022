background 
in,a coffee county circuit court jury in tennessee found thompson guilty of the murder of brenda lane,and following the sentencing phase of the trial,sentenced thompson to death.see state thompson.the tennessee courts affirmed thompson conviction on direct and collateral review.in,thompson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,and the district court denied the petition on february.on january,this court affirmed the district court dismissal of thompson petition.thompson bell,cir.on december,the united states supreme court denied thompson certiorari petition,and on january,denied his petition for rehearing.bell thompson,d.
thompson incompetency petition 
on january,the day after the supreme court denied thompson petition for a rehearing,tennessee attorney general filed a motion with the tennessee supreme court to set a date for thompson execution.on february,thompson filed a response opposing the state motion and a petition providing notice of his incompetency to be executed.on february,the tennessee supreme court set an execution date of august,but remanded the issue of thompson competency to the trial court.
under tennessee law,set forth in van tran state,a prisoner is not competent for execution if he lacks the mental capacity to understand the fact of the impending execution and the reason for it.under this standard,a prisoner seeking to be found incompetent for execution in tennessee has the initial evidentiary burden to make a threshold showing that his present incompetency is genuinely at issue in order to warrant an evidentiary hearing.id.at.in his petition to the trial court,thompson requested an evidentiary hearing to determine his competency,and submitted with his motion his prison medical records,along with the reports of three mental health rabun,george woods,and faye sultan who had recently examined him.
the medical records submitted to the trial court show that thompson has engaged in acts from the time his incarceration began,including swallowing poison,cutting his wrist and arms,and burning his hand and face.prison doctors began prescribing medication,including lithium,to control thompson mood swings as early as.joint appendix at.a medical report from indicated that thompson heard voices and believed he had gotten a snake bite on his finger and chest.at.in,prison doctors diagnosed thompson on two different occasions as schizophrenic,paranoid type and as having bipolar affective disorder.at.thompson was given prescriptions for klonopin and trilafon when he refused to take his lithium prescription.the psychiatrist who diagnosed him at that time reported that thompson had been displaying active evidence of psychosis and mania with marked grandiosity and delusional thought content.at.thompson was continually diagnosed as bipolar or schizophrenic throughout his incarceration.in,a prison doctor deemed thompson a mental health emergency because his mental illness was causing an immediate threat of serious physical harm to the or to others as a result of his violent behavior.at.the doctor report noted that voluntary medication had been ineffective.id.according to a physician who evaluated thompson in,thompson had been violent at times and had assaulted staff in the recent past which appears to be related to his mental illness.at.
rabun,a forensic psychiatrist in the pretrial evaluation unit of the louis psychiatric rehabilitation center in missouri,interviewed thompson for two and hours on march,and for another two hours on january.rabun also read thompson medical records and court files,and the reports of other mental health experts who had evaluated him since his incarceration began.thompson told rabun that he has heard voices intermittently since at least the time of his conviction,and that the voices become less acute when he takes antipsychotic medication.thompson also shared a number of delusions with rabun,including that he has written most of the songs you hear on the radio that he has millions of dollars,gold bars and a grammy award buried near a church in thomaston,georgia and that the united states navy owes him back pay dating back to.at.
thompson told rabun that he killed brenda lane,that he had been convicted of murder,and that he had been sentenced to death in connection with the killing.at.thompson also informed rabun that because he was a lieutenant in the navy and therefore had a right to be tried by a jury of professionals,his conviction should be overturned only the secretary of the navy could decide to execute him.at.thompson said that once everyone sees i am a lieutenant,the secretary of the navy will take control,and the case will be thrown out.at.thompson elaborated that when his buried fortune and grammy award are discovered,he will be deemed rehabilitated.id.thompson told rabun that he preferred execution by electrocution,because i am used to being shocked,every time i touch my tv,i get shocked,or when i went to a chiropractor in,he twisted my neck,and it felt like a shock.at.
rabun diagnosed thompson as schizophrenic,hallucinatory and delusional.having reviewed thompson medical records,rabun stated that thompson likely had been suffering from a psychotic illness for more than ten years,and that his illness was particularly severe when he did not take antipsychotic medications.rabun ruled out a physical or neurological disorder as the cause of thompson condition,and rejected the possibility that thompson had been malingering.at.rabun concluded that in his opinion,thompson lacks the mental capacity to understand the fact of the impending execution and the reason for it.at.
woods,a psychiatrist,examined thompson on february,for approximately three hours,and also reviewed thompson medical records,court file and transcripts from his legal proceedings.woods reported that thompson believes that he can not die,and there will be a period in which he will stay alive,even if he were executed.at.woods stated that thompson denied that electrocution would,in fact,eliminate his life.id.in addition to sharing with woods the same delusions reported by rabun,thompson also told woods that after death he was going to be in hawaii.id.woods diagnosed thompson as a schizophrenic suffer ing from a severe mental illness with psychotic features.id.woods noted that thompson suffers from extreme delusions and hallucinations,even while compliant with his prescribed medication regimen.like rabun,woods concluded that thompson is not competent to be executed.
sultan,a clinical psychologist and forensic consultant,submitted a letter dated february,in which she stated that she had conducted eleven clinical interviews of thompson since,with her most recent interview on january.sultan stated her belief that thompson has been schizophrenic at least since early adulthood,and reported that thompson has experienced the delusions,hallucinations,disorganized thinking,and disorganized speech and behavior that are all characteristic of his particular psychiatric illness.at.sultan stated that she had observed thompson off his medication,and concluded that i n a state,thompson is floridly psychotic.at.without medication,she stated,thompson is unaware of his surroundings,largely incomprehensible,and completely unaware about the reason for his incarceration,the sentence he had received,or the fact of impending execution.id.even with medication,thompson continues to exhibit the major symptoms of schizophrenia,has no real sense of his actual legal situation and lacks the understanding that the state of tennessee could legally execute him.at.sultan cited the same delusions that the other medical experts noted,including thompson claims of buried fortune in georgia,his military rank and his pending by a professional jury.id.sultan concluded that thompson currently lacks the capacity to understand the fact of his scheduled execution or the reason for it.at.
in addition to his medical records and the reports and affidavits from the three experts,thompson also presented the trial court with evidence that in the state had petitioned a tennessee court for the appointment of a conservator to make decisions on thompson behalf regarding his mental health and medical treatment.the conservatorship petition cited thompson long history of b ipolar d isorder and psychic symptoms,as well as thompson failure to comply with his medication prescriptions.at.in october,a state court terminated the conservatorship after finding that thompson was voluntarily taking his medication.
on march,the trial court denied thompson incompetency petition without holding an evidentiary hearing,finding that thompson had not made the requisite threshold showing of incompetency to warrant such a hearing.the trial court found that all three of the expert reports demonstrate clearly that thompson is presently aware that he is under a death sentence for the murder of brenda lane under the cognitive standard established by the supreme court.at.
the tennessee supreme court affirmed the trial court on may.the court found that although the expert reports indicated that thompson is currently suffering from schizophrenia,chronic undifferentiated type,the reports do not present facts indicating that thompson is unaware of his impending execution and the reason for it.thompson state.the court dismissed thompson documented history of mental illness as stale and not relevant to the issue of present competency.id.at.the court cited thompson ability to recount certain details of his crime,and his statements showing that he knows about his death sentence for the murder,as evidence that he is aware of his execution and the reason for it.id.at.the court also cited thompson assertion to woods that he will live for two years after his execution,and his statement to sultan that it is impossible for him to be executed,as further evidence that thompson understands that an execution is going to take place.id.at.the court acknowledged thompson delusions,but stated that t his court previously rejected a prisoner reliance on such delusional or unorthodox beliefs as irrelevant to the question of competency for execution.id.at.
on june,thompson filed a federal habeas petition challenging the state court competency ruling,and on june,the district court stayed thompson execution pending the outcome of the habeas petition.however,thompson habeas proceeding concerning his incompetency was stayed when,on june,this court amended and reversed its january,ruling affirming the denial of thompson original habeas petition.the state appealed this court amended decision,and on june,the supreme court held that this court had abused its discretion by withholding the mandate of its original judgment for more than five months after the supreme court denied rehearing on thompson petition for writ of certiorari.bell thompson,d.
following the supreme court denial of rehearing on august,the district court resumed thompson habeas petition based upon incompetency,which,by that time,had been stayed for more than one year.thompson argued that because so much time had passed,he should have the opportunity to update the state courts on his present condition.on september,the district court lifted the stay of execution so tennessee could set a date for thompson execution and thompson could the tennessee supreme court.the tennessee supreme court set an execution date of february,and on september,thompson submitted to that court a petition,authorized under the procedure set forth in van tran,at,showing that a substantial change in his condition had occurred since the court previous ruling thompson substantial change petition.
thompson argued in his substantial change petition that since he filed his first incompetency petition,thompson delusions had expanded,and his medications no longer worked.thompson included with his petition two affidavits from sultan based on her evaluations of thompson on july,and november.in the first evaluation,sultan found that thompson psychological condition had deteriorated and that it included a new set of irrational beliefs.at.sultan reported that thompson believed his execution and involvement in brenda lane murder were all predestined,and that all of the events of his life were written on a note that is buried at the church and will prevent him from being executed when it is discovered.id.sultan concluded that thompson can speak about the subject of death on a purely theoretical level but can not rationally talk about his own death.id.sultan second evaluation confirmed that thompson was continuing to deteriorate.thompson substantial change petition also included a new claim that if thompson is rendered competent for execution only because of the medication he takes involuntarily,then the execution is barred by the eighth amendment.on december,the tennessee supreme court denied thompson petition,finding that no substantial change had occurred.the court did not address thompson additional eighth amendment claim.
thompson then resumed his habeas petition based upon incompetency in the district court.on march,thompson amended the petition to add the eighth amendment claim that he had just presented to the tennessee supreme court with his substantial change petition.on may,the district court dismissed thompson petition,finding that the state courts decisions on thompson present competency for execution were neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,nor an unreasonable determination of the facts before them.with respect to thompson claim that it is unconstitutional to execute a prisoner rendered competent through medication,the district court determined that the claim was both in procedural default and,and that thompson had failed to state a claim in any event.the district court issued a certificate of appealability with respect to thompson original claim of incompetency.thompson timely appealed.on june,this court expanded the certificate of appealability to include thompson second incompetency claim as well.
ii.thompson rule b motion 
in his original petition brought in to challenge his conviction and death sentence,thompson raised ineffective assistance of counsel claims.four of those claims were that his trial counsel did not confront and a psychiatric expert testifying for the government,did not object to the prosecutor improper references to thompson failure to testify or present a defense,did not inform the court about the prosecutor racist remark in the presence of the jury,and failed to present mitigating evidence during the sentencing phase to show he would not be disruptive in prison.on collateral review,thompson had appealed these four claims to tennessee court of criminal appeals,but had not sought discretionary review of these claims with the tennessee supreme court.
when the district court dismissed thompson first habeas petition on february,it dismissed these four ineffective assistance claims for procedural default because of thompson failure to seek discretionary review of the claims.the district court therefore did not reach the merits of these claims.when thompson appealed the district court dismissal of his petition,he did not specifically challenge the district court procedural default ruling with respect to these four ineffective assistance claims.on june,while thompson appeal of the dismissal of his other claims was pending before this court,the tennessee supreme court promulgated tennessee supreme court rule t scr,which clarified that litigants need not appeal criminal convictions or relief actions to the tennessee supreme court to exhaust their appeals.thompson did not seek an expansion of this court certificate of appealability after tscr was issued.as already noted,this court initially affirmed the district court dismissal of thompson original habeas petition in january.thompson,at.following this court attempt to amend its ruling and the supreme court subsequent reversal,this court issued its mandate to the district court to dismiss the petition on december.
on january,thompson filed a motion pursuant to.b in the district court,alleging that the promulgation of tscr was an extraordinary circumstance warranting the of his original habeas petition.on march,the district court denied the motion,and denied a certificate of appealability.thompson timely appealed,and this court granted a certificate of appealability on june.
thompson appeals of the district court dismissal of his petition based upon his incompetency and its denial of his rule b motion have been consolidated before this court.
discussion 
thompson incompetency for executiona.standard of review 
this court reviews a district court dismissal of a petition brought pursuant to de novo,but reviews the district court factual findings for clear error.white mitchell,cir.
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa,a federal court may not grant a writ of habeas corpus to a state prisoner with respect to any claim adjudicated on the merits unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court,d,or the state court decision was based on an unreasonable application of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings.d.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law under d if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.an unreasonable application occurs when the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.a federal habeas court may not find a state court decision unreasonable simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.id.at.rather,the state court decision must be an objectively unreasonable application of federal law to be reversed.id.at.a habeas court must presume the state court factual findings are correct.e.
t he eighth amendment prohibits a state from carrying out a sentence of death upon a prisoner who is insane.ford wainwright,d.the supreme court derived this principle from reasons found in the common law that presently have no less logical,moral,and practical force than they did when first voiced.id.at.in ford,justice powell stated in a concurrence to the plurality opinion that prisoners are insane for the purposes of execution if they are unaware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why they are to suffer it.id.at.powell also opined that a state may,consistent with due process,presume a prisoner who was competent to stand trial is sane at the time of execution,and may require a substantial threshold showing of insanity merely to trigger the hearing process.id.at.powell concurrence,needed to create a majority,became the controlling opinion in ford and constitutes clearly established law for purposes of.panetti quarterman,d.
the panetti court clarified ford and substantial threshold showing standards.at.in panetti,the state court had denied the petitioner an evidentiary hearing despite his incompetency petition including a letter and a declaration from a psychologist and a law professor who had interviewed petitioner while on death row,id.at,as well as references to the extensive evidence of mental dysfunction considered in earlier legal proceedings,id.at.on habeas review,the district court found that the petitioner motion had been sufficient to meet the substantial threshold showing requirement,and the court therefore held an evidentiary hearing.at the hearing,four experts testified that the petitioner had a disorder resulting in a genuine delusion that recast petitioner execution as part of spiritual warfare between the demons and the forces of the darkness and god and the angels and the forces of light.id.at quotations omitted.according to the petitioner experts,the petitioner understood that the state wanted to execute him for the murders he committed,but believe d in earnest that the stated reason is a sham and the state in truth want ed to execute him to stop him from preaching.id.at.the district court denied the petitioner incompetency claim because the fifth circuit test for competency to be executed requires the petitioner know no more than the fact of his impending execution and the factual predicate for the execution.id.at.the court of appeals affirmed.
the supreme court in panetti first confirmed that the petitioner had made the substantial threshold showing when he filed his motion with the state court,and under ford was therefore constitutionally entitled to an evidentiary hearing.id.at.the court cited both the expert reports and the petitioner documented history of mental illness in reaching this conclusion.id.however,with respect to the competency standard applied by the lower courts,the supreme court stated that the court of appeals standard is too restrictive to afford a prisoner the protections granted by the eighth amendment.id.at.the court elaborated 
the court of appeals standard treats a prisoner delusional belief system as irrelevant if the prisoner knows that the state has identified his crimes as the reason for his execution.yet the ford opinions nowhere indicate that delusions are irrelevant to comprehen sion or aware ness if they so impair the prisoner concept of reality that he can not reach a rational understanding of the reason for the execution.if anything,the ford majority suggests the opposite 
the principles set forth in ford are put at risk by a rule that deems delusions relevant only with respect to the state announced reason for a punishment or the fact of an imminent execution,as opposed to the real interests the state seeks to vindicate.we likewise find no support elsewhere in ford,including in its discussions of the common law and the state standards,for the proposition that a prisoner is automatically foreclosed from demonstrating incompetency once a court has found he can identify the stated reason for his execution.a prisoner awareness of the state rationale for an execution is not the same as a rational understanding of it.ford does not foreclose inquiry into the latter.
it is therefore error to derive from ford,and the substantive standard for incompetency its opinions broadly identify,a strict test for competency that treats delusional beliefs as irrelevant once the prisoner is aware the state has identified the link between his crime and the punishment to be inflicted.
id.at,internal citations omitted.
in thompson case,the tennessee supreme court properly identified the standard by which to determine competency when it stated ford rule that a prisoner must be able to understand the impending execution and the reason for it thompson,at.accordingly,thompson petition may only be granted if the state courts unreasonably applied that standard to the facts of thompson case.see williams,at.as panetti makes clear,the state courts dismissal of thompson petition without conducting an evidentiary hearing was an unreasonable application of ford tenets.
first,the tennessee supreme court unreasonably applied ford when it determined that thompson severe delusions are irrelevant to a ford competency analysis.see panetti,at it is therefore error to derive from ford a strict test for competency that treats delusional beliefs as irrelevant once the prisoner is aware the state has identified the link between his crime and the punishment to be inflicted.thompson delusions relate to precisely the two concepts that justice powell required a prisoner to understand to be competent his impending execution and the reason for it.see ford,at.with respect to thompson understanding of his execution,he believes that only the secretary of the navy can execute him that electrocution will not eliminate his life,but that he will live for at least two more years after being electrocuted and that he will be for the crime once a professional jury is constituted.with respect to thompson understanding of the reason for his execution,although he seems to know on some level that it is for kill ing brenda lane,his understanding of the connection between his act of murder and the execution appears to be cursory at best,since he seems to believe that when his buried riches are discovered,he will be exonerated.
second,the tennessee supreme court determination that thompson documented history of mental illness is equally irrelevant to the question of his present incompetency was also unreasonable.see panetti,at citing petitioner extensive evidence of mental dysfunction considered in earlier legal proceedings as part of the basis for his threshold showing.although the court was correct that only thompson present competency was at issue,his medical records are relevant to that question,particularly to the extent that they demonstrate a chronic mental condition,or a condition that has only worsened over time.thompson medical history demonstrates his long history of bipolar disorder and psychic symptoms,and that he has been psychotic and delusional since at least.while this history is not definitive proof of thompson current incompetency for execution,it is at least probative of the seriousness of his illness and whether it is chronic.
regardless of whether thompson incompetency petition should be granted,his evidence has at least created a genuine issue about his competency,and therefore warrants an evidentiary hearing.thompson included extensive evidence of his incompetency in his petition,including the reports of three medical experts,two of whom had recently examined thompson on multiple occasions a long documented history of delusions and psychosis and the state previous effort to appoint a conservator to make medical decisions on his an acknowledgment by the state that thompson was mentally ill.the conservatorship was terminated less than five months prior to thompson competency petition filing,and only because a court found thompson had become voluntarily compliant with his drug program.the evidence thompson submitted was undoubtedly a substantial threshold showing,and therefore an evidentiary hearing should have been held.
because the tennessee courts unreasonably applied federal law clearly established by ford,this court does not afford aedpa deference to their dismissal of thompson petition.when a state court adjudication of a claim is dependent on an antecedent unreasonable application of federal law,the requirement set forth in d is satisfied.a federal court must then resolve the claim without the deference aedpa otherwise requires.panetti,at.accordingly,this court will remand the action to the district court to conduct thompson incompetency hearing and decide the merits of his incompetency claim de novo.
ii.competency through involuntary medication 
thompson alleges that he is involuntarily taking antipsychotic medication,and that it is unconstitutional to execute him if he is rendered competent through the forced administration of medication thompson chemical competency claim.thompson alleges that,having been forced to take medication in the past through the conservatorship proceedings,he could be required to take the medication again if he ever stopped voluntarily taking it.thompson also contends that he has been subjected to physical abuse by prison guards when he has refused medication in the past.finally,thompson states that he is currently addicted to the medication,and is now physically incapable of living without medication.the district court dismissed this claim as procedurally defaulted,and found that even if it were not procedurally barred,it would be untimely,and that in any event,thompson failed to state a claim.
procedural default 
the district court dismissed thompson chemical competency claim for procedural default because thompson fail ed to fairly present his claim to the state courts before offering it as a federal constitutional violation in a habeas proceeding.thompson bell,wl,at.may.the district court acknowledged that thompson raised his chemical competency claim with his substantial change petition,but found that the procedures set forth in van tran prohibited thompson from raising any other claims along with his claim that his condition had substantially changed.id.citing van tran,at.
in determining whether a procedural default has occurred and,if so,what effect the default will have on federal review of a state conviction,the district court must consider whether a state procedural rule exists that applies to the petitioner claim,the petitioner failed to comply with the rule,the state court actually applied the state rule in rejecting the petitioner claim,and the state procedural rule is an adequate and independent ground upon which the state can rely to deny relief.frazier hufman,cir.a procedural default does not bar consideration of a federal claim on habeas corpus review unless the last state court rendering a reasoned opinion in the case clearly and expressly states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar.id.at quoting harris reed,d.however,even if the state court failed to reject a claim on a procedural ground,the petitioner is also in procedural default by failing to raise a claim in state court,and pursue that claim through the state ordinary appellate review procedures.williams anderson,cir quoting boerckel,d see also deitz money,cir a federal court is also barred from hearing issues that could have been raised in the state courts,but were not.the corollary to this rule is that where a petitioner raised a claim in the state court but in violation of a state procedural rule,a state court must expressly reject the claim on that procedural ground for a federal court to deem the claim defaulted.see williams,at noting that a state court expressed rejection of a petitioner claim on procedural basis and petitioner complete failure to raise a claim in state court are the two ways a claim can be in procedural default.
thompson formally raised his chemical competency claim in his substantial change petition to the tennessee supreme court in september he included the chemical competency claim with that petition.the tennessee supreme court did not address the claim in its december,order denying that a substantial change had occurred.
according to the district court,thompson violated a state procedural rule,purportedly set forth in van tran,that a petitioner filing a substantial change petition may not raise any claims for the first time with his substantial change petition.yet the only statement in van tran regarding a petitioner motion for a finding of substantial change is as follows 
if a prisoner is found to be competent,subsequent ford claims will be disallowed unless the prisoner,by way of a motion for stay,provides this court with an affidavit from a mental health professional showing that there has been a substantial change in the prisoner mental health since the previous determination of competency was made and the showing is sufficient to raise a substantial question about the prisoner competency to be executed.
van tran,at.although the district court concluded from this statement that tennessee forbids a petitioner from bringing any new claims related to his incompetency for execution along with his substantial change petition,nothing in van tran explicitly states such a rule in fact,the reference in van tran to subsequent ford claims,in the plural,indicates that van tran anticipated that other incompetency claims would be brought in addition to a claim of substantial change.regardless,even if such a limitation existed,the tennessee supreme court,in denying thompson petition for a finding of substantial change,did not refer to it.the court rejected thompson argument that substantial change in his mental condition had occurred,and did not address or even mention thompson chemical competency argument.
the district court,in finding procedural default,cited castille peoples,d,for the proposition that a claim is not fairly presented to a state court where the claim is presented in a procedurally inappropriate manner which renders consideration on its merits unlikely.thompson bell,wl,at.may.however,the district court misinterpreted castille,which held only that,where a habeas petitioner had the opportunity to raise a claim in the state courts on direct appeal but only raised it for the first time on discretionary review,such a claim is not fairly presented.at see also clinkscale carter,cir finding that castille holding did not require a finding of procedural default because,u nlike the petitioner in castille,clinkscale raised his constitutional claim on direct appeal,in which there were no special limitations on the ability of the state court to reach the merits of that claim emphasis added.certainly,every time a claim is presented to a state court in violation of its own procedural rule,it is unlikely that the state court would consider its merits,but we nevertheless require a state court to expressly deny such a claim based on the procedural rule in order for the claim to be in procedural default.see caldwell mississippi,d the mere existence of a basis for a state procedural bar does not deprive federal courts of jurisdiction the state court must actually have relied on the procedural bar as an independent basis for its disposition of the case.in thompson it is unclear that there even was a state rule that barred him from raising his chemical competency express statement from the state court is even more necessary.
because thompson indisputably presented his chemical competency petition to the tennessee supreme court in his substantial change petition,this is not a case where we can find procedural default in spite of that court failure to reject the claim on a procedural ground.see williams,at.because the state court did not clearly and expressly state that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar,the rules of procedural default did not bar the district court from considering the claim.see frazier,at.thus,thompson chemical competency claim is not procedurally barred.
statute of limitations 
respondent argues,and the district court found,that even if thompson did not procedurally default on his chemical competency claim,his claim is still.with exceptions not relevant here,federal habeas petitioners in custody pursuant to a judgment in a state court must file their petitions within one year of the date judgment becomes final on direct review or the time to seek such review expires.d a.because thompson presented his chemical competency claim to the tennessee supreme court on september,in his substantial change petition,the state courts judgment with respect to the chemical competency claim first became final on december,when the tennessee supreme court denied thompson substantial change petition without addressing his chemical competency claim.thompson amended his federal habeas petition to include his chemical competency claim on march,well before the limitations period expired.accordingly,thompson chemical competency claim is not barred by the statute of limitations.
failure to state a claim 
standard of review 
if deference to the state court is inapplicable or inappropriate,we exercise our independent judgment and review the claim de novo.mckenzie smith,cir.where the state court has not addressed or resolved claims based on federal law,most courts,including this one,have held that the decision is not an adjudication on the merits.thus,a federal habeas court reviews such unaddressed claims de novo.howard bouchard,cir.because the tennessee state courts did not adjudicate thompson chemical competency claim on the merits,there is no state court decision to which this court can defer pursuant to d.accordingly,this court reviews the district court adjudication of thompson chemical competency claim de novo.in reviewing the district court determination that thompson failed to state a claim,this court accepts thompson factual allegations supporting the claim as true.see lewis acb bus,cir.
neither the supreme court nor the sixth circuit has squarely addressed whether the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment prohibits rendering a prisoner competent for execution through involuntary medication.however,in addressing previous due process claims,the supreme court has recognized that mentally ill state prisoners have a significant liberty interest in avoiding unwanted antipsychotic drugs.washington harper,d riggins nevada,d.considering whether a state may forcibly medicate a defendant to render him competent to stand trial,the supreme court has held that a state may do so only if the treatment is medically appropriate,in the patient best medical interest in light of his condition substantially unlikely to have side effects that may undermine the fairness of the trial and necessary significantly to further important governmental interests,given less intrusive alternatives.sell united states,d emphasis in original.although the court in sell found forcible medication permissible in that case because important governmental interests are at stake when the state tries to bring a defendant to trial,the court added special circumstances may lessen the importance of that interest.the defendant failure to take drugs voluntarily,for example,may mean lengthy confinement in an institution for the mentally that would diminish the risks that ordinarily attach to freeing without punishment one who has committed a serious crime.id.at.thus,the sell court reiterated the importance of a prisoner interest in avoiding forcible medication,and signaled that it may be unconstitutional to medicate a prisoner already destined for a lengthy confinement just to render the prisoner competent for legal proceedings.
although the supreme court in harper,riggins and sell addressed due process challenges and not eighth amendment claims,the logical inference from these holdings is that subjecting a prisoner to involuntary medication when it is not absolutely necessary or medically appropriate is contrary to the evolving standards of decency that underpin the eighth amendment.see trop dulles,d t he words of the eighth amendment are not precise,and their scope is not static.the amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.moreover,the main reason why justice powell viewed the execution of insane prisoners as cruel that their inability to understand the reason for their punishment robs them of the opportunity to prepare,mentally and spiritually,for their death,ford,at with equal force to those who have been rendered chemically competent involuntarily.if forced medication reduces a prisoner delusions and controls his outward behavior,but does not improve his understanding of his impending death or his ability to prepare for it,it is quite possible that the prisoner can not be executed under the principles of ford.
the concurring opinion,certain that prior supreme court precedent has already precluded such a claim,impermissibly ties loose strands of prior precedents together to reach its conclusion.essentially,our concurring colleague surmises that because the supreme court has held that forced medication is not inherently unconstitutional,and that executions are not inherently unconstitutional,the execution of a prisoner rendered competent through medically appropriate forced medication must be constitutional.this leap of logic ignores the supreme court repeated recent willingness to deem unconstitutional the execution of prisoners who the state previously had a legitimate right to those with mental or developmental deficiencies.see,atkins virginia,d prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded defendants roper simmons,d applying atkins to prohibit execution of prisoners who were under eighteen years of age at the time of their capital crimes.we simply do not share the concurring opinion certainty that,given the eighth amendment evolving standards of decency,trop,at emphasis added,a state right to execute a prisoner constitutionally hinges on administering pharmaceuticals that give an otherwise incompetent prisoner the appearance of competence 
regardless,in this case,it is not necessary to resolve these difficult questions,because regardless of whether the eighth amendment prohibits the execution of a prisoner rendered competent through the forced administration of medication,the district court did not err in holding that thompson failed to state a claim.even accepting all of thompson allegations as true,he is not being forcibly medicated right now.although he may be right that the state would forcibly medicate him if he stopped taking his medication voluntarily,those are not the facts he presents to us.thompson argument that his medication is involuntary because he is addicted to the drugs may be accurate from a physiological perspective,but does not amount to an allegation that the state is ordering him to take medication.because this appeal does not present the case of a prisoner who may only be competent by way of forced medication,this court will leave the question of whether executing the chemically competent constitutes cruel and unusual punishment for another day.the district court dismissal of thompson chemical competency claim is affirmed,without prejudice to thompson raising a chemical competency claim in the future should he be forcibly medicated 
iii.thompson rule b motion 
in the appeal of his other claims,thompson argues that the tennessee supreme court promulgation of tscr,which clarified that criminal defendants do not need to appeal their relief actions to the tennessee supreme court to exhaust their claims,demonstrates that the district court erred when it dismissed four of his ineffective assistance claims as procedurally defaulted.thompson argues that because the district court erred,it abused its discretion in denying his subsequent motion pursuant to.b to his original habeas petition with respect to those claims.we agree.

we recently found in in re abdur rahman,cir en banc abdur rahman i that the promulgation of tscr was an extraordinary circumstance.although the supreme court subsequently vacated that opinion in bell abdur rahman,d abdur rahman ii,the rationale behind our finding in abdur rahman i remains valid.in abdur rahman i,the district court,similarly to the district court in this case,had dismissed the petitioner habeas claims as procedurally defaulted for failure to seek discretionary review in the tennessee supreme court.abdur rahman i,at.in abdur rahman i,this court reversed the district court and held that the promulgation of tscr was an extraordinary circumstance warranting relief under rule b,because the new rule indicated that the district court had failed to recognize a state own procedural undermining the principle of comity on which aedpa is based.id.at.in gonzalez crosby,d,the supreme court addressed another habeas petitioner rule b motion,finding in that case that the petitioner was not entitled to relief.the court found that a recent supreme court decision,which changed the federal courts interpretation of the statute of limitations in d so as to render timely the petitioner previously claims,was not an extraordinary circumstance warranting relief pursuant to rule b.id.at.the gonzalez court noted that not every interpretation of the federal statutes setting forth the requirements for habeas provides cause for reopening cases long since final.id.at.the supreme court then vacated this court holding in abdur rahman i so this court could reconsider the case in light of gonzalez.abdur rahman ii,d.this court remanded the case to the district court,which found that the promulgation of tscr was still an extraordinary circumstance after gonzalez.bell,wl,at.may.
we agree that the enactment of tscr is an extraordinary circumstance,and that nothing in the supreme court opinion in gonzalez undermined this court reasoning in abdur rahman unlike the supreme court in gonzalez,which found that a change in federal decisional law by itself was not an extraordinary circumstance,this court in abdur rahman i found the enactment of tscr to be an extraordinary circumstance because refusing to recognize it would disserve the comity interests enshrined in aedpa by ignoring the state court view of its own law.at.a federal court respect for another state law was not at issue in gonzalez,in which the rule b motion was based solely on a change in federal decisional law interpreting a federal statute.see also blue diamond,at a change in decisional law is usually not,by itself,an extraordinary circumstance meriting rule b relief.emphasis supplied.because this court reasoning in abdur rahman i is still valid after gonzalez,today we reaffirm our previous holding that a motion based upon the promulgation of tscr is an extraordinary circumstance warranting relief under rule b.
however,a movant must also file a rule b motion within a reasonable time.c.although the federal rules do not mandate the specific time by which the motion must be filed,a movant lack of diligence can detract from the extraordinariness of the circumstance.gonzalez,at.whether the timing of the motion is reasonable ordinarily depends on the facts of a given case including the length and circumstances of the delay,the prejudice to the opposing party by reason of the delay,and the circumstances compelling equitable relief.olle henry wright,cir.
in this case,although thompson did not bring his rule b motion until january,than four years after the promulgation of tscr reasons for thompson delay are understandable.first,when the tennessee supreme court enacted tscr in june,it would have been pointless for thompson to file a rule b motion because at that time,rule b motions were deemed equivalent to successive habeas petitions see,mcqueen scroggy,cir.in abdur rahman i,this court held for the first time that a rule b motion which seeks to reopen a final judgment for reasons other than the merits of the petitioner substantive claim is not the equivalent of a successive habeas petition.at.
although thompson theoretically could have filed his rule b motion immediately after abdur rahman i was published,the appeal of his habeas petition was still pending on that date.this court did not issue its mandate to the district court to dismiss thompson habeas petition until december,prior to that date,the district court would not have had jurisdiction to hear his rule b motion.see pittock otis elevator,cir generally,a district court no longer has jurisdiction over an action as soon as a party files a notice of appeal.because thompson filed his rule b motion less than two months after we issued the mandate in his case,which he had been actively appealing until that time,we can not find a lack of diligence that would detract from the extraordinary circumstance reflected in the promulgation of tscr.
we recognize that where the judgment the movant seeks to reopen has already become final,courts are often reluctant to find an abuse of discretion in a district court denial of the rule b motion.see,stokes williams,cir.however,we must also heed the supreme court admonition that c onventional notions of finality of litigation have no place where life or liberty is at stake and infringement of constitutional rights is alleged.sanders united states,d.courts addressing rule b motions must consider the equities,and the incessant command of the court conscience that justice be done in light of all the facts.blue diamond,at see also matarese lefevre,cir rule b confers broad discretion on the trial court to grant relief when appropriate to accomplish justice it constitutes a grand reservoir of equitable power to do justice in a particular case and should be liberally construed when substantial justice will thus be served.internal citations and quotations omitted.in this case,the finality of the judgment against thompson must be balanced against the more irreversible finality of his execution,as well as the serious concerns about ineffective assistance that caused this court so much angst upon its prior consideration of thompson petition.because thompson should be heard on the merits of his four remaining ineffective assistance claims,we reverse the district court denial of thompson rule b motion.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth above,we reverse the district court denial of thompson rule b motion and his habeas petition based upon incompetency,and we remand for further proceedings.on remand,the district court shall first rule on the merits of thompson remaining ineffective assistance claims,and shall only address the incompetency question if it rejects the ineffective assistance claims on their merits.if the court rejects the ineffective assistance claims,it must then conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine thompson competency for execution.the district court dismissal of thompson chemical competency claim is affirmed.
the tennessee supreme court erred in affirming the tennessee trial court decision to reject thompson claim that he is incompetent to be executed without holding an evidentiary hearing on his sanity.thompson history of delusions and by,inter alia,three medical experts opinions,prison records spanning almost two decades,and conservatorship relevant in determining whether thompson is presently aware of his impending execution and the reason for it.see ford wainwright,d.accordingly,i concur with the majority conclusion in section i of the discussion,supra,that thompson has made a substantial threshold showing of insanity sufficient to warrant an evidentiary hearing on thompson present competency to be executed.see panetti quarterman,d ford,at.a remand to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on thompson present competency is required.
i also agree with the majority conclusion in section ii,supra,that thompson has failed to state a claim that he is presently being involuntarily medicated in violation of the eighth amendment thompson chemical competency claim.because the issue of chemical competency is admittedly not properly before us,the majority discussion on the issue is improper and dicta.however,as the majority has openly done so,i feel compelled to at least briefly explain why,in section i infra,the view taken by the majority is inconsistent with supreme court precedent.also,i write separately to express,in section ii infra,that thompson decision to raise his chemical competency claim in his substantial change petition to the tennessee supreme court was procedurally inappropriate.i also contend that thompson chemical competency claim is actually a collateral attack on his sentence and may not be raised in a second or successive habeas petition.
finally,as demonstrated in section iii infra,the majority clearly erred in holding that thompson rule b motion fails because he has not brought his motion within a reasonable time as required under.c.
as the majority explains,thompson formally raised his chemical competency claim for the first time in his substantial change petition to the tennessee supreme court in september.the district court found the claim procedurally defaulted because adding the claim in the substantial change petition was procedurally inappropriate.thompson bell,wl,at.may.the majority explains that because the tennessee supreme court did not expressly reject the claim based upon a state procedural violation,the claim is not procedurally defaulted.even if the majority is right,it does not matter because,as the majority expressly holds,thompson has failed to state a claim that the state is involuntarily medicating him.
thus,even though the claim is not properly before us,the majority nonetheless proceeds to express its view on the legal issue of whether a state can execute a prisoner rendered competent through involuntary medication.given the importance of this question,i feel it necessary to point out why the majority view of this it is likely cruel to execute those who have been rendered chemically competent inconsistent with supreme court precedent.
as the majority correctly notes,there is no supreme court decision directly addressing whether the eighth amendment forbids a state from involuntarily medicating an insane prisoner to restore his competency for execution.however,ford wainwright and several supreme court cases addressing fourteenth amendment challenges to involuntary medication make clear that involuntary medication is not inherently unconstitutional and is actually compelled in certain circumstances.
first and foremost,the supreme court has deemed the death penalty constitutional.gregg georgia,d furman georgia,d in ford wainwright,the supreme court addressed the eighth amendment limitation on a state power to execute the insane.the court found the proscription on executing the insane carried over from england and took hold in our common law at the time the bill of rights was adopted.ford,at.the court recognized many divergent theories for barring the execution of the insane,including moral,theological,and ethical arguments,but the court held one thing for certain the eighth amendment prohibits the state from inflicting the penalty of death upon a prisoner who is insane.ford,at.in his concurrence,justice powell offered a narrower opinion i would hold that the eighth amendment forbids the execution only of those who are unaware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why they are to suffer it.id.at powell,concurring.without a majority opinion,justice powell opinion controlled and set the standard for determining competency for execution.panetti.at.while ford limits a state right to executing the insane,it is an affirmation that the death penalty itself is constitutional.
in washington harper,the court considered the question of what limit the due process clause places on a state power to administer antipsychotic drugs to a mentally ill prisoner against his will.harper was a state prisoner who suffered from schizophrenia.harper,at.when he stopped voluntarily taking antipsychotic medications,the state began medicating him against his will under a state law authorizing involuntary medication to inmates who are gravely disabled or represent a significant danger to themselves or others.id.at.in resolving harper due process challenge to the forced medication,the court explained that a prison inmate possesses a significant liberty interest in avoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs.id.at.at the same time,the court cautioned that the outer limits of that liberty interest must be determined within the context of the prisoner confinement because the state has a counterbalancing interest in providing appropriate medical treatment to reduce the danger that an inmate suffering from a serious mental disorder represents to himself or others.id.at.thus,the court held that,in a prison setting,the due process clause permits the state to treat a prison inmate who has a serious mental illness with antipsychotic drugs against his will,if the inmate is dangerous to himself or others and the treatment is in the inmate medical interest.id.at.harper thereby affirmed a state right to impose involuntary medication under certain conditions.
applying harper in the pretrial context,the court in riggins nevada considered the state authority to involuntarily medicate a prisoner to render him competent to stand trial on serious criminal charges.riggins nevada,d.the riggins court reiterated that an individual has a liberty interest in avoiding the involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs,id.at,and explained that only a state essential or overriding interest could overcome it,id.at.the court explained that rendering an accused competent to stand trial for murder would be one such interest,and held that involuntary medication would not violate due process if the state demonstrated that treatment with antipsychotic medication was medically appropriate and,considering less intrusive alternatives,essential for the sake of riggins s own safety or the safety of others.id.at 
the supreme court subsequently applied the framework erected by harper and riggins in sell united states,d,where the court articulated a analysis courts must use in determining whether involuntary medication may be used to render a defendant competent to stand trial.the government must establish,by clear and convincing evidence the existence of an important governmental interest that involuntary medication will significantly further that important interest that involuntary medication is necessary to furthering the important interest and that the administration of the drugs is medically appropriate,in the patient best medical interest in light of his medical condition.id.at.
the sell court emphasized that the analysis applies when a court is seeking to determine whether involuntary administration of drugs is necessary significantly to further a particular governmental interest,namely,the interest in rendering the defendant competent to stand trial.id.at.however,the sell court also explained that a court need not conduct the analysis if forced administration is warranted for a different purpose,such as the purposes set out in harper related to the individual dangerousness,or purposes related to the individual own interests where refusal to take drugs puts his health gravely at risk.id.citing harper,at.guided by sell,this court now applies the sell standard when the involuntary medication is requested to restore competency to a pretrial detainee and the pretrial detainee is not a danger to himself or others,but this court applies the harper standard if he does pose a danger to himself or others.see,united states green,cir.
additionally,states are constitutionally required to provide medical care to inmates.estelle gamble,d holding that the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment,made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment due process clause,requires the state to provide adequate medical care to prison inmates.that duty exists as long as the prisoner is confined and is not extinguished or diminished because the inmate may be under sentence of death.see,singleton,at reasoning that the best medical interests of the prisoner must be determined without regard to whether there is a pending date of execution.indeed,in this circuit,we hold the state accountable for deliberate indifference a violation of the eighth the state culpably fails to treat an inmate serious medical need.see,harrison ash,cir see also blackmore kalamazoo county,cir defining a serious medical need as one that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor attention.
in short,as outlined above,the state has the following rights and obligations prisoners the state is obligated under the eighth amendment and the due process clause to attend to a prisoner serious medical needs.estelle,at.the state is also not restricted by the due process clause from involuntarily medicating a prisoner if he is a danger to himself or others.harper,at.the state is further permitted under the constitution to medicate a defendant to render him competent to stand trial.sell,at.and the state may carry out the death penalty,baze rees,d,so long as the prisoner is competent on the eve of his execution,ford,at.
it follows,then,that if all of the predicate acts of carrying out a valid death sentence on a mentally ill inmate are either constitutionally required or permitted,and the death penalty itself is constitutional,the state imposition of the death penalty to an inmate rendered competent via involuntary medication must also be constitutional.in other words,it is illogical to conclude that while the state has a duty to provide an inmate with medical care and can also render the prisoner competent to stand trial and possibly receive the death penalty,the state is barred from carrying out the death penalty if that medical care successfully reduces the symptoms of a mental illness and,as a result,the inmate regains his competency.
the en banc eight circuit is of a similar view.in singleton norris,the en banc court considered analogous issues to those raised by thompson,namely the interrelated issues of whether the state may forcibly administer antipsychotic medication to a prisoner whose date of execution has been set and whether the state may execute a prisoner who has been involuntarily medicated under a harper procedure.singleton,at.singleton was under a harper order of involuntary medication,which he argued was initially valid while his execution was stayed but which subsequently became unconstitutional once his execution date was set.id.at.the en banc court disagreed,reasoning that the decision to medicate under harper is made based upon the best medical interests of the prisoner,and must be determined without regard to whether there is a pending date of execution.id.at.thus,according to the court,the mandatory medication regime,valid under a pendency of a stay of execution,does not become unconstitutional under harper when an execution date is set.id.
singleton also claimed that the eighth amendment barred his execution because the state was rendering him artificially competent especially so that he could be executed.id.the eighth circuit rejected that argument too,explaining that the state was under an obligation to administer antipsychotic medication and,therefore,any investigation into whether the state had other motives was unnecessary and irrelevant.id.at.the court held,then,that a state does not violate the eighth amendment as interpreted by ford when it executes a prisoner who became incompetent during his long stay on death row but who subsequently regained competency through appropriate medical care.id.
accordingly,based upon the supreme court precedent cited above,holding that an involuntarily chemically competent prisoner may not be executed would be problematic because it would tie the hands of state officials who may be involuntarily medicating inmates to satisfy their obligation to provide appropriate medical care and ensure the safety of prison employees and inmates.those officials would be faced with the hobson choice between administering medically appropriate treatments to the mentally ill inmate population under harper and risking the possibility that lawfully imposed sentences may not be carried out.in that instance,it will likely be the inmates in need of medical treatment that suffer.
as the singleton court held,ford prohibits only the execution of a prisoner who is unaware of the punishment he is about to receive and why he is to receive it.at.and medications may reduce the symptoms of psychosis enough that a prisoner may be found.medications may further quell the symptoms enough that a prisoner regains the opportunity to prepare,mentally and spiritually,for his death.ford,at.accordingly,a is adhering to either the harper standard in involuntarily medicating a dangerous individual,or simply acting on its responsibility to address the medical needs of its not violate the eighth amendment by executing a mentally ill inmate who is receiving antipsychotic medications so long as the prisoner meets the ford standard for competency.
