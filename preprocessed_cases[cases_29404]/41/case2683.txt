the court hereby withdraws the opinion issued in the matter on october,and substitutes the following therefore.
this appeal requires us to determine whether the district court properly rescinded its order converting a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.we must also determine whether the court properly denied defendants qualified immunity.after reviewing the record and the parties briefs,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
the following facts are taken from plaintiff complaint.on april,mitchell vinson harper was arrested by town creek,alabama police officer joe fike for failing to appear in court on public intoxication charges.fike transported harper to the lawrence county jail in where he was processed and incarcerated by kevin blake robinson,a jailer.as alleged,harper did not receive an appropriate or reasonable medical examination screening upon admission to the jail.
according to the complaint harper was an alcoholic,and while in jail he experienced severe alcohol withdrawal.he displayed symptoms of that affliction,including hallucinations,slurred speech,incoherence,and difficulty walking.robinson wilford jerome reed,another jailer,contacted fike and informed him of harper strange behavior.fike informed one or both of them that he fike would contact jerry garrett town creek police chief about harper behavior,and that the town creek would make a decision regarding harper medical care.during a shift change robinson reed informed tim taylor,a lawrence county jailer,of harper behavior.moreover,inmates informed taylor,reed and robinson of harper strange behavior,informing them that harper was saying crazy things,was talking off the wall,and was having trouble keeping his balance.harper did not receive any medical care and died of problems related to alcohol withdrawal in the lawrence county jail on april,four days after his arrest.
plaintiff sheila harper,the personal representative of harper estate,filed a complaint on april,against the following defendants lawrence county,the lawrence county commission,lawrence county sheriff gene mitchell,jail administrator kenneth mitchell,jail administrator mary brown,taylor,reed,robinson,the city of town creek,garrett,and fike.see.in count i plaintiff sued all defendants under for deliberate indifference to harper serious medical needs,as prohibited by the fourteenth and eighth amendments in count ii plaintiff sued all defendants for negligence and wantonness under alabama state law for failing to provide medical treatment

ii.discussion 
conversion of motion for summary judgment back into motion to dismiss 
defendants claim that the district court erred in rescinding its order converting their motion to dismiss to a summary judgment motion.we disagree.it is permissible for a district court to rescind its own interlocutory order.see,toole baxter healthcare,cir in this case,the court order for a new trial was an interlocutory order,and therefore the trial court had the power to revoke it and reinstate the judgment.hardin hayes,cir district court may reconsider and amend interlocutory orders at any time before final judgment.
we review a district court reversal of its own interlocutory order for abuse of discretion.see,lanier,carbone props.of mobile,llc,cir t the district court denial of the plaintiff motion for leave to amend the complaint was simply an interlocutory decision which the district court had ample discretion to reconsider.sanchez,cir a bsent a particularly egregious abuse of discretion,district courts are free to reconsider their interlocutory orders.internal quotation omitted.
we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in rescinding its order converting defendants motion to dismiss to a summary judgment motion.the court made clear when it did so that discovery was stayed,and that it did not consider any evidence outside the pleadings when ruling on the motion as a motion to dismiss.further,the parties are not precluded from filing a summary judgment motion in the future.
defendants argue that it was not enough for the court to have declined to consider the outside documents in ruling on the motion to,it should have excluded them pursuant to rule d this argument has no merit.a judge need not convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment as long as he or she does not consider matters outside the pleadings.according to case law,not considering such matters is the functional equivalent of excluding is no more formal step required.see,jones auto.ins.of hartford,cir i f the judge does consider outside matters,if the judge does not exclude them,rule b requires the judge to comply with the requirements of rule.emphases added see also,austin modern woodman of,cir w e discern no reversible error in the district court refusal to construe the defendants motions to dismiss as motions for summary judgment.although the parties motions had affidavits,the record demonstrates that the district court did not consider matters outside the pleadings.ware milk producers,cir although rule b provides that a b motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment when matters outside the record are presented to the court and not excluded,in the instant case the express wording of the order of dismissal affirmatively indicates that the district court did not consider the matters.
in sum,we find that the district court properly exercised its discretion to reconsider and rescind its order converting defendants motion to dismiss into a summary judgment motion.
denial of qualified immunity 
the court analyzed plaintiff section claims for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs and determined that they were not subject to dismissal under rule b based on qualified immunity.with one exception,we agree rule a requires only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.the supreme court has clarified that to satisfy rule,f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.bell atl.twombly,d.the plaintiff must allege enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,to nudge the claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.id.at.
however,this circuit has tightened the application of rule in section cases where qualified immunity is at issue,like this one.in such cases,the heightened pleading standard applies and s ome factual detail in the pleadings is necessary.gjr,county of escambia,cir see also danley allen,cir under the heightened pleading requirement,the relevant facts must be alleged with some specificity.internal quotation omitted.the purpose of the heightened pleading standard is for the plaintiff to provide facts with sufficient detail for defendants to understand what alleged rights were violated and which of their actions allegedly violated those rights,as well as for the court to determine whether those facts indeed set out a violation of rights and whether those rights were clearly established when these incidents occurred.amnesty int l,usa battle,cir.
here,plaintiff brought claims for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs against individual defendants.specifically,she brought two different types of deliberate indifference claims those for personal participation against gene mitchell,kenneth mitchell,brown,reed,and robinson and those for supervisory liability against gene mitchell,kenneth mitchell,and brown 
below,we analyze both types of claims to see if the district court correctly denied defendants qualified immunity.
personal participation claims 
as stated above,gene mitchell,kenneth mitchell,brown,reed,and robinson all asserted qualified immunity as a defense to the personal participation section claims against them.this circuit generally follows a analysis to determine if qualified immunity applies to any section claim.the first step is to determine whether the defendant conduct amounted to a constitutional violation,and the second step is to analyze whether the right violated was clearly established at the time of the violation.lewis city of west palm beach,cir.whether a constitutional right was clearly established at the time of the violation turns on whether it would be clear to a reasonable defendant that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.gray ex rel.alexander bostic,cir internal quotation omitted.we recognize three sources of law that would put a government official on notice of statutory or constitutional rights specific statutory or constitutional provisions principles of law enunciated in relevant decisions and factually similar cases already decided by state and federal courts in the relevant jurisdiction.goebert lee county,cir.
violation of constitutional rights 
to perform the first step of the qualified immunity analysis,we must determine whether plaintiff properly stated a personal participation claim for deliberate indifference under the fourteenth amendment against gene mitchell,kenneth mitchell,brown,reed,and robinson.specifically,plaintiff must sufficiently allege both an objectively serious medical need and that a defendant acted with deliberate indifference to that need.burnette taylor,cir to establish deliberate indifference,plaintiff must demonstrate that defendants had subjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm disregarded that risk and acted with more than gross negligence.id.she must also show that those defendants conduct caused harper injuries.see marsh butler county,cir.
with respect to the subjective knowledge component,we have stated that defendants must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,and must also draw the inference.bozeman orum,cir internal quotation omitted.i mputed or collective knowledge can not serve as the basis for a claim of deliberate indifference.each individual defendant must be judged separately and on the basis of what that person knows.burnette,at.
here,there are two main ways plaintiff alleges defendants knew of harper serious medical needs.first,plaintiff claims that they had full knowledge that harper was an alcoholic who would experience delirium tremens dt due to alcohol withdrawal if left untreated,because he had been arrested before and placed in the lawrence county jail on various charges.compl.at.she also alleges that during the course of one or more of his prior arrests harper informed the defendants that he had a history of seizures due to alcohol withdrawal.id.at.however,these allegations do not meet the rule standard,much less the heightened pleading standard.plaintiff did not offer any facts to suggest why these defendants in particular a sheriff,two jail administrators,and two jailers would know of harper specific medical history,nor did she offer any specific facts regarding harper past arrests.moreover,even if those defendants did know of harper history of alcoholism past arrests,they would still have needed to know that harper was in serious need of medical attention during the time period in question,april,to april.in our view,plaintiff does not raise her right to relief above the speculative level in this instance.twombly,at.
second,plaintiff claims defendants were aware of harper condition because of his symptoms and behavior at the jail.specifically,plaintiff alleges that several days after his initial incarceration harper was hallucinating,slurring his words,physically weak,and incoherent.according to the complaint,reed robinson told both taylor and fike that harper was displaying erratic and strange behavior.compl.at.the complaint also alleges that other inmates informed reed and robinson that harper was acting strangely,losing his balance,and had urinated on himself.id.at.based on these allegations we hold that plaintiff adequately alleged reed and robinson had actual knowledge of the risk of serious harm to harper if left untreated.however,the complaint does not allege how the other three defendants,sheriff gene mitchell and administrators kenneth mitchell and brown,could possibly have had such actual knowledge.thus,the court should have dismissed the personal participation claims as to those three defendants based on qualified immunity,and we reverse the district court order in that respect.
as explained above,plaintiff must also sufficiently allege that reed and robinson disregarded the risk of serious harm to harper with conduct that was more than negligent.o fficials,to be liable for deliberate indifference,must be aware of a substantial risk of serious harm to the inmates and not take reasonable measures to alleviate that risk.marsh,at.deliberate indifference can include the delay of treatment for obviously serious conditions where it is apparent that delay would detrimentally exacerbate the medical problem,the delay does seriously exacerbate the medical problem,and the delay is medically unjustified.taylor adams,cir internal quotation omitted.
here,plaintiff alleges that reed robinson called fike regarding harper strange behavior.fike allegedly told one or both of them that he fike would contact garrett about harper behavior,and that the town creek defendants would make a decision regarding harper medical care.plaintiff also alleges that reed robinson told taylor about harper behavior at the shift change.however,despite their awareness of harper condition,neither reed or robinson took any steps to actually secure immediate medical attention for harper,whose need for prompt treatment appeared dire.thus,plaintiff adequately alleged that reed and robinson violated harper fourteenth amendment rights.
were harper rights clearly established at the time 
in order to clear the qualified immunity hurdle for reed and robinson,plaintiff must also show that harper rights under the fourteenth amendment were clearly established at the time they were allegedly violated.we find that plaintiff can clear this hurdle.this circuit has stated that its prior cases established that a jail official who is aware of but ignores the dangers of acute alcohol withdrawal and waits for a manifest emergency before obtaining medical care is deliberately indifferent to the inmate constitutional rights.lancaster monroe county,cir see also id.morrison clearly established that sheriffs and jailers can not place or keep a chronic alcoholic in jail without any medical supervision,when the defendants are aware that the alcoholic is suffering from a severe form of alcohol withdrawal.citing morrison washington county,cir.
thus,plaintiff properly stated personal participation section claims for deliberate indifference against reed and robinson,and the district court was right to deny those defendants qualified immunity.we therefore affirm the district court in that respect.
supervisory liability claims 
plaintiff also sues gene mitchell,kenneth mitchell,and brown for deliberate indifference in their capacity as supervisors.because those defendants asserted qualified immunity to the supervisory liability claims against them,we must again perform the qualified immunity analysis.that is,we must analyze whethe
