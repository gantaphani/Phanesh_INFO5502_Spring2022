the family medical leave act fmla mandates that certain employers provide employees suffering from a serious medical condition up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave per year.see a d.employees,however,have several duties concomitant to this right.for instance,an employer may require an employee submit medical certification documenting his medical condition before the employer authorizes fmla leave.see a b see also id.b a sufficient certification is one that,inter alia,states the probable duration of the condition.fmla regulations outline the medical certification process,including the respective duties of the employer and employee.see,d.the regulations also set forth the remedies available to an employer when an employee fails to provide a medical certification as prescribed by law.b.this appeal presents the question of whether a jury could reasonably conclude that united states postal service usps willful ly violated the fmla in denying tony bass request for fmla leave.see c.
the fmla statute of limitations applies only to cases brought for willful violations of the fmla.id.all other fmla claims are subject to a limitations period.id.c.plaintiff filed the underlying fmla interference claim more than two years,but less than three years,after his fmla claim accrued.see id.plaintiff maintains usps willfully violated the fmla by refusing to accept his medical certification and,on that basis,denying his request for fmla leave.the district court disagreed and granted summary judgment in usps favor.on appeal,plaintiff contends the district court erred in concluding that the fmla limitations period is inapplicable.we exercise jurisdiction under,and affirm.
we recount only those underlying and procedural facts material to resolving the instant appeal.plaintiff worked for usps from until may,when usps terminated his employment.plaintiff had a history of failing to abide by usps attendance and leave policies.plaintiff attendance problems were apparently sufficiently serious that they prompted usps,in september,to take removal action against plaintiff.plaintiff returned to work in december,however,under a last chance agreement lca.the lca afforded plaintiff a final opportunity to continue his employment on certain terms.plaintiff lca mandated that if he violated usps attendance and leave requirements again,he would be terminated.plaintiff had additional attendance issues and,on february,acknowledged his breach of the lca.rather than terminating plaintiff,usps gave plaintiff another chance and extended the lca terms for an additional eight months.hence,at the time plaintiff requested fmla leave on march,the request spawning this litigation,he was employed under the lca.
no later than august,date plaintiff submitted his first medical certification first certification usps was made aware that plaintiff suffered from chronic lower back pain,which typically reoccurred several times per year.on march,a bout of back pain caused plaintiff to be absent from work and,accordingly,to request fmla leave.the next day,march,usps acting fmla coordinator jack lapp wrote plaintiff to inform him that his first certification was incomplete.
specifically,lapp noted plaintiff first certification lacked the requisite information regarding the typical frequency and duration of his chronic back pain.lapp explained information relevant to frequency and duration must be completed,p hrases such as unknown,indefinite,intermittent and occasionally are not acceptable,but approximations,days every months were permissible.see appellant appx.at emphasis in original additional emphasis omitted.second,lapp letter underscored plaintiff sixteen unscheduled absences during the preceding period.further lapp specified that unless plaintiff submitted a complete certification within fifteen days of receiving the march letter,his leave would not qualify under the fmla and he would be subject to possible disciplinary action by usps.third,lapp indicated that if plaintiff was unable to comply with the march,deadline,plaintiff was required to contact him to arrange for a reasonable time within which to provide it.see id.the march letter also enclosed a blank certification form and literature explaining plaintiff fmla rights.shortly thereafter,lapp met with plaintiff to discuss these issues 
on march,plaintiff timely submitted a second medical certification second certification.like the first certification,the second certification frequency and duration information proved inadequate.by generic letter dated march,usps fmla coordinator linda daniels notified plaintiff that he was scheduled for a mandatory,april,fmla consultation to review his documentation.daniels then met with plaintiff and expressly informed him of the second certification deficiencies.she also imposed a second,april,deadline by which plaintiff was required to submit a completed certification.
on april,plaintiff made an appointment with his health care provider to obtain the required frequency and duration information.the earliest available appointment was on april,plaintiff claims he informed someone who worked for daniels that he would be unable to meet the april deadline.plaintiff does not,however,identify or describe who he spoke with or clarify whether he contacted daniels office directly.daniels,as well as the two people responsible for taking messages,denied receiving such a message from plaintiff.
in any event,plaintiff missed the april deadline.on april,daniels sent plaintiff a letter disapproving his fmla leave request.daniels noted that days had elapsed since march,the date usps first advised plaintiff he needed to provide proper frequency and duration information.she further noted that at their april meeting she had advised plaintiff that his failure to submit the requisite information would result in disapproval of all fmla leave taken after march.nevertheless,plaintiff had still not submitted a completed medical certification form or indicated that he would be unable to so by the april deadline.daniels recited governing regulation b requirements regarding medical certifications.next,she outlined plaintiff absences from march,through april,and stated that they would be changed from conditionally approved fmla leave to unexcused absences,subjecting plaintiff to corrective action.see appellant appx.at.lastly,daniels stated that,even if plaintiff submitted a completed medical certification,the dates listed would not be changed to approved fmla leave.rather,usps would treat the submission of a proper certification as a request for fmla leave from the date usps received such documentation.
on april,plaintiff supervisor made a disciplinary action request based on plaintiff failure to document his unscheduled absences and late or no since march.that same day,plaintiff health care provider examined him and provided the frequency and duration information usps required certification record plaintiff did not,however,submit that document to usps until april,when he returned to work.usps concedes the certification record cured the deficiencies in plaintiff earlier certifications.indeed,daniels testified that,had plaintiff provided the certification record by the deadline,she would have deemed plaintiff absences approved fmla leave.because plaintiff failed to do so by april,however,daniels refused to excuse those absences under the fmla.on april,the usps plant manager where plaintiff worked issued him a notice of proposed removal,citing plaintiff multiple unexcused absences between march and april,which put him in breach of the lca.ultimately,usps terminated plaintiff employment on may.
plaintiff filed his complaint on april,alleging usps willfully interfered with his right to fmla leave in violation of a usps filed a.b motion to dismiss,arguing fmla statute of limitations barred plaintiff complaint.see id.c.the district court converted usps motion into a.c motion for summary judgment.after providing the parties notice and an opportunity to present evidence,the district court granted summary judgment in usps favor.plaintiff appeals,contending that a genuine issue of material fact remains as to whether plaintiff claim is for a willful violation of the fmla.we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same legal standard employed by the district court.see yaffe,great am.ins,cir.de novo review also applies to a district court ruling on the applicability of a statute of limitations.see wright sw.bell,cir.on appeal,plaintiff argues that a genuine issue of material fact remains as to whether usps conduct was willful because usps failed to give plaintiff a reasonable opportunity to respond to usps request for medical documentation supporting his fmla request.plaintiff further contends that although the district court recited the correct standard of willfulness,it actually applied a more stringent,erroneous standard.we disagree.
we first address the meaning of willful for c purposes.generally,a fmla claim may be brought under this section not later than years after the date of the last event constituting the alleged violation for which the action is brought.c.w illful fmla violations are,however,subject to a statute of limitations.id.c.section c provides in full in the case of such action brought for a willful violation of of this title,such action may be brought within years of the date of the last event constituting the alleged violation for which such action is brought.
the fmla does not define the term willful and,to date,the supreme court has not spoken to its meaning under c.see samuels kansas city,missouri sch,cir.in mclaughlin richland shoe,d,however,the supreme court construed the term willful under the fair labor standards act flsa analogous statute of provision.under mclaughlin willfulness standard,a plaintiff must show that the employer either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute.mclaughlin,at.emphasis added adopting the willfulness standard for age discrimination in employment act claims articulated in trans world airlines,thurston,d.as the mclaughlin court reasoned 
in common usage the word willful is considered synonymous with such words as voluntary,deliberate,and intentional.the word willful is widely used in the law,and,although it has not by any means been given a perfectly consistent interpretation,it is generally understood to refer to conduct that is not merely negligent 
if an employer acts reasonably in determining its legal obligation,its action can not be deemed willful even i f an employer acts unreasonably,but not recklessly,in determining its legal obligation its conduct is not willful.
id.at.emphasis added.
we have not previously addressed fmla limitations period in a published decision.but,importantly,our sister circuits have applied mclaughlin standard to fmla statute of limitations.see,hoffman prof l med.team,cir adopting mclaughlin reasoning porter new york.sch.of law,cir per curiam same hanger lake county,cir same hillstrom best tlc hotel,cir same.as the first circuit explained,employing the flsa willfulness standard to the fmla claims makes eminent sense 
mclaughlin,a decision,predated the enactment of the fmla.the statutes use the term willful in similar ways and in identical contexts both provide for a statute of limitations except in cases of willful violations,when a limitations period applies.when enacting the fmla,congress is presumed to have known the definition that the supreme court had given to the term willful.
hillstrom,at see also porter.at adopting hillstrom reasoning.
we find our sister circuits reasoning sound and hold that mclaughlin willfulness standard applies to the fmla.compare c,with a.for c statute of limitations to apply,a plaintiff must demonstrate that his employer knew or showed reckless disregard for whether its conduct was prohibited by the fmla.mclaughlin,at.see also hanger,at noting that,under mclaughlin willfulness standard,an employer general knowledge regarding a statute potential applicability does not prove willfulness.applying this standard,we turn to the instant appeal.
in this case,the facts plaintiff presents do not demonstrate that usps conduct rises to the level of a willful fmla violation.see c.we underscore that the question presented is we expressly do not usps violated the fmla or its regulations.rather,we must only assess whether a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether usps willfully violated the act.we further note the case law dictates if some intent to avoid the fmla consequences is finding of willfulness will not necessarily follow where the employer tried to comport with the law and tenable reasoning undergirded its conduct.see hoffman,at emphasis added.our review of the record in light of the applicable law reveals that usps endeavored to comply with fmla medical certification process.see,d.
for example,fmla regulation,entitled when must an employee provide medical certification to support fmla leave,provides in relevant part 
an employer must give notice of a requirement for medical certification each time a certification is required in most cases,the employer should request that an employee furnish certification from a health care provider at the time the employee gives notice of the need for leave at the time the employer requests certification,the employer must also advise an employee of the anticipated consequences of an employee failure to provide adequate certification.the employer shall advise an employee whenever the employer finds a certification incomplete,and provide the employee a reasonable opportunity to cure any such deficiency.
a,c d.usps clearly adhered to these strictures.the day after plaintiff requested fmla leave on march,lapp informed plaintiff his second certification was incomplete.see id.d.at that time,lapp also advised plaintiff of his rights and obligations under the fmla in writing.see id.a,c.lapp further explained the consequences that would result if plaintiff failed to timely submit a sufficient certification to usps.see id.d.moreover,lapp thereafter met with plaintiff to further explain the certification process.
when plaintiff second certification proved deficient,usps promptly scheduled a second meeting with plaintiff to explain the first second certification failed to detail the duration and frequency of plaintiff medical condition.see id.a,c d.only after plaintiff failed to meet the second,april,deadline for providing a complete certification did usps deny plaintiff fmla leave request.put simply,plaintiff presented no evidence to suggest that usps knowingly violated,or acted in reckless disregard of,the fmla strictures.plaintiff,therefore,failed to demonstrate any material issue of fact remains on the question of willfulness see c see also hoffman,at cases under the adea and flsa statutes analogous to the fmla have found willfulness most frequently in situations in which the employer deliberately chose to avoid researching the law terms or affirmatively evaded them.collecting cases.
plaintiff arguments to the contrary are unavailing.plaintiff first insists usps wilfully violated b see id.assuming without deciding that usps violated b,we can not find that usps refusal to approve plaintiff fmla leave request amounted to a willful violation of the fmla under the facts presented.see c.usps gave plaintiff specific written notice of his rights and obligations under the fmla,specifically describing his obligation to provide a sufficient medical certification requirement and the consequences that would follow if he failed to do so by the stated deadline.perry jaguar of troy,cir recognizing that when an employee first asks for fmla leave,the employer must give specific written notice of the employee obligations,including the duty to provide medical certification and the consequences for failing to do so.plaintiff produced no evidence that usps knowingly violated or acted in reckless disregard of fmla requirements when it enforced its april deadline and subsequently refused to consider plaintiff certification record usps actions in april came after it afforded plaintiff numerous opportunities to submit the requested frequency and duration information.on march,usps gave plaintiff detailed,written notice of his duty to provide a completed medical certific
