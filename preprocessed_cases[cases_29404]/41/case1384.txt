background 
pakovich worked as a retail sales representative for verizon and applied for long term disability benefits in september following a series of back surgeries.at the time,the long term disability plan the plan was administered by kemper national services,which in october,found pakovich to have been disabled as of july.under the long term disability policy terms,benefits for the first months were based upon pakovich inability to perform the essential functions of her regular occupation,with continuing benefits beyond the month mark depending upon pakovich being prevented from performing the essential functions of any gainful occupation that her training,education and experience would allow her to perform.the policy also provided that any benefits paid out by the plan would be offset by the receipt of social security benefits.in november,pakovich was found to be totally disabled by the social security administration,and thus was approved for social security benefits retroactive to july.by the end of,broadspire was administering the plan.
between february and march,pakovich was examined by a host of different physicians,some of whom noted that pakovich was only capable of performing sedentary work.the records from these examinations were then reviewed by physicians selected by broadspire.in february,pakovich received a letter from broadspire indicating that,based upon the information at its disposal,it did not appear that pakovich was disabled under the plan own occupation standard.she also received a separate letter the same day informing her that broadspire would be conducting an evaluation in the future to determine whether pakovich would continue to qualify for long term disability after july,under the any occupation standard.this any occupation evaluation,however,never occurred.instead,on april,pakovich was informed by letter that after reviewing all her medical documentation,broadspire had concluded that she was no longer disabled under the own occupation standard and that her benefits would be discontinued after april.pakovich appealed the decision,and on june,was awarded further benefits from may until may,due to a recent knee surgery,but nothing beyond that date.pakovich then brought suit in federal court pursuant to section a of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,challenging broadspire termination of her benefits.
in november,the district court issued a memorandum and order on pakovich motion for judgment under fed.civ.and broadspire motion for summary judgment.the court concluded that broadspire decision to terminate pakovich long term disability benefits was arbitrary and capricious.the district court noted that many physicians had determined that pakovich was only capable of performing sedentary work,and found that broadspire had unreasonably characterized pakovich current position as one involving light work,when by defendant own analysis of the position,it entailed lifting requirements near the high end of what is classified as medium work.
the district court entry of judgment in pakovich favor regarding her qualification for disability benefits under the own occupation standard,however,did not end the matter.instead,the district court then went on to determine for itself whether pakovich was also entitled to benefits under the any occupation standard.the court,in a brief paragraph,stated that the evidence in the record indicated that pakovich could perform at least sedentary work,and accordingly,found that pakovich did not qualify for disability benefits after july,and thus entered judgment for broadspire on that issue.in sum,these two rulings meant that pakovich was entitled to disability benefits from broadspire between may,and july.
following this memorandum and order,pakovich filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment under fed.civ.e.in her motion,she argued that broadspire never addressed her qualification for benefits under the any occupation standard,and moreover,that the district court finding that she could perform sedentary work still did not mean that it had been found that there was an occupation she could hold that would comport with her training,education and experience,as required by the plan documents.pakovich then asked that the district court reinstate her benefits.the district court denied this motion,stating that pakovich was now proceeding with a new argument not fully presented originally,and explaining that the record indicated that pakovich had the training,education and experience to perform sedentary work.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
pakovich appeals the district court finding that she was not disabled from all occupations,as required by the plan in order to receive disability benefits beyond months.as a preliminary matter,the parties dispute the proper standard of review concerning this issue.pakovich asserts that the standard should be that for a motion for summary judgment,while broadspire claims that the standard of review for judgment on the record under fed.civ.controls.this dispute stems from the procedural posture initially filed a motion for summary judgment,which pakovich responded to with her own motion for judgment under rule.the district court made clear,however,that it would decide this matter on the pending cross motions pursuant to rule for judgment on the administrative record.accordingly,because we are reviewing the district court judgment on a rule motion,we review any findings of fact or application for clear error.sehie city of aurora,cir.the additional deference shown by this court when reviewing the district court factual findings under rule,however,has no bearing on this particular case,since our decision rests purely on legal conclusions,which we review de novo.compare with reich ladish,cir we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.
the focus of pakovich appeal is on her contention that erisa requires plans to provide beneficiaries with the specific reason for denying benefit coverage,and that because the plan itself did not provide a reason why she was not entitled to benefits under the any occupation standard,the district court erred in finding for broadspire on this issue.broadspire,however,claims that pakovich waived this issue below.although the district court,when addressing this claim as part of pakovich rule e motion,also apparently viewed this argument as waived,we do not find this to be the case.pakovich,in her rule motion and response to broadspire motion for summary judgment,stated that she was also entitled to her any occupation benefits because erisa required that the plan give all the reasons for her denial,and she was only given the reason for denial under the own occupation standard.although pakovich developed this argument more fully in her rule e motion,contrary to the district court waiver statement in its order on that motion,pakovich argument was sufficiently developed in her original motion that the district court felt compelled to address the claim albeit in a footnote in its rule order.
we now turn to the substance of pakovich claim.her argument rests upon erisa requirem
