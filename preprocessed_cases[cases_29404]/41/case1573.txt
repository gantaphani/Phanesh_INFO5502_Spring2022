this case is almost as hard as pulling the teeth of floyd wood,who lost a final decision of the united states department of health and human services secretary tommy thompson that the extraction of his diseased teeth was not reimbursable under part b of the medicare program,et.we now affirm the district court decision to uphold the secretary ruling.
wood,an enrollee in the medicare program,needed a heart valve replacement.at the time his physician determined the need for this procedure,wood had severe infection in the tissue supporting his teeth.his cardiologist determined that wood severe periodontal disease presented a significant risk of bacterial infection to his artificial heart valve after implantation of the device.because of his poor dental the possibility of doctor recommended that he undergo dental extractions prior to his surgery.on june,a dentist removed of wood diseased teeth and recontoured his upper and lower jaw a procedure designed to prepare the tooth sockets for future denture construction.on september,wood was admitted to a paul,minnesota hospital to undergo the heart valve replacement surgery.the doctor who performed the operation,lyle joyce,said he would not have performed the procedure if wood had not undergone the tooth removal prior to surgery because of the risk of bacterial infection.
after removing wood teeth,wood dentist submitted a claim for dental services to metrahealth companies,a medicare carrier which denied coverage of the services.wood appealed this determination to a medicare part b hearing officer,who upheld the carrier decision.wood then appealed to a social security administrative law judge alj,who affirmed the hearing officer determination.the alj decided that wood was not qualified for coverage because services in connection with the treatment of teeth were not covered under part b of the medicare act,title xviii of the social security act,stat,as amended,et.congress,the alj concluded,specifically excluded dental care from coverage under medicare.see social security act a,a.the alj did identify three exceptions to this exclusion dental care in preparation for radiation of the jaw a covered medical procedure performed by the same physician doing the dental work and inpatient dental examinations conducted in preparation for kidney transplant surgery.while the alj did not dispute that wood extractions were medically necessary,he concluded that this procedure did not fall within one of the exceptions to the blanket denial of dental coverage under medicare.wood requested review of the alj decision by the medicare appeals council,but the council declined to review the case,stating that the alj decision would stand as the final decision of the secretary.
because the medicare appeals council adopted the decision of the alj,that decision stands as the final decision of the secretary.judicial review of such final decisions lies in the appropriate district court under g.wood thus appealed to the district court for the western district of wisconsin,which affirmed.we review the alj decision with the deference due to final decisions of agencies under g,findings of the secretary if supported by substantial evidence,shall be conclusive,and where a claim has been denied by the secretary the court shall review only the question of conformity with the secretary regulations and the validity of such regulations.see also johnson heckler,cir.substantial evidence is more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance of the evidence,and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.kapusta sullivan,cir quoting richardson perales,d.
we may also set aside the secretary denial of coverage if the denial was based on legal error.see stevenson chater,cir.when interpreting a statute,we first determine whether the intent of congress is unambiguous.see chevron,natural resources defense council,d.if the meaning of the statute is clear,no deference is due an agency interpretation.if the meaning of the statute is ambiguous,an agency interpretation will be deferred to if it is reasonable.see id.at.if the agency interpretation conflicts with its prior interpretation,the current interpretation is entitled to considerably less deference than a consistently held view.ins,d quoting watt alaska,d.
title xviii of the social security act,et,established medicare as a federally funded and administered health insurance program for eligible persons who are or older and entitled to social security retirement benefits are disabled and entitled to social security disability benefits or have end stage renal kidney disease.see.the secretary of health and human services administers the medicare program through the health care financing administration hcfa,which enters into agreements with private contractors to administer payments of funds to hospitals and providers for covered services on behalf of eligible beneficiaries.see,a.
the medicare program is divided into three major components.part a,the hospital insurance benefits program,provides coverage for inpatient hospital care,care in skilled nursing facilities and home care services.see to.part b generally provides coverage for outpatient physician services,physical and occupational therapy services,outpatient rehabilitation facility services,and medical equipment and services provided at rural health clinics and qualified health centers.see to,s.part b does not provide reimbursement for dental services.expenses excluded from part b coverage include those that are incurred 
in connection with the care,treatment,filling,removal,or replacement of teeth or structures directly supporting teeth,except that payment may be made under part a of this subchapter in the case of inpatient hospital services 
a.part c is a new component of the medicare statute,and the parties agree that it has no bearing on this case.see et.part b is the only section of the statute under which wood procedure could arguably fall,because the extraction did not involve inpatient hospital care.however,as noted,the statute clearly excludes dental procedures from coverage under part 
there is only one exception to the exclusion of dental services under part section of the medicare carriers states that otherwise noncovered services performed by a dentist as incident to and as an integral part of a covered procedure or service will be covered by medicare.medicare carriers manual.both the dental and the covered procedure under this provision must be furnished by the same provider.an example of this,provided in the manual,is when the reconstruction of a ridge,which is normally a procedure,is performed as a result of and at the same time as the surgical removal of a tumor for other than dental purposes.see id.in such a situation,the totality of surgical procedures would be a covered service.see id.citing same physician rule the alj concluded that the case here neither fits within the rule purview nor falls within any corollaries to that rule.
there are two corollaries to the same physician rule,under which dental procedures will be covered under part b even if the covered procedure is performed by someone other than a dentist.the first is outlined in of the medicare carriers manual the extraction of teeth to prepare the jaw for radiation treatment of abnormal jaw growths neoplastic disease.the second corollary allows for medicare coverage of an inpatient dental examination performed as part of a comprehensive workup prior to renal kidney transplant surgery.medicare coverage issues manual the alj concluded that wood procedure fit within neither of these corollaries,and that therefore wood could not escape the exclusion for dental services.
on appeal,wood advances a argument the dental services exclusion in the statute is ambiguous the hcfa interpretation of the statute is unreasonable and the legislative history is inconsistent with the interpretation of the exclusion and hcfa interpretation of the other medically necessary exceptions to it.
in reviewing an agency interpretation of a statute,we first determine whether that statute is ambiguous.see chevron,at.united transp.legislative bd.surface transp,cir.the secretary appears to concede that the statute is ambiguous on this point he begins by arguing for the reasonableness of his articulated exceptions and the exclusion of wood procedure.as described above,the statute delineates the type of dental services that can be covered under part a,and does not indicate any exceptions to the exclusion from coverage under part because there are exceptions,wood reasons,the statute must be ambiguous and the secretary does not appear to view the exclusion as absolute.this is not an entirely outlandish argument.that a statute has several articulated exceptions does not necessarily mean it is ambiguous,but it does suggest the need for a possible concession on the part of the administrator of the statute as to ambiguity.the secretary argues that the hcfa has interpreted the medicare act and its legislative history to allow for coverage of dental procedures in a few limited has not felt free to make further exceptions to the exclusion,even if it believes the added exceptions would not undermine congress goals.the secretary fails to explain why the existing exceptions,and not others,serve any express intent of congress to exclude procedures such as wood.we thus consider the statutory exclusion of dental coverage to be ambiguous,and consider whether the secretary interpretation of the statute in the present case is reasonable.
wood argues that the hcfa interpretation of the statute is unreasonable,and attempts to show that the secretary proposed list of exceptions to the part b exclusion is not exhaustive.this argument is first,he argues that the hcfa current interpretation of the statute is inconsistent with prior interpretations,and second,that the rationale behind the other exceptions applies here.wood claims the exclusion of procedures like his is inconsistent with prior interpretations because those interpretations are premised on the idea that procedures are or should be covered by medicare.because dental services received prior to a kidney transplant are covered under an administrative interpretation of the act,see national coverage decision,medicare coverage issues manual,wood believes that coverage for dental services prior to a heart valve replacement is a logical extension.he reasons that the rationale of the kidney transplant exception would apply in his case as well 
t he dental examination is for the identification,prior to a complex surgical procedure,of existing medical problems where the increased possibility of infection would not only reduce the chances for successful surgery but would also expose the patient to additional risks in undergoing such surgery.
national coverage decision,medicare coverage issues manual.but,as the secretary notes,the kidney transplant exception applies to inpatient dental examinations,a significantly worded application,considering that inpatient hospital services in connection with dental care are explicitly covered by the statute under medicare part further,the medicare act itself singles out kidney disease for special treatment it is the only disease that explicitly entitles an individual to medicare coverage.see while this alone may not be sufficient to justify the narrowness of the exception,it does provide some indication that an extension of it to include heart valve surgery is not what congress intended.all medically necessary procedures are not covered under the act.it is simply too long a stretch to extend this exception for an inpatient examination in connection with renal transplant surgery to outpatient treatment prior to heart valve surgery on a rationale of the comparable complexity and seriousness of the respective surgeries.in addition,the renal disease exception specifically applies to an examination,not to treatment.
the secretary notes that while the hcfa has outlined limited exceptions to the general exclusion,each exception is consistent with the language of the medicare act and congressional intent.the only statutorily explicit coverage of services related to dental procedures does not actually cover the dental services at all it merely reimburses providers of inpatient hospital services in connection with dental procedures.also,the corollary to the same physician rule in medicare carriers manual is for the extraction of teeth to prepare the jaw for radiation treatment of oral tumors.the secretary argues that the alj reasonably limited this exception to its facts.we agree.a possibly questionable exception promulgated by the hcfa is no argument that the exception should be expanded further.
section contains a reference to another section that wood argues indicates an intent to extend coverage to his kind of procedure.that section,of the medicare carriers manual,indicates that medicare part b pays for otherwise covered services furnished by a doctor of dental surgery or dental medicine if those services would be covered as physicians services when performed by a doctor of medicine.the section indicates further that otherwise covered services include treatment of oral infections and interpretations of diagnostic examinations in connection with covered services.but the section goes on to note that the general exclusion of payment for dental services has not been withdrawn.the secretary argues that interpreting this provision in the way wood suggests would open the door to coverage of any extraction performed by a dentist to treat an infected tooth.he suggests,as an alternative,that this section should be interpreted to refer to treatment of oral infections using antibiotics,as suggested in an institute of medicine report.institute of medicine,extending medicare coverage to preventive and other services.this of the secretary is only modestly convincing.but,in the absence of more specific support for wood claim,we can not extend coverage to dental procedures simply because they are necessary for heart valve replacement surgery.
wood also attempts to find support in the hcfa rural health clinic and federally qualified health centers manual.that manual defines coverage for services offered at such facilities,which provide services that can be covered under medicare part see a d.the manual,as wood notes,has a provision nearly identical to of the medicare carriers manual,with a significant exception 
a dental examination for patients requiring certain complex surgical procedures may be covered.to date,the only identified procedures for which dental examinations are covered are kidney transplants and heart valve replacements.
rural health clinic and federally qualified health centers manual emphasis added.first,this provision is not applicable to wood,as he was not treated at either a rural health clinic or a federally qualified health center.second,this reference to heart valve replacements indicates their specific inclusion within the general exception to the exclusion for examinations in connection with surgical procedures.while this reference lends some weight to wood argument,it appears in an isolated corner of the administrative provisions and is not strong enough to prevail over the authority to the contrary.and,again,the manual specifically covers an examination,not treatment.
wood also notes that,had the services been provided after december,and in wisconsin,he would have been covered under the wisconsin physicians service local medical review policy.he did not rely on this policy in his arguments before the alj or the medicare appeals council,and he has therefore waived this argument.see johnson apfel,cir.even if the argument had not been waived,this policy would be of no use to wood.it does indeed state that medicare covers dental extractions due to infections prior to heart valve replacement surgeries.see wisconsin physicians serv.local med.review policy,unfortunately,even on the assumption that this plan was approved by the hcfa,the wps policy is not controlling authority.the policy was adopted more than two years after the dental services in this case were they were performed in minnesota,not wisconsin.in addition,as the secretary notes,local medical review policies may not conflict with national policy,and allowing p
