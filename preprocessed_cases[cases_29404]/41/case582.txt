born in,stewart adult life has been punctuated by a history of psychiatric illness and criminal behavior.although stewart obtained a general education degree after leaving high school in the eleventh grade,stewart began to have problems with the law at the age of twenty when he was convicted in state court of possession of stolen property.the record reflects that stewart mental health also began to deteriorate in his twenties,resulting in several psychiatric hospitalizations for schizophrenia.these problems corresponded with a gradual escalation in stewart criminal behavior,from shoplifting and resisting arrest to larceny and burglary.although stewart received antipsychotic medication while hospitalized or incarcerated,stewart typically did not comply with his medication regimen postrelease.

the court subsequently ordered a psychiatric evaluation of stewart by a panel of medical personnel at fmc devens,pursuant to a,b,and b the risk assessment panel report,filed on december,examined stewart psychiatric and criminal history,his treatment at fmc devens,and his future risk of violent recidivism.according to the panel,stewart suffers from disorganized personality paranoid schizophrenia,and can exhibit grandiosity and,possibly of delusional proportions.appellant app.vol.ii,at risk assessment panel report.during one examination,for example,stewart stated he is allah and that he is the most gracious,most compassionate,and most worthy.id.furthermore,the panel found that if improperly medicated,stewart mental illness can impact and impair his judgment,as demonstrated by his past criminal history and acts of violence.for example,while at fmc devens,stewart assaulted a correctional officer and attempted to assault the chief psychiatrist on november.however,stewart responded well to treatment,and after an increase in his medication,the panel reported he committed no further violence.id.stewart advanced through the mental health unit system and was eventually able to live in the least restrictive setting.the panel found that in while in the highly structured prison environment,stewart was compliant with his medication,attended all of his psychiatric appointments,and appeared to be at his baseline.id.at.
the panel also conducted a series of psychological evaluations to determine stewart risk for future violent behavior.the results indicated stewart was at a moderate risk for violent behavior,with a chance he will engage in future acts of violence within the next seven years,and a chance he will engage in future acts of violence within the next ten years.id.at.according to the report,stewart history of violence,his serious mental illness,and his limited insight into his mental illness increased his risk for future violence,especially if he becomes noncompliant in taking his prescribed psychotropic medication.id.however,the panel concluded that if stewart remained properly medicated and in a structured and supervised environment,he is not a dangerous individual.id.at.
c.the hearing 
on stewart motion,a hearing pursuant to c was conducted on may,to determine whether he should be released from custody.in accordance with d,stewart had the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that his release would not create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to the property of another due to a present mental disease or defect.if stewart was successful,both parties agreed that stewart release was subject to no conditions whatsoever,because the statute does not permit the district court to order a conditional release at a c hearing.under e,which governs the disposition of a c hearing,a district court is only granted authority to either commit the defendant or release him unconditionally united states baker,cir.
stewart presented testimony from three witnesses dennis becotte,chief forensic psychologist at fmc devens,cheryl tolentino,a clinical team leader for the union county integrated case management services icms and wanda mcneil,stewart cousin.becotte testified that while stewart had improved at fmc devens,stewart risk of future violent behavior was critically dependent on stewart medication regimen and living environment.becotte stated that stewart stability had improved over the past two and a half years and that stewart had recently acknowledged his mental illness and his need to stay on medication.becotte also testified that stewart prognosis was good,his moderate risk of violent recidivism was relatively positive,and he currently did not pose a substantial risk of danger to the public.however,becotte clearly expressed that stewart medication regimen was crucial to his stability.without taking his required medication,becotte testified that stewart risk of engaging in violent behavior substantially increased.furthermore,stewart history of postrelease medication noncompliance indicated that stewart needed a structured and supervised environment to give him the best chance of success.appellant app.vol.ii,at c hearing,may.according to becotte,this environment would ensure that stewart received his medication biweekly,attended weekly meetings with mental health professionals who would monitor his illness,and participated in ongoing counseling therapy.this type of oversight was available through a community outpatient program,becotte concluded,but not possible if stewart was living on his own.
because stewart release under e would be subject to no conditions whatsoever,stewart attorney presented evidence that there would be safeguards in place to provide stewart with a structured and supervised environment.id.at.however,the witnesses testimony raised doubts as to the level of structure and support these resources would truly provide.while tolentino testified that icms could provide weekly mental health visits for stewart,arrange for his biweekly medications,and would make referrals to other agencies as appropriate,tolentino agreed that icms is a completely voluntary program and stewart could terminate its services at any time.in addition,tolentino admitted that icms had not assessed stewart,coordinated any plans for his release,or discussed his release with personnel at fmc devens.furthermore,while mcneil testified that she consented to letting stewart live in her home,that she is comfortable with his illness,and that she would take the necessary steps to ensure stewart received adequate care,she admitted that she worked every day from to,during which time stewart would be entirely unsupervised.mcneil also agreed that she must devote substantial attention to her four children,all of whom are seventeen years of age or younger.finally,although becotte stated that icms looks like a very good service,assuming that they will do it,he admitted that he only learned about the icms program from reading a brochure that morning.id.at.neither he nor anyone on the panel ever talked with representatives at icms or interviewed mcneil.although he was satisfied with stewart plan because it sounds like a conditional release plan that we have engineered for many other cases that have been successful,becotte admitted that stewart plan was obviously not a typical condition of release plan which we work on and present to the court.there is going to be no oversight or supervision of stewart if he is released into the community and our involvement with the case would be terminated.id.at.
at the conclusion of this hearing,the district court denied stewart release pursuant to e.while observing that stewart was doing about as well as could be expected given his mental illness,the court found that stewart mental health evaluations indicated that he is still at a moderate risk for violent behavior and that this risk increases if he is not properly medicated.the court determined that these factors,coupled with stewart only recent acknowledgment of his illness,posed formidable obstacles to release.stewart proposed safeguards,according to the court,did not eliminate the danger he otherwise posed.the court noted that mcneil testimony revealed she could not provide any daytime supervision and it was unknown what stewart would do during those hours.nor did the court have any information regarding icms history,its track record,or the specific programs in which stewart would be enrolled upon his release.rather,the court found that stewart would undergo a drastic change from the controlled conditions at fmc devens to an environment with little or no supervision and,consequently,he could potentially decompensate and pose a great danger to other people and property.without demonstrating an adequate release program,the court found that stewart had failed to show,by clear and convincing evidence,that his release would not create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to the property of another and therefore denied his release.stewart now appeals.
