shortly after being employed as a welder for james marine,jmi,heather spees discovered that she was pregnant.at the direction of her foreman,spees obtained a note from her physician restricting her to work,which resulted in jmi reassigning her to a position in the company tool room.jmi terminated spees two months later when a second doctor placed her on bedrest for the duration of her pregnancy.spees then sued jmi and its subsidiary,jamesbuilt,llc,seeking relief for among other things pregnancy and disability discrimination.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of jmi and jamesbuilt on these claims,which spees now challenges on appeal.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court with regard to spees claim and her claim as they pertain to the termination of her employment,reverse the district court grant of summary judgment on spees claim and claim to the extent that they are based on her reassignment to the tool room,and remand the case for further proceedings on these latter two claims.
background 
factual background 
jmi owns and operates a construction and repair facility for inland waterway vessels on the banks of the tennessee river near calvert city,kentucky.on may,spees was hired to work at jmi jamesbuilt facility,which focuses largely on constructing deck and tank barges,towboats,and for the industry.jamesbuilt,llc is a subsidiary of jmi,and the two share the same human resources department.for convenience,jmi and jamesbuilt are hereinafter collectively referred to as jmi.
despite having no prior experience working in a position,spees was hired by jmi as a welder.spees,like other newly hired welders without welding experience,was required by jmi to complete a training course.she successfully completed the training program and was promoted to a position in early june.
at this point in time,jmi nonoffice positions were overwhelmingly male,with only four of these positions filled by female employees.spees was the only female assigned to the jamesbuilt facility.
welding work at the jamesbuilt facility is physically demanding.it requires heavy lifting,climbing up ladders and stairs,maneuvering into barge tanks,and,occasionally,the overhead handling of equipment.the summer of was also particularly hot,with temperatures reaching degrees fahrenheit or more on multiple occasions.
in addition,welders are exposed to fumes,dust,and organic vapors in the course of their work.to limit the inhalation of these substances,jmi provides welders with respirators to wear while on the job.spees was fitted with a respirator during orientation,although she often opted not to wear it once she became a welder because she did feel like she needed one.
tony milam,spees foreman,described her as a good employee and a good welder,and he ribbed other male employees about her coming in there and welding as good as what she done.spees enjoyed her work and believed that her supervisors saw her as a good employee and a hardworking employee.
shortly after she started working at jmi,spees became pregnant.this was spees third pregnancy she had given birth to a daughter in and had suffered a miscarriage in.fearing that the pregnancy would cause her to lose her job,spees was hysterical when she became aware of her condition.by this point,spees was roughly five to six weeks pregnant.
spees first course of action was to telephone her brother,christopher gunder,who was a jmi foreman.gunder,in turn,recommended that she call milam.while talking to milam,spees expressed her concern that she would be terminated from her position due to the pregnancy.milam responded by noting that he had concerns about her being around the chemicals,the welding smoke,and climbing around on some of the jobs while pregnant,and he told her to see a doctor to find out exactly what she did or did need to be doing or be around.
on june,the day following her telephone conversation with milam,spees saw jorge cardenas,an obstetrician in paducah,kentucky.cardenas had been spees physician for a number of years,including when she had suffered her miscarriage two years earlier.during her appointment with cardenas,spees discussed her past miscarriage and described her job duties as a welder.cardenas replied that there was no problem with spees resuming her work as a welder while pregnant.although cardenas did not know of any health problems that welding fumes could pose for a fetus,he recommended that spees wear a respirator while working.at the end of her appointment,spees received a certificate to return to work from cardenas that did not list any restrictions on her ability to weld.
spees left her appointment with the intent of returning to work that same day.on her way back to jmi,she called milam to inform him that she had received clearance from cardenas to resume welding.milam,in the meantime,had discussed with his supervisor kenneth colbert the possibility of moving spees to a nonwelding position.he therefore asked spees to read him cardenas certificate to return to work.despite cardenas having cleared spees to work,milam believed,based on common sense,that there was some questions about her being pregnant and being able to safely perform the job that she was required to do.milam concerns were also in part driven by the fact that spees had complications with other pregnancies before.
spees testified that,upon hearing her read cardenas note,milam told spees that she needed something more descriptive or else they were going to get rid of her.according to spees,milam requested that she obtain a second note from cardenas mentioning toxic fumes and limiting her to light duty.milam told spees that such a note would help her get a transfer to a position in the tool room,thereby allowing her to retain her employment with jmi during her pregnancy.
at milam direction,spees returned to cardenas that same day to ask for a second note that limited her to light duty.cardenas,complying with her request,wrote her a work order that read patient requires light duty avoid sic toxic fumes.he testified that although there was no medical reason to limit spees job duties,he wrote the note to allay some of spees concerns and for the purpose of reducing her anxiety.according to cardenas,spees did not inform him that her superiors at jmi had requested that the note be written.
spees returned to jmi and showed milam the second note from cardenas that limited her to light duty.milam informed spees that he had consulted further with colbert and that they had already decided that spees could no longer weld.he did,however,tell spees that she could work in the tool room,noting that for right now,we do know what to do with you.milam believed that the transfer would be temporary and that spees could resume welding after the pregnancy.despite voicing her desire to continue welding,spees accepted the change.
gunder also participated in the decision to reassign spees to the tool room.he testified that,while jmi was deliberating where spees should be working,he and milam went to colbert,and we just decided that it would be a good idea for her to weld.gunder added that he was motivated by concern for the health of his sister unborn child,and he believed that the job duties of a constant dragging and pulling as well as inhaling the welding not be performed by spees while pregnant.
spees began working in the tool room on june,the day after she visited cardenas.her primary duties in that capacity were to dispense tools to other employees and to ensure that none of the equipment was lost or stolen.spees found the job to be as physically demanding as welding,with the working conditions being just as hot,and her having to lift the same tools and materials as she did when welding.the main difference was that she did not have to perform any overhead work while in the tool room.spees received the same salary for her work in the tool room as she did when welding.
shortly after she began working in the tool room,spees encountered tom freeman,the head of jmi safety department,to whom she had never before spoken.according to spees,freeman told her that working at jmi was not women work and that she needed to go back to her doctor to ask for a descriptive note.he added that the descriptive note should specify everything you can and can not do,including whether spees could climb ladders,lift heavy objects,and work in the heat.freeman then told spees that i am your boss,and i am requesting this.when spees noted that she had already submitted a work order from cardenas,freeman told her the note was good enough and that she needed to understand that this is a man world.
freeman comments upset spees,causing her to seek out milam in his office.milam,upon hearing about freeman remarks,told her i your boss.they are trying to fire you.do not waste your time.i have already been told by colbert that you are not going to weld no matter what your doctor is going to do.he later reprimanded freeman for his comments to spees.
spees worked the daytime shift in the tool room for approximately one week.this assignment was temporary in nature and was made to give jmi time to get everything straightened out regarding spees pregnancy.milam then informed spees that there was a position available in the tool room,indicating that such a transfer would allow her to maintain her employment with jmi during the pregnancy.
acting on this information,spees went to see pam deweese,an employee in jmi human resources department.spees thought that the schedule change would be difficult given her status as a single mother,but she also believed that the change was necessary in order to keep her job.during their conversation,chad walker,the human resources director,stopped by deweese office and told spees that he could fire her because she was not injured at work,but that he was going to work with her and allow her to work in the evening.following spees conversation with deweese and walker,the change in shifts was approved and spees began working nights.gunder,spees brother,was the night foreman at jmi.
spees worked the night shift in the tool room without incident for approximately one month.but in early august,temperatures in calvert city reached degrees fahrenheit,and spees was experiencing significant swelling due to the heat.she also had vomited on multiple occasions while commuting to work.spees again visited cardenas,who wrote her a note stating that she should take off one week from work due to the heat.
milam and another manager with jmi knew of the problems that spees was experiencing and encouraged her to go on some medical leave.at this point,spees transferred her medical care from cardenas to susan mueller,another obstetrician in paducah.spees had an appointment with mueller on august,and,during this visit,mueller discovered that spees had an incompetent cervix.an incompetent cervix,according to,is a cervix that is abnormally liable to dilate and so is not competent to keep the fetus up in the uterus and keep it from being spontaneously aborted.in light of this complication,mueller placed spees on bedrest for the remainder of her pregnancy and wrote her a note to that effect.spees did not request to be placed on bedrest nor did she inform mueller that her supervisor had encouraged her to go on medical leave.although mueller believed that spees was not physically capable of doing her job,spees disagreed and thought that she could have continued working.spees nevertheless submitted mueller note to gunder.
at this point,spees had been absent from work for more than days due to her various doctors appointments and the rest recommended by cardenas.because spees had not yet worked days for jmi,she was entitled to only two weeks of approved leave and was not eligible for leave at all under the family and medical leave act fmla,et.gunder,who was aware that spees had exhausted her leave,called deweese to discuss what to do.deweese told gunder to terminate spees.she further instructed gunder to note in spees termination paperwork that the company would rehire her after her baby was born.
gunder called spees to tell her about the termination.spees was surprised by her firing,having believed that she would be placed on medical leave.according to spees,gunder told her that she was being fired for being pregnant.spees further contends that gunder failed to tell her that she would be rehired following the conclusion of her pregnancy.
gunder filled out spees termination form.it stated that put heather off work until after her delivery date.not enough time in for medical leave of absence.rehire after delivery.despite this statement on the form,spees did not know until after taking legal action against jmi that the company intended to rehire her following the pregnancy.
procedural background 
spees filed suit against jmi in april,alleging unlawful discrimination under title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et,under the americans with disabilities act ada,et,and under the kentucky civil rights act kcra.ann.et.her claims included pregnancy discrimination on the basis of her transfer to the position,pregnancy discrimination on the basis of her termination,and disability discrimination.spees also brought and claims on the basis of allegedly inferior women restroom and locker facilities at jamesbuilt,but neither of these claims is raised by spees on appeal.
following discovery,spees filed a motion for summary judgment on all of her claims as to jmi liability.jmi then responded to spees motion and filed its own for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of jmi on spees and claims.regarding spees transfer claim,the court concluded that spees reassignment did not constitute an adverse employment action.it similarly determined that spees could not succeed on her claim because she could not show that jmi justification for firing.mueller note placing her on bedrest and the fact that she had exhausted her medical a pretext designed to mask discrimination.finally,the court was not persuaded that pregnancy constituted a disability for ada purposes and,accordingly,granted summary judgment in favor of jmi on spees claim.
the remaining two claims of and gender on the allegedly inferior restroom and locker facilities for tried to a jury,which found in favor of jmi on both claims.spees now appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of jmi on her claims of pregnancy discrimination and disability discrimination.

standard for claims 
spees contends that jmi discriminated against her on the basis of her pregnancy on two separate occasions when she was transferred to work in the tool room,and when she was terminated.the district court concluded that spees had failed to make out a prima facie case of discrimination on the first claim because the transfer was not deemed an adverse employment action.it further determined that,although spees established a prima facie case of discrimination regarding her termination,she was unable to show that jmi proffered justification for the.mueller note restricting spees to bedrest and spees exhaustion of her medical pretextual.the court thus granted summary judgment to jmi on both claims.
spees brought her claims pursuant to title vii and the kcra.title vii makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual sex.a.because of sex as used in title vii includes because of or on the basis of pregnancy,childbirth,or related medical conditions.k.w omen affected by pregnancy,childbirth,or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all purposes as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.id.
the kcra likewise prohibits discrimination against pregnant women.see.and the kcra is similar to title vii of the federal civil rights act and should be interpreted consistently with federal law.ammerman bd.of educ.of nicholas county,see also jefferson county zaring,observing that because the provisions of the kcra are virtually identical to those of the federal act,in this particular area we must consider the way the federal act has been interpreted citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
as an initial matter,we must determine the proper analytical framework to apply to spees claims at the summary judgment stage of the case.the district court analyzed both claims pursuant to the framework first announced in mcdonnell douglas green,as amended by texas department of community affairs burdine.under that familiar tripartite analysis,a plaintiff seeking to survive summary judgment on a title vii claim must overcome the following hurdles 
first,the plaintiff has the burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination.second,if the plaintiff succeeds in proving the prima facie case,the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the employee rejection.third,should the defendant carry this burden,the plaintiff must then have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons,but were a pretext for discrimination.
burdine,at citations omitted.the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.id.at.
subsequent cases,however,have held that a different standard applies to claims.such claims are based on the plaintiff allegation that race,color,religion,sex,or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice,even though other factors also motivated the practice.title vii,m emphasis added.allegations of discriminatory conduct thus fall into one of two categories claims,where an illegitimate reason motivated an employment decision,or claims,where both legitimate and illegitimate reasons motivated the employer decision.white baxter healthcare,cir.
this court in white held that the mcdonnell framework does not apply to claims.id.at.instead,a title vii plaintiff asserting a claim need only produce evidence sufficient to convince a jury that the defendant took an adverse employment action against the plaintiff and race,color,religion,sex,or national origin was a motivating factor for the defendant adverse employment action.id.emphasis in original citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the plaintiff burden of producing evidence to support a claim is not onerous and should preclude sending the case to the jury only where the record is devoid of evidence that could reasonably be construed to support the plaintiff claim.id.
although portions of the mcdonnell framework might be useful in presenting a claim,the white court made clear that compliance with the shifting burdens of production is not required in order to demonstrate that the defendant adverse employment action was motivated in part by a consideration of the plaintiff race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.id.at emphasis in original citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the ultimate question in a analysis is simply whether there are any genuine issues of material fact concerning the defendant motivation for its adverse employment decision,and,if none are present,whether the law supports a judgment in favor of the moving party on the basis of the undisputed facts.id.at.inquiries into what motivated an employer decision are very fact intensive and will generally be difficult to determine at the summary judgment stage.id.citation omitted.
this relatively lenient summary judgment standard is counterbalanced by potential restrictions on a plaintiff recovery for a claim.under title vii,a plaintiff asserting a claim is entitled only to declaratory relief,limited injunctive relief,and attorney fees and costs where the employer demonstrates that it would have taken the same employment action in the absence of an impermissible motivating factor.g b.
plaintiffs must give proper notice when bringing claims.danou enters,app x,cir affirming the district court application of the mcdonnell framework where the plaintiff failed to raise a claim in her complaint or in her response to the defendants summary judgment motion,and the record was utterly silent as to mixed motives.spees provided such notice of her claims in the district court.as stated in her complaint,both discrimination claims alleged that spees pregnancy was a motivating factor in jmi treatment of her.emphasis added.she also specified in a footnote to her motion for summary judgment that she was bringing claims and was using the mcdonnell framework in her motion only because of uncertainty regarding the proper analysis of claims on a plaintiff motion for summary judgment.finally,spees reiterated that she was pursuing claims under title vii in her reply in support of her motion for summary to jmi motion for summary judgment.we therefore conclude that spees provided adequate notice of her claims.
in light of this notice,the district court failure to apply the white analytical framework was in error.to properly analyze spees claims,we need determine only whether jmi took an adverse employment action against spees and whether her pregnancy was a motivating factor for the adverse action.see white,at.each of spees claims is addressed below with the white framework in mind.
claim based on spees transfer to the tool room 
spees first claims that jmi discriminated against her by transferring her to a position once it learned of her pregnancy.the district court granted jmi motion for summary judgment on this claim,finding that the transfer did not constitute an adverse employment action.
the transfer as an adverse employment action 
an adverse employment action has been defined as a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of a plaintiff employment.white burlington santa fe ry,cir en banc citation omitted.a bruised ego or a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities is not sufficient to constitute an adverse employment action.id.at.adverse employment actions are typically marked by a significant change in employment status,including hiring,firing,failing to promote,reassignment with significantly different responsibilities,or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.id.at quoting burlington indus.ellerth.
reassignments and position transfers can qualify as adverse employment actions,particularly where they are accompanied by salary or work hour changes.see kocsis,cir holding that a job transfer was not an adverse employment action because the plaintiff enjoyed the same rate of pay and benefits,and her duties were not materially modified.and even if a reassignment is not paired with a salary or change,it can nonetheless be considered an adverse employment action where there is evidence that the employee received a less distinguished title,a material loss of benefits,significantly diminished material responsibilities,or other indices that might be unique to a particular situation.id.at citation omitted.
upon learning that spees was pregnant,jmi transferred her from a daytime welding position to a daytime position in the tool room,where she worked for approximately one week before being transferred to a nighttime shift in order to keep her job.some evidence indicates that the transfer was not a materially adverse change in her employment.for instance,spees received the same salary while working in the tool room and did not lose any of her benefits.and,as jmi points out in its brief,the working conditions in the tool room were in some ways better than those while welding.jmi contends,for example,that the summer heat was more tolerable in the tool room because spees could wear two fewer pieces of gear than when welding,and jmi provided a small fan for spees personal use.spees was also not subject to the toxic fumes from welding while working in the tool room.
but the record contains other evidence to suggest that spees transfer was a materially adverse change.in many ways,the transfer can be seen as a demotion.spees was required to complete a training course to become a welder,but there is no evidence that a position required any specific training or skill.in addition,spees appears to have felt unchallenged by her position,testifying that she found it to be more boring than welding.this contrast weighs in favor of finding the change in job assignments to be materially adverse.see white burlington,at concluding that an employee transfer from a forklift operator to a standard railroad track laborer job was an adverse employment action because,in part,the forklift operator position required more qualifications,which is an indication of prestige.
moreover,spees was soon assigned to the night shift,which adversely affected her ability to raise her daughter as a single mother.an inconvenience resulting from a less favorable schedule can render an employment action adverse even if the employee responsibilities and wages are left unchanged.ginger district of columbia,holding that switching police officers to a rotating shift from a permanent night shift was an adverse employment action because it severely affected their sleep schedules and made it more difficult for them to work overtime and day jobs.although spees did not describe in detail how the schedule change affected her,she did state that she was happy about transferring to nights because she was a single mother.and the fact that spees requested the position does not diminish jmi responsibility for the schedule change because spees was constructively forced to work nights.both milam and spees testified that milam told her to pursue the because it was the only option available that would allow her to retain her employment with jmi.this evidence supports the conclusion that she suffered an adverse employment action.
nor does the evidence conclusively indicate that the position was a more pleasant working environment.spees testified that working in the tool room was just as hot and as physically demanding as welding,the only difference being that she did not need to do any overhead handling of the welding equipment.and although spees was not exposed to toxic fumes while working in the tool room,she could have avoided such fumes by wearing a respirator while welding,as first recommended by cardenas.
on balance,spees transfer to the tool room resulted in her working a more inconvenient shift in a position that was less challenging and that required fewer qualifications.viewing this evidence collectively in spees favor,a reasonable jury could find that her transfer to the tool room constituted an adverse employment action.
spees pregnancy as a motivating factor for the transfer 
we must next determine whether spees presented sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that her pregnancy was a motivating factor in transferring her to the tool room.in international union,uaw johnson controls,the supreme court set forth the parameters regarding the acceptable treatment of female employees with childbearing capacity.johnson controls had barred all fertile females from its plant out of concern for the health of the fetuses that the women might conceive.id.at.the court struck down the company policy as violating title vii because the policy discriminated against female employees based on their capacity to become pregnant,even though the employees reproductive potential did not prevent them from being able to perform their jobs.id.at.it added that an employer safety concerns were a permissible ground for restricting a female employee job opportunities only where a pregnancy actually interfere d with the employee ability to perform the job.id.at.the court concluded that congress made clear that the decision to become pregnant or to work while being pregnant was reserved for each individual woman to make for herself.id.at.
in the present case,spees presented considerable evidence demonstrating that her pregnancy was at least a motivating factor,if not the motivating factor,in jmi decision to transfer her to the tool room.milam testified that when he first learned of spees pregnancy,he had concerns that she would not be able to weld.when spees read him cardenas first note clearing her to return to welding,milam said that there was some question about her being pregnant and being able to safely perform the job that she was required to do.he based these concerns on his perception of common sense.and according to spees,milam told her to obtain a second note from cardenas limiting her to light duty and instructing her to avoid toxic fumes.jmi then relied on this note in transferring spees to the tool room.
other jmi employees superior to spees exhibited a similar attitude.tom freeman,the head of jmi safety department,told spees that this is a man world and that the notes from cardenas were not acceptable.freeman statement that he did know what he was going to do with spees could be construed as further questioning her ability to weld while pregnant.gunder,the night foreman and spees brother,also partook in the decision to transfer spees.he stated in his deposition that he did not want spees welding because she was carrying my niece.gunder and milam discussed where spees should be working,and they just decided that it would be a good idea for her to weld.in contrast,spees never told her supervisors at jmi that she was unable to weld.she instead believed that she could weld,with only minimal restrictions,up until the full term of her pregnancy.
furthermore,there is no evidence to suggest that spees requested a transfer to the tool room.milam,on the other hand,knew that there was a opening in the tool room and recommended that spees seek a transfer.he and other managers made the decision to move spees to the tool room,allegedly telling her we do know what to do with you.in addition,milam later indicated to spees that jmi management had taken unilateral action.according to spees,milam informed her that i have already been told by colbert that you are not going to weld no matter what your doctor is going to do.
jmi defends its decision to transfer spees by relying on cardenas second note that restricts spees to light duty and indicates that she should avoid toxic fumes.the company also points to cardenas testimony in which he states that his recommendations were independent of any motivations that jmi may have had.but this evidence does not shield jmi transfer decision in light of milam apparent opinion that spees should be transferred even before cardenas had written the note.furthermore,spees testified that milam instructed her to obtain the note so limiting her.cardenas statement that he was not influenced by jmi when writing the second note is similarly inconclusive because spees might have chosen not to inform him or forgotten to inform him that she was seeking that note at jmi request.in sum,evidence exists from which a reasonable jury could find that jmi had decided that spees was unable to weld due to her pregnancy and had instructed her to get a doctor note to that effect.
jmi also argues that it would have been subject to a tort claim for negligence if it had permitted spees to continue welding contrary to the orders contained in cardenas second note.but this argument again overlooks the evidence that milam told spees to obtain the restrictive note in the first place.moreover,as the supreme court noted in johnson controls,jmi risk of tort liability in this situation would be remote if it fully inform ed spees of the risk inherent to welding while pregnant and did not otherwise act negligently.see id.at.summary judgment is accordingly inappropriate on this ground.
as a whole,the evidence is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether jmi management,rather than undertaking an objective evaluation to determine whether spees could perform her welding job while pregnant,instead subjectively viewed spees pregnancy as rendering her unable to weld.this would allow a reasonable jury to find that jmi decision to transfer spees was made out of concern for her pregnancy and the of her unborn child rather than because spees was unable to perform her job as a welder.such concerns,though laudatory,do not justify an adverse employment action.see id.at.the district court therefore erred in granting summary judgment in favor of jmi on spees transfer claim.
claim based on spees termination 
in addition to alleging that jmi violated the antidiscrimination laws in transferring her to work in the tool room,spees contends that jmi discriminated against her by terminating her employment after she was placed on bedrest.this claim is also a claim,so spees must show that she was subject to an adverse employment action for which her pregnancy was a motivating factor.see white baxter healthcare,cir.jmi concedes the firing an employee constitutes an adverse employment action.see,id.at.and,to be sure,spees pregnancy played a role in her termination,with complications stemming from the pregnancy causing spees to be placed on bedrest,which in turn led to her firing due to the fact that she had exhausted all of her available medical leave.but the white analysis does not hinge on whether spees pregnancy was a link in the chain of events that resulted in her firing.rather,white directs us to examine whether there is evidence that jmi was motivated by spees pregnancy in making its decision to terminate her.
jmi justifies its termination decision by pointing to the fact that spees presented it with mueller note placing spees on bedrest.unlike the note from cardenas,which spees claims was obtained at the direction of milam in order to restrict her to work,there is no evidence that jmi influenced mueller writing spees the bedrest note.this restriction instead stemmed from mueller diagnosis of spees medical condition.mueller assessment was also arrived at independently of any request by spees,who testified that she neither asked to be placed on bedrest nor told mueller that jmi had told her to seek medical leave.
pursuant to the bedrest note from mueller,spees was unable to work in any capacity at jmi,a point that spees herself recognizes.spees also acknowledges that although she would have been placed on medical leave under normal circumstances,she was not eligible for fmla leave as a recently hired employee who had already exhausted all of the regular leave to which she was entitled.jmi decision to terminate spees was thus based on a combination of her being unable to work and her lack of any available medical leave,not upon her pregnancy per se.
but spees maintains that she would not have submitted the bedrest note from mueller to jmi if she had known that she was ineligible for any additional medical leave.she adds that she would have preferred to continue working in defiance of mueller advice.but there is no evidence that spees resisted being placed on bedrest.to the contrary,it was spees who submitted the bedrest note to jmi.spees argues that she did so only because she had been encouraged to go on some medical leave,but she also conceded in her deposition that no one at jmi guaranteed her that she was eligible for such leave.her reliance on any expectation of medical leave was therefore unjustified.
in short,absent any evidence that jmi played a role in having spees placed on event that directly led to her is no support for spees contention that her pregnancy in and of itself was a motivation behind jmi decision to fire her.without the bedrest note,the record supports the conclusion that jmi would have allowed spees to continue working in the tool room despite being pregnant.spees was terminated,in other words,not because she was pregnant,but because she voluntarily submitted to jmi the bedrest note advising her not to work for the duration of her pregnancy.we therefore conclude that summary judgment was proper on this claim.
disability claim based on spees transfer to the tool room 
spees next appeals the entry of summary judgment for jmi on her claim that the company prohibited her from welding and transferred her to a position because it wrongfully perceived her pregnancy to be a disability.the ada prohibits discrimination by a covered entity against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures,the hiring,advancement,or discharge of employees,employee compensation,job training,and other terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.a.to make out a prima facie case of discrimination under the ada,a plaintiff must show that she or he is an individual with a disability,who was otherwise qualified to perform a job requirements,with or without reasonable accommodation and who was discriminated against solely because of the disability.talley family dollar stores of ohio,cir citation omitted.the third element requires that the plaintiff suffer an adverse employment action.id.
in this case,the central dispute over spees ada claim revolves around whether she meets the definition of a disabled person.a disability is defined as a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual b a record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment.this section of the act was amended in,subsequent to the events giving rise to spees lawsuit.but we must analyze spees claims pursuant to the earlier version provided above because the amendments to the ada do not apply retroactively.see milholland sumner county bd.of,cir holding that the ada amendments act does not apply to conduct.
spees does not argue that her pregnancy qualified as a disability under subsections a or b rather,she brings her claim pursuant to the provision in subsection c.moreover,spees acknowledges that pregnancy,by itself,does not constitute a disability under the ada and thus can not form the basis of a claim.this concession comports with the unanimous holdings of the federal courts that have addressed the issue.see,richards city of topeka,cir w e do note that numerous district courts have concluded that a normal pregnancy without complications is not a disability under a.listing cases navarro pomares pfizer,d,observing that the only district judge to have held that pregnancy,by itself,was a disability under the ada reversed himself in a subsequent case,rev on other grounds,navarro pfizer,cir.likewise,the interpretive guideline for the term disability issued by the equal employment opportunity commission in its compliance manual excludes pregnancy from its definition of disability.eeoccm c,wl,because pregnancy is not the result of a physiological disorder,it is not an impairment.
