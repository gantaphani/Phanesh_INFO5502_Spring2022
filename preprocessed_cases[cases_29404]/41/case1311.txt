gratzl has suffered from incontinence since approximately,apparently as a result of pregnancy complications.unable to treat her condition with medication,she left a court reporting job and began to teach court reporting at mccormick college,which allowed her to manage her incontinence by leaving the room whenever necessary.when the campus where she was teaching closed in,gratzl transferred but soon had to quit because she was unable to make the commute to the college chicago campus without becoming incontinent.as her incontinence worsened,she applied for an electronic court reporting position in the control room at the dupage county courthouse,believing the position would allow her to manage her condition.she was hired for the control room position and eventually entered into a written agreement specifying that her job responsibilities included only control room reporting.this arrangement worked favorably for both gratzl and the court.gratzl was able to manage her incontinence problem so well that no one was even aware of it.judge robert kilander was pleased because court reporters,as a group,apparently preferred reporting to the control room because they could make extra money preparing transcripts.
in,however,the state of illinois eliminated the court reporting specialist job title and consolidated all reporters under the title official court reporter.although the state did not specify what job responsibilities accompanied the new title,judge ann jorgenson,the new chief judge of the dupage county courthouse,decided that all court now shared the same be required to do the same job.this would include a full rotation in which all court reporters would rotate through all of the courtrooms,including the control room.according to the court,the purpose of this new procedure was to evenly distribute the workload that varied with each courtroom.when judge jorgenson told gratzl on march that she would have to go into the full rotation,gratzl explained her medical condition to judge jorgenson and that,because of her condition,she believed she could not do reporting.at the same meeting,gratzl requested a leave of absence for surgery scheduled on april,which judge jorgenson approved judge jorgenson then gave gratzl until april to decide whether to participate in the full rotation or resign.on april,gratzl informed the court that she would participate in the full rotation.she then requested,and was granted,an extension of her medical leave until may.
on may,gratzl attorney formally requested that the court accommodate gratzl incontinence by allowing her to return to work full time in the control room.her request was supported by a letter from catrambone,in which he stated that gratzl needed to have the access to a restroom on a moment notice and opined that this requirement was inconsistent with reporting duties.in response,the court first offered to assign gratzl only to juvenile courtrooms,which did not have jury trials.with catrambone support,gratzl rejected that offer as incompatible with her or no,she would still not have the flexibility she needed during stated that she did not believe that any accommodation other than maintaining her prior specialist position would accommodate her needs.the court then offered to structure her rotation to include only the courtrooms with an adjacent restroom,but gratzl rejected this proposal as well.through further communication with gratzl and catrambone,the court learned that gratzl needed to be able to access a restroom within five minutes of feeling the urge to urinate,to prevent potential injury and the possibility of incontinent episodes.
gratzl reiterated her request to be placed exclusively in the control room.in response,the court proposed additional accommodations,including allowing her to avoid assignment to any courtrooms in which a trial was scheduled not assigning her to juvenile courtrooms,which were farther from the restrooms and establishing a high sign that she could use to signal to the presiding judge that she needed a break.gratzl did not present these new terms to catrambone but,feeling that the proposals did not accommodate her condition any better than the previous offers,rejected the offer.the court responded by reiterating that the job duties of all court reporters included rotating through both the courtrooms and the control room,repeating its latest offer of accommodation,and stating that gratzl was expected to return to work on october.when gratzl again rejected the offer,the court gave her until october to provide specific reasons why the offer remained incompatible with her condition.she responded that because her medical condition had not changed,further debate over the previously rejected offer served no purpose.on october,the court terminated gratzl employment.
gratzl then sued the office of the chief judges under the ada and the rehabilitation act for failing to accommodate her incontinence.the defendant moved for summary judgment,arguing that gratzl had not established that she was disabled under the ada and rehabilitation act,that it had offered her a reasonable accommodation,and that she was not qualified for the job of official court reporter if she could not do reporting.the district court concluded that gratzl had not established that she was disabled under the ada and rehabilitation act and granted summary judgment on that ground.it did not address the defendant other arguments.gratzl appeals.
