a petition under welfare and institutions code section charged appellant with felony carrying of a concealed firearm on his person.following the juvenile court denial of his motion to suppress evidence,appellant entered an admission he committed the charged offense,but declined to stipulate the offense was a felony rather than a wobbler.the trial court found otherwise,declared a wardship,and placed appellant with his parent subject to conditions of probation.appellant contends the judgment must be reversed because the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence the court erred following his guilty plea to count by determining his offense was punishable as a felony under penal code section,subdivision c and the prosecutor erroneously determined he was ineligible for deferred entry of judgment.we agree with the latter two contentions and will reverse and remand for appropriate proceedings to determine whether appellant is suitable for deferred entry of judgment and,if not,whether the offense is a felony or misdemeanor.

prosecution case 
at on march,san francisco police officer ryan doherty,together with officers dejesus and sample,were proceeding on howard street,a street,heading toward seventh street.the officers were in plainclothes and driving an unmarked patrol car.officer doherty was in the front passenger seat.the area was the site of a high number of robberies and auto boosts.
as the officers crossed moss street,officer doherty saw four individuals at the corner of moss and howard.it appeared three of them were surrounding the fourth,whose back appeared to be up against a building.the individuals seemed to be looking up and down the block as the officers passed through the intersection,leading doherty to believe there might be a crime in progress.the officers thought the person surrounded could be a robbery victim.one of the other three,the only one wearing a backpack,was appellant.appellant was standing at a position in relation to the individual against the building,assuming the latter was at the position.
as the officers passed the intersection,officer dejesus,the driver,said,did you see those guys dejesus stopped the vehicle out of view of the four individuals so that officer doherty could get out of the car and approach them on foot.officer sample got out of the car with doherty.to avoid a possible foot chase,officer dejesus backed the car to the intersection of moss and howard as doherty was about to walk around the corner.he did not activate his siren or emergency lights.
officer doherty turned the corner to make contact with the four individuals.his primary concern was to protect the person he thought was a robbery victim.the four juveniles appeared to be surprised when he said,police.officer doherty was wearing his badge around his neck,but was not sure he had pulled it out when he first approached.the four began to retreat toward the wall.standing in the same location where officer doherty first saw him,appellant was looking all around,which is a common sign to officer doherty of someone that is looking to run away.at some point during the initial contact,officer dejesus got out of the car and joined officers doherty and sample.
officer doherty asked,hey,what going on here you guys okay no one answered the question.standing about four or five feet from the officer,appellant announced,i not on probation.because officer doherty had not asked appellant about his probation status,the officer believed appellant was trying to hide something.without being commanded to,appellant and the others continued to retreat to the wall.noticing appellant was still looking around,officer doherty asked if he was carrying a weapon.appellant responded,you ca search me.officer doherty observed appellant was wearing clothing in which you could easily conceal a weapon.he found appellant statements evasive and considered his failure to answer the question whether or not he had a weapon indicative that he could be hiding something.accordingly,officer doherty decided to patsearch him while the officers conducted their investigation.
officer doherty placed appellant in a high profile cursory search position,with appellant hands behind his head.as the officer moved his hand down appellant body to search for any bulky object that might be a weapon,appellant began to shift around,and it appeared that he did not want the officer searching him.officer doherty believed appellant was trying to deter the officer from searching him.based on this,and appellant evasive actions from the beginning of the encounter,the officer interrupted his search and handcuffed appellant.he feared appellant might possibly have a weapon and believed his safety required placing appellant in handcuffs while he searched.officer doherty continued the search without resistance.
during the search,officer doherty picked up appellant backpack from its top to frisk his rear waistband.the officer could feel that the backpack had some weight in it.when officer doherty unzipped the backpack,appellant said,you ca search my backpack.the officer believed the backpack might contain a weapon because it did appear or feel like there were books in the backpack.
officer doherty found a firearm in the backpack.he found six caliber bullets wrapped in a clear plastic baggie in an interior pocket.
some time after the firearm was found,when all four juveniles were sitting on the curb,it became apparent to the officers these were four friends and no robbery had occurred.
defense case 
calvin was one of the other three minors with on the night of march.calvin testified he,and the two other minors were all close friends.all four friends were on spring break on the date of arrest.calvin was talking with and his other two friends when three officers in regular clothes he took to be narcs approached calvin.
before the officers approached,calvin,and his two other friends were standing in the alley in back of the building on the corner of moss and howard.calvin at first testified his back was not against the building but close to it.first,calvin and his friends were chatting in a circle but ended up in a line when the police came.calvin could not remember if any of his three friends had his back against the building wall before the officers approached them.
the first of the plainclothes officers who approached calvin and his three friends was officer doherty.officer doherty approached closest to was closest to the corner.after officer doherty approached the group,calvin saw him grab calvin testified doherty said,what are you guys doing here or what are you doing before grabbing later in his testimony,he stated doherty asked the group what was going on after putting his hands on 
officer doherty also told calvin and his two other friends not to move and started to search them.another officer searched calvin.while they were being grabbed,calvin heard tell officer doherty he was not on probation.officer doherty opened the backpack and found a firearm.
officer doherty did not ask calvin or any of his three friends if they were all right or about their.calvin initially asked one of the officers if he could sit down because my legs were tired.one of the male officers,not necessarily officer doherty,said,no.
trial court rulings 
the trial court denied the motion to suppress.the juvenile court found the officers decision to stop was motivated by the observations of an apparent robbery in a area at night.as officer doherty approached the minors,the court found appellant was looking around and backing up towards the building.it appeared to officer doherty that appellant was seeking to leave that area.
the court found that when officer doherty asked whether appellant had a weapon,the latter responded,you ca search me,which led the officer to believe the minor was hiding something.additionally,the officer was concerned based upon the fact that the minor was wearing clothing which could conceal a weapon.the court considered the patsearch for weapons a reasonable action to protect officer doherty and the other officers that were there,based on what had occurred to that point.in the course of pat searching the minor body,the officer went to move the backpack,felt the backpack was heavy and not heavy with books,but heavy with another object,which he thought might be a weapon.officer doherty search of the backpack was a reasonable action in the sense that he would certainly have the right to protect himself while conducting the investigation and for his safety.the court found no fourth amendment violation because all of the officer actions were reasonable.
immediately following the ruling,appellant admitted a violation of penal code section,subdivision a.upon the district attorney motion,the court dismissed counts and of the petition.juvenile court counsel stipulated to the factual basis for the admission,but when the court inquired as to the maximum custodial time for the offense,counsel stated she would stipulate for purposes of the plea to a maximum custody time of three years if the application of penal code section,subdivision c was upheld on appeal,but would not stipulate offense was in fact punishable under that subdivision.
on july,the court declared appellant a ward and placed him on probation subject to various terms and conditions.appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
appellant contends the judgment must be reversed in whole or part because the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence the court erred following his guilty plea to count by determining his offense was punishable as a felony under penal code section,subdivision c and the prosecutor erroneously determined he was ineligible for deferred entry of judgment.we find merit in the latter two contentions.
motion to suppress 
in ruling on a motion to suppress,the trial court must find the historical facts,select the rule of law,and apply it to the facts in order to determine whether the law as applied has been violated.we review the court resolution of the factual inquiry under the deferential standard.the ruling on whether the applicable law applies to the facts is a mixed question of law and fact that is subject to independent review.people saunders cal th.when a motion to suppress has been denied,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the order denying suppression.people colt th.this standard of review is equally applicable to juvenile court proceedings.in re lennies th.
in our view,the search here was reasonable under fourth amendment standards based on the facts found by the trial court,all of which were supported by substantial evidence.a police officer may get out of his patrol vehicle and approach a person on the street without necessarily implicating the fourth amendment.people rivera cal th.in this case,the initial contact with appellant and the other three juveniles could be described as a consensual encounter to check on the welfare of the individual officer doherty thought might be the victim of a robbery.at nighttime in an area known for robberies,the officers spotted three males surrounding another male whose back was against a wall.the males were looking up and down the block,potentially indicative of a crime in progress.based on these observations and circumstances,the officers acted reasonably in stopping and approaching to check on the welfare of the individual up against the wall.
the officers were in plainclothes,in an unmarked vehicle,and no emergency lights or sirens were activated.doherty announced he was police and inquired generally what was going on.at that point,there had been no display of authority sufficient to indicate a detention.the officers did not brandish weapons,block exits,or issue commands.see united states drayton.even doherty subsequent question to appellant whether he had a weapon can not be construed as a show of authority converting the encounter into a detention.id.at,police did not seize bus passengers when they boarded bus and questioned them about whether they had weapons or drugs.
however,even assuming for the sake of analysis that officer doherty initial contact with appellant and the others constituted a detention or became one when,according to appellant theory,he manifested lack of consent through his eye movements and retreat from the officer the detention was justified.the previously cited factors justifying the contact the time and place,the positioning of the males,their monitoring of the surroundings also justified a detention based on the officer reasonable suspicion that a robbery was being committed.see people souza cal th,detention is reasonable under the fourth amendment when the detaining officer can point to a particularized,objective basis for suspecting the person detained may be involved in criminal activity area reputation for criminal activity and time of night are relevant facts illinois wardlow,incidence of crime in the area and the lateness of the hour are both relevant in determining the legality of a detention.
officer doherty suspicion of a robbery in progress had not dissipated by the time he initiated the patsearch,as appellant contends.starting when the officers saw the individuals on the street,the entire encounter lasted not more than a couple of minutes.doherty testified it was not apparent there had been no robbery until after the weapon was found and the officers were able to determine the four juveniles were all friends.nothing that occurred up to the initiation of the patsearch should have made this apparent to the officers.when doherty asked if everything was all right,no one responded,except for appellant who announced he was not on probation.appellant then retreated from the officer,appeared anxious,and was wearing clothing in which a weapon could be easily concealed.when appellant continued to look around,doherty asked him if he had a weapon,to which appellant responded,you ca search me.none of these circumstances would have put doherty at ease.see illinois wardlow,supra,at suspect nervous and evasive behavior is a pertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion.
the fact an innocent explanation for appellant conduct was possible does not preclude the basis for a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.people letner and tobin cal th.resolving that ambiguity and establishing whether the activity is legal or illegal is the principal purpose of a police investigation.id.at.all of the foregoing circumstances,and the reasonable suspicion a robbery had been interrupted,were in fact indicative that appellant might have a weapon on his person.that fully justified a patsearch in the interest of officer safety.thus,even on the hypothesis a detention preceded the patsearch,the detention and search were both justified.
the search of appellant backpack was also justified.when officer doherty lifted it by its top handle to check appellant rear waistband,he felt it had some weight in it,and the backpack did not appear or feel like there were books inside.combined with the other circumstances suggestive that a robbery had been in progress and appellant was being evasive,the otherwise unexplained weight of the backpack gave doherty reason to believe it might hold a weapon.nor was it reasonable to expect doherty,before searching it,to squeeze and manipulate the outside of the backpack to ascertain whether it contained a weapon potentially a loaded firearm.i t is by no means clear that poking and prodding the outside of a duffel bag is the most sensible way to find a suspected loaded gun.no doubt,the frisking of the outside of a bag intrudes less on the privacy of the suspect.but at what cost who looks for a loaded gun by aimlessly grabbing and manipulating the outside of a large bag that may or may not contain the gun walker,see also peo
