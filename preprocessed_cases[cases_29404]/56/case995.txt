texas family code b requires a police officer taking a juvenile into custody to promptly notify the juvenile parents the issue presented in this case is whether the first court of appeals erred in holding that appellant written statement was automatically inadmissible because his parents were not notified in accordance with family code b.we hold that the first court of appeals erred.
relevant facts 
on february,appellant,chance derrick gonzales,shot and killed a convenience store clerk in houston during a botched attempt to steal beer.appellant,who was fifteen years old at the time,was later arrested and taken to a designated juvenile processing center en route,the arresting officers gave appellant the miranda warnings upon arrival,the officers took appellant written statement,in compliance with texas family code a 
the entire process,from the moment of appellant arrest until his later release to the juvenile detention facility,lasted about five hours.the arresting officer made no attempt to notify appellant parents.furthermore,the record suggests that appellant parents were not notified of his arrest until he was processed into the juvenile detention facility,five to six hours after he was initially taken into custody.
after the juvenile court waived its jurisdiction over appellant,a harris county grand jury indicted him for capital murder.see.a.appellant later filed a motion to suppress his written statement on the ground it was obtained in violation of texas family code b.more specifically,appellant argued that his confession must be suppressed because the police did not promptly notify his parents that he was in custody.at the conclusion of the suppression hearing,the trial court denied appellant motion.appellant then pled guilty to the lesser included offense of murder.
on appeal,appellant reiterated his argument that his statement must be suppressed.the first court of appeals agreed with appellant and held that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the statement.although we find that the requirements of texas family code section a a were met,we must conclude the appellant confession was inadmissible because of the violation of family code section b.gonzales state,dist.we granted the state petition for discretionary review to determine whether the court of appeals erred.see.proc.b.
in its brief to this court,the state argues that a juvenile written statement should not be subject to suppression without some showing of a causal connection between the failure to notify the juvenile parents and the juvenile execution of a written statement.
in order for a juvenile written statement to be suppressed because of a violation of b,there must be some exclusionary mechanism.unlike a,b is not an independent exclusionary statute.texas family code,however,provides that chapter,code of criminal procedure,appl ies in a judicial proceeding under this title.thus,if evidence is to be excluded because of a b violation,it must be excluded through the operation of article a.
article a provides that n o evidence obtained by an officer or other person in violation of any provisions of the constitution or laws of the state of texas shall be admitted in evidence.our decisions have established that evidence is not obtained in violation of a provision of law if there is no causal connection between the illegal conduct and the acquisition of the evidence.roquemore state,chavez state,state daugherty,johnson state,
in light of article a,the state argues,and we agree,that before a juvenile written statement can be excluded,there must be a causal connection between the family code violation and the making of the statement.here,the court of appeals did not discuss the requirements of article a.instead,the court held simply that the confession was automatically inadmissible because of the police officers failure to notify appellant parents,in violation of texas family code b the court relied on our decision in baptist vie le state.
in baptist vie le,we considered whether a violation of texas family code a required the suppression of an otherwise admissible statement.that section essentially provides that once a juvenile is taken into custody,he must either be taken,without unnecessary delay,to a juvenile processing center or there must be compliance with one of the other statutory options in that case,the officers took the juvenile to the homicide division of the police department,where they obtained a statement from him.the homicide division was not a juvenile processing center,nor did taking him there satisfy one of the other statutory options.thus,we held that the statement was inadmissible since the officers failed to comply with the family code.
in baptist vie le,we did not automatically exclude the evidence.rather,we recognized that article a provides the proper mechanism for excluding evidence obtained in violation of the family code.baptist vie le,at.moreover,nothing in baptist vie le did or could alter the statutory requirements of article a.see chavez,at daugherty,at johnson,at.furthermore,baptist vie le relied on and reaffirmed our previous decision in comer state.
in comer we our subsequent holdings in roquemore,chavez,johnson,and daugherty an exclusionary analysis under article a necessarily entails a causal connection analysis there,the appellant argued that his confession should have been suppressed because the police officer failed to comply with family code a we concluded that detaining a juvenile for approximately three hours to obtain his confession violated the a requirement that a juvenile be taken immediately to either an authorized officer of the juvenile court or to a juvenile detention center.however,we made it clear that a violation of a does not necessarily make a statement given by the child inadmissible.comer,at we further held that if evidence obtained in violation of the family code is to be excluded,article a is the proper mechanism for exclusion.id.at.
in the instant case,the court of appeals failed to consider whether there was a causal connection between the illegality and the acquisition of the evidence.therefore,we vacate the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
i concur in the judgment of the majority.i would differentiate the violation in this case from the violations in vie le state,and roquemore state.in vie le,the statement was obtained at the homicide department,which was not one of the places in which the taking of a statement from a juvenile was permitted.it was therefore obtained in violation of the family code a.we noted that the legislature intended to restrict involvement of law enforcement officers to the initial seizure and prompt release or commitment of the juvenile offender in accordance with a vie le at,quoting comer state.the family code sections at issue,a and,expressed that intent by limiting where law enforcement could take the child,when,and for what purpose.it is reasonable to conclude that the narrow limits on law enforcement involvement were a legislative effort to balance the competing interests of society protection from the criminal acts of juveniles and the juvenile protection from the use of coercion to obtain a statement.see,comer at.a violation of the family code that raises an issue as to the voluntariness of a statement by a juvenile because of possibly coercive conditions which produced that statement,implicates the standards set out in.
in roquemore,the challenged statement was not the result of custodial questioning or,indeed,any questioning at all.roquemore at the oral statements were not the result of any questions or conduct by the police officer.the provisions of did not,therefore,apply.as to the stolen property,we found a violation of a and its apparent expression of legislative intent to restrict involvement of law enforcement officers to the initial seizure and prompt release or commitment of the juvenile offender.
section sets out what must be done before the statement of a juvenile will be admissible the statement of a child is admissible in evidence if the reasonable inference is then that
