jesus,a minor born january,hereinafter jesus,represented by the los angeles county public defender office,filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus on december,for his release from central juvenile hall.jesus was the subject of a wardship petition pursuant to welfare and institutions code section and was placed in juvenile hall.at a september hearing he was found incompetent to stand trial and remained detained.we initially denied the petition on january,and jesus filed a petition for review with the supreme court.
the supreme court granted the petition for review on february.it ordered this court to vacate the january order denying habeas relief and directed us to issue an order to show cause why jesus prolonged detention without the provision of services was not in violation of the protocol issued by the los angeles superior court juvenile division and did not otherwise deny jesus due process of law.
on march,we issued an order to show cause.the los angeles county department of probation filed a return and the public defender office filed a traverse.the traverse indicated that as of may,jesus had been released and a continued hearing on competency was set for august.
we deny the petition for habeas corpus as moot but hold that a minor detained in juvenile hall pending attainment of competency must be provided with adequate services.

the protocol 
welfare and institutions code section provides during the pendency of any juvenile proceeding,the minor counsel or the court may express a doubt as to the minor competency.a minor is incompetent to proceed if he or she lacks sufficient present ability to consult with counsel and assist in preparing his or her defense with a reasonable degree of rational understanding,or lacks a rational as well as factual understanding,of the nature of the charges or proceedings against him or her.if the court finds substantial evidence raises a doubt as to the minor competency,the proceedings shall be suspended.the court shall appoint an expert to evaluate whether the minor suffers from a mental disorder,developmental disability,developmental immaturity,or other condition and,if so whether the condition or conditions impair the minor competency c if the minor is found to be incompetent by a preponderance of the evidence,all proceedings shall remain suspended for a period of time that is no longer than reasonably necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that the minor will attain competency in the foreseeable future,or the court no longer retains jurisdiction.during this time,the court may make orders that it deems appropriate for services that may assist the minor in attaining competency 
on january,the presiding judge of the juvenile division of the superior court of los angeles county issued a memorandum setting forth a protocol implementing welfare and institutions code section regarding juvenile competency to stand trial the protocol.
the protocol provides in pertinent part,if the court finds substantial evidence raises a doubt as to the minor competency the court shall suspend proceedings.if the court suspends proceedings,or grants minor request for a cst competency to stand trial evaluation,it shall appoint an expert from the juvenile competency to stand trial jcst panel under evidence code to perform a cst evaluation if the court finds the minor competent,it shall reinstate the delinquency proceedings and proceed with the case.however,if the court finds the minor incompetent to stand trial ist,all proceedings shall remain suspended for a period of time that is no longer than reasonably necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that the minor will attain competency in the foreseeable future,or the court no longer retains jurisdiction.
the protocol then outlines the procedures to be followed if the minor is detained.if the minor is detained the court shall set an ist planning hearing within calendar days.the court shall then order the probation department probation and the department of children and family of services dcfs to evaluate the minor and submit a planning report.if the court finds that there is a substantial probability that the minor will attain competency in the foreseeable future,the court shall order probation and the department of mental health dmh to begin immediate coordination of mental health and education services to help the minor attain competency.providing services to attain competency may include the coordination of services from dmh,regional center,education agencies and any other entity that has an obligation to provide services to the minor.to do this the court,or counsel,should consider joining such entities in the court proceeding if the minor has not been adjudged a ward or a dependent the court may issue subpoenas for persons,or agencies,who have an obligation to provide services to the minor.the case shall be set for an attainment of competency hearing within sixty days.pending attainment of competency,minor shall be held in the least restrictive setting and may only be detained if it is a matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the protection of the minor or reasonably necessary for the protection of the person or property of another the court shall review the appropriateness of minor detention at every hearing after a finding of ist.if the court finds that there is not a substantial probability that the minor will attain competency in the foreseeable future it shall dismiss the petition at the attainment hearing,probation shall submit a report that documents the specific services provided to the minor and,after consultation with the service provider,whether such services have been successful in helping minor to attain competency,and,if not,whether further efforts are likely to succeed if the court believes that minor has attained competency it shall reinstate juvenile proceedings.if the court finds that minor is not likely to attain competency in the foreseeable future,it shall dismiss the petition if the court finds that further efforts at attainment would be successful,it may order these services be provided for another period of sixty days.the minor may not be held in a juvenile hall to participate in attainment services for more than one hundred and twenty days.italics added.
competency hearing 
on may,jesus counsel expressed a doubt as to his competence.pursuant to the protocol,the juvenile court suspended proceedings and appointed timothy collister to evaluate jesus.
collister performed a competency evaluation on may.his report stated,inter alia,that jesus reported auditory and visual hallucinations and exhibited paranoia and suspicion.jesus was cutting himself before hospitalization and had again attempted to cut himself while at central juvenile hall.mother was physically abused by his biological father and had a dysfunctional relationship with stepfather.jesus had auditory processing deficits,difficulty maintaining interpersonal relationships and acted inappropriately,with a general pervasive mood of unhappiness and depression.he had communication skills in spanish but was not fluent in english.he had difficulty with attention and memory and deficits in verbal memory.it was collister opinion that jesus was not competent within the meaning of welfare and institutions code section.he has an inadequate factual and rational understanding of the criminal proceedings against him,and will not be able to assist counsel in a rational manner.his incompetence flows primarily from a mental disorder.collister felt it would be difficult for jesus to rationally analyze courtroom procedures.he did not understand basic courtroom terms,or the roles of various participants in the court process,even after receiving training from collister.collister felt that as jesus psychiatric disturbance was treated,and as his status improved,it remained possible that he could be found competent but there was not a substantial probability that this would occur.
in an addendum dated august,collister stated that after administration of a test,of individuals in the presumed incompetent group would have a greater understanding of the criminal proceedings than jesus does.
in august,the juvenile court ordered a report to be prepared pursuant to welfare and institutions code section the court also ordered probation to prepare a plan for the minor in the event he was found to be incompetent.
on september,the court held a hearing on jesus competency.collister testified,repeating his opinion that jesus was not competent to stand trial,but this time he stated,i think it developmental immaturity more than a mental disorder.his processing with respect to memory is at the level of a.and so the predominant reason for his incompetence is going to be the developmental immaturity.there is a mental disorder superimposed which probably can create difficulty as well,but i think the larger of his incompetence comes from his level of intellectual function.
collister defined developmental immaturity as where the level of intellectual function is weak enough that it is the cause of incompetence.jesus was not retarded technically,but he functioning at a very low level.collister also stated,however,that developmental immaturity could sometimes improve with the passage of time,but age and training may or may not fix it.he stated jesus had trouble with comprehension and memory and did not understand legal concepts even when collister trained him.jesus was confused about the role of the judge,and not necessarily because of a lack of education.jesus was able to learn some information about the court process,retain it and then explain it to collister,but it did not change collister opinion on his competency.his opinion did not change even though jesus had admitted to the sexual touching and giving his brother money to keep silent.collister reviewed education records which showed jesus verbal processing and receptive language in the borderline range and expressive language in the mild range of retardation.he explained for him to understand the reality of what transpiring and understand the process,what people are doing with him and what he needs to do in his own defense,thinking through rationally what he can do to assist counsel in his defense.i think those are going to be difficult things for him.collister again said that there not a substantial probability that he would attain competency i do think training is going to help him.it pretty much a fixed neurologic thing at this point.it may improve in time based on his development.
the court found jesus to be incompetent to stand trial.it then ordered probation,dmh and dcfs to evaluate jesus and to submit a planning report to the court on whether there are services available to help jesus attain competency.the court included dcfs because,although the minor is currently under the jurisdiction of dcfs,if charges are dismissed and the minor is returned home,there are two minor children in that home who probably need to be removed since they are also alleged victims in this case.
the ist planning hearing could not be held within the required day period required by the protocol because the judge was unavailable.the ist hearing was scheduled for october.
on october,the probation officer report was submitted.the probation officer had conflicting recommendations and did not have a placement available until,so it requested a continuance for a further report.jesus counsel opposed a continuance,because the protocol required a ruling on the issue of competency and because any further detention would be a violation of jesus constitutional rights.dcfs submitted a report concluding that jesus should be returned to the home with intensive wraparound services.the wraparound team would include a youth specialist specifically assigned to jesus,a parent partner assigned to support mother and a facilitator assigned to the family.the wraparound team members would go to the house on a weekly basis or more frequently as needed to provide counseling.if an emergency arose precipitated by jesus behavior,the mother would ensure that the siblings sleep in her bedroom.
the court stated,inter alia,the report does address some issues.probation indicates they believe the minor may be competent in the future i think the minor may be able to attain competency in the future with proper services.probation still has given us the proper services.i have issues with the public safety in that dcfs is recommending that the minor be placed in the home where both his victims are present i heard the testimony of the doctor.i do have to endorse his testimony but i do think it would be fair to the minor for me to make that determination now since we do have all of the information.
jesus counsel requested the court to order collister to appear at the next court hearing to testify,or in the alternative,to allocate more funds so collister could evaluate jesus and issue a further evaluation.the court denied the request and stated,again,we have two problems.number one,this protocol is so new that we do even have services in place yet.one of the problems with the legislation was that they provide something we supposed to do but no resources were allocated in order to attain competency.it looks like we may have those resources in place.i do know yet because the report was clear.that why i need a further report.i not saying i made a decision yet.i saying i need more information.
on november,the juvenile court held the ist planning hearing.the court proposed joining in representatives of dmh,dcfs and probation at the same time,but stated it did not have the resources to draft the joinder order and subpoenas.jesus counsel objected to his continued detention and indicated that it had been days since he was found incompetent and that there had been no remediation efforts by probation or dmh.
everyone expressed concern for jesus and concern that mother could not protect the siblings.the court stated,the problem,as i see it,is we have a protocol set up without the resources to help the minor attain competency.this is just a real dangerous thing for me to do i could see the minor being placed back home with the two victims being removed from the home and one of the departments taking responsibility to provide competency training.i think we might be able to fashion a plan,even with the limited resources we have.but again i going to suggest to both counsel we need to get all three agencies here at the same time and same place.the court declined to make a final ruling on whether the minor could attain competency.it denied the prosecutor request to set an attainment of competency hearing and appoint a juvenile expert on the competency plan.jesus counsel offered to prepare the joinder subpoenas.
the court scheduled another planning hearing for december.jesus counsel renewed her objection to the detention.
at the december,hearing,the court had a conference with representatives from dcfs,probation,dmh and county counsel.it then stated,this is a brand new procedure.i never done it before,and not many judges in the county have done it before.it my view that under our protocol the minor is entitled to be in the environment.it also my view that the court has an obligation to balance the rights of the minor against public safety issues before i return him to the home where the victims live,i want to initiate counseling services,obviously,to prevent another offense.and this concern is based upon the fact that the minor,while in the hall,has engaged in what has been described as oppositional defiance disorders,that is opposition against authority,and he has acted out sexually it my view that there is a danger of reoffense it may turn out probation may develop services that may be appropriate to both treat the minor and to bring him into competency,but those services will not be available for at least two months the wraparound team is going to explore with the department of mental health and probation getting or keeping wraparound services or fsp in place.the department of mental health,probation,and the wraparound team will explore getting sexual offender counseling in place and dcfs is going to explore whether or not they going to file a petition should the minor be returned home 
jesus counsel then argued that probation and dmh had provided no training and that jesus had been incarcerated nearly a year.she argued there should have been an attainment of competency hearing in november and that he could not be detained after january.
the court denied the request and the matter was continued to december.a petition for writ of habeas corpus was filed on december.we denied the petition for writ of habeas corpus on january.
on january,jesus counsel filed a petition for review with the supreme court.jesus remained detained and the matter was continued until february.
the supreme court granted review and ordered this court to issue an order to show cause why jesus prolonged detention without the provision of services was not in violation of the protocol issued by the juvenile division of the superior court of los angeles county and did not otherwise deny jesus due process of law.we issued an order to show cause on march.
probation return to the osc contended that jesus had been afforded due process and that it had not violated the protocol because jesus had been provided services to help him attain competency and that he had not been detained on an unreasonable basis for an unreasonable period of time.it argued that educational services and mental health services help attainment of competency,that jesus received these services,and that nothing indicated that these services were not effective.it argued that the protocol conflicts with welfare and institutions code section and is thus preempted.it requested judicial notice of the legislative history of welfare and institutions code section to demonstrate that a maximum for suspension of proceedings had been considered and was rejected,resulting in statutory language that limited the suspension of proceedings to a period which is no longer than reasonably necessary.
jesus counsel filed a traverse,which argued that jesus had not received attainment of competency services while in juvenile hall and that jesus was receiving educational services but not any other services.it also argued that welfare and institutions code section does not preempt the length of time that proceedings may be suspended,and not how long a minor may be detained in juvenile hall.finally,it asserted that jesus was deprived of equal protection and due process.
in the traverse,jesus counsel noted that jesus had been released april,and the matter had been set for a competency hearing on august.it contended the petition was not moot because it concerns a current and ongoing problem.
discussion 
is the protocol preempted by welfare and institutions code section 
in kalivas barry controls corporation th,a courtroom established a rule that parties to a summary judgment motion must file a joint statement of disputed and undisputed facts.the rule was in conflict with code of civil procedure section,which required the parties to file separate statements,as well as with the promulgation requirements contained in the code of civil procedure and the government code.the court of appeal held that trial judges have no authority to issue courtroom rules which conflict with statutes.id.at.
in hogoboom superior court th a family law mediation fee imposed by the los angeles county superior court for family law and domestic violence matters was found to be preempted by the family code and the government code.id.at.the court of appeal reviewed other state statutes and concluded the legislature had intended to determine the amount and type of fees imposed in conciliation court.id.at.
in los angeles county department of children and family services superior court th,a local rule was enacted to appoint independent counsel for children in dependency proceedings.no other court rule or code section was inconsistent or conflicted with the rule in question.the court of appeal found that the dependency court did not abuse its discretion in issuing the rule and that there was no preemption by state legislation or statewide court rules.id.at.it held that the policy and rule were reasonable and a permissible exercise of the court local power.id.at.
we conclude that the protocol is most like the local rule enacted in los angeles county department of children and family services superior court,supra,th.the protocol mirrors much of the language contained in the welfare and institutions code but adds additional language which does not conflict with that statute.welfare and institutions code section does not contain a time limitation on the duration of competency services or how long a minor may be detained in juvenile hall.section only addresses the length of time proceedings may be suspended due to a finding of incompetency,that is,no longer than is reasonably necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that the minor will attain competency in the foreseeable future or when the court no longer retains jurisdiction.welf,subd.c.the protocol also contains the same language limiting the time for suspension of proceedings.
the protocol day limitation on the detention period,therefore does not contradict or overrule welfare and institutions code section,but adds additional rules for competency proceedings.there are no other code provisions which address these issues.therefore we conclude the protocol is not preempted.
is the protocol constitutional 
in jackson indiana,a year old who was described as a mentally defective deaf mute who could not read,write or otherwise communicate except through limited sign language was charged with two robberies.id.at.the court appointed two psychiatrists to examine him.the two doctors submitted a joint report which concluded that he was unable to understand the nature of
