the social worker reported that the children,then five and three years old,were happy,healthy and.the caregivers were willing to adopt the children.the agency had also identified other families willing to adopt a sibling group similar to and

the social worker believed the children did not consider joseph to be a parental figure.did not appear to have a bond with joseph,and the benefits of adoption outweighed any residual relationship may have had with joseph.
the court found that adoption was in the best interests of the children and there was no compelling reason for determining that termination of parental rights would be detrimental to them.the court terminated the parental rights of joseph,rachel and presumed father,ruben.
discussion 
joseph contends the court erred when it did not conduct an evidentiary hearing on his section petition.joseph asserts he did not receive proper notice of the dependency proceedings and when the court determined he was the children presumed father he was entitled to custody of the children,or reunification services,absent a finding of detriment.
the agency asserts the court properly determined joseph did not make the requisite prima facie showing that would entitle him to a hearing on the merits of the petition.the agency argues joseph waited months to participate in the children dependency proceedings.his recent completion of a parenting course and ongoing participation in therapy did not establish a prima facie case of changed circumstances.further,joseph did not state any reason to show why additional delay in selecting and implanting a permanent plan for the children would be to their benefit.
minors counsel joins with the agency arguments.
under section,a party may petition the court to change,modify or set aside a previous court order.the petitioning party has the burden to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,there is a change of circumstances or new evidence,and the proposed modification is in the child best interests.cal.rules of court,rule a in re jasmon cal th,d,in re amber th,d.the court must liberally construe the petition in favor of its sufficiency.in re marilyn cal th,d,marilyn rule a.the parent need only make a prima facie showing to trigger the right to proceed by way of a full hearing.marilyn,supra,at,d,in re hashem th,d.
we review a summary denial of a hearing on a modification petition for abuse of discretion.in re zachary th,d.under this standard of review,we will not disturb the decision of the trial court unless the trial court exceeded the limits of legal discretion by making an arbitrary,capricious or patently absurd determination.in re geoffrey d.
the arguments joseph sets forth on appeal with respect to his section petition are without merit.joseph petition stated his circumstances had changed because he completed a parenting class and participated in individual counseling in the sibling case.he did not allege inadequate notice or that he was entitled to custody of the children unless the court made an express finding of detriment.where the parties assume certain issues are raised by the pleadings,nei
