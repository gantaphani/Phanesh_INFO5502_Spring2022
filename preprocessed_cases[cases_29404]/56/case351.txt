michael,appeals from the juvenile court order denying his fiancée status as a nonrelative extended family member nrefm under welfare and institutions code section we affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
in january,michael,michael,was adjudicated a dependent of the juvenile court due to domestic violence and his mother alcohol abuse.michael was placed in relative care with a maternal and uncle.michael father had not had any contact with him since approximately october and his whereabouts were unknown.
in may,michael relatives said they were no longer able to care for him.the san diego county health and human services agency agency detained michael in foster care in june,michael mother,jennifer,realized she was not ready to care for michael and asked the social worker to initiate an interstate compact on the placement of children icpc to allow her parents,who resided in michigan,to take guardianship of michael.the social worker reported that jennifer and michael had lived with the grandparents until november,when the grandparents moved to michigan.in,the grandparents cared for michael for a total of six months.they continued to telephone him every week.the court granted the social worker the discretion to place michael with his maternal grandparents upon icpc approval.
shortly before the review hearing,the agency located michael,in local custody.he did not expect to be released until october.michael,said he lived with his son for the first months of his life.he was incarcerated when michael was approximately three and years old.when michael,was released in april,he was unable to locate his son.michael,asked the agency to place michael with a paternal aunt and uncle in tennessee.he informed the social worker that he and his fiancée,were the parents of an infant son.
at a hearing on july,the court vacated its order granting the social worker discretion to place michael with his grandparents upon icpc approval and authorized the social worker to consider paternal relatives for placement.
on august,at the section jurisdictional and dispositional hearing,the social worker testified michael paternal aunt and uncle in tennessee had contacted her for placement and she had initiated an icpc evaluation of their home.icpc approval for michael placement with his grandparents was pending.the state of michigan required the grandparents to obtain a foster care license,which they were in the process of doing.
the social worker asked michael,whether would be interested in caring for michael.michael,said he was not sure.his preferred placement for michael was with his brother in tennessee.the social worker was willing to evaluate home for placement if she expressed an interest in caring for michael.
michael,testified he talked to a little bit about caring for michael.had never met michael but was willing to build a relationship with him.to his knowledge,she did not contact the social worker about michael placement.michael,was not opposed to placing michael with his maternal grandparents provided that michael could continue to visit his paternal relatives.
in closing argument,michael,asked the juvenile court to order the agency to evaluate for placement as a nrefm under section.
the juvenile court endorsed evaluating the maternal and paternal relatives for placement and said it would schedule a hearing if one or both of the relatives were approved for placement.the court found that was not married to michael,and was not considered michael relative.there was no evidence indicating michael had a relationship with either or his half brother,and denied the request to evaluate for placement as a nrefm.the court ordered that family reunification services not be provided to michael,because of the length of his incarceration and his lack of access to services in prison.the court found that jennifer was making some progress with her case plan and continued her reunification services to the month review date.
discussion 
michael,contends the juvenile court erred when it did not order the agency to investigate home for placement as a nrefm.he maintains that is his fiancée,and the mother of michael half brother,and thus she has an established familial relationship with michael.he argues the court erred when it found that needed to be a relative or to have met michael to qualify as a nrefm placement.michael,argues the court did not consider other criteria including ability to offer michael a familiar setting in san diego county,assist with visitation with both parents,facilitate reunification with jennifer and help michael establish a relationship with his half brother.
legal framework and standard of review 
in,recognizing the importance of continuity of community,school,church and friends to dependent children who have been removed from their families,the legislature enacted section,which permits a county welfare department to place a dependent child in the home of a nrefm.stats,ch,see samantha superior court th,samantha.a nrefm is defined as any adult caregiver who has an established familial or mentoring relationship with the child.nrefm may include relatives of the child teachers,medical professionals,clergy,neighbors and family friends.ibid.
the county welfare department must verify the existence of a relationship between the child and the individual seeking nrefm status through interviews with the parent and child or with one or more third parties.a child may not be placed with a nrefm unless that individual home meets standards for the licensing of foster family homes.ibid.any placement with a nrefm must be in the child best interests.samantha,supra,th at.
a nrefm placement may be appropriate in cases where the child does not have an existing relationship with the individual seeking nrefm status,if that individual has a close connection with the child family and placement will further the legislative goals of allowing the child to remain in familiar surroundings,facilitating family reunification or providing a culturally sensitive environment to the child samantha,supra,th at.thus an individual may qualify as a nrefm under the express terms of the statute or within the legislative goals of the statute.id.at.
we review questions of the interpretation of a statute,and its application to undisputed facts,de novo.in re fernando th.
the court interpretation of nrefm was overly narrow 
we are not persuaded by michael,argument nrefm status is conferred through a mutual relative when there is no existing relationship between the child and the individual seeking nrefm status.by its plain terms,section applies when the child has an existing relationship with the individual seeking nrefm status.county welfare department must verify the existence of a relationship between the child and the individual seeking nrefm status,italics added.nevertheless,we conclude that the juvenile court interpretation of nrefm status did not fully comport with current law.see samantha,supra,th at.
the juvenile court declined to order the agency to evaluate home for placement because she had never met michael and michael did not have any relationship with his half brother.if the child does not have an existing relationship with the individual seeking nrefm status,the court then considers whether that individual has a close connection with the child family and whether the child placement in the nrefm home will further the legislative goals of allowing the child to remain in familiar surroundings,facilitating family reunification or providing a environment to the child.samantha,supra,th at.here,to the extent the court considered the nature of michael and relationship,it did not examine whether michael placement with would further the legislative goals of section,as discussed in samantha 
notwithstanding the court restrictive interpretation of section,we conclude that the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the request to order the agency to evaluate home for nrefm placement.
the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to order the agency to investigate home for placement 
on this record,we can not conclude the juvenile court erred when
