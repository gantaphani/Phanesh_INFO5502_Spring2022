introduction 
appellant stacey mother appeals the juvenile court dispositional order removing her sons,dakota and joseph,from her physical custody and ordering suitable placement.mother contends the court erred by removing the boys under welfare institutions code section,subdivision c,because the boys were not in her physical custody at the time the department filed its petition,and had not been in her custody for several years prior mother also argues,in the alternative,that no substantial evidence supports the removal order,and that the court should have considered noncustodial placement under section,subdivision a,rather than removal under section,subdivision c.we agree with mother first argument and reverse.
facts and procedural background 
mother has three children,dakota age,joseph age and faith age.all three children were the subject of a prior juvenile dependency proceeding initiated in.in connection with that proceeding,mother was awarded legal and physical custody of dakota and joseph in however,for the past six or seven years,the boys lived with their father,michael y,and saw mother only for a few hours each week faith continued to reside with mother.
in october,the department of children and family services department received an anonymous referral regarding faith.in response to the referral,a department social worker attempted to visit mother and faith at the hotel where they were living.mother refused to open the door to her hotel room or to speak with the social worker.a few days later,another social worker attempted to visit mother at the hotel.although mother initially opened the door to her room,when she learned the social worker was from the department,she responded with profanity and threats of violence,then slammed the door.at the social worker request,officers from the inglewood police department came to the hotel to assist with the department investigation.mother refused to open her hotel room door,and would not comply with the officers verbal request to allow the social worker to see faith and assess her condition.after the officers learned that there were outstanding warrants against mother,they obtained a key from the hotel attendant and opened the hotel room door.the officers entered the hotel room and observed faith sitting on the bed.mother said to the officers,i have a right to kill you here because i do like cops.i have a right to murder you here now that you are inside my home.mother attempted to strike the officers and,after a brief struggle,one of the officers used a taser to subdue her.mother was subsequently hospitalized with a broken arm.
with mother consent,the department placed faith temporarily with a family friend,dorothy,while mother was in the hospital.during an initial interview,faith told the social worker she was nine years old but did not go to school.faith said she left the hotel room only occasionally,when she would go with her mother to buy cigarettes.faith also disclosed that mother smoked cigarettes and other stuff.
the department conducted a comprehensive investigation of the family over the next several weeks.after mother was discharged from the hospital,a social worker visited mother and faith at dorothy home.mother appeared frustrated by the investigation and denied neglecting faith.mother initially refused to answer the social worker questions,stating you guys are in the process of me being in the cold war.it international elite conspiracy.i do need to answer you.mother later explained to the social worker that she had a microchip implanted in the left side of her neck behind her left ear to protect her.mother stated she did not abuse the power of the microchip even though she could have used it to find out classified information 
mother became increasingly agitated during the interview at dorothy house and asked the social worker if dorothy could join them.when the social worker stated the interview was intended to be confidential,mother responded,t here is nothing confidential with me because i am sure the people at pentagon sic.are listening through the microchip.mother also said the microchip implanted in her head sent her visual images,and the people watching her were mixed people who were alien species that look like people,and were everywhere.mother stated she taught faith how to identify the aliens because most people can not recognize them and they can come through the television.she told the social worker she had been seeing white flies flying all over her recently,and also explained that the moon is a holographic satellite.
with regard to faith,mother confirmed she was being homeschooled,but acknowledged the homeschooling was not being overseen by any educational entity.although mother denied taking faith to beg for money,she admitted that they go out to do freedom of speech stuff which is asking for money.mother claimed faith had been receiving regular medical care,but refused to provide the name of any physician who had ever treated faith.mother also acknowledged that faith did not receive immunizations because they are poisonous,and did not see a dentist because dentists are scandalous and the fluoride in the toothpaste is poisonous.as to dakota and joseph,mother confirmed their father was in jail and the boys were living with michael 
after meeting with mother,the social worker interviewed faith,who confirmed many of the details mother provided.faith disclosed she had seen her mother smoke cigarettes and something that looked like little white stone and wood color looking wrapper,and that mother had a pipe and would sometimes put flowers in the pipe and smoke.
a few weeks after the interview at dorothy house,the social worker called mother to confirm that she would be taking faith to get a medical examination.mother said the hospital had contacted her to schedule an appointment.however,mother responded,i do have to do anything that you guys said and i am not taking her to harbor ucla.those government hospitals are where they implant microchip in people.i think you are working with the zulus and you seem to be an agent.mother abruptly ended the phone call and the department further efforts to contact her were unsuccessful.
the department also interviewed dakota and joseph dakota told the social worker he and joseph lived with mother until he was or years old,at which time mother was evicted from her home.dakota and joseph had been living with michael since that time.dakota stated he was attending continuation school,rather than high school.he explained that during and grades he did do his homework and,as a result,fell behind in school.although dakota initially said mother was mentally fine,he later said she believes that there are too many conspiracies about the government and that the moon is a hologram.she just says things that i can not understand,at times.dakota remembered mother participated in a drug rehabilitation program when he was four years old in order to treat her crack cocaine addiction and denied mother was currently using drugs.
joseph said he believed mother is a good mom,but can be overprotective.he expressed concern for mother mental health,stating i am worried about her paranoia,because she believes there are problems with the world and that someone could break into the house to kill us or hurt us.joseph confirmed he was having difficulty in school but was trying to schedule time to do his homework.he described michael as a nice guy,and said michael provided food for the boys,transported them as needed,and washed their laundry for them.joseph confirmed he felt safe with michael and at his home.
on november,the department filed a juvenile dependency petition under section,subdivision b,seeking jurisdiction over all three children.the department alleged mother was unable to provide regular care and supervision of the children due to her mental health condition specifically,mother appeared to suffer from delusions,visual hallucinations and paranoid behaviors.mother denied the allegations of the petition.the court detained all three children and ordered mother visitation to be supervised.the court also ordered mother to submit to random drug testing as well as a mental health and dual diagnosis assessment.
the department attempted to contact mother in december regarding the petition.mother stated she would not talk with the social worker without her attorney present.the department repeatedly attempted to contact both mother and her attorney,without success.the department also interviewed the children again.dakota said that although mother believed in conspiracies,it did not affect her ability to parent the children.he said he had heard his mother talk about the microchip in her head and her belief that she was being watched through the television,but said,i do pay attention to it.i feel safe with my mom.i never felt threatened by my mom in any way.joseph responded in a similar fashion.faith told the social worker that mommy believes there are aliens in the tv.mommy do like fluoride she says its poison.we use water to brush our teeth.
the department filed an amended petition on january,adding an allegation that mother was unable to care for her children due to chronic use of marijuana and cocaine.according to the department last minute information dated march,mother submitted to seven drug tests between november,and february.mother tested positive for opiates codeine,morphine,hydrocodone on four occasions and failed to appear on one occasion.she tested negative for all drugs on one occasion,but also tested positive for cocaine on another occasion.in response to the positive drug tests,mother told the department she was taking prescription pain medication,but she initially failed to provide the department with copies or any other evidence of the prescriptions.however,mother later photographed the prescription bottles and provided the photos to the department.mother also stated on march,that she would not continue to submit to drug tests or follow the other court directives because she feels that the drug testing site lied and that they are setting her up.her counsel later represented that mother believes that the positive test for cocaine on january was tampered with by pacific toxicology somebody associated with pacific toxicology.
the court held an adjudication hearing on april.the court found true both allegations regarding mother and found jurisdiction with respect to all three children under section,subdivision b.with respect to the disposition,the court declared all three children to be dependents of the court and then found,by clear and convincing evidence,that there would be a substantial danger to the children physical health,safety,protection,physical and emotional if they were returned to mother.accordingly,the court issued an order removing all three children from mother and ordering suitable placement.
mother timely appeals.
discussion 
this case presents the following issue for our consideration where clear and convincing evidence supports removal of one child from a parent physical custody,may a juvenile court also order removal of the parent other children,when those children are not living with that parent at the relevant time we conclude the court may not do so because,as mother argues,the legislature has only authorized removal of a child from the physical custody of the parent s with whom the child resides at the time the petition was initiated,subd.c,emphasis added.
although we usually review dispositional orders for substantial evidence,because the issue in this case involves the interpretation and application of a statute,our review is de novo.in re th.
the court erred by applying the removal statute to dakota and joseph 
section,subdivision c,provides in relevant part a dependent child shall not be taken from the physical custody of his or her parents or guardian or guardians with whom the child resides at the time the petition was initiated,unless the juvenile court finds clear and convincing evidence t here is or would be a substantial danger to the physical health,safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the minor if the minor were returned home,and there are no reasonable means by which the minor physical health can be protected without removing the minor from the minor parent or guardian physical custody,subd.c.mother primary contention on appeal is that section,subdivision c,does not apply to dakota and joseph because the boys were not in her physical custody it was undisputed the boys had been living with their for at least five years before the department filed its petition in this case.we agree.
in construing a statute,our role is to ascertain the legislature intent so that we may effectuate the purpose of the law.in re cal th.we consider the words of the statute first,because they are normally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.ibid.where,as here,the statutory language is unambiguous,the plain meaning controls.see,in re,supra,th at.
section,subdivision c,authorizes a child removal from the physical custody of his or her parents or guardian or guardians with whom the child resides at the time the petition was initiated,subd.c,emphasis added.although we found no published case in the juvenile dependency context addressing the meaning of resides as it is used in this section,historically the term resides has been commonly used and understood to mean to dwell permanently or for a considerable amount of time.leroux industrial acc.commission of cal,see also merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed,reside to dwell permanently or continuously.applying this definition,it is plain that the statute does not contemplate that a child could be removed from a parent who is not living with the child at the relevant time 
our interpretation of the statute is internally consistent.for instance,section,subdivision c,also provides that where a child under the age of five has been declared a dependent of the court due to severe physical abuse by the parent or other adult known to the parent,the court must consider,as a reasonable means to protect the minor,each of the following a the option of removing an offending parent or guardian from the home.b allowing a nonoffending parent or guardian to retain physical custody as long as that parent or guardian presents a plan acceptable to the court demonstrating that he or she will be able to protect the child from future harm,subd.c.these provisions reflect the statute focus on removal as a means of addressing abuse and neglect originating from the child home environment in particular.
our interpretation is also compatible with the considerable body of case law emphasizing that one of the major goals of the dependency system is to preserve the family unit.the governing statute,section,subdivision c,is clear and specific even though children may be dependents of the juvenile court,they shall not be removed from the home in which they are residing at the time of the petition unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a substantial danger to the child physical health,safety,protection,or physical or emotional and there are no reasonable means by which the child can be protected without removal.citation.the statute embodies an effort to shift the emphasis of the child dependency laws to maintaining children in their natural parent homes where it was safe to do so.citations.in re jasmine th.in that context,courts have consistently held that removal is a last resort,to be considered only when the child would be in danger if allowed to reside with the parent.in re henry th.
we are aware that mother was given legal custody of the boys in,in connection with a prior dependency proceeding.however,given the plain meaning of the statute and a common sense interpretation of the phrase parent with whom the child resides,we conclude the statute does not authorize an order of removal from every parent having legal custody rights,even those who do not currently reside with their children.rather,as we have concluded,the legislature chose to authorize removal only from a parent who is residing with his or her child.in re isayah th,a parent may have custody of a child,in a legal sense,even while delegating the care of that child to a third party for a limited period of time.courts considering temporary placement following
