we have for review the decision of the fourth district court of appeal in fields kirton,so d dca,which certified the following question to be of great public importance 
whether a parent may bind a minor estate by the execution of a release.
we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const for the reasons discussed below,we answer the certified question in the negative and hold that a parent does not have the authority to execute a release on behalf of a minor child when the release involves participation in a commercial activity 
statement of the case and facts 
the instant action arises from the decision by the fourth district court of appeal in fields kirton,so d dca.the facts of the underlying action were detailed in the opinion of that court 
pursuant to a final judgment of dissolution of marriage,bobby jones was the primary residential parent for his fourteen year old son,christopher.on may,the father took christopher to thunder cross motor sports park to ride his all terrain vehicle atv.to gain entry to the facility and be allowed to participate in riding the atv,bobby jones,as christopher natural guardian,signed a release and waiver of liability,assumption of risk,and indemnity agreement.while attempting a particular jump,christopher lost control of his atv,causing himself to be ejected.tragically,he hit the ground with the atv landing on top of him.he got up,walked a short distance,then collapsed and died.christopher mother,bette jones,was unaware that the father was permitting their son to engage in this activity.she was also unaware that approximately one month prior to the accident causing christopher death,he had attempted the same jump,resulting in a fractured rib and mild concussion.
subsequently,fields,as personal representative of the estate of christopher jones,filed suit for wrongful death against spencer kirton,scott corey kirton,dudley kirton,and the kirton brother lawn service,the kirtons as owners and operators of thunder cross motor sports.the amended complaint also named dean dyess as a defendant for his participation in the management of the park.the kirtons then filed an answer and affirmative defenses to the amended complaint.in one of the affirmative defenses,the kirtons argued that the claims raised by fields were barred by the release and waiver executed by jones on behalf of his son.the kirtons thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment based on the release and waiver the trial court entered an order granting the kirtons motion for summary judgment on the wrongful death claim,finding that there was no genuine issue of material fact because the release executed by jones on behalf of his minor child,christopher,barred the claim.
on appeal,the fourth district reversed the trial court order granting the motion for summary judgment.in doing so,the district court emphasized that the issue was not about a parent decision on what activities are appropriate for his or her minor child,which is properly left to the parent.instead,the issue concerned the decision to absolve the provider of an activity from liability for any form of negligence which goes beyond the scope of determining which activity a person feels is appropriate for their child.id.at.this is because the effect of the parent decision in signing a release impacts the minor estate and the property rights personal to the minor.as a result,the district court found that these rights could not be waived by the parents absent a basis in common law or statute.id.at.the district court found that there was no statutory scheme governing the issue of releases signed by parents on behalf of minor children.because there is no basis in common law or statute,the district court found that the courts do not have the authority to judicially legislate that which necessarily must originate,if it is to be law,with the legislature.id.at.accordingly,the district court held that a parent could not bind a minor estate by the parent execution of a release.in doing so,the fourth district also certified the above question to be of great public importance and certified conflict with the fifth district court of appeal decision in lantz iron horse saloon,so d dca.
the issue in this case is the enforceability of a release executed by a parent on behalf of a minor child that binds a minor child estate and releases an activity provider from liability.because the enforceability of the release is a question of law arising from undisputed facts,the standard of review is de novo.see fitzmaurice,so d,stating that the standard of review for pure questions of law is de novo and no deference is given to the judgment of the lower courts.
the kirtons and the amicus curiae supporting their position assert that a parent has a fundamental right to make decisions relating to the care of a minor child,and that right includes executing a release on behalf of the minor child.the kirtons also argue that enforcing the validity of a release is consistent with florida courts that have ruled that a parent has the prelitigation right to forego settlement awards in favor of pursuing a lawsuit without court approval or appointment of a guardian ad litem.on the other hand,fields contends that releases are invalid because neither the common law nor the legislature has given parents the authority to waive these substantive rights of a minor child.
parental authority and the state parens patriae authority 
the enforceability of a release concerns two compelling interests that of the parents in raising their children and that of the state to protect children.parental authority over decisions involving their minor children derives from the liberty interest contained in the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution and the guarantee of privacy in article i,section of the florida constitution.see troxel granville,d plurality opinion in light of this extensive precedent,it can not now be doubted that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of their children.see also beagle beagle,so d,the fundamental liberty interest in parenting is protected by both the florida and federal constitutions.in florida,it is specifically protected by our privacy provision.in fact,beginning with meyer nebraska,the united states supreme court has recognized that parents have a constitutionally protected interest in child rearing.in troxel,the united states supreme court further pointed to a presumption that 
fit parents act in the best interests of their children accordingly,so long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children,is fit,there will normally be no reason for the state to inject itself into the private realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent children.
at.see also von eiff azicri,so d,neither the legislature nor the courts may properly intervene in parental absent significant harm to the child threatened by or resulting from those decisions.
however,these parental rights are not absolute and the state as parens patriae may,in certain situations,usurp parental control.in global travel marketing,shea,so d,we explained the concept of parens patriae as applied in this state 
parens patriae,which is latin for parent of his or her country,describes the state in its capacity as provider of protection to those unable to care for themselves.black law dictionary ed.the doctrine derives from the concept of royal prerogative,recognized by american courts in the form of legislative prerogative.see alfred snapp son,puerto rico ex rel.barez,d.the united states supreme court,upholding a state child labor law in prince massachusetts,recognized the parens patriae power when it stated that although the custody,care,and nurture of the child reside first in the parents,the state as parens patriae may restrict the parent control by requiring school attendance,regulating or prohibiting the child labor and in many other ways.id.at.footnotes omitted.
in decisions over the past three decades,this court has expressly relied on the state parens patriae authority to protect children in two areas juvenile delinquency and dependency,see state,so d,state,so d,in re camm,so d,and child custody and support.see schutz schutz,so d,lamm chapman,so d,kern kern,so d.pervasive statutory schemes cover each of these areas.see generally ch.stat.proceedings relating to children ch.stat.dissolution of marriage support custody ch.stat.children and families in need of services ch.stat.delinquency interstate compact on juveniles.
although there is no statutory scheme governing releases,the kirtons argue that a parent execution of a release falls squarely within the parent authority to settle pursuant to section,florida statutes.this statutory provision allows a parent,acting as the natural guardian of a minor child,to settle the child claim for amounts up to.the kirtons reason that because at the time a parent signs a release,the claim is worth less than,the parent authority to execute a release for a minor child falls within this section.contrary to the kirtons assertion,a parent authority to execute a release on behalf of a minor child does not fall within the purview of section.section,florida statutes,applies to situations where a minor child already has a cause of action against another party.a release is executed before any cause of action accrues and extinguishes any possible cause of action.
the absence of a statute governing parental releases demonstrates that the legislature has not precluded the enforcement of such releases on behalf of a minor child.see global travel,shea,so d,noting that the absence of a statutory scheme governing a parent agreement to binding arbitration on behalf of a minor child demonstrates that the legislature has not precluded the enforcement of such agreements.however,we find that public policy concerns can not allow parents to execute releases on behalf of minor children.
florida courts 
although this is an issue of first impression for this court,the district courts of florida have addressed this matter,but their decisions have not been consistent.in lantz iron horse saloon,so d dca,the minor child natural guardian filed suit against iron horse saloon after the child was injured while operating a pocket bike on the iron horse premises.id.at.the trial court granted iron horse motion to dismiss the complaint based on the release executed by the minor child guardian.on appeal,the fifth district affirmed the trial court order granting the motion,finding that the release was sufficient to bar the child claim.id.at.however,the fifth district decision was based on the finding that the release clearly and unequivocally relieved iron horse from liability.the district court did not focus on whether the guardian had authority to execute the release on behalf of the minor.id.
in gonzalez city of coral gables,so d dca,the mother signed a release so that the minor child could participate in the coral gables fire rescue explorer program.after the child was injured,the mother filed suit and the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the city based on the release the mother had signed.the third district affirmed and found that the release barred the mother claim on behalf of the minor child.id.at.the district court relied on a distinction the fourth district made in shea global travel marketing,so d,dca,quashed,so d,between community and activities and commercial activities.the third district found that because the explorer program was a activity,the release was enforceable.gonzalez,so d at the third district similarly found a parent execution of a release on behalf of a minor child,for participation on the high school cheerleading squad,enforceable.see krathen school bd.of monroe,so d dca.in krathen,the third district again discussed the fourth district distinction in shea between activities and commercial activities.id.at.however,the third district decision ultimately relied on this court finding in shea that parents have the authority to make the decision whether to waive a child litigation rights in exchange for participation in an activity the parent feels is beneficial for the child.id.at citing global travel,shea,so d.
on the other hand,in applegate cable water ski,so d dca,a case decided after lantz,the fifth district aligned itself with the fourth district in the instant case and held that releases are unenforceable as against public policy.applegate involved a minor child who was injured while wakeboarding at a camp.in finding the parent execution of the release unenforceable,the district court emphasized that its decision was limited to commercial enterprises because t hey can insure against the risk of loss and include these costs in the price of participation.id.at.
in global travel marketing,shea,the father brought a wrongful death action against a safari operator for the death of his son who was mauled by hyenas while on the safari.so d at.before the safari,the child mother signed a travel contract on behalf of herself and her son,which included a release of liability and an arbitration agreement provision.based on the travel contract,global travel moved to stay the proceedings and compel arbitration of the father claim,which the trial court granted.id.on appeal,the fourth district reversed and found the arbitration clause unenforceable as to the child based on public policy grounds.id.at.however,this court quashed the fourth district decision and found the arbitration agreement enforceable against the minor or minor estate in a tort action arising from the contract in doing so,this court reasoned that if the courts required parents to seek court approval before entering into travel contracts that included arbitration agreements,courts would be second guessing a fit parent decision.id.at.the court emphasized that parents who decide which activities their children can participate in may also decide on behalf of their children to arbitrate a resulting tort claim if the risks of these activities are realized.id.
a federal district court in florida in two separate cases also found that releases signed by parents on behalf of their minor children were invalid.see in re royal carribean cruises,d in re royal caribbean cruises,d where both the father and minor child were injured on a jet ski that was owned by royal caribbean on the island of coco cay,bahamas.in both cases,the federal district court reviewed precedent and found that in cases involving or activities the courts upheld releases,and in cases involving commercial activities the courts have found the releases unenforceable.in re carribean cruises,d at in re royal caribbean cruises,d at.
other states and federal courts have also addressed the propriety of a parent or guardian execution of a release on behalf of a minor child.in holding that releases executed by parents on behalf of minor children are unenforceable for participation in commercial activities,we are in agreement with the majority of other jurisdictions.see,johnson new river scenic whitewater tours,d finding a parent could not waive liability on behalf of a minor child and also could not indemnify a third party against the parent minor child for liability for conduct that violated a safety statute such as the whitewater responsibility act meyer naperville manner,d,finding a parental waiver unenforceable in a situation where the minor child was injured after falling off a horse at a horseback riding school doyle bowdoin,me stating in dicta that a parent can not release a child cause of action smith ymca of benton.joseph,it is well settled in michigan that,as a general rule,a parent has no authority,merely by virtue of being a parent,to waive,release,or compromise claims by or against the parent child.hojnowski vans skate park,finding that where a child was injured while skateboarding at a skate park facility,a parent may not bind a minor child to a release of a minor prospective tort claims resulting from the minor use of a commercial recreational facility childress madison county,extending the law that a parent could not execute a release on behalf of a minor child to a mentally handicapped student who was injured while training for the special olympics at a ymca swimming pool munoz ii jaz,finding that giving parents the power to waive a child cause of action for personal injuries is against public policy to protect the interests of children hawkins peart,utah concluding that a parent does not have the authority to release a child claims before an injury,where the child was injured as a result of falling off a horse provided by a commercial business hiett lake barcroft cmty.ass,concluding that public policy prohibits the use of waivers of liability for personal injury due to future acts of negligence,whether for minor children or adults scott pac.mountain resort,holding that the enforcement of an exculpatory agreement signed by a parent on behalf of a minor child participating in a ski school is contrary to public policy.
although there are jurisdictions where releases executed by parents on behalf of minor children have been found enforceable,we note that the only published decisions where they have been upheld involved a minor participation in or activities.see,hohe san diego unified sch,d.finding the release executed by the father on behalf of the minor child enforceable against any claims resulting from the child participation in a event sharon city of newton,holding that a parent has the authority to bind a minor child to a waiver of liability as a condition of a child participation in public school extracurricular sports activities zivich mentor soccer club,ohio,concluding that a parent may bind a minor child to a release of volunteers and sponsors of a nonprofit sports activity from liability for negligence because the threat of liability would strongly deter many individuals from volunteering for nonprofit organizations because of the potential for substantial damage awards.
while this particular case involves a commercial activity,we note that these jurisdictions that have upheld releases have done so because and type activities involve different policy considerations than those associated with commercial activities.as the ohio supreme court explained in zivich,in community and activities,the providers can not afford to carry liability insurance because volunteers offer their services without receiving any financial return.at.if releases were invalidated,these volunteers would be faced with the threat of lawsuits and the potential for substantial damage awards,which could lead volunteers to decide that the risk is not worth the effort.
the trial court in this case specifically relied on the case law that has upheld the enforceability of the release executed by the father on behalf of the deceased minor child in granting a motion for summary judgment in favor of the kirtons.in reversing the trial court order,the fourth district first acknowledged that as part of the liberty interest contained in the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution and the guarantee of privacy in article i,section of the florida constitution,parents have a right to determine what activities may be appropriate for the minor child participation.however,the district court determined that the decision to absolve the provider of an activity from liability for any form of negligence regardless of the inherent risk or danger in the activity goes beyond the scope of determining which activity a person feels is appropriate for their child.fields,so d at.we agree.
although parents undoubtedly have a fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care,custody,upbringing,and control of their children,troxel,at,the question of whether a parent should be allowed to waive a minor child future tort claims implicates wider public policy concerns.see hojnowski,at.while a parent decision to allow a minor child to participate in a particular activity is part of the parent fundamental right to raise a child,this does not equate with a conclusion that a parent has a fundamental right to execute a release of a tortfeasor on behalf of a minor child.it can not be presumed that a parent who has decided to voluntarily risk a minor child physical is acting in the child best interest.furthermore,we find that there is injustice when a parent agrees to waive the tort claims of a minor child and deprive the child of the right to legal relief when the child is injured as a result of another party negligence.when a parent executes such a release and a child is injured,the provider of the activity escapes liability while the parent is left to deal with the financial burden of an injured child.if the parent can not afford to bear that burden,the parties who suffer are the child,other family members,and the people of the state who will be called on to bear that financial burden.therefore,when a parent decides to execute a release on behalf of a minor child,the parent is not protecting the welfare of the child,but is instead protecting the interests of the activity provider.moreover,a parent decision in signing a release impacts the minor estate and the property rights personal to the minor.fields,so d at.for this reason,the state must assert its role under parens patriae to protect the interests of the minor children.
business owners owe their patrons a duty of reasonable care and to maintain a safe environment for the activity they provide.see hojnowski,at.if releases were permitted for commercial establishments,the incentive to take reasonable precautions to protect the safety of minor children would be removed.id.moreover,as a provider of the activity,a commercial business can take precautions to ensure the child safety and insure itself when a minor child is injured while participating in the activity.on the other hand,a minor child can not insure himself or herself against the risks involved in participating in that activity.as the new jersey supreme court stated in hojnowski 
the operator of a commercial recreational enterprise can inspect the premises for unsafe conditions,train his or her employees with regard to the facility proper operation,and regulate the types of activities permitted to occur.such an operator also can obtain insurance and spread the costs of insurance among its customers.children,on the other hand,are not in a position to discover hazardous conditions or insure against risks.moreover,the expectation that a commercial facility will be reasonably safe to do that which is within the scope of the invitation,is especially important where the facility patrons are minor children.if we were to permit waivers of liability,we would remove a significant incentive for operators of commercial enterprises that attract children to take reasonable precautions to protect their safety.
id.citations omitted.
based on these public policy concerns,it is clear that the release executed by bobby jones on behalf of his now deceased son was unenforceable because it prevented the minor estate from bringing a cause of action against the commercial establishment that provided the activity which resulted in the minor death.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth above,we hold that a release executed by a parent on behalf of a minor child is unenforceable against the minor or the minor estate in a tort action arising from injuries resulting from participation in a commercial activity.accordingly,we answer the certified question in the negative,approve the decision of the fourth district,disapprove the fifth district decision in lantz,and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
i concur in the majority opinion and write separately to emphasize that our holding is narrowly directed at those commercial operators who wrongfully and negligently cause injury to a child but seek to be relieved of liability for their misconduct by securing a release from the child parent.of course,under today holding commercial operators who properly conduct their operations and can not be demonstrated to have acted negligently will continue to be free of liability.on the other hand,florida children and parents need not worry,after today decision,that careless commercial operators may be immunized from their carelessness by the presence of an exculpatory clause in a ticket for admission.
finally,i also find the articulation of the policy considerations supporting today decision set out in judge torpy opinion for the fifth district in applegate to be particularly instructive and persuasive 
exculpatory contracts are,by public policy,disfavored in the law because they relieve one party of the obligation to use due care and shift the risk of injury to the party who is probably least equipped to take the necessary precautions to avoid injury and bear the risk of loss.cain banka,so d,dca.nevertheless,because of a countervailing policy that favors the enforcement of contracts,as a general proposition,unambiguous exculpatory contracts are enforceable unless they contravene public policy.ivey plants,fmc,so d,dca restatement second of torts.
appellants concede that the contract at issue here is unambiguous but urge that the general rule should give way to an overriding public policy of protecting children from damages caused by negligently imposed injuries.this argument finds considerable support in the decisional law across the country.we are persuaded by some of the reasoning advanced by these authorities and also offer our own rationale for our holding.
indisputably,florida public policy manifests a strong intent to protect children from harm.as parens patriae,the state authority is broader than that of a parent and may be invoked to limit parental authority when necessary to protect children.global travel,shea,so d.the expression of that policy most relevant here is the legislative limitation on parental authority to settle claims contained in section,florida statutes.by requiring judicial approval of settlements over,the legislature has manifested a policy of protecting children from parental imprudence in the compromise of their claims for injury.because parents legal duty to support their children ends at or near the age of majority,the potential societal burden of an imprudent settlement justifies judicial oversight of the settlement contract.
the case of a exculpatory clause may be distinguished from a settlement in one respect.in a situation,there is no risk that financial pressure will induce parental imprudence.instead,the parents motivation is the potential benefit to the child derived from the child participation in the activity.theoretically,the prudent parent can weigh this benefit against the potential consequence of a negligently caused injury and determine whether it is in the child best interest to execute an exculpatory clause and permit the activity.motivations aside,however,the consequence of an imprudent decision is the same as in the context a child will suffer injury for which society might ultimately bear the burden.thus,the parents interest is not necessarily consonant with those of society and the child.
although this potential societal cost is arguably a justification to invalidate all exculpatory clauses,we discern significant reasons for a distinction when a child is the subject.a consenting adult has the ability to avoid potential injury by exercising personal caution and mitigate the impact of future economic loss by purchasing disability and health insurance policies.conversely,children tend to throw caution to the wind during risky activities,resulting in a decreased chance of avoiding injury caused by the negligence of others.more importantly,children have no ability to indemnify themselves for future economic losses like their adult counterparts,making them especially vulnerable after the parents support obligation ends.as parens patriae,the state also has an interest in protecting children from the consequences of injury.a policy that enforces exculpatory clauses fosters an increased risk of injury through carelessness.for these reasons,although the scales of public policy might tip in favor of the enforcement of exculpatory contracts involving consenting adults,we think they tip the other way when children are the subject.
we emphasize that our holding is limited to commercial enterprises.they can insure against the risk of loss and include these costs in the price of participation.
applegate,so d at footnote and citation omitted.
i fully concur with the majority conclusion that the release signed by the father on behalf of his son,executed in order to gain entry to the facility and be allowed to participate in riding the atv in the thunder cross motor sports park,is invalid.the owners and operators of the sports park,the kirtons,raised the execution of this release as a complete defense to the wrongful death action brought on behalf of the estate.
i write to emphasize several points.first,as pointed out by the fourth district,t here is no basis in common law for a parent to enter into a compromise or settlement of a child claim,or to waive substantive rights of the child without court approval.fields,so d at.
second,the release in this case was,as it covered not just injuries occurring as a result of the activity of atv riding,which itself could be considered inherently dangerous,but all negligent acts.the allegations of the complaint in this case,which we must accept as true,asserted in pertinent part that the atv christopher jones was racing and jumping on the course set up and maintained by defendants was recommended only for use by those over the age of by the manufacturer.significantly,the allegations also asserted that the subject four wheel all terrain vehicle was not designed by the manufacturer or recommended for racing or jumping on a course such as the course constructed and maintained by defendants defendants agents and employees.
moreover,the amended complaint alleged that the kirtons had prior knowledge of christopher jones limited experience based on a serious injury he sustained on the same course with the same atv approximately one month before 
defendants their agents and employees knew or should have known that a fourteen year old with limited experience as a rider,such as christopher jones,should not have been permitted to operate the subject cc four wheel all terrain vehicle in the manner it was being operated by him on the course constructed and maintained by thunder cross motor sports park on may.this is particularly the case given the fact that the last time christopher jones operated the subject cc four wheel all terrain vehicle he operated it in the same manner and missed the jump while riding on the identical course constructed and maintained by thunder cross motor sports park on april.on that date he was seriously injured such that he was removed from the defendant property by fire rescue personnel and was transported to the hospital for treatment.
the amended complaint further alleged that the negligent design of the course and the failure to have a flag man to alert riders to the dangers of the course and to prevent the fatal injuries directly caused or substantially contributed to the death of christopher jones.as explained in the amended complaint 
on may,while attempting to jump on defendants course which was negligently constructed maintained by defendants through their agents and their employees,christopher jones missed the jump so that he came up short and did not clear the jump.the front tires of the four wheel all terrain vehicle he was operating hit the ground first and christopher jones bounced over the handlebars,flipped off the to the right and the went to the left and then came back directly at him.
although there was supposed to be a flag man stationed at the jump to alert riders of dangers on the course and to assist in rendering assistance to injured riders such as christopher jones,there was no flag man stationed at the jump that christopher jones was attempting to navigate when the accident occurred on may.because the came back at christopher jones after he was thrown off the vehicle,had a flag man been close enough to the jump,he would have been able to remove christopher jones from harm way before the vehicle hit and killed him.
in distinguishing between risks inherent in the activity and separate acts of negligence,the fourth district explained 
the decision to absolve the provider of an activity from liability for any form of negligence regardless
