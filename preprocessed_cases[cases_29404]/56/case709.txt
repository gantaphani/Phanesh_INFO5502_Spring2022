a jury awarded plaintiff jacob against defendants county of shasta the county and stephanie lloyd for invasion of his state constitutional right to privacy.the invasion consisted of a letter written by lloyd,a supervisor in the county victim witness program,referring to a child molestation accusation against jacob,which was published in a family law proceeding that concerned visitation rights among jacob,his parents,and members of their extended family.
on a motion for nonsuit,the trial court found that the letter was cloaked with the litigation privilege immunity found in civil code section,subdivision b hereafter section b,and dismissed all causes of action except for invasion of jacob constitutional right to privacy.defendants appeal,claiming the trial court should have dismissed the entire case.
we conclude that the letter was absolutely privileged,and that the motion for nonsuit should have been granted.we shall reverse the judgment.
factual background 
a motion for nonsuit is proper when,interpreting the evidence most favorably to plaintiff case and most strongly against the defendant and resolving all presumptions,inferences and doubts in favor of the plaintiff,a judgment for the defendant is required as a matter of law.citations.dipalma seldman th,d,citing carson facilities development cal d.we summarize the evidence in light of that principle,which is applicable to both reviewing courts and trial courts.dipalma,at,d.
the molestation claim 
in,laura and charles came into the shasta county sheriff office to report that their son had been molested by his uncle younger brother who was years old at the time.the investigating officer interviewed and was of the opinion that a molestation had occurred,but the case was not prosecuted due to his young age and inability to communicate specifics about what had occurred.
the county operates a victim witness program victim witness,which is a subdivision of the district attorney office.on september,laura applied for victim witness benefits on behalf.victim witness is authorized by law to grant compensation to a victim of any criminal act,regardless of whether there was a prosecution or conviction.see,subd.a.to determine whether benefits are payable,victim witness decides,using a preponderance of the evidence standard and based on medical and police reports and other documentation,whether a crime occurred.in this case,victim witness approved laura claim,and as a result,received in counseling services.
in,victim witness transferred raw data from its cases into a statewide vox computer database system,while maintaining index cards to track and identify individual claims.on the vox system,was identified as the victim of a molestation and his uncle jacob as the perpetrator.although date of birth was listed,at that time there was no space in the system to enter a birth date for the perpetrator.
family historical events 
todd and stephanie were married from to and had three biological sons together,and hereafter todd sons.in,todd divorced stephanie,while charles divorced laura.each then married the other spouse.as a result,charles and stephanie lived together with todd sons,while charles biological son with laura lived with todd and laura.at this time,all of the children are still minors.
when charles and laura were divorced in,the couple stipulated,after mediation,that would have no contact with either his uncle jacob or his paternal grandparents and likewise,stephanie and todd dissolution decree also forbade contact between todd sons and jacob,and 
stephanie and charles grew unhappy with the court order forbidding contact between todd sons and charles brother jacob or his parents.consequently,there was an ongoing dispute in stephanie and todd family law proceeding as to whether todd sons should be able to visit jacob,and 
on february,stephanie now married to father,charles filed an order to show cause osc in tehama county superior court,asking the family law court to remove visitation restrictions between todd sons and jacob,and,due to the financial and emotional hardships these restrictions caused the stepfamilies.
the february letter 
on february,laura now todd wife came into the victim witness office,crying and distraught.she told victim witness advocate carol gall and her supervisor lloyd that there was a court hearing that day in tehama county,in which the judge would be deciding whether her son would have contact with his uncle jacob.she pleaded with them to help her by writing to the court.
gall went to her index card file and located a card for case.she then took the card to lloyd who instructed her to obtain the information on the case in the vox computer system.gall went to claims specialist brenda ness,who accessed the vox computer screen.the vox synopsis listed the crime as penal code section child molest,recited that jacob had molested his nephew,and that had been paid in victim witness benefits.vox also indicated criminal proceedings were closed due to insufficient evidence.
after receiving the information,lloyd had gall compose a letter for lloyd signature.that letter,dated february,on the stationary of the shasta county district attorney the february letter,is the focal point of this litigation.in it,lloyd states that in november,laura established a claim with victim witness that her son was a victim of molestation by his uncle jacob,that the case was investigated by the shasta county sheriff department,and that family had used all in victim witness benefits for counseling due to the crime.
lloyd assumed jacob was an adult at the time of the molestation because he was referred to as uncle and the information she had did not indicate he was a minor.both she and gall understood that the letter would be presented to a judge in family law court in tehama county.lloyd used the salutation to whom it may concern because she did not know the judge name and thought using dear judge or your honor would sound awkward.
as it turned out,the tehama county court proceeding involved removal of visitation restrictions between jacob,and and todd sons.visitation between jacob and was not an issue before the court.however,laura felt that if the order were dropped as to todd sons,removal of jacob prohibition on visiting would inexorably follow.this was especially true because charles had previously sought to lift the restrictions on contact between jacob and and because todd sons and his stepson usually traveled together as a unit for family visitation purposes.
laura gave the letter to her husband todd,who attached it to his declaration in opposition to stephanie request to modify visitation,and filed it in tehama county superior court.when stephanie saw the letter,she gave it to jacob,who filed this lawsuit on july.
procedural history 
jacob filed a complaint against the county and lloyd for libel and negligent infliction of emotional distress based on the february letter and a second letter that was sent to jacob attorney in response to his demand for a retraction in addition,the complaint alleged an invasion of privacy based on the february letter.
a jury was impaneled and the above evidence was presented.at the conclusion of jacob case,defendants the county and lloyd made a motion for nonsuit,based on the litigation privilege.the trial court ruled that the litigation privilege attached to the february letter,and thus defendants were entitled to dismissal of jacob causes of action for defamation,negligence,and common law invasion of privacy.however,relying on jeffrey imai,tadlock keeney th,d jeffrey,the court determined that jacob state constitutional privacy interests overrode the litigation privilege,and denied the nonsuit as to jacob invasion of privacy cause of action based on article i,section of the california constitution.
the case proceeded to its conclusion,resulting in a jury verdict of against the county and lloyd.judgment was entered accordingly.
discussion 
i.the parties contentions 
each party has set its own agenda for appellate review of the propriety of the trial court ruling on defendants motion for nonsuit defendants appeal is based on the straightforward assertion that the trial court followed the wrong line of authority in ruling that the constitutional right to privacy trumped the litigation privilege.jacob counters that the trial court erred in its foundational finding that the privilege of section b applied at all,because defendants violated the law when they engaged in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential juvenile criminal records,and the county and lloyd were neither litigants nor participants in the visitation dispute regarding jacob and todd sons 
in the event we disagree with his primary thesis,jacob concedes that it is unsettled whether a claim for constitutional invasion of privacy survives section b,but urges us to uphold the trial court ruling,based on the reasoning of jeffrey,supra,th,d.
we conclude the trial court was correct that the privilege applied but incorrect in its view that a privacy claim invoking the state constitution could trump it.moreover,even if a privacy cause of action could survive the privilege,defendants could not be liable for that tort based on the evidence presented at trial.
ii.did the litigation privilege apply to the february letter 
section b provides in relevant part a privileged publication or broadcast is one made i n any judicial proceeding.t he privilege applies to any communication made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and that have some connection or logical relation to the action.silberg anderson cal d,silberg accord see rusheen cohen cal th,d,cal.lexis,rusheen.the privilege is absolute,which means it applies regardless of the existence of malice or intent to harm.abraham lancaster community hospital d.although originally enacted with reference to defamation citation,the privilege is now held applicable to any communication,whether or not it amounts to a publication citations,and all torts except malicious prosecution.citations.further,it applies to any publication required or permitted by law in the course of a judicial proceeding to achieve the objects of the litigation silberg,supra,cal d at.finally,c ase law is clear that section b absolutely protects litigants and other participants from being sued on the basis of communications they make in the context of family law proceedings.wise thrifty payless,th,d wise.
applying these principles to the facts here,it is clear to us that the february letter was protected by the litigation privilege.the letter constituted a communication.it was made in the context of a judicial proceeding,a pending case in tehama county.lloyd,who was the custodian of information relevant to the action,was a.finally,the letter furthered the objects of the litigation,since the information it conveyed had relevance to a family law visitation dispute.
jacob maintains that the trial court incorrectly ruled that privilege applied,because lloyd broke confidentiality laws meant to protect a juvenile right to privacy by releasing information about the incident without a prior court order consequently,he argues,lloyd disclosure was not authorized by law,and an essential element of the privilege is gone.he relies on cases such as susan israels th,d susan,kimmel goland cal d,kimmel and mansell otto th,d mansell.
those cases are distinguishable however,because in each,tort liability was based on noncommunicative acts that invaded the plaintiff privacy,not publications or broadcasts in a judicial proceeding.in susan,a defense attorney was inadvertently given the plaintiff confidential psychiatric records after reading them,he transmitted them to a psychiatric expert.the court stated that susan cause of action for invasion of her constitutional right of privacy does not depend on the publication or broadcast of her mental health records but rests on israels s conduct in reading those records.susan,supra,th at,d.the privacy invasion recognized in susan was not the dissemination of confidential medical records in the civil suit,but the noncommunicative act of reading them and transmitting them to a third party.
in kimmel,supra,cal d,the plaintiffs sued the defendants for unlawfully confidential conversations between the parties in violation of an eavesdropping statute.defendants argued they were immune from liability under the litigation privilege because they made the recordings in order to gather evidence to be used in litigation.the supreme court rejected that claim,ruling that the litigation privilege precludes recovery for tortiously inflicted injury resulting from publications or broadcasts made during the course of judicial and proceedings,but does not bar recovery for injuries from tortious conduct regardless of the purpose for which such conduct is undertaken.id.at.thus,plaintiff was permitted to go forward with her privacy claim based on the noncommunicative acts of making illegal recordings.
mansell facts parallel those of susan in that plaintiff,a crime victim,brought an invasion of privacy suit against the alleged perpetrator and his criminal defense attorneys for the unauthorized reading and disseminating of her mental health records.mansell,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal for the second appellate district,division seven,reiterated its holding in susan,supra,th,d,that noncommunicative conduct is not protected by the litigation privilege,regardless of whether the defendant harbors a purpose.mansell,at,d.even then,the court affirmed a dismissal of the case because the defendants received the records through the court normal discovery process.id.at,d.
ribas clark cal d,ribas sheds far more light on the resolution of this case than the triad of cases relied on by jacob.there,the attorney for the plaintiff wife eavesdropped on a telephone conversation between the wife and the plaintiff.the attorney then revealed the contents of the overheard conversation in an arbitration proceeding.plaintiff sued the attorney alleging,inter alia,violation of california invasion of privacy act,et and common law invasion of privacy.our supreme court held that while the defendant could be held statutorily liable for listening in on the conversation plaintiff could not state a cause of action for the common law privacy tort,noting that the claimed injury stems solely from defendant testimony at the arbitration proceeding.ribas,supra,at.
here,the gravamen of jacob invasion of privacy claim was not lloyd noncommunicative conduct in accessing data through the vox system and disclosing it to the victim mother.the alleged injury stems from the publication of the information in a judicial proceeding,thereby exposing it to public view.
just as ribas held that the plaintiff privacy act claim could not defeat the litigation privilege when based on testimony given in a proceeding,jacob privacy claim,which is based on publication of a letter in a judicial proceeding must also yield to the privilege.ribas,supra,cal d at.
jacob next claims the privilege was inapplicable because neither the county nor lloyd was a participant in any litigation.he relies on this court decision in wise,supra,th,d.there,a payless pharmacy that made an unauthorized disclosure of private medical information regarding the plaintiff to her husband in the middle of an acrimonious divorce proceeding claimed that the litigation privilege immunized it from liability for invasion of privacy because the husband subsequently published the information in judicial and proceedings.id.at,d.we noted that payless disclosure of the information to the husband for tax purposes did not satisfy any of the elements necessary for application of the privilege id.at,d,and refused to create an extension of the privilege that would allow litigants to escape from the consequences of their tortious conduct under the blanket of privilege belonging to a third party id.at,d.however,we were careful to point out that h ad payless provided the information to a litigant or attorney in order to further the object of litigation this case would stand in a far different posture,for there the paramount goal of encouraging freedom of access to the courts would be implicated.id.at,d.
our case resembles the hypothetical we contemplated in wise.t
