factual and procedural history 
and and their half sister.hereafter,and ke,were the subjects of a prior dependency proceeding which was initiated in august and terminated in december with the four children being returned to the mother custody the petition,which was filed before was born,alleged that the mother residence was filthy that the mother left the children with an unrelated caretaker for an extended period without providing adequately for their care and support,thus placing the children at risk of serious physical harm that the children were extremely dirty and that their health needs were not being provided for that the mother and the father of ka.and kr.had a history of criminal behavior and that the fathers were not providing support.the father of ka.and kr,the appellant father in this appeal was in prison on drug charges,and the whereabouts of ke.father were unknown.when was born in february,a petition was filed as to him,but he remained in the physical custody of the mother.the mother successfully reunited with the children,and the petition was dismissed in december.
the father was released from prison on parole during the pendency of the prior proceeding,but because of a prior conviction for lewd and lascivious acts on a child under the age of,subd.a,his parole conditions forbade contact with minors under a specified age including his own children,and forbade him to live with any minor years or younger.
the current petition was filed on march.it alleged that the father,who was living with the family in violation of the conditions of his parole had molested,then years old,and that the mother knew or reasonably should have known that the children were at risk of sexual abuse.the petition alleged that the children were filthy and infested with head lice,that the parents engaged in acts of domestic violence,and that the mother had previously been provided with reunification and family maintenance services but had failed to benefit from those services.the allegations of the petition were found true.the children were placed in foster care.services were ordered for the mother,but not for the father.ultimately,parental rights were terminated and the children were freed for adoption by their foster parents 
during the prior dependency proceeding,the father informed the department of public social services dpss that he might have indian ancestry.no action was taken to notify the appropriate tribal authorities pursuant to icwa before that case was dismissed.when the current petition was filed,the father information was ignored,and no inquiry was made of either parent as to possible indian ancestry.the father also failed to inform the court that icwa might apply.the father asserted for the first time in his appeal from the original termination order in the current proceeding that the court had failed to comply with the notice provisions of icwa.in re k,supra,at.we affirmed the juvenile court finding that the children are adoptable,but reversed the termination order and remanded the cause for the limited purpose of providing the mandatory notice to the appropriate tribal authorities.we ordered that if,after proper notice,a tribe claims the minors as indian children,the juvenile court shall proceed in conformity with all provisions of icwa.id.at.
following remand,notice was given,and on may,the choctaw nation of oklahoma determined that the children had choctaw heritage and that they were indian children within the meaning of icwa the father was recognized as a member of the tribe on june.on august,the juvenile court found that icwa applied.the tribe intervened but did not assert jurisdiction.it chose instead to review all filings in the case,to work directly with the social worker and to make recommendations.several months later,after having received the reports filed by dpss,the tribe stated that it was in agreement with termination of parental rights and the plan for adoption.it originally asked that all family members be considered as adoptive parents,but ultimately agreed to the plan for adoption by the children current caretakers.
on june,at the scheduled hearing on termination of parental rights,the parents asked the court to vacate all prior orders as having been rendered in violation of icwa.the court conducted a hearing and determined that the substantive requirements of icwa had been met and that the earlier failure to give notice as required by icwa was not prejudicial.the court then conducted a hearing pursuant to section.it terminated parental rights and adopted a permanent plan of adoption by the children current caretakers.the parents appealed.
legal analysis 
failure to comply with icwa does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to enter disposition orders 
both icwa and the welfare and institutions code provide that any party seeking an involuntary foster care placement of an indian child must satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.d welf,subd.a see also cal.rules of court,rule c.both state and federal law provide that any parent from whose custody an indian child was removed may petition the court to invalidate an order for foster care or termination of parental rights if the order violated any provision of specified sections of icwa,including title united states code section.welf,subd.e.
at the scheduled hearing on june,the parents asked the court to vacate all of its prior orders pursuant to title united states code section for lack of compliance with icwa.the parents contended that because the court had not previously found that active efforts had been made to prevent the breakup of the family before placing the children in foster care,as required by title united states code section d,the court lacked jurisdiction to proceed to a hearing on termination of parental rights.the parents also contended that the court lacked jurisdiction to place the children in foster care because the disposition order was not supported by testimony by an expert on indian tribal matters.
after hearing argument and reviewing the file and this court opinion in in re th,d,the court concluded that there was no reasonable probability that if the substantive provisions of icwa had been applied,either parent would have received more favorable results.for that reason,the court declined to vacate the past orders and proceeded to hold the section hearing.
the parents now contend,as they did below,that the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to enter disposition orders placing the children in foster care because the court failed to comply with icwa notice provisions.
we agree with the line of cases which hold that failure to comply with icwa notice provisions does not divest courts of jurisdiction to remove an indian child from the custody of the parents.see,in re antoinette th,d nicole superior court th,d but see in re desiree th,d in re samuel th,d.accordingly,we reject the parents contention.
dpss contends that the juvenile court lacked the authority to entertain the request to invalidate the disposition order in any event,because in the prior appeal,we reversed only the order terminating parental rights.when a judgment is reversed with directions,the trial court jurisdiction is limited by those directions.in re th,d.dpss is correct that our opinion reversed only the final order for purposes of compliance with icwa notice provisions.however,we also directed that if the children were found to be indian children,the trial court must proceed in conformity with all provisions of icwa.in re k,supra,at.as noted above,icwa permits the parents to petition the juvenile court to invalidate prior orders.welf,subd.e.consequently,despite the fact that we reversed only the termination order,the juvenile court was required to consider the parents contention that the disposition order placing the children in foster care should be invalidated.
active efforts to prevent breakup of the family were not required before the disposition hearing 
in a dependency proceeding which does not involve an indian child,the court must make a determination as to whether reasonable efforts were made to prevent or to eliminate the need for removal of the minor from his or her home or,if the minor is removed for one of the reasons stated in paragraph of subdivision c,whether it was reasonable under the circumstances not to make any of those efforts,subd.d.in a case involving an indian child,however,the court must determine whether active efforts as required in section were made and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.ibid.welfare and institutions code section,which in part adopts the provisions of title united states code section d and e,provides,in part,that a party seeking an involuntary foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights over,an indian child shall provide evidence to the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful,subd.a.
at the disposition hearing,which was held before the court was on notice that icwa might apply,the court found that reasonable efforts had been made to prevent or to eliminate the need for removal of the children from their home.the parents contend that a finding of reasonable efforts is a lower standard than the finding of active efforts required by icwa and by section,subdivision a.accordingly,they contend,even if the original failure to provide notice pursuant to icwa was not jurisdictional,it was nevertheless prejudicial error because,if notice had been given in a timely manner,the children would have been found to be indian children before the disposition hearing,and the court would have been required to provide remedial services before ordering the children placed in foster care.the parents assert,based on in re,supra,th,d,that we must find the notice error prejudicial unless we determine that there is no reason to suppose that if the juvenile court had been asked to find whether active efforts were made before it issued the disposition order placing the children in foster care,rather than reasonable efforts,it would have made a different finding.
we disagree that the standard enunciated in in re,supra,th,d is the correct standard of review in this case.unlike the court in in re,the juvenile court in this case,in ruling on the motion to invalidate the prior orders,found that active efforts were made prior to the disposition hearing.consequently,if we were to review this finding,we would do so by applying the substantial evidence rule.see,in re michael th,d.we need not engage in a substantial evidence review,however as we discuss below,we can determine,as a matter of law,that even if the court had been on notice that icwa might apply,it was not required to find that active efforts were made before placing the children in foster care.
the parents also contend that because no services were offered to the father before the disposition hearing,the court could not find that active efforts within the meaning of icwa had been made to prevent the breakup of the family.services were denied to the father based on welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,which provides that a court may deny services to a parent who has been convicted of a violent felony,as set forth in penal code section,subdivision c however,as the parents point out,welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a applies notwithstanding welfare and institutions code section.for that reason,they contend that in a case governed by icwa,the court must under all circumstances make active efforts to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs before issuing an order placing the child in foster care.we disagree.
in letitia superior court th,d letitia,the court held that icwa does not require a juvenile court to offer reunification services to a parent who failed,in prior dependency proceedings,to reunify with her children,despite active efforts having been made to assist her in overcoming her drug dependency.the court held that offering services as to a later born child,after previous reunification efforts had failed,would be an idle act not required by icwa.letitia,at,d.the court explained that the phrase active efforts means only that timely and affirmative steps be taken to accomplish the goal which congress has set to avoid the breakup of indian families whenever possible by providing services designed to remedy problems which might lead to severance of the relationship.id.at,d,italics added.thus,the court reasoned,where the parent history indicates the futility of offering services,no further services must be offered.id.at,d.
here,in contrast to letitia,supra,th,d,the father had not previously been offered services.nevertheless,his history clearly demonstrates the futility of offering reunification services he is a registered sex offender with a prior conviction for lewd and lascivious acts on a child under the age of,subd.a.in the current proceeding,the court sustained the allegations that he sexually molested,the children half sister.the parents do not suggest any services which might have been offered to the father under the circumstances and we can not conceive of any services which could usefully be offered to a registered sex offender with a prior conviction for molesting a child and a current finding of molesting a different child.for these reasons,requiring the court to provide services to the father would be at best an idle act which would not further the legislative purposes of icwa see letitia,at,d.
there was also no need to make active efforts to offer remedial services to the mother before placing the children in foster care.the mother knew that the father was a registered sex offender.during the prior dependency,she was told by the social workers,the court and her therapist that he should not be around the children.nevertheless,as soon as that case was closed,she allowed him to reside with the family,thus facilitating the molestation of her oldest daughter.despite her knowledge of the father history,she denied that the abuse took place.she also counseled her daughter just to forget about the abuse or to get over it and move on,thus demonstrating her unwillingness to protect her children from the father abuse.the mother unwillingness or inability to recognize the danger posed by the father to her children and her resulting inability to protect them is sufficient to justify the court order.placing the children in foster care at the disposition stage did not conflict with the objectives of icwa.icwa was intended to protect the rights of the indian child as an indian and the rights of the indian community and tribe in retaining its children in its society.citation.mississippi band of choctaw indians holyfield,d.it was not intended as a shield to permit abusive treatment of indian children by their parents.matter of,see also people in interest of.under these circumstances,no reasonable court would have ordered the children placed with either parent,rather than in foster care,while the parents were given services which might prevent further sexual abuse.indeed,we can not imagine a more egregious abuse of discretion than leaving these children vulnerable to such abuse.the court disposition order for further services to the mother amply furthered the goals of icwa 
the court correctly found that the active efforts requirement of section was satisfied.
section,subdivision a provides that the court must make active efforts to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the indian family.section,subdivision c b provides that parental rights to an indian child shall not be terminated if the court finds that active efforts,as required by section,have not been made,or if the court does not make a determination,supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,including testimony of one or more qualified expert witnesses as defined in section,that the continued custody of the child by the parent is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child,subd.c b i,ii.section,subdivision b states what constitutes active efforts shall be assessed on a basis.the active efforts shall be made in a manner that takes into account the prevailing social and cultural values,conditions,and way of life of the indian child tribe.active efforts shall utilize the available resources of the indian child extended family,tribe,tribal and other indian social service agencies,and individual indian caregiver service providers.
at the section hearing,the court found that active efforts had been made.the court also found,based on the testimony of the expert witness,philip powers,that because the choctaw nation protocol was to rely on the local jurisdiction to provide services,the services provided in this case would not have differed if the tribe had been involved at an earlier stage of the proceedings.
we first address the parents contention that the court active efforts finding can not be upheld because the services provided to the mother before our reversal of the prior termination order did not amount to active efforts within the meaning of section.
whether active efforts were made is a mixed question of law and fact.state div.of family and youth services alaska.we can determine what services were provided by reference to the record.whether those services constituted active efforts within the meaning of section is a question of law which we decide independently.crocker national bank city and county of san francisco cal d.
neither icwa nor its california counterpart defines active efforts.d welf.thus,while it is clear that icwa requires that timely and affirmative steps be taken to accomplish the goal of avoiding the breakup of indian families whenever possible letitia,supra,th at,d,no pat formula exists for distinguishing between active and passive efforts state alaska.however,the following is a useful guideline passive efforts are where a plan is drawn up and the client must develop his or her own resources towards bringing it to fruition.active efforts is where the state caseworker takes the client through the steps of the plan rather than requiring that the plan be performed on its own.for instance,rather than requiring that a client find a job,acquire new housing,and terminate a relationship with what is perceived to be a boyfriend who is a bad influence,the indian child welfare act would require that the caseworker help the client develop job and parenting skills necessary to retain custody of her child,fn.omitted.
here,in the prior dependency,dpss provided numerous services to the mother.she was referred to a substance abuse program and to counseling.she completed both.she was referred to a parenting class,which she completed.dpss also provided her with homemaking assistance and assistance in finding housing,including providing her with resources to find shelter housing and to find available permanent housing and providing monetary assistance with rent.it provided her with bus passes to assist her in attending the programs and to facilitate visitation with her children.in the current dependency,dpss also referred her to parents united,a program designed to educate parents on issues of sexual abuse and to help them learn to protect their children from sexual abuse.the mother told dpss that she had learned a great deal from that program.it is abundantly clear that dpss did more than merely draw up a reunification plan and leave the mother to use her own resources to bring it to fruition.see state alaska,state,supra,at.on the contrary,dpss provided the mother with the resources necessary to achieve the goals of her case plan.this constitutes active efforts within the meaning of icwa 
as to the father,active efforts were not required for the same reason they were not required prior to the disposition order placing the children in foster care there were no services which could be offered to him which would have prevented the breakup of the family,which was due to his sexual abuse of,along with the mother inability to protect the other children from similar abuse.
the parents also contend that the termination order can not be sustained because no services were provided after the remand.neither cites any authority which supports their contention.icwa requires that an order terminating parental rights be supported by a finding that active efforts were made but were unsuccessful.welf,subd.b,subd.c b i,ii d.here,the court complied with that directive by finding that active efforts were made over a period of several years,both during the prior dependency and during the current dependency proceeding.there is no requirement that additional efforts be made after the children were belatedly determined to be indian children.
the parents also argue that the termination order can not be sustained because dpss failed to comply with the requirement that the active efforts be made in a manner that takes into account the prevailing social and cultural values,conditions,and way of life of the indian child tribe.active efforts shall utilize the available resources of the indian child extended family,tribe,tribal and other indian social service agencies,and individual indian caregiver service providers,subd.b.active efforts required by icwa are timely and affirmative steps to remedy problems which might lead to severance of the relationship.letitia,supra,th at,d.the parents do not suggest how any services related to the cultural values,of the tribe would have been of any use in remedying the problem which ultimately led to the breakup of this family see,subd.b,the father sexual abuse of the children half sister and the mother failure or refusal to accept that the abuse occurred,thus preventing her from protecting the children from similar abuse.in the absence of any showing that there were services or resources which might be useful in remedying the problem underlying the dependency,the parents have failed to meet their burden on appeal of demonstrating prejudicial error.state farm fire casualty pietak th,d.
active efforts were made to find appropriate family members with whom to place the children 
icwa provides that in an adoptive placement of an indian child,in the absence of good cause to the contrary,preference shall be given to a placement with a member of the child extended family,other members of the child tribe,or other indian families.a welf,subd.c.
the parents contend that dpss made insufficient efforts to place the children with extended family members.they couch their arguments in terms of the court duty to find that active efforts were made to assess maternal relatives and contend that such efforts were not made.sections and do not require a finding that active efforts were made to find an appropriate placement within the statutory framework,however.rather,when a court has not ordered an indian child placed in a preferred placement,the question is whether good cause existed to deviate from the statutory preferences.fresno county of children family services superior court th,d.because the parents have not challenged the current placement on that basis,we need not determine whether good cause did or did not exist.rather,we will address the parents arguments as made.we conclude that active efforts to assess extended family members were made.
