the trial court sustained a juvenile wardship petition welf,after finding true the allegation that defendant and appellant minor assaulted a victim with a deadly weapon,subd.a the court deemed the offense a misdemeanor and ordered minor to be placed at his parent home,subject to certain probation terms.
on appeal,minor argues insufficient evidence supports the allegation that he used a deadly weapon.he therefore asks us to reduce the allegation the court found true to one for simple assault.because we disagree with minor about the sufficiency of the evidence,we affirm the adjudication order.
factual and procedural background 
minor and the victim had been friends before the incident at issue on this appeal.minor was years old at the time of disposition.the victim was in eighth grade at the time of the incident and was years old when she testified on april.at one point in time,minor had been allowed to visit the victim house,but the victim mother said he was no longer welcome there because he had failed to listen to her rules.although minor and the victim used to play and joke with each other,they did not rough play.the victim had on occasion smacked or pushed minor in a joking manner,but she had not done so on the day of the incident that is the basis of this appeal.
on that day,the victim was trying to avoid minor and did not want to talk to him.he approached her anyway.when minor pulled at the hood on the victim sweater,she tried to pull away and told him to leave her alone.instead of complying,minor retrieved a pocketknife from his pocket and,while still holding onto the victim clothing,opened it so she could see the blade.
minor said,you wo be scared of this.the victim responded,if my mom was here,you would have said that.she was scared she would get hurt when she saw the knife and heard what minor said.minor made no verbal response to the victim statement that things would be different if her mother were present,but he poked her multiple times in the upper back with the exposed blade of the knife.the knife felt sharp and pointy,and the victim felt some pain.she did not think minor would hurt her,or that he was trying to cut or kill her.however,the victim was scared that an injury might occur because minor had a knife pressed to her back.minor appeared to be trying to bother the victim,and he seemed mad.
at this point,a teacher approached,and minor stopped hitting her with the knife and went into class.the victim told both a teacher and a police officer about the incident.when speaking to the police officer,the victim was visibly upset.on more than one occasion,she told the officer she was scared that minor might hurt her.the police officer noticed a red mark but no broken skin where the victim said she felt the most pain.
the police officer escorted minor to the assistant principal office,where minor produced the knife.using a ruler,the police officer determined that the sharpened portion of the knife was more than two and inches long.the blade was sharp,and the tip of the knife was pointed.the police officer testified that she had seen knives of the same shape and sharpness cause both wounds that bled profusely and wounds that cause people to die.she based these observations on her more than eight years experience as a police officer.
after receiving miranda warnings,minor spoke to the police officer about the incident.he explained that he had accidentally left his father knife in his backpack after using it to open a package of headphones.minor initially denied having pulled out a knife in his interaction with the victim.after the police officer reminded him that it was important to tell the truth,minor stated that he and the victim had been playing earlier in the day.more specifically,he said that the victim had hit him in the forehead.minor said he would get her back.the victim then indicated minor would have to catch her first.even after admitting that he had shown the knife to the victim,minor at first denied poking her with it.eventually,he told the police officer he may have accidentally poked her,but he could not recall how many times.minor acknowledged that the victim told him to stop and was continually try ing to get away from him.according to minor statements to the police officer,the incident ended when the victim pulled away and was able to run from him.minor expressed remorse and said he could have hurt the victim.he also said that he and the victim had been just playing,and that he did not intend to harm her.
shortly before she testified at the jurisdictional hearing,the victim spoke to the police officer again.she seemed upset and nervous about testifying.the victim told the police officer she did want to tell on minor.
after the close of evidence at the jurisdictional hearing,the court found that the knife in question was being used as a deadly weapon.it stated the knife blade was open.it was poked numerous times to the back of the victim in this case to the extent that it could have resulted in great bodily injury if more force were to be applied with the use of that knife.
minor sole contention on appeal is that the evidence does not support a finding that he used a deadly weapon when he assaulted the victim.more specifically,he contends the knife was not likely to cause death or great bodily injury because he only used it to poke the victim in the back.minor also argues he did not intend to use the knife as a deadly weapon because he and the victim were only playing.finally,minor asserts the limited nature of the victim injury demonstrates that the knife was not likely to cause death or great bodily injury.we reject each of these contentions in turn.
in reviewing minor claim that proof of an essential element was lacking,we must determine whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.people davis cal th.in the course of this inquiry,we presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.ibid.
