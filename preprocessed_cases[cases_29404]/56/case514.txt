after the minor alleged unsatisfactory performance of the conditions of his probation arising from his plea bargain on a sustained petition,the juvenile court,pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,dismissed the minor sustained petition in order to make him eligible for commitment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation,division of juvenile facilities djf under the revised terms of section,subdivision c section c.section c limits the commitment of a minor to djf to cases where the minor has been,or is adjudged to be,a ward of the juvenile court pursuant to section and the minor most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is an offense listed in section,subdivision b,or a sex offense listed in penal code section,subdivision c 
here,the juvenile court dismissed most recently sustained petition,a penal code section offense,which does not qualify for a djf commitment,to cause an earlier sustained petition,a penal code section,subdivision b offense,which does qualify for a djf commitment,to be the most recent offense for purposes of section c.based on the facts of this case,we conclude the court abused its discretion under section when it dismissed the petition.thus,we need not reach the other issues raised by the parties.
we shall issue a writ of mandate requiring the respondent juvenile court to vacate its order of may,dismissing the petition filed on november,dismiss the may,notice of violation of probation and reinstate the february,notice of violation of probation.
factual and procedural background 
in,a petition was filed alleging came within the provisions of section based on his commission of a lewd and lascivious act upon a child under the age of in violation of penal code section,subdivision a.admitted felony oral copulation of a minor in violation of penal code section,subdivision b,as a reasonably related offense the petition.the juvenile court declared a ward of the court and placed him in the youth center.
a petition to modify and change placement was granted in and was committed to the care of the probation officer for suitable level a placement.special conditions of probation were imposed,including that participate in a sexual offender treatment program.
on september,the legislature amended former section.stats,ch.the new legislation limits eligibility for commitment to djf to minors found to have committed the criminal offenses listed in section,subdivision b and the sex offenses listed in penal code section,former subdivision d,subd.c.
in november,the district attorney filed a subsequent petition alleging committed three new criminal offenses in october a lewd and lascivious act upon the body of a child under the age of,subd.a misdemeanor indecent exposure,subd.and misdemeanor child molestation,subd.a.the juvenile court approved a negotiated plea bargain resolution under which admitted the charge of indecent exposure and the court dismissed the two remaining allegations in the interests of justice the petition.the court continued as a ward of the court and again committed him to the care of the probation officer for suitable level a placement.the special conditions of probation again required participate in a sexual offender treatment program.
in february,the district attorney filed a section notice alleging violated probation by failing to participate in a sexual offender treatment program and failing to obey the directives of the group home staff.the notice recommended the consequence of the violations be a commitment to djf.however,under the terms of section c as amended,was not eligible for such commitment the court detained in juvenile hall.
the district attorney moved to dismiss the prior petition the offense in the interests of justice pursuant to section.the district attorney argued that if the court dismissed the petition,djf commitment would be appropriate under section c because the most recent offense alleged in any petition would then be the oral copulation of a minor,penal code section,offense c.opposed the request,responding that dismissal of the petition would violate the legislature intent in amending section.he also maintained that dismissal in these circumstances would lead to absurd results and frustrate the will of the legislature because the prosecution could dismiss each petition,ad infinitum,until the most recent petition made the minor eligible for placement at djf.
the juvenile court granted the district attorney motion under section to dismiss the petition in the interests of justice and based on the lack of awareness by the court and the parties of the nuances of the newest law.in its written order,the court explained it granted the dismissal because the change in the law determining djf eligibility occurred neither the court nor the lawyers were aware that allowing to admit the violation would make him djf ineligible the court had warned he was headed to djf if his behavior did not improve the purpose of the new law was to divert nonviolent,nonserious offenders c,entire delinquent history could not be characterized as nonviolent or nonserious the juvenile court was authorized and obligated in carrying out its duties to weigh and consider both the interests of the juvenile and the interests of society and predatory offenses and abysmal adjustment to the sex offender group home suggest djf is a viable option for treatment of and the protection of society.the court orally stated that since djf commitment could not occur without the dismissal,it appears that both the interest s of justice and the welfare of the minor support a dismissal of the petition.the juvenile court emphasized that in its view all it did in dismissing the petition was give the sentencing judge some options.the court denied it was prejudging what happened on the alleged probation violations,but indicated djf appears to be an appropriate option for the sentencing court to have.the court acknowledged that the district attorney most recent notice of probation violation was based on orders that,after the dismissal,were no longer in effect and indicated w e are definitely going to have to go back and fix things,but it does mean that he not in violation of the court orders.
two days later,the district attorney moved inter alia to modify the prior orders,specifically,t hat the court adopt all prior conditions and orders from the sustained pc b offense from the petition,in addition to including the superseded conditions and modifications thus continuing all orders,conditions and modifications in full force and effect.on the same date,the district attorney filed a new section notice of hearing on the two counts of violating probation and requested that be committed to djf.the court set a hearing on the district attorney motions.
filed his petition for writ of mandate prior to such hearing.we stayed all further proceedings in the juvenile court and issued an alternative writ.
discussion 
claims are justiciable in a petition for writ of mandate 
citing code of civil procedure section,the people contend writ relief is inappropriate because has a plain,speedy and adequate remedy through the normal appellate process the people maintain that the minor may obtain immediate appellate review of his claim that the juvenile court abused its discretion under section by dismissing the supplemental petition because the order of dismissal is a subsequent order within the meaning of section 
argues principally that the remedy of ordinary appeal from the order dismissing the petition is inadequate.he asserts that writ relief is necessary to rectify the juvenile court error before he is forced to go to hearing on the pending alleged violations of probation and to contest the people recommendation of djf placement at any dispositional hearing.see maine superior court cal d,conway municipal court d.

the juvenile court abused its discretion under section in dismissing the petition 
juvenile courts have long had the authority to dismiss juvenile matters at the disposition stage of proceedings.in re d.such authority was statutorily expressed between and.ibid.when the entire juvenile court law was repealed and recodified in,without enactment of a general dismissal provision,the reviewing court in in re concluded juvenile courts nevertheless properly continued the practice of exercising discretion to dismiss juvenile matters.ibid.it noted the juvenile court is accorded great discretion in its disposition of juvenile matters.it may at any time modify or vacate a dispositional order and may entirely terminate its jurisdiction when it is satisfied that further supervision is unnecessary citations.it would be inconsistent with the liberal termination provisions and the general thrust of the juvenile court law to hold that the referee,at the time of original disposition,could not dismiss the case if he felt that court supervision would be unnecessary and perhaps harmful.id.at,fns.omitted.shortly after the decision in in re,the legislature drafted section,restoring to the juvenile law the clear power of the court to dismiss juvenile petitions in the interests of justice.derek superior court d.derek.section is a general dismissal statute for juvenile matters.ibid.
section provides,in relevant part,that a judge of the juvenile court in which a petition was filed,at any time before the minor reaches the age of years,may dismiss the petition or may set aside the findings and dismiss the petition if the court finds that the interests of justice and the welfare of the minor require such dismissal or if it finds that the minor is not in need of treatment or rehabilitation,italics added.that is,as applicable here,section authorizes dismissal when it is both in the interests of justice and the welfare of the minor require s it.
in considering the first prong of whether a dismissal is in the interest s of justice,we agree with derek,supra,d at page,that penal code section section,the dismissal statute applicable to adult criminal proceedings,is analogous and provides an appropriate analytical framework for consideration of dismissals under section.accord,in re juan th,d.as explained by derek,although certain distinctions exist between the goals and purposes of the criminal justice system on the one hand and the juvenile justice system on the other,those distinctions are not material for purposes of the resolution of this issue interpreting whether a dismissal is in the interests of justice.in connection with dismissal of adult criminal proceedings,the supreme court has determined that furtherance of justice requires consideration of both the rights of the accused and the interests of society represented by the people.people orin cal d.similarly,t he juvenile court is not only authorized,but obligated,in carrying out its duties under the juvenile court law,to weigh and consider both the interests of the juvenile and the interests of society.the clear parallel with those joint obligations in criminal court proceedings persuades us that a dismissal which is not in furtherance of justice in an adult criminal proceeding is unlikely to be in the interests of justice in juvenile court.derek,supra,d at.
we turn to consider whether the juvenile court dismissal of petition was in the interests of justice as required by section.in this inquiry we are guided by case law concerning whether a particular dismissal is in furtherance of justice under section.derek,supra,d at.in connection with such section dismissals in adult criminal proceedings,the california supreme court has stated that a trial court power to dismiss an action under section,while broad,is by no means absolute.people orin cal d.paramount is the rule that furtherance of justice,requires consideration both of the constitutional rights of the defendant,and the interests of society represented by the people,italics omitted.the same is true for section.derek,supra,at.
here the constitutional rights of include his due process right to the benefit of his plea bargain in the petition.people mancheno cal d.under the due process clause,when a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor,so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration,such promise must be fulfilled.santobello new york,d.
here the petition originally alleged had committed three criminal offenses one felony and two misdemeanors.the felony lewd and lascivious conduct in violation of penal code section,subdivision a was a djf eligible offense under the new terms of section c the record reflects the prosecutor agreed could admit only the misdemeanor indecent exposure,count,a djf ineligible offense,and his disposition would be level a placement.victor accepted such offer,waived his constitutional rights,and admitted the indecent exposure offense.the juvenile court accepted admission and dismissed the other counts in the interests of justice.although the juvenile court expressed some reservations about the placement recommendation,warning that i f there is any more of this type of miss behavior sic,certainly,if there is another victim,he would likely be sent to djf,the juvenile court committed to the care of the probation officer for suitable level a placement.was apparently placed in accordance with this order of disposition.his plea agreement was thus a fully executed agreement 
months later was alleged to have violated the terms of his probation,not by further criminal sexual misbehavior,but by failing to participate in an ordered sexual offender treatment program and follow directions of the group home staff.wanting to argue for djf placement and realizing the effect of section c,the district attorney moved for dismissal of the petition.the juvenile court found a basis for granting the dismissal in the fact that n either the court nor the lawyers were aware of the ramifications of allowing an admission to sic pc,as opposed to the other counts.
the record before us does not support the juvenile court finding that both the prosecutor and defense counsel were unaware of section c.the transcript of the hearing at which was offered,and accepted,the plea bargain does not reflect any misunderstanding of the law by counsel,who was largely silent during the proceedings.the juvenile court did not warn the minor that he was headed to djf if his behavior did improve as the juvenile court later found in its order dismissing the petition.rather the court statement to at the time of his admission that i f there is any more of this type of miss behavior sic,certainly,if there is another victim,he would likely be sent to djf,can reasonably be understood as warning that he could be subject to a djf placement if he committed any new eligible sexual offense under the terms of section c.
however,even if we accept the juvenile court apparent finding of a mutual mistake of law principles of equity preclude rescission of the plea bargain on such basis.see,american psychometric consultants workers comp.appeals bd.th,d modern doctrine emphasizes the importance of equitable factors such as detrimental change of position,hardship,the implementation of some important public policy or transactional stability in determining remedy for mistakes of law and fact.allowing a trial court to rescind a plea bargain that has been accepted and fully executed,because it was unaware of a change in the law in existence at the time of a defendant admission that if known by it and the parties would have changed the terms or acceptance of the proposed plea,would clearly introduce unacceptable instability in the practice of plea bargaining.no bargain would ever truly be secure.
we conclude the juvenile court dismissal was not in the interests of justice in light of the constitutional rights of victor to his plea bargain in this case.this conclusion is confirmed by consideration of the interests of society,which in this case have been expressed by the legislature in section c.
section c prohibits commitment to the djf in cases where t he ward has been or is adjudged a ward of the court pursuant to section,and the most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is not described in subdivision b of section,unless the offense is a sex offense set forth in subdivision c of section of the penal code.italics added.
as in any case involving statutory interpretation,our fundamental task is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.people murphy cal th,d.people cole cal th,d.statutory interpretation begins with an analysis of the statutory language.beal bank,ssb arter hadden,llp cal th,d.if the statute text evinces an unmistakable plain meaning,we need go no further.id.at,d.if the statute language is ambiguous,we examine additional sources of information to determine the legislature intent in drafting the statute.people cole,supra,cal th at,d.olson automobile club of southern cal.cal th,d.here,neither the language nor the legislative history of section c demonstrates the intent of the legislature to allow commitment of minors to djf who are not currently serious or violent offenders.
the language of section c allows commitment to djf only when the most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court italics added is an eligible offense.the statute does not focus on the overall or entire delinquent history of the minor or on whether the minor may be generally considered a serious,violent offender.the language looks to the minor most recent offense.the legislature has specifically determined it is the minor most recent offense that determines the minor eligibility for djf commitment.dismissal of the most recent petition to reach back to an earlier petition containing a djf qualifying offense would be contrary to the unmistakable plain language of section c.it would frustrate the legislative policy expressed by the language of section c.such a dismissal can not be in the interests of justice.see people hernandez d.where legislature specifically determined in penal code section that days is a reasonable time in which to bring to trial a defendant who has consented to a postponement beyond the original period,dismissal within the period is not in furtherance of justice under section.
although we need go no further than the plain meaning of the language,we reach the same conclusion when we consider the legislative history for section c.the senate floor analysis for section c explains t his bill will stop the intake of youthful offenders adjudicated for,offenses to the djf on september.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of bill reg.sess,as amended july.the assembly floor analysis of senate bill similarly states the legislation p rohibits the intake of youthful offenders adjudicated for,offenses to the djf on september.assembly floor analysis on reading of bill reg.sess.as amended july.the import of these analyses seems clear the legislature intended only currently violent or serious juvenile offenders to be sent to djf starting september.
like the court in in re th,d,we also find it helpful background to realize section c was enacted as part of chapter of the statutes of in order to make necessary statutory changes to implement the budget act of stats,ch.according to the court in in re,a report of the california little hoover commission explains the budget impact.to settle a lawsuit brought on behalf of inmates of state juvenile facilities,the state entered into a consent decree in november of.the cost of compliance with the consent decree proved to be high realizing the state could not afford to comply with the consent decree,in,acted to reduce the number of youth offenders housed in state facilities by enacting realignment legislation which shifted responsibility to the counties for all but the most serious youth offenders citation.in re,supra,at,d.
in light of the legislative history and budgetary context for section c,it would obstruct the legislature purpose for us to construe section as allowing a juvenile court to dismiss a minor most recently sustained petition for a noneligible offense so that it could have the option of committing the minor to djf for an eligible offence in an earlier petition.this would not restrict the intake of juvenile offenders to djf to those who are currently serious or violent offenders.the use of section to reach such a result can not be in the interests of justice.
since the juvenile court could not have found the dismissal of the petition in this case to be in the interests of justice,as analyzed under constitutional due process right to the benefit of his plea bargain and as analyzed under the interests of society as expressed in section c it is unnecessary to consider whether the welfare of otherwise required the dismissal.the juvenile court abused its discretion in granting dismissal under section,which mandates,as we have noted,that any dismissal be based on a finding that the interests of justice and the welfare of the minor require such dismissal.italics added.the dismissal must be vacated and the parties restored to their prior positions.
disposition 
let a peremptory writ of mandate issue commanding the respondent sacramento county superior court to enter an order in this case vacating its order of may,dismissing the section petition,dismissing the may,notice of violation of probation,and reinstating the february,notice of violation of probation.the alternative writ is discharged.the stay issued by this court shall remain in effect pending issuance of the remittitur.
this is one of those times when a court must divine what the legislature intended when it enacted a statute susceptible to two reasonable,but conflicting,interpretations.
in this case,a ward of the juvenile court was charged with sex crimes,including indecent exposure and child molestation,while he was on probation for committing a lewd and lascivious act on a child under the age of.in a plea bargain,he admitted the charge of indecent exposure and was reinstated on probation.probation was later revoked when the minor failed to participate in a sex offender treatment program and disobeyed the staff of the group home where he was placed.
the juvenile court concluded a commitment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation,division of juvenile facilities djf formerly cya was in the best interests of the minor and was necessary to protect the public.however,welfare and institutions code section precluded the court from imposing a djf commitment for indecent exposure further section references are to the welfare and institutions code unless otherwise specified.
to avoid the preclusion of section,the juvenile court set aside its on the negotiated the minor committed indecent exposure,and the court dismissed the petition charging that offense.the court then committed the minor to djf for his lewd and lascivious act on a child under,subd.a,an offense listed in section,subdivision b.the court still had jurisdiction over that o
