the question before us is whether under our immigration laws asylum may be granted to the parents of a disabled child who has been persecuted in his native land on account of his disability or whether,instead,we are compelled to force the family to return involuntarily to its home country where the child is likely to face further persistent and debilitating persecution.to answer that question,we must decide whether disabled children and their parents who provide care for them may constitute a particular social group within the meaning of our immigration laws and whether,in order to protect a disabled child from persecution,a parent of such child may apply for asylum and withholding of removal and may rely during the administrative proceeding on the past persecutory conduct directed against the child.
we hold that disabled children and their parents constitute a statutorily protected group and that a parent who provides care for a disabled child may seek asylum and withholding of removal on the basis of the persecution the child has suffered on account of his disability.we also hold that,given the record before us,the parent who is seeking asylum and withholding in this case is eligible for the former relief and entitled to the latter.finally,we hold that the parent spouse and the disabled child are eligible for asylum by virtue of their derivative applications and are also entitled to withholding of removal.
factual and procedural history 
evgueni tchoukhrova was born in in vladivostok,russia with infantile cerebral paralysis,or cerebral palsy.his disability resulted chiefly from the negligence of members of the staff of the russian hospital,who first induced his mother labor and then abandoned her for the entire night,during which time the fetus did not receive sufficient oxygen.the next morning,because the induced labor had stopped,hospital personnel decided to forcibly extract the child from its mother body,breaking its neck in the process.instead of giving the newborn child medical care,they initially threw evgueni into a container holding abortion and other medical waste,telling his mother that they did see the reason why he needed to live.the mother,victoria tchoukhrova,having lost a lot of blood,fell into a state of unconsciousness.
against all odds and despite the staff neglect,evgueni survived,and was retrieved from the disposal bin.as soon as she became conscious again,victoria commenced pleading to see her son,without success.she was told that he was severely disabled and that she should refuse him.after five days,victoria managed to convince a nurse to break the rules and let her visit her child in the middle of the night because she wanted desperately to see him and to hold his lifeless body close to her heart.
despite victoria and her husband dmitri attachment to their newborn son,government officials tried to intimidate the couple into abandoning him to a orphanage.notwithstanding his parents refusal to give their consent,evgueni was transferred to an institution for orphaned children with birth defects.victoria and dmitri repeatedly sought to visit their son,but were denied permission for the first two months.
when the tchoukhrovas finally gained entrance to the hospital for children with birth defects,the conditions were horrifying.the children were wrapped in old,wet,dirty linens and cried out from hunger.no one cleaned or otherwise took care of them.some children writhed in pain but received no treatment.despite their cries and obvious plight,the children were simply abandoned.the tchoukhrovas would not allow their child to remain in confinement under such deplorable conditions and,notwithstanding intense pressure from state authorities to consent to evgueni permanent institutionalization,victoria and dmitri secured his release and put him in a private clinic.
evgueni parents struggles had still not ended.once evgueni was diagnosed as having infantile cerebral palsy,he was permanently labeled as disabled and was consequently banned from receiving any public medical support for his condition.in search of better medical care for their child,the family traveled three times to the osteopathic center for children in san diego.as a result of the treatment that he received in the united states,evgueni was able to walk for the first time in his life.when the family returned to russia,victoria and dmitri,in accordance with the recommendation of his american doctor,refused to allow evgueni to be vaccinated.the doctor was concerned about the boy fragile immune system.because evgueni was not vaccinated,it became difficult for him to obtain any medical care in medical facilities.
the diagnosis of cerebral palsy resulted in evgueni being denied access to public school,despite the fact that his disability was a physical and not a mental one the russian government doctor recommended that,if evgueni parents insisted on refusing to allow him to be institutionalized,he be isolated at home and not taken out into public places,a recommendation that was understandable given the extreme degree of societal prejudice against the disabled in russia.when victoria took evgueni out in public,he was subjected to verbal abuse and spat upon.victoria would often hear parents say to their children get away from that boy,ca you see that he abnormal or do get near him,he sick.children would throw things at him.although many of the interactions were simply frightening and humiliating,two assaults resulted in evgueni hospitalization.on one visit to a park when he was six years old,several young men attacked him.the broken arm and severe head trauma that he suffered due to this incident required him to be hospitalized for two months and led to insomnia,spontaneous crying,shaking,and paranoia.victoria and dmitri filed a report with the police,but they never investigated the incident.on another occasion,a women yelled at victoria,get your ugly imbecile out of here,and shoved evgueni to the ground.he was rushed to the emergency room and received several stitches in his head,from which he still has a visible scar.victoria again filed a police report this time,the police told her the case was insignificant and to settle it herself.evgueni became so frightened of the dangers he faced every time he went outside that he refused to leave the house.all the while,the government continued to try to have him institutionalized.
unable to get the government to treat their son with decency or even to attempt to protect him from the violent harassment he faced,victoria and dmitri decided to take political action in order to create a normal life for him.they joined together with other parents of disabled children and founded an association that opposed the prevailing oppressive conditions of the handicap sic children,called mothers unite victoria worked to have a newspaper article published criticizing the russian government treatment of disabled children,but the proposed article was canceled at the last minute.the couple spoke to the authorities,wrote letters demanding equal rights,and engaged in fundraising on behalf of the cause.the family also sought help from the moon society this action only provoked additional harassment.after one meeting,people threw stones at victoria and vandalized the family car.when dmitri complained to the police,the authorities failed to respond.in,dmitri was fired from his job as a civil engineer and was unable to find employment for two years.in several job interviews,he was urged to stop advocating for the rights of the disabled.with hostilities toward the whole family increasing and the mounting certainty that victoria and dmitri would never be able adequately to protect their son and provide him with a life free from persecution,the family left for the united states in.
documentary evidence corroborates victoria testimony.the wretched treatment evgueni received from both the russian government and from private individuals in russia is far from uncommon in that country.for example,the state department human rights report state department report confirms that evgueni treatment as a child with cerebral palsy reflects the standard practice.russia institutionalizes its orphans,more than of whom are social orphans children who have at least one living parent but who,like evgueni,are by the state because they have been deemed undesirable in some respect.the state department report states 
t he prospects of who are disabled physically or mentally are extremely bleak.the label of imbecile or idiot,which signifies uneducable,is almost always irrevokable.the most likely future is a lifetime in state institutions.
the report also explains that,once institutionalized,children are often provided for poorly and are in some cases abused physically by staff.the state department report also incorporates the human rights watch report abandoned to the state,which chronicles the shocking levels of cruelty and neglect in the state institutions,called internaty,where children with cerebral palsy and other disabilities are warehoused 
in addition to receiving little or no education in such internaty,these orphans may be restrained in cloth sacks,tethered by a limb to furniture,denied stimulation,and sometimes left to die in their own filth.bedridden children aged five to seventeen are confined to understaffed rooms and in some cases are neglected to the point of death.
according to the human rights watch report,severely disabled babies are routinely abandoned at maternity wards,under pressure from medical personnel who warn the recuperating mothers of a life as social pariahs if they keep a defective child.all children who have been institutionalized face the danger of being diagnosed as oligophrenic,or mentally retarded even when they have no mental impairments.as explained in the report,those with diagnoses of oligophrenia have extreme difficulty seeking a of their status,and t hose who grow to adulthood are then interned in another total institution,where they are permanently denied opportunities to know and enjoy their civil and political rights.even the children who manage to be classified as normal while institutionalized face grim prospects because they lack the necessary social,educational,and vocational skills to function in society.
unfortunately,what is true for social orphans in russia extends to disabled people generally in that country.as the state department report explains,the disabled face the danger of being removed from mainstream society and isolated in state institution s they face immense problems created by the government and societal prejudice.
the tchoukhrovas entered the united states on september,and shortly thereafter applied for asylum,withholding,and relief under the convention against torture.victoria filed the principal application for asylum and listed both dmitri and evgueni she stated that she wished to include them in her application.in an oral decision,the immigration judge made explicit findings that victoria testimony was credible,the family were members of a particular social group,namely,a family whose child is severely disabled,the harms suffered by the tchoukhrovas were on account of their membership in that particular social group,the government of russia was responsible for the harms because the government of russia wishes to isolate handicapped children,russian society does not tolerate people with disabilities,and the family did suffer harm in russia.however,while saying the case was close and that he hoped that the family would be able to stay in the united states,the immigration judge held that the harms the family suffered did not rise to the level of persecution.he therefore denied victoria application for asylum,withholding,and a prohibition against removal under the convention against torture the bia issued a summary,although not streamlined,decision in which it noted that the tchoukhrovas had a very sympathetic family history,but,nevertheless,adopted the immigration judge decision and denied the relief sought.this petition for review followed.
ii.standard of review 
we accept the petitioner testimony as true when,as here,the agency finds her to be credible.mihalev ashcroft,cir.to establish eligibility for asylum,the petitioner must prove that she is unable or unwilling to return to her home country because of a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion a a see ins,d.an asylum applicant can establish eligibility either because he or she has suffered past persecution or because he or she has a fear of future persecution.b.the applicant is entitled to withholding if she has suffered a past threat to life or freedom or is more likely than not to endure a future threat to life or freedom.b.
when the bia adopts the immigration judge decision as its own,we treat the immigration judge reasons as the bia.he ashcroft,cir.here,the bia relied on matter of burbano,bia,which holds that the board final decision may be rendered in a summary fashion,and that,in such cases the board conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the immigration judge articulated in his or her decision.when the bia does not express any disagreement with any part of the immigration judge decision,but instead cites burbano,the bia adopts his decision in its entirety.
iii.analysis 
because the immigration judge explicitly reached all of the component issues in the family asylum and withholding claims,we review each of those determinations here,and,if relief is warranted,we are authorized to order that such remedy or remedies be granted we agree with the legal conclusion of the immigration judge and the bia that disabled children and their parents who provide care for them are members of a particular social group.we also agree that the factual findings that evgueni and his parents were members of that social group,were harmed directly or indirectly on account of their membership,and that these harms were inflicted by the russian government or those whom it was unwilling or unable to control are supported by substantial evidence.furthermore,although we agree that,as a matter of law,the immigration judge was correct to look at the harms faced by the tchoukhrovas collectively when evaluating victoria application,we hold that his determination that the harms did not rise to the level of persecution is not supported by substantial evidence.
on account of a particular social group 
the first question we must consider is whether disabled children and their parents who provide care for them constitute a particular social group within the meaning of a a.whether a category constitutes a particular social group for the purposes of asylum and withholding of removal is a legal question we review de novo.ins,cir.a particular social group is one in which the members are united by a voluntary association,including a former association,or by an innate characteristic that is so fundamental to the identities or consciences of its members that members either can not or should not be required to change it.id.at.we agree with the agency that russian disabled children and their parents constitute a particular social group.
we begin by noting that persons with disabilities are precisely the kind of individuals that our asylum law contemplates by the words members of a particular social group.while not all disabilities are innate or inherent,in the sense that they may be acquired,they are usually,unfortunately,immutable.id.at,see also americans with disabilities act of.a codified at a i ndividuals with disabilities are a discrete and insular minority who have been faced with restrictions and limitations,subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment,and relegated to a position of political powerlessness based on characteristics that are beyond the control of such individuals.because disability constitutes precisely the sort of immutable characteristic that an individual can not change,as contemplated by our law,we have no trouble concluding that persons with disabilities can constitute a particular social group for purposes of asylum and withholding of removal law.
as the above analysis suggests,we include within the social group only persons whose disabilities are serious and or permanent in nature.we need not decide whether such persons necessarily constitute a social group in every country,although it is clear from our references to the americans with disabilities act that in this land they do.for purposes of this case,we need determine only two narrow questions.first,do disabled children in russia constitute a particular social group and,second,may their parents be joined with them in that classification we answer both questions affirmatively.
disabled children in russia constitute a distinct and identifiable group.in this respect,disabled russian children resemble the particular social groups our circuit has previously recognized.see,mohammed gonzales,cir holding that a somali woman under threat of female genital mutilation was a member of a particular social group karouni gonzales,cir holding that all alien homosexuals are members of a particular social group.disabled children in russia share not only common characteristics but a common experience as well.their mistreatment by the state and society in general is before us,by explicit discussion in both the state department report and a human rights watch report devoted to the issue.russian children who are disabled experience permanent and stigmatizing labeling,lifetime institutional internaty,denial of education and medical care,and constant,serious,and often violent harassment.all of this evidence supports our conclusion that in russia disabled children constitute a particular social group.
we further hold that russian parents who provide care for their disabled children are properly included in the particular social group.parents who resist the harms inflicted by the russian government upon their children often express a political opinion while doing so,and thus may be entitled to asylum on that basis as well but,in providing care for their disabled children,parents are doing something more fundamental than engaging in politics they are acting out of love and devotion for their children.helping care for one disabled child is an act basic to one humanity.parents who provide such care act in a manner that is so fundamental to their identities that they should not be required to change,at see also matter of acosta,bia,overruled in part on other grounds by in re mogharrabi,bia.likewise,just as their children disabilities are immutable,so is a parent relationship to a disabled child.because the parents and their disabled child incur the harm as a unit,it is appropriate to combine family members into a single social group for purposes of asylum and withholding.furthermore,including parents in the social group with their disabled children is consistent with the definition of a particular social group that we sometimes employ,namely,a collection of people closely affiliated with each other,who are actuated by some common impulse or interest.ins,cir.the family interest in preserving the rights and protecting the welfare of a disabled child welds the parents or those in loco parentis together with the disabled child in a manner that qualifies all of them as members of a social group for purposes of our immigration laws.
we therefore come to the same legal conclusion as the agency and hold that russian disabled children and their parents who help care for them constitute a social group for purposes of our immigration statutes.see a a.if individuals experience persecution on account of their membership in that group,they may seek asylum and withholding of removal.
in addition to the legal questions,we also consider the immigration judge factual determinations that the tchoukhrovas were members of this particular social group,the harms that they experienced were on account of their membership in the social group,and the harms that occurred were inflicted by the government or those whom the government was unwilling or unable to control.in this case,none of these factual determinations is disputed.uncontroverted evidence supports the findings that evgueni suffers from cerebral palsy and is classified as disabled by the russian government,that victoria and dmitri have dedicated their lives to caring for their son,and that the tchoukhrova family was therefore part of the social group of disabled russian children and their parents.furthermore,it is undisputed that the government cruel mistreatment of evgueni and the violence to which he was subjected by private parties were both on account of his membership in that group and that the government not only inflicted harm directly but was unwilling or unable to control the persecutory conduct of the private parties involved.accordingly,the requirements for finding persecution under the statute are all met,except for the question whether the harmful and injurious conduct to which evgueni was subjected rose to the level of persecution.
rising to the level of persecution 
preliminary question 
before addressing the final issue,we must decide a threshold procedural question may the harms suffered by a disabled child be taken into account when determining whether to grant his parent asylum application once again,we agree with the approach taken by the agency in this case.without discussing the question expressly,the agency treated the harms inflicted on the family members cumulatively.both the purposes of our immigration statutes and the background principles of law generally applicable to families and children mandate the procedure followed by the agency in this case.
immigration law has always had a purpose of protecting families and,where possible,keeping them united.see,gonzales,cir the immigration and nationality act ina was intended to keep families together.it should be construed in favor of family units and the acceptance of responsibility by family members.it has also always been a principle of american law that the family is a unique and important social unit entitled to legal protection.see moore city of east cleveland,d our decisions establish that the constitution protects the sanctity of the family precisely because the institution of the family is deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition.stanley illinois,d emphasizing the important and essential nature of the family and holding that integrity of the family unit is constitutionally protected see also troxel granville,d rejecting any notion that a child is the mere creature of the state internal citations omitted.caring for the family is also consistent with our international obligations.see,international covenant on civil and political rights,opened for signature,ratified by the united states on september,the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the state.imputing the disabled child harms to the parent filing an application for asylum on behalf of the family members vindicates these basic principles and statutory purposes,and renders the law consonant with both common sense and the important family values on which this nation prides itself.the agency was correct,as a matter of law,to do so here.
the procedural issue arises as a consequence of the limited scope of derivative asylum applications.under b,only a spouse or child of an alien may obtain asylum eligibility derivatively when the petitioning alien application is approved.although the statute provides that minor children may obtain asylum derivatively through their parents,there is no comparable provision permitting parents to obtain that relief derivatively through their minor children.accordingly,if a minor child is granted asylum as a derivative applicant of his parent principal application,both parents and child can stay in the united states.however,if the child is the principal applicant and is granted asylum,the child can legally stay in this country,but his parents will be removed.this second circumstance occurs rarely because parents fleeing to this country usually have their own claims of persecution,and it is infrequent that the child is the only member of the family who has been directly persecuted in the family native country.see generally jeff weiss,dep of justice,guidelines for children asylum claims,at wl the majority of children who apply
