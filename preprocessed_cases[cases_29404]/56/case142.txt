this is an appeal from a judgment of juvenile delinquency under the federal juvenile delinquency act.the primary question for decision is whether the district court should have dismissed the information for violation of the special speedy trial provision of the delinquency act.the answer depends on the date on which the clock of began to run.we join our sister circuits that have addressed the question and hold that time begins to run at the commencement of federal detention of the juvenile on the federal delinquency charge.by that calculation,there was no violation of in this case and we accordingly affirm the district court ruling.
a second issue that we must resolve concerns one of the requirements of of the delinquency act.the section provides,in pertinent part,that no hearing shall be held for disposition of a juvenile after a finding of delinquency until any prior juvenile court records of such juvenile have been received by the court,or the clerk of the juvenile court has certified in writing that the juvenile has no prior record,or that the juvenile record is unavailable and why it is unavailable.the record in this case does not reflect that the district court received the specified records or certification.no objection was entered.we conclude that this requirement of is not jurisdictional,and that any deficiency in the district court compliance with the requirement did not rise to the level of plain error.we accordingly affirm the judgment of the district court.
i.the speedy trial provision of 
factual background 
the appellant,whom we refer to as john doe,is a juvenile indian who assaulted a teacher in her home on the tohono indian reservation in arizona in august.doe turned himself in to tribal authorities two months later.two days thereafter,on october,tribal authorities charged doe with three sexual assault offenses,one of which was the august assault against the teacher.doe remained in tribal detention on those charges,and the tribal court ordered psychological evaluations.
it is not entirely clear from the record when federal authorities were notified of doe detention and charges.doe counsel in the tribal proceedings testified in district court that during tribal plea negotiations on november,the tribal prosecutor represented that he had been informed that,if tribal plea negotiations were successful,a federal declination to pursue charges could be obtained.there is nothing in the record to indicate who in the federal government had been contacted or when the contact occurred.the assistant united states attorney stated in the district court hearing on the motion to dismiss that she was not aware that anyone in her office knew of the case until they were informally advised of it in late november or early december.she asserted that in late december an investigator brought a report to her and a case investigative file was opened on december in the office of the united states attorney.
on january,the tribal prosecutor informed defense counsel that the federal government had changed its position and that federal charges would be filed.on january,the tribal prosecutor informed the tribal court that the federal authorities intended to prosecute and that he expected a federal writ to issue on or about january.at that point,the tribal prosecutor and defense counsel stipulated to a stay of all tribal proceedings a tribal court hearing that had been set for january was vacated.
on march,the united states filed an information charging doe with three counts of delinquency,all arising from the assault on the teacher in august.on the same date,the united states attorney filed a certification pursuant to stating that the counts charged were crimes of violence that are felony offenses and that there is a substantial federal interest in the case or the offense to warrant the exercise of federal jurisdiction.this certification is a precondition to federal prosecution of juvenile delinquency.on march,the federal court issued a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum but the writ was not executed until march.doe was released into federal custody by tribal authorities on or about that date.he made his first appearance before a federal magistrate judge on march,and was ordered detained pending trial,which was set for may.
on april,doe moved to dismiss for violation of the speedy trial provision of.doe also filed a motion to continue the trial for at least days to permit a psychological examination.the district court denied the motion to dismiss,but granted the continuance.additional continuances and a period of incompetency caused further consensual delay that is not in issue.doe ultimately pleaded guilty but reserved his right to appeal the denial of his speedy trial motion.he was sentenced to two concurrent terms of approximately months ending with his birthday.
upon appeal,a panel of this court held that the provision of had been violated,and reversed the judgment.see united states doe,cir.the united states petitioned for rehearing en banc.the petition was granted and the opinion vacated,see united states doe,cir,bringing this matter before this en banc court.
discussion 
the question for decision is when the clock begins to run for purposes of the speedy trial provision of the juvenile delinquency act.we conclude that the clock starts when federal detention on the federal delinquency charge commences.section provides in relevant part 
if an alleged delinquent who is in detention pending trial is not brought to trial within thirty days from the date upon which such detention was begun,the information shall be dismissed on motion of the alleged delinquent or at the direction of the court,unless the attorney general shows that additional delay was caused by the juvenile or his counsel,or consented to by the juvenile and his counsel,or would be in the interest of justice in the particular case.
under the plain meaning of this provision,time begins to run on the date upon which such detention was begun.id.
one possible literal reading of this phrase would start the clock when any detention began.in practice,such an interpretation becomes nonsensical.in many cases,a juvenile might be held in state or tribal detention for more than days before federal authorities even learn of the crime or the detention.federal prosecution would be before it could begin.for this reason,other circuit courts have read detention in to mean federal detention,and have started the clock at its commencement.see,united states three male juveniles,cir united states doe,cir see also united states wong,cir.this reading is buttressed by the requirements of of the juvenile delinquency act whenever a juvenile is taken into custody for an alleged act of juvenile delinquency,the arresting officer must notify the attorney general and parents or guardian of the juvenile,and the juvenile must be taken before a magistrate judge.id.some of these requirements make little sense unless custody is understood to be federal custody.see united states doe,cir en banc doe,at.
in this circuit,however,we placed a gloss on that resulted in the starting of the clock at a time that did not necessarily coincide with the beginning of federal custody.in united states andy,cir,we held that must be read in conjunction with.section provides,among other things 
a juvenile alleged to have committed an act of juvenile delinquency shall not be proceeded against in any court of the united states unless the attorney general,after investigation,certifies to the appropriate district court of the united states that the juvenile court or other appropriate court of a state does not have jurisdiction or refuses to assume jurisdiction over said juvenile with respect to such alleged act of juvenile delinquency,the state does not have available programs and services adequate for the needs of juveniles,or the offense charged is a crime of violence that is a felony and that there is a substantial federal interest in the case or the offense to warrant the exercise of federal jurisdiction.
our opinion in andy agreed that it made no sense to start the clock when tribal custody began,but then proceeded to hold that the process of certification under entered into the calculation.see andy,at.andy held that time began to run under on 
the date that the attorney general certifies,or in the exercise of reasonable diligence,could have certified,to the conditions stated in,or the date upon which the government formally assumes jurisdiction over the juvenile,whichever event earlier occurs.
id.we later made clear that,for purposes of alternative,the federal government formally assumes jurisdiction over a juvenile when it arrests the juvenile and places him or her in federal custody.see united states eric,cir.
the application of the andy formula would clearly require the dismissal of doe information in the present case.wholly apart from the question of when the united states attorney could have certified the necessary matters,the actual certification was filed on march.doe motion to dismiss was filed on april,than days after certification.by andy reasoning,time had run under.
we conclude,however,that andy formulation is unsound and andy must be overruled.andy has been followed by no other circuit and has been criticized by several for what we regard as sound reasons.first,andy is a strained combination of two statutory provisions with different purposes,neither of which requires an effect upon the other.see united states sechrist,cir united states doe,cir.section is a straightforward speedy trial provision for juveniles in detention.once detention is understood to be federal detention,the requirement of trial within thirty days from the date on which such detention was begun is direct and without any hint that certification under affects the process.
section,on the other hand,is designed for a purpose wholly independent of speedy trial provisions or detention.as the government puts it,this need certification requirement of creates a rebuttable presumption against federal jurisdiction in juvenile cases see united states juvenile male,cir.there is no reason why certification under,which may occur when there is no detention at all,should start the speedy trial clock of running.
particularly troublesome is andy rule that time runs from the date on which the attorney general in the exercise of reasonable diligence,could have certified to the necessary conditions for federal prosecution.andy,at.for courts to determine when a prosecutor could have decided that federal charges were appropriate intrudes into an area that courts are properly reluctant to enter.see united states,cir.moreover,andy rule creates an incentive that frustrates a purpose of.a decision by the attorney general or his delegate that a federal prosecution of juvenile delinquency is warranted is meant to be a careful and deliberate decision.see juvenile male kenneth,at.but andy creates an incentive for the attorney general to certify and file charges the moment that some court later might determine he could have certified the necessary conditions.see eric,at.what was to have been a considered decision thus becomes a hasty one.
we therefore overrule andy.in its place,we hold that the speedy trial clock begins to run from the time of detention,as provided by,and that detention means federal detention.moreover,the federal detention must be on the charge of alleged delinquency for which the juvenile is held in custody pending trial.otherwise,unrelated federal detention might cause time to run before federal authorities became aware of the facts giving rise to a charge of delinquency.see united states juvenile male,cir.accordingly,the clock begins to run from the date upon which federal detention was begun on the charges of delinquency for which the alleged delinquent is in custody pending trial.this formulation,we conclude,best follows the statutory language of in light of the practical necessities of federal jurisdiction in juvenile cases.
it will ordinarily be a relatively simple task to determine when federal detention on the charge of delinquency began,but we recognize that factual disputes might arise in some cases over whether a particular detention was federal or was on the pending delinquency charge.there may be instances,for example,when federal detention commences even though the juvenile is not held in federal facilities or directly by federal personnel.we have no reason to speculate on these or other factual issues that might arise,because we find no triable factual dispute in this case.doe was taken into tribal custody on three separate tribal charges.there is nothing in the record to indicate that his tribal custody was ordered by federal authorities or was maintained for federal purposes.there is no suggestion of bad faith collusion between federal and tribal authorities in detaining doe on the tribal charges.unquestionably,the tribal authorities proved willing to release doe for federal prosecution and anticipated federal prosecution for some time before that release.but doe was held on three tribal charges,two of which were unrelated to the federal charges.nothing but the stipulation of doe counsel and the tribal prosecutor appears on this record to have prevented tribal action on the tribal charges.even if the tribe was willing to forestall action on its charges in light of the federal point not clear from the fact did not render the tribe detention federal.although the length of delay between the issuance and execution of the habeas writ that permits the federal government to take a juvenile into custody might under some circumstances give rise to questions as to the purposes of the continued detention in a tribal facility,the district court finding that the detention was tribal prior to doe delivery to federal authorities was not clearly erroneous in light of the whole record.
under that finding,doe motion was properly denied.he was delivered into federal custody on march.his motion to dismiss was filed on april,less than days after his federal detention began.on the same date,doe filed a motion for continuance to permit a psychological examination.the district court denied the motion to dismiss because the time limit had not run.the court then granted the continuance,which began a series of consensual delays that the parties agree tolled the further running of the period there was accordingly no error.
ii.the juvenile record requirement of 
factual background 
after doe was adjudicated to be a delinquent,the district court held a dispositional hearing.the only presentation of doe juvenile record in the district court record was in the predisposition report,which was delivered to the court prior to the dispositional hearing.that report recited that the tribal justice center currently is not releasing juvenile records.it then set forth doe history of delinquency as obtained from a pretrial services report.the predisposition report then listed several delinquency referrals of doe to the tribal justice system,and described two additional sexual assaults that were the subject of pending tribal charges at the time doe was delivered into federal custody.defense counsel did not object to any of these recitals in the predisposition report and did not contest or question their factual accuracy there was no objection to the absence of official juvenile court records.the district court sentenced doe at the conclusion of the hearing.
discussion 
the relevant provision of states 
a juvenile shall not be transferred to adult prosecution nor shall a hearing be held under section disposition after a finding of juvenile delinquency until any prior juvenile court records of such juvenile have been received by the court,or the clerk of the juvenile court has certified in writing that the juvenile has no prior record,or that the juvenile record is unavailable and why it is unavailable.
the record does not indicate compliance with these requirements.the district court does not appear to have received doe actual juvenile records,and there is no certificate from the clerk of the tribal juvenile court regarding doe records we have previously held that requires the district court to receive the official documentary record and that summaries and testimony about a juvenile record presented by the prosecution are not suff
