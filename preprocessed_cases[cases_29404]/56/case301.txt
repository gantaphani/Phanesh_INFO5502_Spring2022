crystal,the mother of christopher,natalie,francisco,and infant brianna,and frank,the presumed father of brianna,appeal from the jurisdiction findings and disposition orders declaring the children dependents of the juvenile court after the court sustained a petition pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b alleging that crystal had a history of substance abuse and was a current abuser of cocaine rendering her unable to provide regular care and supervision of her four children and that frank had a history of illicit drug abuse and was a current abuser of marijuana rendering him unable to provide regular care and supervision of brianna.crystal does not seriously challenge the findings and order as to brianna,who tested positive for cocaine,amphetamine and methamphetamine at birth,but argues the evidence was insufficient to establish jurisdiction over her other children or to remove them from her custody.frank,who is the father only of brianna likewise does not challenge the court findings with respect to crystal and brianna,but contends the evidence of his past marijuana use and criminal history is insufficient to show he is unable to provide regular care for his child.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the los angeles county department of children and family services department received a child abuse referral after both crystal and brianna tested positive for cocaine at brianna birth.brianna also tested positive for amphetamine and methamphetamine.crystal admitted she had started using cocaine when she was years old seven years before the filing of the dependency petition in this case but insisted she had stopped when she was and had not used the drug since that time.she denied using cocaine during her pregnancy and could not explain how she and brianna had tested positive.subsequently crystal claimed she had picked up a small container of cocaine for someone else during her eighth month of pregnancy and had tasted it to be sure it was cocaine.brianna was born three days later,approximately one month before crystal due date.
brianna weighed five pounds one ounce when born and,because of respiratory issues,had to be fed intravenously and was on oxygen.she remained in the hospital for days but did not have any withdrawal symptoms and no ongoing health issues.
at the time of the child abuse report crystal,christopher then six years old and francisco then two years old were living with a cousin,estella,and estella family in bellflower.crystal,however,did not know estella address or telephone number.natalie then five years old was living with a maternal great aunt in las vegas.all three children appeared healthy and had no marks,bruises or other visible signs of abuse.
estella watched the two boys when crystal went out sometimes returning the same day sometimes not until the following day.crystal did not let estella know where she was going when she left the children in her care.estella told the department social worker she had no knowledge whether crystal had a drug problem but confirmed that frank,also a relative of hers,smoked marijuana.
crystal and frank had had an off and on relationship for months to two years.frank said he and crystal had been separated for approximately six months he was not with her when she was pregnant and did not know what she was doing.apparently when not with crystal,frank lived with his father brianna paternal grandfather.
frank said he was unaware that crystal used drugs and denied that they had used cocaine or smoked marijuana together.however,frank acknowledged he had smoked marijuana since he was or years old and his use had increased over time to once or twice each day.he explained he had been shot in the back and smoking marijuana relaxed him.frank had unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a medical marijuana card.however,frank said he had completely stopped two weeks prior to brianna birth because he was going to have a baby soon.notwithstanding that explanation,frank was unsure if he was brianna father and asked for a paternity test.frank also told the social worker he was a former gang member and was on probation for vandalism actually,community supervision,a form of parole supervised by the probation department.according to his probation officer,frank was not in full compliance with the terms of his release he had enrolled in a substance abuse program,but not completed it,and had tested positive for marijuana but no other drugs.
while brianna remained in the hospital and natalie was in las vegas,the department detained the other two children and filed a dependency petition on behalf of all four of them on april.the juvenile court found a prima facie case had been established the children were described by section,subdivision b inability of parent to provide regular care for the child due to substance abuse,and ordered them detained.
at the july,jurisdiction and disposition hearing the court sustained the petition,amended slightly by interlineation,and found the children were described by section,subdivision b.as sustained,count b provides,crystal has a seven year history of substance abuse,and is a current abuser of cocaine,which renders the mother unable to provide regular care and supervision of the child.the mother used illicit drugs,during the mother pregnancy with brianna,and had a positive toxicology screen for cocaine at the child birth.the mother substance abuse endangers the children physical health and safety,creates a detrimental home environment,and places the children at risk of physical harm and danger.as sustained,count b provides,frank has a history of illicit drug abuse,and is a current abuser of marijuana,which renders the father unable to provide regular care and supervision of the child.the father abuse of illicit drugs endangers the child physical health and safety,and places the child at risk of physical harm and danger.
proceeding to disposition,the court found by clear and convincing evidence that a substantial danger existed to the children and there were no reasonable means to protect them without removing them from their parents custody.the court ordered the children committed to the care,custody and control of the department for suitable placement and directed the department to provide reunification services to all four children and crystal and to brianna and frank.services for the parents were to include substance abuse treatment and drug testing,parenting classes,individual counseling and monitored visitation.
both crystal and frank filed timely notices of appeal from the jurisdiction findings and disposition orders.
contentions 
essentially conceding dependency jurisdiction was proper as to brianna,who was born with a positive toxicology screen for cocaine and other illicit drugs crystal contends the evidence of her sporadic drug use was insufficient to support the findings she was a current substance abuser and christopher,natalie and francisco were at substantial risk of serious physical harm justifying the exercise of the juvenile court jurisdiction.in addition,even if jurisdiction was appropriately extended over all four children,crystal argues support services could have been provided and there was insufficient evidence that removal of the three older children was necessary for their protection.frank contends the evidence of his past marijuana use and criminal history was insufficient to support the finding he could not care for brianna or to justify removing her from his custody.frank also contends the court lacked an adequate basis for ordering him to participate in a full substance abuse program or individual counseling or to restrict him to monitored visits.
discussion 
the governing statute and standard of review 
the purpose of section is to provide maximum safety and protection for children who are currently being physically,sexually,or emotionally abused,being neglected,or being exploited,and to ensure the safety,protection,and physical and emotional of children who are at risk of that harm.see in re giovanni th.section,subdivision b,allows a child to be adjudged a dependent of the juvenile court when t he child has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer,serious physical harm or illness,as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent or guardian to adequately supervise or protect the child or by the inability of the parent or guardian to provide regular care for the child due to the parent or guardian mental illness,developmental disability,or substance abuse.
although section generally requires proof the child is subject to the defined risk of harm at the time of the jurisdiction hearing in re savannah th,in re rocco th,rocco,the court need not wait until a child is seriously abused or injured to assume jurisdiction and take steps necessary to protect the child.in re th.the court may consider past events in deciding whether a child presently needs the court protection.ibid.a parent p ast conduct may be probative of current conditions if there is reason to believe that the conduct will continue.in re th.
in addition,the legislature has declared,the provision of a home environment free from the negative effects of substance abuse is a necessary condition for the safety,protection and physical and emotional of the child.successful participation in a treatment program for substance abuse may be considered in evaluating the home environment.exercise of dependency court jurisdiction under section,subdivision b,is proper when a child is of such tender years that the absence of adequate supervision and care poses an inherent risk to his or her health and safety.rocco,supra,th at.
we review the juvenile court jurisdictional findings and disposition orders for substantial evidence.los angeles county of children family services superior court th,in re th.under this standard w e review the record to determine whether there is any substantial evidence to support the juvenile court conclusions,and we resolve all conflicts and make all reasonable inferences from the evidence to uphold the court orders,if possible.in re david th,accord,in re drake th,drake in re savannah,supra,th at.
substantial evidence supports the count b jurisdiction findings and disposition order with regard to crystal 
crystal used cocaine and,based on the positive toxicology screen for brianna at birth,amphetamine and methamphetamine while she was pregnant,unquestionably endangering the health and safety of her unborn child.she also admitted she had used cocaine in the past although claiming she had stopped using when she was years old.given her initial false denial of any cocaine use in the days before brianna was born,the juvenile court reasonably disbelieved crystal portrayal of limited,sporadic drug use.in addition,following the children detention crystal missed one drug test,properly considered the equivalent of a positive test result and failed to enroll in a substance abuse program or any other recommended programs.this evidence,taken together with crystal unstable lifestyle and cavalier attitude toward childcare she left the children with her cousin estella while she went out,sometimes for the entire night,without telling estella where she was going or when she would return fully supports the juvenile court finding that crystal substance abuse endangered all four children health and safety.
the analysis in drake,supra,th by our colleagues in division three of this court does not compel a different conclusion.as the drake court explained,when the legislature rewrote section,subdivision b,in to include as a basis for dependency jurisdiction a parent inability to provide regular care for his or her child due to substance abuse,it included no definition of the term substance abuse in the statute.id.at.similarly,the legislative history revealed no specific discussion of how the term should be defined in practice.as a result,d ependency cases have varied widely in the kinds of parental actions labeled substance abuse.ibid.
to avoid inconsistencies,the drake court proposed a definition of substance abuse based on the american psychiatric association diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ed.dsm iv tr,a definition that had also been used in an earlier dependency decision involving a somewhat different issue,jennifer superior court th.see drake,supra,th at.following jennifer,the drake court held a finding of substance abuse for purposes of section,subdivision b,must be based on evidence sufficient to show that the parent or guardian at issue had been diagnosed as having a current substance abuse problem by a medical professional or establish that the parent or guardian at issue has a current substance abuse problem as defined in the dsm iv tr.the full definition of substance abuse found in the dsm iv tr describes the condition as a maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress,as manifested by one or more of the following,occurring within a month period recurrent substance use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work,school,or home,repeated absences or poor work performance related to substance use absences,suspensions,or expulsions from school neglect of children or household recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous,driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by substance use recurrent legal problems,arrests for disorderly conduct and continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance,arguments with spouse about consequences of intoxication,physical fights.dsm iv tr,at.drake,at.
we recognize the drake formulation as a generally useful and workable definition of substance abuse for purposes of section,subdivision b.but it is not a comprehensive,exclusive definition mandated by either the legislature or the supreme court,and we are unwilling to accept crystal argument that only someone who has been diagnosed by a medical professional or who falls within one of the specific dsm iv tr categories can be found to be a current substance abuser.see jessen mentor th,fn.there is no horizontal stare decisis in the court of appeal we are not bound by the contrary decision by division one of this court in re marriage of shaban th,same.here,we believe crystal repeated use of cocaine and her ingestion of that drug while pregnant constitutes recurrent substance use that resulted in her failure to fulfill a major role obligation within the meaning of dsm iv tr.but even if crystal conduct fell outside one of the dsm iv tr categories,we have no doubt her use of cocaine while in the final stage of her pregnancy,combined with her admitted use of the drug in the past and her failure to consistently test or enroll in a drug abuse program,justified the juvenile court exercise of dependency jurisdiction over her children.
in addition,because the children were six years old or younger at the time of the jurisdiction hearing children of tender years in the language of rocco the finding of substance abuse is prima facie evidence of the inability of a parent or guardian to provide regular care resulting in a substantial risk of harm.drake,supra,th at accord,rocco,supra,th at.crystal did not adequately rebut that evidence.indeed,her use of cocaine during the last months of her pregnancy confirmed her poor judgment and willingness to endanger her children safety due to substance abuse.thus,the decision to remove the children from her care and custody was supported by substantial evidence.
the count b jurisdiction finding as to frank is supported by substantial evidence 
frank,an unemployed,year old,former gang member,has been a daily user of marijuana for a number of years.the court reasonably disbelieved his claim he had stopped using marijuana two weeks before brianna birth because he was going to be a father,based in part on his initial request for a paternity test,plainly suggesting impending parenthood was not something he was planning for,and in part on his explanation he needed to use marijuana in the aftermath of being shot and his purported failed efforts to obtain a medical marijuana card.in addition,frank was in violation of the terms of his parole be
