ii.background 
webber was convicted by a jury of sexually abusing a minor child,first degree rape,forcible sodomy,lewd molestation,attempted rape,sodomy,sexual battery,and attempted lewd molestation.webber state,no.june,unpublished.
webber worked as a teacher,coach,and counselor at bishop kelley high school in tulsa,oklahoma.allegations of sexual misconduct on the part of webber began to surface in the spring of.as a result of the allegations,webber was terminated from his job at bishop kelley in october.
on june,webber was tried in tulsa county district court on counts of sexual misconduct involving seven different victims,each of whom testified at trial.the case was prosecuted by assistant district attorneys john priddy and eric stall.webber was represented by patrick malloy,iii and paul brunton.in addition,assistant public defender vicki sousa served as a child advocate for one of the victims.at the time,a child advocate was required by oklahoma law to be appointed to represent the interests of child victims for cases filed under.stat.tit.stat.tit,b.

in his defense,webber offered numerous character witnesses,including former players and students,members of his church,and his father.webber denied all of the allegations.
vicki sousa filed her entry of appearance on behalf of on october.sousa was present but did not participate in the preliminary hearing.sousa argued in support of a motion to quash brought by lanny endicott,counselor,claiming any communications between the two were privileged.sousa also opposed the defense motion to compel psychiatric examination of and sousa was present and participated in voir dire.throughout voir dire and the trial sousa sat at a table separate from the defense and the prosecution.sousa herself objected to the trial court judge limiting her participation in the trial.at trial sousa questioned ten of the sixteen witnesses for the state and eight of the eighteen witnesses for the defense.sousa was admonished by the trial judge not to ask leading questions.although sousa questioned a number of witnesses,in the context of the trial her questioning was minimal.much of her questioning focused on whether the witnesses knew and on any interactions the witnesses had with through her questioning,sousa often attempted to reinforce the state argument,refreshing a witness memory on the sexual connotation of his encounter with webber,inquiring about whether basketball players could drive their own cars to practice,asking witnesses about the credibility of one of the primary accusers,supporting the credibility of,including introducing an exhibit showing the letter wrote to his family telling them what happened,and challenging webber defense.

iii.standard of review 
the district court denial of webber petition for habeas relief is reviewed de novo with respect to legal conclusions and under a clear error standard for factual findings.rogers gibson,cir.if the state court addressed a claim on the merits,habeas relief will not be granted unless the state court adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.deference is accorded to a state court result even when the state court fails to discuss any federal law rationale for its decision or cite to any federal authority.aycox lytle,cir.this deference applies when there is no indication suggesting that the state court did not reach the merits of a claim.gipson jordan,cir.if,however,it is determined that the state court did not reach the merits of a federal claim and there is no procedural bar,deference under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa is inapplicable.id.
iv.discussion 
participation of the child advocate 
webber argues that the participation of the child advocate violated his fourteenth amendment due process right to a fair trial by creating an improper situation which affected the jury guilt determination and,to the extent the occa concluded this error was harmless,the occa applied the harmless error test in an objectively unreasonable manner.
on direct appeal the occa determined that the child advocate appointment was improper under the statute because was over at the time the charges against webber were filed and that her participation at trial exceeded the bounds of the statute.webber state,no.june,unpublished.the occa reversed the counts associated with although webber argued federal and state due process grounds on direct appeal,the occa reversal was apparently based primarily on the oklahoma statute.the opinion included only an oblique reference to due process.id.without stating whether the error was premised on a violation of the state statute or due process,the occa further held that the participation of sousa was harmless with respect to the determination of guilt on the remaining counts of conviction.the occa,however,did modify webber sentence on each of the remaining counts on the grounds that the child advocate participation in the trial may have influenced the jury when they assessed punishment.id.the occa did not conduct any analysis regarding whether the error was structural or trial error.
from the occa opinion it is not clear whether the occa reached the merits of webber federal due process claim with regard to the participation of the child advocate,including whether there was a federal due process violation at all,whether the error was structural or trial error,and whether the error was harmless under chapman california,d.the question of whether the occa reached the merits need not be decided,however,because webber claim fails with or without according the state court decision aedpa deference.thus,for purposes of this decision,we will assume,without deciding,that the state court did not reach the merits of webber federal due process claim regarding whether participation of the child advocate was a due process violation,whether such a violation was structural or trial error,and whether the error was harmless under chapman.we,therefore,exercise our independent judgment in deciding the claim.battenfield gibson,cir.in so doing,we review the legal conclusions of the district court de novo and its factual findings for clear error.id.we will further assume,without deciding,that sousa participation did amount to a violation of webber fourteenth amendment due process right to a fair trial.
webber argues that the error flowing from sousa extensive participation in webber trial is structural in nature.structural errors are errors that affect the entire framework within which the trial proceeds,rather than simply an error in the trial process itself.arizona fulminante,d.in contrast,trial error is error which occurred during the presentation of the case to the jury,and which may therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.
webber relies heavily on young united states ex rel.vuitton et fils in which a plurality of the supreme court concluded that the appointment of a private prosecutor is structural error not subject to harmless error analysis,d plurality opinion the situation in young,however,was qualitatively different than what happened in webber case.in young,the defendant was accused of violating an injunction against infringing louis vuitton trademark and vuitton own lawyers were appointed by the court to prosecute the contempt charge.id.at.vuitton lawyers,unlike the child advocate,were the government sole representatives,had a relationship with vuitton,and had a direct personal interest in the outcome of the case which would be to the advantage of their client,beyond simply vindicating the public interest in justice.see id.at.suggesting the lawyers may have had a desire to obtain information for a pending defamation case and various other civil claims.in a case where a prosecutor represents an interested party the ethics of the legal profession require that an interest other than the government be taken into account.id.at.as such,the supreme court was concerned about the appearance of impropriety that results from the inherent conflict of interest and opportunity for abuse.id.at.the concerns of the supreme court in young are not present in webber case because the child advocate,an officer of the court,had no personal or continuing interest in the case nor did she have a relationship with any of the parties.
furthermore,this court has held that the participation of a attorney in a state criminal prosecution does not violate the defendant right to due process under federal law unless the private attorney effectively controlled critical prosecutorial decisions.erikson pawnee county bd.of county comm rs,cir.while it does not include a structural error analysis,the erikson decision sheds light on the question of whether the improper presence and participation of a child advocate should be considered a structural or trial error.erickson filed a suit alleging,in part,a violation of his federal due process rights because private defendants,the attorneys who represented the families of two men killed by erikson,participated in the state prosecution of erickson.id.at.as in erikson,sousa was not involved in decisions regarding whether to prosecute,what targets of prosecution to select,what investigative powers to utilize,what sanctions to seek,plea bargains to strike,or immunities to grant.id.at quotation omitted.because her level of participation did not amount to controlling prosecutorial decisions,any improper involvement on sousa part can not be said to be so fundamental and pervasive that it require s reversal without regard to the facts or circumstances of the particular case.delaware van arsdall,d.
moreover,contrary to webber suggestion,the involvement and participation of sousa is manifestly different than those errors that are considered structural.see,vasquez hillery,d plurality opinion excluding members of defendant race from the grand jury mckaskle wiggins,d denial of at trial waller georgia,d denial of public trial gideon wainwright,d denial of right to counsel payne arkansas,d coerced confession tumey ohio.biased judge.concluding that an error is structural is the exception and not the rule and if the defendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator,there is a strong presumption that any other errors that may have occurred are subject to analysis.rose clark,d.the fact that sousa was present throughout the trial and that any error could be described as or continuous,does not automatically give rise to a structural error outside the bounds of harmless error analysis.in the case before us,webber was tried by an impartial judge and jury,was represented by counsel,and had a full opportunity to present his case.the constitutional error,if any,that resulted from the improper appointment and participation of sousa was,therefore,trial error.
trial error is subject to harmless error analysis.fulminante,at.because,as
