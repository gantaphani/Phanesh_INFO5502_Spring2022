on appeal,the minor contends the gang conditions are not supported by sufficient evidence,unconstitutionally vague and overbroad,and unreasonable.we conclude hearsay evidence was properly admitted at the dispositional phase of this juvenile delinquency case.we conclude further that certain conditions of the minor probation must be modified to include the element of his personal knowledge.
the facts of the marijuana offense are not at issue and need not be set forth in this opinion.the facts supporting the gang conditions will be set forth in the discussion.
discussion 
the minor contends the gang conditions are not supported by competent evidence because the only evidence offered was inadmissible hearsay to which he duly but unsuccessfully objected.we do not agree with the minor.
background 
a contested dispositional hearing was held on the propriety of imposing gang conditions on the minor.the sole evidence presented by the people was the testimony of the probation officer,jamie rodriguez,who relayed statements that had been made to him by another probation officer,charles bell,who had been stationed at the school that the minor had been attending.according to rodriguez,bell told him that the minor had been coming to school wearing red clothing,even after being told that he could not wear red at school.bell further told rodriguez that the minor had been wearing a belt buckle with the letter n,a known symbol of the norte√±o street gang.the minor objected to the admission of this evidence as hearsay but the court overruled the objection,in essence finding that the statements were reliable and therefore admissible at a dispositional hearing.thereafter,the minor testified for the defense and denied wearing clothing.based on this evidence,the court imposed the gang conditions,stating that the evidence was pretty thin,but it enough so i am going to impose the gang conditions.
in juvenile dependency cases it is settled that hearsay evidence,which would be inadmissible at a jurisdiction hearing,may nevertheless be considered at a dispositional hearing.
under section,applicable to jurisdictional hearings,the dependency finding must be based upon legally admissible evidence that is relevant to the circumstances or acts that are alleged to bring the minor within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.thus,a social study is admissible at a jurisdictional hearing only if the preparer is made available for.citations.section permits a social study and attached reports to be admitted where only the preparer of the report itself testified,and not the authors of the attached reports.in re malinda cal d.in re malinda focused on section which pertains specifically to jurisdictional hearings.we have been cited to no judicial interpretation of section,subdivision b,applicable to dispositional hearings,a provision which does not contain the limiting language of section.section,subdivision b states in part,without qualification,the court shall receive in evidence the social study of the child made by the social worker,any study or evaluation made by a child advocate appointed by the court,and other relevant and material evidence as may be offered.where statutory language is clear,there is no room for interpretation.citation.the statutes clearly indicate legislative intent to treat the two phases of dependency proceedings differently.under section,more stringent evidentiary requirements must be met at the jurisdictional hearing where the court initially intervenes and obtains jurisdiction over the child.at the subsequent dispositional phase,any relevant evidence including hearsay shall be admitted pursuant to section,subdivision b to help the court determine the child best interests.considering the express statutory language of sections and,subdivision b,and the california supreme court broad interpretation of section in in re malinda,we see no reason to construe section,subdivision b to require the preparer to testify as a prerequisite to admitting the report.in re corey d.fn.omitted see stats,ch,see in re tasman d.
the statutes governing juvenile delinquency cases are closely analogous.s ection governs the conduct of jurisdictional hearings.that statute provides in relevant part the admission and exclusion of evidence shall be pursuant to the rules of evidence established by the evidence code and by judicial decision.citations.there is no correlative statute making the evidence code generally applicable to a dispositional hearing.rather,section provides after finding that a minor is a person described in section or,the court shall hear evidence on the question of the proper disposition to be made of the minor.the court shall receive in evidence the social study of the minor made by the probation officer and any other relevant and material evidence that may be offered,including any written or oral statement offered by the victim,the parent or guardian of the victim if the victim is a minor,or if the victim has died or is incapacitated,the victim next of kin,as authorized by subdivision b of section.in any judgment and order of disposition,the court shall state that the social study made by the probation officer has been read and considered by the court.citation.in re romeo th,d see stats,ch.
given this parallelism between the statutory schemes governing dependency and delinquency cases,we conclude the reasoning of in re corey,supra,d at pages,applies to the dispositional phase of this delinquency case thus,the minor hearsay objection was properly overruled.as he makes no other challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,we conclude it was sufficient to support the imposition of the gang conditions.
the minor contends gang conditions and are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because they lack an explicit requirement of personal knowledge.the attorney general responds that,as he reads the conditions,they contain an implicit knowledge requirement and need not be modified.the minor has the better argument.
the gang conditions provide in relevant part 
you are not to associate with any known gang member.
you are not to possess,wear or display any clothing or insignias,emblems,badges,or buttons which are evidence of affiliation with or membership in a gang or display any gang signs or gestures,nor be at areas known to be frequented by gang members.see fn,ante.
a probation condition must be sufficiently precise for the probationer to know what is required of him,and for the court to determine whether the condition has been violated,if it is to withstand a challenge on the ground of vagueness.citation.a probation condition that imposes limitations on a person constitutional rights must closely tailor those limitations to the purpose of the condition to avoid being invalidated as unconstitutionally overbroad.citation.in re sheena cal th,d.the vagueness issue may be raised for the first time on appeal.id.at,d.
in people ex rel.gallo acuna cal th,d,acuna,the court acknowledged that a prohibition against associating with any other known gang member might apply to a circumstance in which a defendant was engaged in one of the prohibited activities with someone known to the police but not known to him to be a gang member,and that in such a case,the city would have to establish a defendant own knowledge of his associate gang membership to meet its burden of proving conduct in violation of the injunction.id.at,d,see people lopez th,d people garcia th,d.
acuna applies to juvenile wardship conditions.in re justin th,d see in re sheena,supra,cal th at,d.its reasoning applies equally to association with fellow gang members and to possession of gang clothing and other materials.we shall modify gang conditions and accordingly.
the minor claims gang conditions and are unconstitutionally vague because the word gang is,on its face,uncerta
