jose challenges juvenile court orders dismissing dependency jurisdiction under welfare and institutions code section,finding he committed the misdemeanors of contributing to the delinquency of a minor,simple battery,and obstructing or resisting a peace officer,and declaring him a ward of the court under welfare and institutions code section he argues the juvenile court abused its discretion by treating him as a delinquent instead of preserving his status as a dependent and insufficient evidence was presented that he contributed to the delinquency of a minor.in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we conclude that the court properly treated jose as a delinquent.in the published portion of this opinion,we agree there was insufficient evidence he contributed to the delinquency of a minor.accordingly,we reverse that finding and remand for a further disposition hearing but otherwise affirm the judgment.
factual and proceduralbackground 
jose family has a long history of involvement in the system,and jose became a dependent of the mendocino county juvenile court in.he was eventually placed in a group home in antioch,from which he ran away in september.
the following month,the mendocino county district attorney office filed a wardship petition under section,subdivision a alleging that jose,who had recently turned years old,had committed the misdemeanor of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and the felonies of battery for the benefit of a gang and participation in criminal street gang activity a subsequent wardship petition filed in january alleged an additional misdemeanor count of resisting or obstructing a peace officer 
at the detention hearing,the juvenile court noted that jose was a dependent and ordered the county probation and social services departments to prepare a section report on whether dependency or delinquency jurisdiction was more appropriate.the departments report recommended that the court assume delinquency jurisdiction over jose.after considering the report and the parties arguments,the court found that jose needs would be best served by proceeding in the delinquency court and terminated the dependency proceeding.
at the jurisdiction hearing,the juvenile court heard evidence on the four crimes jose allegedly committed.the first,contributing to the delinquency of a minor,involved,jose girlfriend,who was years old at the time of the hearing in january.steven,father,testified that in,was on probation for associating with gangs,and he was concerned she was violating the terms of her probation by doing various things,including r unning away,drug use,and gang activity.he told that he did not approve of jose because of the lifestyle that he lives or that he involved in.
ran away during that time period,and steven went to jose house in ukiah several times to look for her.the first two times,he did not find her.the third time,he parked in view of the house and sat there and waited to see if there was any movement.he eventually saw jose and walking down the street from the direction of the house.they saw him and ran,and he chased them in his car to a nearby bar.after steven made a couple turns around the bar,jose and both split up,and he went one way and she went the other way.steven was unable to catch his daughter.
the next day,steven and his father went to jose house.steven testified that jose mother told him t hat jose and were there the night before,but she told them to leave.one of jose brothers told steven that might be down the street on laws avenue.steven drove to a group of apartments on that street and saw walking with jose on the back side of the apartments going toward where her friend lives.they looked toward steven,made eye contact with him,and ran.jose jump ed a fence and escaped,but was caught.steven observed that seemed to be on drugs because her eyes were dilated,her mouth was dried,and she seemed very jittery.
the remaining counts alleged battery for the benefit of a gang,participation in criminal street gang activity,and resisting or obstructing a peace officer are not at issue in this appeal,and we do not discuss them in detail.suffice it to say,the prosecution presented evidence in support of the first two counts that in november,jose and three other boys,two of whom were jose brothers,beat up another boy,robert p.a sheriff deputy testified that robert told him jose had yelled south side during the attack,but robert testified that it was another boy,not jose,who did so.in support of the last count,the prosecution presented evidence that jose ran from probation officers and a sheriff deputy in january when they went to his house to check on the same two brothers jose surrendered after he was caught on a staircase at a nearby apartment complex.
the juvenile court granted jose motion to dismiss the count.it also reduced the battery count to a simple misdemeanor battery under penal code by eliminating the allegation that the battery was committed for the benefit of a gang.the court then found true the count and the remaining two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and resisting or obstructing a peace officer.at the disposition hearing,the court declared jose to be a ward of the court and ordered him to attend the bar o boys ranch in del norte county with a maximum commitment term of one year and six months,comprised of one year for contributing to the delinquency of a minor,two months for simple battery,and four months for obstructing or resisting a peace officer.
discussiona.the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion by treating jose as a delinquent instead of a dependent.
jose claims that the juvenile court abused its discretion under section by determining that he should be treated as a delinquent instead of a dependent.we are not persuaded.
the section report submitted by the probation and social services departments stated that the delinquency proceedings were initiated based on the attack on robert and the attempt to evade the probation officers and sheriff deputy jose had been in trouble at least once before in december,he was arrested for vandalism,but he was reprimanded and the case was dismissed.
according to the report,there had been referrals for the investigation of child abuse or neglect associated with jose family dating back to late,when jose was four years old.as a result of these referrals,several cases were opened,the most recent resulting in jose placement in the antioch group home from which he had run away.the report characterized his home environment as inconsistent and unpredictable and stated that such issues contributed to his criminality.it noted that the social services department involvement has been minimal,although jose was receiving various services at the group home and had an individualized education plan to address his educational needs.
the report concluded that jose needs are best met pursuant to s ection at this time,explaining 
jose has struggled to abide by the rules and regulations of his group homes.jose has failed to obey the law and has shown a pattern of delinquent,behavior.jose appears to have issues regarding substance abuse and gangs.jose poses a risk to himself and to the community and appears to be in need of supervision and immediate consequence.jose gang status has increased to a point that child welfare services have been ineffective in addressing his needs or the needs of the family.he has been awol from group home placement since september.during this time relatives knew of his whereabouts but remained voiceless about assisting in his return.meanwhile,his criminal and gang issues exacerbated.
at the section hearing,the juvenile court admitted the report into evidence and heard additional statements from various parties.jose dependency counsel stated that jose told her h e would prefer to be part of the delinquency court because he would have a better opportunity to return to his mother.he understands the rules are stricter and the consequences greater if he not able to follow the rules many of his brothers have been given that opportunity to return to their mom under the system,and he understands the rules.he wants to do that.so
