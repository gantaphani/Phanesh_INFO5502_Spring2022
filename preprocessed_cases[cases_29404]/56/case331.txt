factual and procedural background 
when mary was born in march,she tested positive for amphetamine.mother admitted using diet pills during pregnancy.mary was detained and remained in foster care until she was placed with robert.in july,the juvenile court terminated dependency jurisdiction after robert obtained legal and physical custody of mary.mother was given supervised visitation.
according to mother,however,robert gave mary back to her because there was no stipulation in the custody orders that she do anything to get mary back.in december,robert was arrested for domestic violence after an altercation with mother.during that incident,robert pushed mother against a door causing her to hit her head while she held mary in her arms.
in november,robert was arrested again.in december,the agency filed a petition under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,alleging that the parents were residing together and that mary had been exposed to a violent confrontation between them.undesignated statutory references are to the welfare and institutions code.the court detained mary in care and ordered separate supervised visits for the parents.following the contested jurisdiction and disposition hearing,the court found the allegations in mary modified petition true,placed her in foster care,ordered that the parents comply with their case plans and allowed them to have short,separate,unsupervised visits with mary.
the parents set the review hearing for trial as the recommendation was for continued placement.at the beginning of the contested hearing on october,mary counsel requested the court proceed with the trial,but that it set argument for another date as counsel had not yet been able to speak with mary or check on her with the caregiver.undesignated year references are to.robert sought return of mary and mother requested return or expanded visitation.at the hearing,the social worker subsequently changed her recommendation to placement with robert as he had made substantive progress with his case plan and overnight and unsupervised visits had gone well.the social worker testified,however,that it would be detrimental to return mary to mother care,but indicated a willingness to increase mother visits to four hours unsupervised.
robert moved for a directed verdict,reasoning the agency agreed that mary should be placed with him.explaining that the parents issues were inseparable,the court denied the motion.mary counsel renewed her request for a continuance indicating she had a duty to check with mary as to how she was doing and to review the prospect of mary placement with her parents.the court continued the matter for days.
the social worker filed an addendum report recommending that mary remain in care and that visits be supervised.among other things,robert had been allowing mother to have unauthorized overnight visits with mary and mary caregiver believed that robert aggressive behavior was escalating.the social worker listened to a recorded phone conversation between robert and mother in which robert threatened to go to mother home and get mary even though mother reminded him it was against court orders.he called mother names and escalated to the point where he screamed something inaudible into the phone.the social worker believed that even though robert was engaged in services,he did not appear to be demonstrating or implementing what he was learning or showing that he was changing his behavior in order to protect mary.
at the continued hearing,the agency moved the court to reopen its.the court found good cause existed and granted the agency motion to reopen.it also indicated it was continuing the case to provide the parents with time to respond to the evidence supporting the agency section motion.the court found the agency had met its threshold burden of proof regarding its section motion requesting supervised visits and set the evidentiary hearing to follow the review ruling.
after several continuances,the review hearing concluded in early january.at that hearing,the agency withdrew its section motion and the court received the additional agency reports into evidence.the parents presented no affirmative evidence and did not the social worker.following argument,the court found returning mary to either parent would create a substantial risk of detriment.mary was continued as a dependent in care and placed with the same nonrelative extended family member.the court ordered unsupervised visits for robert in his home only.robert timely appealed.

procedural issues 
at a review hearing,the issue before the court is whether the child should be returned to parental custody,subd.e cal.rules of court,rule d.robert contends the juvenile court erred when it denied his motion for a directed verdict,continued the hearing,and allowed the agency to reopen its.we address each issue in turn.
directed verdict 
robert claims we must reverse the juvenile court ruling denying his motion for a directed verdict under code of civil procedure section because no substantial evidence supported a finding that it would be detrimental to return mary to him.the agency responds that code of civil procedure section does not apply,that section is the appropriate statute and,among other things,it would have been improper to grant the motion because the juvenile court had not yet heard from mary counsel.we agree with the agency.
under code of civil procedure section,u nless the court specified an earlier time,after all parties have completed the presentation of all of their evidence in a trial by jury,any party may,without waiving his or her right to trial by jury in the event the motion is not granted,move for an order directing entry of a verdict in its favor.code civ,subd.a,italics added.we have found no authority applying code of civil procedure section to juvenile dependency matters where a jury is not involved.rather,dependency proceedings are not subject to the code of civil procedure or the civil code unless an express provision in the welfare and institutions code makes them so.in re hadley th.
in the dependency context,section is similar to a motion for judgment in a court trial under code of civil procedure section,and allows the juvenile court to weigh the evidence and consider the credibility of witnesses.in re roberto th.specifically,subdivision c of section provides the following at any hearing in which the probation department bears the burden of proof,after the presentation of evidence on behalf of the probation department and the minor has been closed,the court,on motion of the minor,parent,or guardian,or on its own motion,shall order whatever action the law requires of it if the court,upon weighing all of the evidence then before it,finds that the burden of proof has not been met.in his reply brief,robert concedes that section is the applicable statute.
in a nutshell,robert contends the juvenile court had no choice but to grant his motion for a directed verdict under section because at the time he made the motion,the agency recommended mary return to his custody.this is incorrect.although the agency recommended mary return,it is the duty of the juvenile court to weigh the evidence and consider the credibility of witnesses in ruling on the motion.in re roberto,supra,th at pp.thus,even assuming the trial court erred in denying the motion,we would remand the matter to allow the juvenile court to rule on the motion after weighing the evidence and considering the credibility of witnesses.ibid.dependency matters,however,are fluid in nature and circumstances must be assessed based on the facts that actually exist when the motion is renewed,rather than on the fact
