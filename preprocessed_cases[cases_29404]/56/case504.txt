discussion 
at the conclusion of the contested dispositional hearing,at which defense counsel,the prosecutor and the victim mother all gave impassioned statements,the court made the following remarks 
the court i believe based upon all of the events in this case,based upon the choices that you made and the choices that you have at this point,that you have a different choice as of today.but as of today,the appropriate choice that i have and i believe the only choice i have is to commit you to the department of juvenile justice.i indicate that the maximum term is years,eight months.i indicate 
defense counsel your honor,i believe it years,eight months.
the court years,eight months.
defense counsel and the court has discretion to lower that.
the court i have finished.i misspoke,but i have finished twelve years,eight months.i indicate that at least based upon some discussions,that four years for the principal term is appropriate,the enhancement consecutive,the four,the one year,which is of the consecutive,and the of the five years,for a total of years,eight months.and the issue is,you did have choices,and you made them.and i have choices and i have made them.and i believe mine are appropriate.
however,the commitment order sent to the department of juvenile justice,and the disposition order signed by the court,indicate a maximum term of confinement of years and eight months.in addition,the probation department memorandum signed by the court indicates that years eight months is the maximum term as well as the appropriate discretionary term under sections and.
at a subsequent hearing held on october,defense counsel brought to the court attention the discrepancy between the year eight month maximum term stated in the probation report of september,and the year eight month maximum stated by the court at the disposition hearing.the court replied,no.no.what i indicated was that it was a year eight month maximum.i indicated that if i had to pick a term,because,i believe,on the case law that was given to me,that i believe years eight months was appropriate,but the maximum was eight.
quoting from in re joseph th,d,the minor argues this record shows the juvenile court understood it had the discretion to consider the facts and circumstances of the minor case in setting a period of physical confinement that was less than the maximum adult term but within the sentencing triad described in penal code section,subdivision a,and intended to do so.the court error,according to the minor,was in deciding how to calculate a maximum term of confinement less than the adult term maximum.an adult being sentenced for a second degree robbery can be ordered to serve two,three or five years in prison,subd.a.four years is not one of the choices.the juvenile court had to choose one of the three time periods set forth in paragraph of subdivision a of section of the penal code,subd.c.since the court intended to select the rather than the upper term in calculating maximum term of confinement,the maximum term should be set at ten years and eight months.
the attorney general agrees with the minor that a juvenile court has the discretion to impose an actual term of confinement less than the maximum term imposable on an adult that the juvenile court here understood it had that discretion and that in exercising discretion to impose less than the maximum term,the juvenile court is limited to selecting the lower or middle term statutorily authorized,and may not simple select any term lower than the upper term which is not part of the standard triad 
the attorney general correctly notes that there is a potential conflict in the case law on the last point.see in re joseph,supra,th at,d in re carlos th,d.the attorney general further agrees with the minor that the juvenile court appeared to indicate the appropriate actual physical term should be years months by virtue of a four,not five,year term for the robbery and further muddled the matter with its comments at the october,hearing.the attorney general suggests that if this court should deem the actual physical term of confinement unclear,it should remand the matter to the juvenile court for clarification,since an year month sentence would be unauthorized and the juvenile court should have the opportunity to decide whether years eight months would be an appropriate discretionary term.
we agree with the parties that the record before us strongly suggests that the court understood its discretion to set the minor maximum term of confinement at something less than the maximum term that could be imposed on a similarly situated adult,pursuant to section,subdivision c we also agree with the parties that the record is muddled in that it also appears the court would have imposed a term of years months as the appropriate maximum term,but for its belief that imposition of such a term would be unlawful,as the court was apparently under the the parties it had no discretion to choose a term other than one of the determinate sentencing law dsl triadic terms for the offense at issue.
we do not agree that the court discretion to set a term of physical confinement for the minor at less than the maximum imposable term is limited to one of the three terms for a given offense set by penal code section.we discern no legislative intent to so restrict the juvenile court power.in the first place,the juvenile court law is an indeterminate disposition scheme.the juvenile court does not determine the minor release date or the actual term of confinement.those functions reside with the youth authority board now board of parole hearings created by senate bill.stats,ch,amending.while the court now decides the outer limits of the ward indeterminate period of confinement,the administrative board still determines the ward actual length of stay.in our view,the wholesale importation of the dsl triadic sentencing scheme into the juvenile court law would be inconsistent with its indeterminate sentencing structure,at least absent some legislative direction.
however,the amendment to section,subdivision c contains no such direction.the language of the amendment does not even reference the dsl or penal code sections,or a triadic sentencing structure.on the contrary,the statute ties the court exercise of discretion to the facts and circumstances of the matter or matters which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,strongly suggesting that the court should endeavor to tailor the disposition to the offender and the offense,rather than attempt to shoehorn the punishment into a sentencing scheme,subd.c.our view is supported by the extant legislative materials.the report for the senate committee on public safety dated march,states this bill would authorize the court to additionally set maximum terms of physical confinement in the cya based upon the facts and circumstances of the matter or matters which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.this new provision would provide for court consideration of factors about the offenses and the offender history which would be comparable to those employed now for the triad sentencing of adults,and have those considerations reflected in the cya confinement term ordered by the court.com.on public safety,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,pp,italics added.by providing for court consideration of factors that inform the court sentencing choices under the dsl triadic scheme,rather than consideration of the triadic scheme itself,we think the report supports our view that the court discretion is not unfettered but rather is circumscribed by the rules of court,and perhaps by the types of materials listed in penal code section,subdivision b,probation reports,victim impact statements.but we find nothing in the legislative history to suggest that the juvenile court new discretion was intended to be limited to selection of one of the three terms provided by the penal code for a particular offense.
nor do we find that section,subdivision c compels a different reading of section,subdivision c.we see no conflict between those two sections.consistent with the equal protection principles it was designed to implement,section sets the outermost limit of a ward physical confinement at the maximum term of imprisonment that could be imposed on an adult.it defines the maximum term of imprisonment as the upper term calculated pursuant to penal code section.it permits the court to increase the overall maximum term of imprisonment by aggregating the period of physical confinement on multiple counts or multiple petitions,including previously sustained petitions,and it defines physical confinement as placement in a juvenile hall,ranch,camp,forestry camp or secure juvenile home or in any institution operated by the youth authority,subd.c.nothing in section,subdivision c affects these provisions.section,subdivision c simply adds that the court may set the maximum term of physical confinement in the djf at less than the overall maximum term of imprisonment set by section.the two provisions complement each other.
our reasoning is in accord with the views expressed in in re carlos in which the court of appeal concluded that section,subdivision c grants the juvenile court the discretion to choose any appropriate term less than the maximum term imposable on an adult charged with the same offense,based on the facts and circumstances of the matter.that court observed there is nothing in the legislation or its history to suggest the legislature sought to make sweeping changes in the commitment of a minor to djf from an indeterminate term to a determinate term,nor is there any provision that the legislature is restricting the juvenile court to the adult sentencing triad.proof the juvenile court decision is not tied directly to the adult system is found in the language utilized the juvenile court is to consider the facts and circumstances of the matter,rather than being restricted solely to the aggravating or mitigating circumstance scheme for adults.the juvenile court determination must be tied to the purposes of the juvenile system,which include the protection of the public as well as the rehabilitation of the minor.under the changes to section,the juvenile court must determine the maximum period of confinement to djf based on the facts and circumstances,this maximum may not be more than that for a comparable adult,but may be less.the maximum period of confinement set by the court is not a determinate term,it is the ceiling on the amount of time that a minor may be confined in djf,and recognizes that the committing court has an interest in and particularized knowledge of the minors it commits to djf.the youth authority board retains the power,subject to the applicable rules and regulations,to determine the actual length of confinement at or below the ceiling set by the juvenile court and to determine the conditions of the minor confinement.thus,the indeterminate nature of the system remains in accordance with the distinct purposes of the juvenile system.in re carlos,supra,th at,d see also in re christian th,d rejecting claim of cunningham california,d error.
we recognize that the court of appeal in joseph concluded that t he amendment to section,subdivision b now c,was intended to afford the juvenile court the
