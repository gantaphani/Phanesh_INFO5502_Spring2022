in this consolidated writ proceeding dante dante and timothy timothy seek review of the denial of their petitions for writ of mandate and requests for stay of juvenile delinquency proceedings in the juvenile court.welf.they ask that we overrule the court rejection of their claims of incompetency to stand trial under former california rules of court,rule d hereafter rule d we issued an order to show cause pursuant to the order of the supreme court.
rule d requires the juvenile court to stay the proceedings and conduct a hearing regarding the minor competency to stand trial if the court finds a reason to doubt that the minor who is the subject of a petition filed under section of the welfare and institutions code petition is capable of understanding the proceedings or of cooperating with the child attorney it directs that i f the court finds that the child is not capable of understanding the proceedings or of cooperating with the attorney,the court shall proceed under welfare and institutions code section and sections a c of this rule.sections a through c provide procedures upon a finding the child is mentally ill,mentally disabled,or mentally disordered.
the juvenile court in both cases ruled that to be found incompetent under rule d,the minor must have a mental disorder or developmental disability and here both minors based their claim of incompetency on their developmental immaturity.
as we shall explain,we construe rule d consistent with the constitutional test of competency stated in dusky united states,d dusky and hold that the rule does not require that a minor have a mental disorder or development disability before the juvenile court may hold a hearing to determine whether,or find after holding a hearing that,the minor is incompetent to stand trial.
we therefore shall issue peremptory writs of mandate directing the juvenile court to vacate its prior rulings and reconsider the minors claims in light of our holding.
factual and procedural background 
on june,dante and two other minors broke windows at the woodbridge elementary school and took food items from the gymnasium.dante and the other two minors confessed at the scene.an original petition was filed alleging that dante committed one count of second degree burglary.at the arraignment on december,the court declared a doubt as to dante competency,appointed a psychologist pursuant to rule d,and ordered dante to submit to a psychological evaluation.
the court appointed psychologist lisa boal perrine,perrine,who interviewed dante and filed a report concluding that he was incompetent to stand trial and was not likely to achieve competence for a year or more.according to perrine,dante,who was years old at the time of the interview lived with his parents and two siblings,was enrolled in the sixth grade and had never been enrolled in special education classes.although there was some confusion concerning dante grades,which may have deteriorated somewhat,he generally received grades of a and b.in addition,he had no known criminal history or any mental health or behavioral problems.
when perrine asked dante if he understood the court proceedings,he replied,no although he said he knew he had been charged with burglary which he thought was a misdemeanor and knew that a felony is more serious than a misdemeanor.he said in order to commit a burglary,someone would have to break in somewhere.he believed that not guilty meant the person is not accountable for what the people think they did and guilty means the person being accused did something and will have to suffer the consequences.if a person is found not guilty they go free,if the person is found guilty as charged,the possible sentence would be community service which he would serve at his church.dante thought probation meant you have to ask the probation officer to do stuff like play football.
with the exception of witnesses,dante did not understand the functions of the court participants and thought his chances of being found not guilty were zero out of.he did not know what plea he planned on entering,nor did he know what rights he would have to give up in order to get a plea bargain.dante told perrine that he had an attorney,that he had confidence in his attorney,and he thought he could help his attorney by trusting in him.he did not know what he should do if he disagreed with his attorney.dante stated that he remembered everything that happened,would be expected to tell his attorney everything he knows and remembers,and expected no difficulty doing so.
perrine report indicates that dante would defer to his parents or his attorney to make decisions regarding his case,that if he disagreed with them,he would not be able to stand up for himself,and that he is not able to appreciate the long term effects of his decisions.perrine also found that dante was currently experiencing a mental adjustment disorder,which included depressive symptoms manifested in behavioral problems,impaired abilities,difficulties managing his emotions,and limited ability to think clearly.
at the contested hearing,the juvenile court received into evidence the written competency evaluations of perrine and daniel edwards,who had been retained by defense counsel.the court also heard their testimony.perrine testimony was consistent with her report.she opined that dante did not have the ability to effectively work with his attorney to prepare this case because as a result of his age,he had not reached the developmental stage where he can process information,make sense of it,and develop a preferred strategy.
edwards,a clinical and forensic neuropsychologist,reported that dante is,which he classified as average.edwards found dante was performing in the normal range for his age with no psychological problems or personality disorders.as an,dante had little or no concept of the future,so the idea of prolonged punishment or supervision had no meaning to him and because he had not yet developed a desire to be independent of his parents,the impositions of physical restrictions would not have the same meaning and effect on him as it would have on an adult.dante was also unable to explain what a trial is or what his rights are.edwards concluded that these abstract concepts are still beyond his appreciation developmentally and opined that dante competency to stand trial is limited by his developmental level 
edwards explained that the brain of a young child has mildly developed frontal lobes.as the person reaches puberty around the ages of,and,the myelination process takes place in the frontal lobes and the individual begins to develop the ability to think logically,abstractly,and to have a sense of the future.dante developmental level limited his ability to think in those terms.edwards concluded that dante was incompetent to stand trial because he was unable to understand the issues,including the role of the courtroom participants,and the nature of the punishment.
the juvenile court found dante had failed to meet his burden of proof,which in the court view,required that dante establish by a preponderance of evidence that he suffers from a mental disorder or developmental disability that impairs his ability to understand the nature of the delinquency proceedings or to assist or cooperate with counsel with his defense in a rational manner.the court found unpersuasive the opinions of both experts.perrine opinion was based on an unsubstantiated adjustment disorder and on dante developmental immaturity while edwards opinion was based on dante age,his lack of maturity,and his ability to think in abstract terms.
on may,dante filed a petition for writ of mandate and a request for immediate stay of the juvenile proceedings.this court denied the petition on june.however,on june,dante filed a petition for review in the california supreme court,which granted the petition,issued a stay of the juvenile proceedings,and transferred the matter back to this court,with directions to vacate our order denying mandate and to issue an alternative writ.we complied with the order by issuing an alternative writ of mandate on august.
on may,an amended original petition was filed alleging that timothy,age,had entered fern bacon elementary school after being suspended from the school,and stole personal property from the premises,subd.a.the court placed timothy on informal probation,which was extended when he failed to complete the specified terms and conditions.a subsequent petition was filed on february,alleging that timothy possessed a knife with a blade on school grounds,subd.a.
on march,timothy counsel requested that the juvenile court declare a doubt as to the minor competency to stand trial.rule d.counsel informed the court that timothy had just turned,that when counsel asked him what a trial was or what its purpose was,timothy responded w hen you do something bad.i do know.counsel then advised the court that neither he nor timothy mother believed the minor understood or knew the gravity of his situation,the potential consequences of his acts,or what probation is.timothy had an individualized education program iep was in special education classes,and read a couple of grade levels below normal for his age.when the court asked whether timothy had a mental disorder or developmental disability,timothy mother advised the court that timothy had obedience defiant disorder odd and attention deficit disorder add.the court also had before it a probation report,which indicated that timothy had been diagnosed with disorder adhd the court subsequently denied the request.
counsel renewed his request on may,proffering recent school records,which indicated that timothy had a learning disability related to attention,visual processing,and cognitive abilities.the records also showed he was not participating in any curriculum or academic classes because of significant learning delays due to his disabilities.the court again denied the request on the grounds timothy did not have a mental disorder and that an attention problem was not a mental disability.
on june,timothy filed a petition for writ of mandate and request for stay of the juvenile proceedings.we granted the stay on june and issued an alternative writ of mandate on july.
discussion 
both dante and timothy contend the juvenile court erred in denying their requests for a determination of incompetency because in both cases the court ruling was based on the ground that neither minor had a mental disorder or developmental disability.the minors argue that under rule d,there is no need to find a mental disorder or developmental disability and that a minor may be found incompetent on the basis of developmental immaturity alone.
rule d requires the juvenile court to stay the proceedings and conduct a hearing into the child competency if the court finds there is reason to doubt that the child who is the subject of a petition filed under section or is capable of understanding the proceedings or of cooperating with the child attorney as noted,it directs that i f the court finds that the child is not capable of understanding the proceedings or of cooperating with the attorney,the court shall proceed under welfare and institutions code section and sections a c of this rule.sections a through c provide procedures upon a finding the child is mentally ill,mentally disabled,or mentally disordered.
the attorney general representing real party in interest in both cases fails to address the legal question raised by the minors.instead,he argues in his answer to dante petition that dante failed to meet his burden of proof and that the juvenile court was within its discretion when it found the experts opinions unpersuasive.the attorney general further contends that penal code section provides the appropriate procedure for raising dante incompetency claim.
in his informal response to timothy petition,the attorney general argues that a petition for writ of mandate is not the appropriate vehicle to challenge the juvenile court decision because mandate is not available to compel a discretionary act and that timothy has failed to show the court acted beyond its jurisdiction or abused its discretion.
we agree with the minors and hold that rule d does not require that a minor have a mental disorder or developmental disability before a hearing may be held or a finding made of incompetency.
it is well established that the criminal trial of an incompetent defendant violates the due process clause of the state and federal constitutions.medina california,d,pate robinson,d,people jenkins cal th,d.because this principle is fundamental to our adversary system of justice drope missouri,d,the high court has held that failure to employ procedures to protect against the trial of an incompetent defendant is a deprivation of due process.pate robinson,supra,at.at,d at drope missouri,supra,at.at,d at.
the standard for determining a defendant competency to stand trial was set forth in dusky,supra,at page.at,d at.under that standard,the inquiry is whether the defendant has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.ibid.
subsequent to dusky,the high court extended the rights of due process to juvenile delinquency proceedings in re gault,d,including the right to the effective assistance of counsel.kent united states,d.
to preserve those rights,the court in james superior court d.james held that a minor has the right to a competency hearing in a delinquency proceeding.id.at.the court found that in the absence of any statutory procedure,the juvenile court has the inherent power to determine a minor mental competence to understand the nature of the proceedings pending under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b and to assist counsel in a rational manner at that hearing.id.at.
fashioning a procedure to make that determination,the court in james instructed that if the juvenile court entertains a reasonable doubt as to the minor competency,it should suspend proceedings and conduct a hearing into the question of the minor present competence.the court further advised that the juvenile court may borrow from penal code section and use as a yardstick the definition of incompetency set forth in that section o r the court may be guided by the statement of the united states supreme court in dusky,supra,james,supra,d at,italics added.
rule was adopted in to conform to james see advisory com,pt.west ann.court rules foll.rule.consistent with that decision,rule d requires the juvenile court to stay the proceedings and conduct a hearing into the child competency if the court finds there is reason to doubt that the child who is the subject of a petition filed under section or is capable of understanding the proceedings or of cooperating with the child attorney 
the question before us is whether a mental disorder or developmental disability is an elemental requirement under rule d.when construing the california rules of court,we apply the usual principles of statutory construction,looking first to the words of the rule to determine the drafters intent and when the language of the rule is clear and unambiguous,we need not probe the rule drafting history.crespin shewry th,d.however,as with a statute,where reasonably possible,we must construe rule d to avoid doubts as to its constitutionality.in re howard cal th,d,people smith cal d.
the test stated in rule d,whether the child is capable of understanding the proceedings or of cooperating with the child attorney,is similar to,albeit an abbreviated version of,the dusky test,and like dusky,the test itself makes no mention of a mental disorder or developmental disability.
however,rule d directs that i f the court finds that the child is not capable of understanding the proceedings or of cooperating with the attorney,the court shall proceed under welfare and institutions code section and sections a c of this rule.sections a through c provide procedures upon a finding the child is mentally ill,mentally disabled,or mentally disordered.there is no specific provision for a child found to be developmentally immature.
welfare and institutions code section,on the other hand,makes no mention of a mental disorder or developmental disability.rather,it uses the terms mental health or the
