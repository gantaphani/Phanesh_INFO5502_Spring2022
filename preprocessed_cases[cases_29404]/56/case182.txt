when a minor is charged with certain serious criminal offenses,the prosecutor can file the charges against the minor directly in the criminal division of the superior court criminal court.see welf,subd.b,subd.d.if the minor is convicted,the criminal court has discretion under penal code section,subdivision a,to order a juvenile disposition under the juvenile court law,in lieu of a sentence under the penal code but only if the prosecutor consents to that disposition.
we agree with the court of appeal that the prosecutorial consent provision is invalid because it violates california separation of powers doctrine cal,art.iii.but we further conclude that contrary to the court of appeal view,the trial court discretionary authority under penal code section,subdivision a,to commit a minor to the youth authority applies only when the minor meets the eligibility requirements of welfare and institutions code section.because defendant here admitted committing robbery and personally using a firearm in the commission of that felony,his sentence,when added to his age,exceeds makes him ineligible for youth authority commitment under subdivision a of section.we therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeal and direct that court to affirm the judgment and sentence of the trial court.
on march,defendant,then years old,entered a market wearing a black bandana over his face and holding a handgun.he pointed the gun at the store clerk and demanded money.another clerk grabbed defendant hand and a struggle ensued during which the gun discharged.a third clerk subdued defendant by hitting him over the head with a bottle.the clerks held defendant at gunpoint until the police arrived.
the district attorney brought charges in criminal court,as authorized by welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d personal use of a firearm.he charged defendant with three counts of second degree robbery,one count of assault with a firearm,subd.a,and enhancements for personal use of a firearm,subds.b and c,subd.a.
on december,defendant entered a negotiated plea of guilty to one count of robbery and admitted use of a firearm in violation of penal code section.under the plea agreement,defendant would not be sentenced to more than years in prison.
defendant asserted that under penal code section the criminal court had discretion to order him committed to the youth authority,a less restrictive confinement than state prison.section,subdivision a,states in relevant part subject to the knowing and intelligent consent of both the prosecution and the person being sentenced pursuant to this section,the court may order a juvenile disposition under the juvenile court law,in lieu of a sentence under this code,upon a finding that such an order would serve the best interests of justice,protection of the community,and the person being sentenced.italics added.
when defendant here asked the criminal court for a disposition under the juvenile court law,the prosecution objected.under the italicized language in penal code section just quoted,that objection barred the trial court from considering a juvenile disposition.defendant argued to the trial court that the requirement for prosecutorial consent violated the separation of powers provision of the california constitution.see cal,art.iii.the trial court,however,ruled that under welfare and institutions code section it had no authority to impose a juvenile disposition in defendant case.
the court of appeal affirmed the conviction,but it struck the prison sentence and remanded the case for the trial court to exercise its discretion whether to order a juvenile disposition.we granted the attorney general petition for review and returned the matter to the court of appeal with directions to vacate its decision and to reconsider it in light of penal code section,which limits the criminal court discretion to order a youth authority commitment when a minor is found to have personally used a firearm in violation of penal code section.thereafter,the court of appeal held the provision in penal code section,subdivision a,requiring the prosecutor consent to a juvenile court disposition in a case filed directly in criminal court violates the separation of powers provision cal,art.iii,and welfare and institutions code section has been impliedly repealed by the enactment of welfare and institutions code section,and hence does not limit a trial court discretion to transfer a case to juvenile court under penal code section,subdivision a.
we granted the attorney general petition for review of the latter issue.we later asked the parties to brief also the issue of the constitutionality of the prosecutorial consent provision in penal code section.
in a supplemental brief filed with this court,the attorney general concedes that the prosecutorial consent provision of penal code section,subdivision a,is unconstitutional.we accept the attorney general concession,which,as discussed below,finds support in the decisions of this court 
in people tenorio cal d,tenorio,we held that a statute requiring a trial court to secure a prosecutor consent to dismiss an allegation of a prior conviction violates the state constitution separation of powers clause by improperly invading the constitutional province of the judiciary.we said when the decision to prosecute has been made,the process which leads to acquittal or to sentencing is fundamentally judicial in nature.just as the fact of prosecutorial discretion prior to charging a criminal offense does not imply prosecutorial discretion to convict without a judicial determination of guilt,discretion to forgo prosecution does not imply discretion to sentence without a judicial determination of those factors which the legislature has never denied are within the judicial power to determine and which relate to punishment.the judicial power is compromised when a judge,who believes that a charge should be dismissed in the interests of justice,wishes to exercise the power to dismiss but finds that before he may do so he must bargain with the prosecutor.the judicial power must be independent,and a judge should never be required to pay for its exercise.id.at.
in the years after tenorio,we have applied its rationale to several analogous situations.in esteybar municipal court cal d,this court held that a statute requiring a magistrate to secure a prosecutor consent to determine that an offense is a misdemeanor rather than a felony violates the separation of powers doctrine see,subd.b.we said since the exercise of a judicial power may not be conditioned upon the approval of either the executive or legislative branches of government,requiring the district attorney consent in determining the charge on which a defendant shall be held to answer violates the doctrine of separation of powers.esteybar municipal court,supra,at.
the next year,in people navarro cal d,we held that requiring a trial court to obtain a prosecutor consent to order a posttrial commitment to a narcotic detention,treatment,and rehabilitation facility violates the separation of powers doctrine the imposition of sentence and the exercise of sentencing discretion are fundamentally and inherently judicial functions.citation.it bears reiteration that the legislature,of course,by general laws can control eligibility for probation,parole and the term of imprisonment,but it can not abort the judicial process by subjecting a judge to the control of the district attorney.id.at,fns.omitted,quoting people sidener cal d,dis.opn.of schauer.
then,in people superior court on tai ho cal d,we held that a statute requiring a court to get a prosecutor consent to order pretrial diversion to a narcotic treatment and rehabilitation program violates the separation of powers doctrine w hen the jurisdiction of a court has been properly invoked by the filing of a criminal charge,the disposition of that charge becomes a judicial responsibility with the development of more sophisticated responses to the wide range of antisocial behavior traditionally subsumed under the heading of crime,alternative means of disposition have been confided to the judiciary.id.at.
thereafter,in davis municipal court cal d
