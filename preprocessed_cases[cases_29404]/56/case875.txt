each of these cases presents two issues.the first issue is whether a prior juvenile adjudication of robbery,constitutes a strike offense within the meaning of the three strikes law,subds.b i,in cases where the prior adjudication occurred before robbery was added to the list of offenses in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b by the passage of proposition on march,but the current offense was committed after that date.the second issue is whether any prior juvenile adjudication may constitutionally be used as a strike in light of the fact that there is no right to a jury trial in juvenile proceedings.
in each case,the trial court determined that the defendants prior juvenile adjudications for robbery did not qualify as strikes because robbery was not included in the list of offenses in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b at the time of the defendant prior juvenile adjudication.the trial courts therefore dismissed the strike allegations on that basis and did not reach the second issue,whether the use of a prior juvenile adjudication as a strike is constitutional.
we conclude that a prior juvenile adjudication of robbery does constitute a strike in cases where the current offense was committed after the passage of proposition.we further conclude that a prior juvenile adjudication may constitutionally be used as a strike even though there is no right to a jury trial in juvenile proceedings.we will therefore grant the people petitions for writs of mandate,with the exception of case no.andrades,which we will deny as moot in light of our issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate in case no.andrades.
background 
the facts underlying the charged and prior offenses of each case are not relevant to the issues presented by the instant writ petitions.we briefly summarize the procedural history of each case.
case nos.and andrades 
defendant and real party in interest dalon tariz andrades was charged,by indictment,with attempted murder,subd.a,assault with a deadly weapon,subd.a and possession for sale of cocaine base health.these offenses were alleged to have occurred on november,october,and december,respectively.the indictment alleged that andrades had suffered a prior juvenile adjudication for robbery,which qualified as a strike.
on june,andrades pled guilty to possession for sale of cocaine base.on november,the trial court dismissed the allegation that andrades had suffered a prior strike,finding that his prior juvenile adjudication of robbery was not a strike under section,subdivision d,because robbery was not listed in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b at the time of the prior juvenile adjudication.
on december,the people filed a notice of appeal,and on january,the people filed their first petition for writ of mandate case no.at sentencing on january,the trial court placed andrades on probation for two years with one year in county jail.the following day,january,the people filed a second petition for writ of mandate case no.
case no.beavers 
defendant and real party in interest charles edward beavers was charged,by information,with transportation or sale of cocaine base health,subd.a.that offense was alleged to have occurred on or about may.the information alleged that beavers prior juvenile adjudication for robbery qualified as a strike.
on september,beavers pled guilty to transportation or sale of cocaine base.on the same date,the trial court dismissed the allegation that beavers had suffered a prior strike,finding that his prior juvenile adjudication of robbery was not a strike under section,subdivision d,because robbery was not listed in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b at the time of the prior juvenile adjudication 
at sentencing on december,the trial court denied the people request for reconsideration of its ruling and imposed a prison term.on january,the people filed a notice of appeal,and on january,the people filed a petition for writ of mandate.
case no.fisher 
defendant and real party in interest patrick fisher was charged,by information,with assault with a deadly weapon,subd.a,attempting to dissuade a witness,subd.b,criminal threats,exhibiting a deadly weapon,subd.a felony vandalism,subds.a b,and driving under the influence of alcohol.these offenses were alleged to have occurred on or about may and.the information alleged that fisher prior juvenile adjudication for robbery qualified as a strike.
on november,fisher pled guilty to assault with a deadly weapon,exhibiting a deadly weapon,and felony vandalism.on december,the trial court found true the allegation that fisher did suffer a prior conviction within the provisions of the strike law,but dismissed the allegation as a matter of law,finding that fisher prior juvenile adjudication for robbery does not legally qualify under the law.
a sentencing hearing was set for january,but the materials submitted in support of the petition for writ of mandate do not indicate what happened at that hearing.the people filed a notice of appeal on january,and on february,the people filed a petition for writ of mandate.
orders to show cause and stays 
by an order issued on april,we agreed to consider the four writ petitions together for purposes of oral argument and decision and issued orders to show cause in each case.on that same date,we issued stays in the related appeals people andrades,people beavers,and people fisher.
ii.discussion 
availability of writ relief 
the people contend that writ relief is available because section may not provide them with an appellate remedy.the people cite people samples th,d,where the appellate court held that the people have no right to appeal from an order finding a prior conviction allegation not true.review was granted in samples on february.defendants do not contend that writ relief is unavailable.
juvenile adjudications for robbery 
welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b 
in general,a minor who commits a criminal offense is presumed fit for treatment under the juvenile court law.welf,subd.a see manduley superior court cal th,d.however,upon the motion of the prosecutor and after an investigation and report by a probation officer,the juvenile court may find that the minor would not be amenable to the care,treatment,and training program available through the facilities of the juvenile court,subd.a.
the commission of an offense listed in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b by a juvenile aged or over raises a presumption of unfitness for treatment under the juvenile court law.see welf,subd.c.the presumption of unfitness may be rebutted upon the juvenile court evaluation of each of the following criteria the degree of criminal sophistication exhibited by the minor.whether the minor can be rehabilitated prior to the expiration of the juvenile court jurisdiction.the minor previous delinquent history.success of previous attempts by the juvenile court to rehabilitate the minor.the circumstances and gravity of the offenses alleged in the petition to have been committed by the minor.welf,subd.c.
proposition 
at the march,primary election,california voters approved proposition,the gang violence and juvenile crime prevention act of,which became effective on march.proposition effected numerous changes in laws relating to criminal street gangs and the procedures relating to juvenile offenders.proposition also enacted changes to the list of violent felonies in section,subdivision c,the list of serious felonies in section,subdivision c,and the list of offenses in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b.
as relevant to the instant case,proposition added the crime of robbery to the list of offenses in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,replacing the formerly listed offense of robbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon.
three strikes law 
california three strikes law was enacted in,subds.b i urgency legislation effective march,see also,voter initiative approved.the three strikes law specifies four requirements for using a prior juvenile adjudication as a strike.section,subdivision d provides a prior juvenile adjudication shall constitute a prior felony conviction for purposes of sentence enhancement if 
a the juvenile was years of age or older at the time he or she committed the prior offense.
b the prior offense is listed in subdivision b of section of the welfare and institutions code or described in paragraph any one of the serious or violent felonies listed in section,subdivision c and section,subdivision c or paragraph a conviction in another jurisdiction for an offense that includes all the elements of one of the serious or violent felonies listed in section,subdivision c and section,subdivision c.
c the juvenile was found to be a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law.
d the juvenile was adjudged a ward of the juvenile court within the meaning of section of the welfare and institutions code because the person committed an offense listed in subdivision b of section of the welfare and institutions code.
for convenience,we will sometimes refer to the four paragraphs of section,subdivision d simply as paragraphs a,b,c,and d.
the issue in each of the instant cases is whether the requirement of section,subdivision d d was met.each defendant contends that he was not adjudged a ward of the juvenile court because he committed an offense listed in subdivision b of section of the welfare and institutions code,subd.d d.
in each of the instant cases,the strike allegation is a prior juvenile adjudication of robbery.at the time of each prior juvenile adjudication,robbery was not listed in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b.robbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon was one of the listed offenses see former welf,subd.b,but the parties agree that there is no evidence to show that any of the robberies were committed while the defendants were armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon 
with the enactment of proposition on march,robbery was added to the list of offenses in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,replacing robbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon.welf,subd.b.thus,at the time each of the defendants committed his current offense or offenses,robbery was an offense listed in subdivision b of section of the welfare and institutions code,subd.d d.
in each of the cases before us,the trial courts found that paragraph d requires that a juvenile have been adjudged a ward of the juvenile court within the meaning of section of the welfare and institutions code,subd.d d by virtue of commission of an offense that was listed in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b at the time of that previous juvenile adjudication.
the people assert that paragraph d reference to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b is to the version of that statute.in other words,the question whether a juvenile committed an offense listed in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b depends on whether or not the prior offense was listed at the time of the current offense.
the people point out that,as part of proposition,the electorate enacted section,which provides notwithstanding subdivision h of section,for all offenses committed on or after the effective date of this act,all references to existing statutes in subdivisions c to g,inclusive,of section,are to those statutes as they existed on the effective date of this act,including amendments made to those statutes by this act.see also.
in people bowden th,d bowden review denied,the court agreed with the people argument.the bowden court concluded that a prior juvenile adjudication for robbery suffered prior to the passage of proposition qualifies as a strike if the current offense was committed after the passage of proposition.that court explained because the march,initiative measure both changed the cutoff date in the three strikes law and changed welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b to include simple robbery,and the present crimes were committed after the march,amendments,the prosecution proof that the defendant suffered a prior juvenile adjudication of simple robbery is sufficient to prove the strike.bowden,supra,th at,d.
the bowden court cited people james th,d james as authority for its conclusion.in james,the defendant had prior convictions of assault with a firearm,subd.a and shooting at an inhabited dwelling house or motor vehicle.the prior offenses had occurred in and the convictions were obtained in.prior to the passage of proposition,those offenses constituted serious felonies under section,subdivision c only if the defendant had personally used a firearm or had personally inflicted great bodily injury.proposition added both offenses to section,subdivision c.the james court held that because the defendant current offense was committed after the passage of proposition,the prior convictions qualified as strikes.the court explained penal code sections and require that,if the current offense was committed on or after march,a determination whether a prior conviction alleged as a serious felony is a prior strike must be based on whether the prior offense resulting in that conviction was a serious felony within the meaning of the three strikes law on march,the effective date of proposition.id.at,d.
defendants criticize bowden reliance on james,pointing out that james involved an adult prior conviction rather than a juvenile prior conviction,and that james did not involve interpretation of paragraph d.defendants also contend bowden is inconsistent with people garcia cal th,d,garcia.they claim that garcia interpreted paragraph d as requiring that there was a presumption of unfitness at the time of the prior juvenile proceeding.
in garcia,the court considered whether the defendant prior juvenile adjudication for residential burglary,qualified as a strike.residential burglary was listed as a serious offense in section,subdivision c but was not listed in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b.therefore,the defendant prior juvenile adjudication met the requirement of paragraph b that t he prior offense is listed in subdivision b of section of the welfare and institutions code or described in paragraph or as a serious or violent felony italics added but it did not meet the requirement of paragraph d that t he juvenile was adjudged a ward of the juvenile court within the meaning of section of the welfare and institutions code because the person committed an offense listed in subdivision b of section of the welfare and institutions code.
in garcia,the trial court and court of appeal concluded that drafting error accounted for the discrepancy between paragraphs b and d.the lower courts concluded that,like paragraph b,paragraph d should have included a reference to the lists of serious and violent felonies in sections,subdivision c and,subdivision c.the garcia court disagreed with the lower courts and instead adopt ed an interpretation that harmonizes paragraphs b and d,without doing violence to the language or spirit of section,subdivision d.garcia,supra,cal th at,d.the court explained in brief,we interpret paragraph b as setting out the list of prior juvenile offenses that will qualify as strikes and paragraph d as requiring,in addition,that in the prior juvenile proceeding giving rise to the qualifying adjudication the juvenile have been adjudged a ward of the court because of a welfare and institutions code section b offense,whether or not that offense is the same as the offense currently alleged as a strike.garcia,supra,cal th at,d.
the garcia court noted the differences between paragraph b and paragraph d by their terms,then,paragraph b sets out the list of qualifying priors,and paragraph d provides that those priors may be counted as strikes so long as the record of the prior juvenile proceeding shows that the adjudication of wardship was premised at least in part upon an offense listed in welfare and institutions code section b.garcia,supra,cal th at,d.
the garcia court explained why the language of paragraph d could not be attributed to drafting error since the legislature,the initiative drafters and the voters have enacted a scheme that includes an explicit requirement,for juvenile adjudications,that the juvenile was at the same time adjudged a ward because of a welfare and institutions code section b offense,we must presume the legislature,the drafters and the voters did not regard that circumstance as a fortuity.had they thought the requirement of a welfare and institutions code section b offense unimportant or anomalous to the purposes of the three strikes law,they would presumably have omitted any reference at all to that section.as written,the requirement of paragraph d may be seen as serving the purpose of ensuring that the crimes adjudicated in the prior proceeding included at least one offense so serious as to raise a presumption of unfitness for treatment in the juvenile court system.garcia,supra,cal th at,d.
defendants argue that paragraph d,as interpreted by garcia,requires that there was a presumption of unfitness at the time of the prior juvenile proceeding.defendants claim that this requirement of paragraph d was not changed by the enactment of section.they argue that section applies only to paragraph b,which lists the offenses that qualify as strikes,and does not apply to the additional requirement of paragraph d that the adjudication of wardship was premised at least in part upon an offense listed in welfare and institutions code section b.garcia,supra,cal th at,d.
importantly,garcia was decided in,before the passage of proposition and the enactment of section.the garcia court did not have occasion to consider whether the requirement of paragraph d that the prior juvenile adjudication include a welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b met if the offense in question was added to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b after the adjudication occurred.therefore,garcia does not resolve the issue presented here.
in interpreting section,we apply the following rules of statutory construction.absent ambiguity,we presume that the voters intend the meaning apparent on the face of an initiative measure citation and the court may not add to the statute or rewrite it to conform to an assumed intent that is not apparent in its language.citation.of course,in construing the statute,t he words must be read in context,considering the nature and purpose of the statutory enactment.citation.people ex rel.lungren superior court cal th,d.
on its face,section applies to all references to existing statutes in subdivisions c to g,inclusive,of section.nothing in the language of section limits its application or excepts paragraph d reference to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b.there is no ambiguity in section it applies to all references to existing statutes in subdivisions c to g,inclusive.this clearly includes paragraph d.
in addition to garcia,defendants rely on in re jensen th,d jensen.however,like garcia,that case involved a defendant whose current crimes were committed before the passage of proposition.in jensen,the defendant claimed that his juvenile adjudication for voluntary manslaughter could not be used as a strike in his prosecution for being a felon in possession of a firearm.voluntary manslaughter was not listed in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b in or in.following garcia,the court agreed that the juvenile adjudication could not be used as a strike because it did not meet the requirement of paragraph d.id.at,d.the question whether the prior juvenile adjudication qualified as a strike was properly determined by reference to the list of offenses included in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b before the passage of proposition because the current offense was committed before the passage of proposition.as in garcia,the jensen court was not required to consider the effect of proposition enactment of section on paragraph d.
at oral argument,defendants argued that the legislative analyst ballot summary of proposition supports their argument defendants pointed to the absence of anything in the ballot summary indicating that proposition would overrule garcia interpretation of paragraph d.
we observe that our analysis is in accordance with the intent of the electorate in passing proposition.t he general object of the initiative is to address the problem of violent crime committed by juveniles and gangs.manduley superior court cal th,d.to achieve this object,among other things,proposition added a number of the list of violent and serious felonies that qualify as strikes.id.at,d.therefore,it would be inconsistent with the intent of the electorate if we were to hold that a prior juvenile adjudication for robbery does not qualify as a strike in cases where the current crimes were committed after the passage of proposition.
we conclude that by virtue of section,a prior juvenile adjudication of robbery qualifies as a strike in cases where the current offense was committed after the passage of proposition on march.
constitutionality of using prior juvenile adjudications as strikes 
defendants alternatively claim that no prior juvenile adjudication may constitutionally be used as a strike because there is no right to a jury trial during juvenile proceedings.as noted above,each of the defendants raised this argument below,but in each case the trial court did not have to reach the issue because it found that the prior juvenile adjudication did not fall within section,subdivision d d.
we recently rejected this argument,in people lee th,d lee.see id.at,d conc.opn of premo,id.at,d dis.opn.of rushing.we repeat the majority analysis from lee,along with a discussion of the recent case of people smith th,d smith.
defendants claim that a prior juvenile adjudication may not constitutionally be used as a strike because there is no right to a jury trial during juvenile proceedings was rejected in people fowler th,d fowler.the fowler court explained by enacting the three strikes law,the legislature has not transformed juvenile adjudications into criminal convictions it simply has said that,under specified circumstances,a prior juvenile adjudication may be used as evidence of past criminal conduct for the purpose of increasing an adult defendant sentence.the three strikes law use of juvenile adjudications affects only the length of the sentence imposed on an adult offender,not the finding of guilt in the adult court nor the adjudication process in the juvenile court.since a juvenile reliably citation can be adjudicated a delinquent without being afforded a jury trial,there is no constitutional impediment to using that juvenile adjudication to increase a defendant sentence following a later adult conviction.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
after the fowler case was decided,the united states supreme court decided apprendi new jersey,d apprendi,which considered the constitutionality of new jersey hate crime law.that law provided for an extended term of imprisonment if the trial judge finds,by a preponderance of the evidence,that t he defendant in committing the crime acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race,color,gender,handicap,religion,sexual orientation or ethnicity.citation.id.at.the court concluded the statute was unconstitutional,holding that o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.in reaching its holding,the court explained that prior convictions were exempt from the rule because of the procedural safeguards attached to any fact of prior conviction.id.at.
after apprendi,the ninth circuit decided tighe cir tighe.the tighe court considered whether the defendant prior juvenile adjudication could constitutionally qualify as a prior conviction under section,subdivision e,a federal sentencing statute for repeat offenders which did not provide for the right to have a jury find the prior conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.in tighe,a decision,the majority stated that a t first blush,it may appear that a juvenile adjudication,which congress has characterized as a prior conviction for the purposes of the federal statute,falls precisely within apprendi exception for the fact of a prior conviction such an analysis,however,igno
