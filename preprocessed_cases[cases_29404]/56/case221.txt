after jonathan minor stabbed another young man during a brawl,he was alleged in a juvenile wardship petition to have violated penal code section,subdivision a,assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm,and subdivision a,assault by force likely to produce great bodily injury.the juvenile court found true both violations,as well as enhancement allegations under both violations of personal use of a deadly weapon and infliction of great bodily injury.defendant contends he can not be found to have committed violations of both subdivisions of section because the two subdivisions merely specify different ways of committing a single offense.he also argues the deadly weapon enhancement under subdivision a is improper because use of such a weapon is an element of the crime and objects to the imposition of an electronic search probation condition.
we conclude the minor argument that the crimes specified in subdivision a and of penal code section are not separate offenses is untenable in light of the supreme court decision in people gonzalez cal th gonzalez.nonetheless,we agree with the minor that he can not be found to have violated both offenses because we find the offense specified in subdivision a,assault by force likely to produce great bodily injury,is necessarily included within the offense specified in subdivision a,assault with a deadly weapon or instrument other than a firearm.we also find merit in the minor other arguments.we therefore vacate the juvenile court findings with respect to section,subdivision a and strike the deadly weapon use enhancement under the violation of subdivision a.in addition,we direct the entry of a narrower electronic search condition and remand for recalculation of the minor maximum term of confinement and restitution fine.
background 
in an amended juvenile wardship petition under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a,the minor was alleged to have violated penal code section,subdivision a,assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm count one,and section,subdivision a,assault by force likely to produce great bodily injury count two.both counts also alleged the minor used a deadly weapon,a knife,and inflicted great bodily injury on the victim,subd.b,subd.a.
testimony at the contested jurisdictional hearing established that the minor stabbed another young man in the abdomen during a brawl,using a folding pocket knife with a blade approximately three to four inches long.the resulting injury required a hospital stay.
the juvenile court found true both counts of the petition,as well as all enhancement allegations.the minor was adjudged a ward of the court and committed to the county youthful offender treatment program for a maximum period of nine years or until age.among the probation conditions imposed was one requiring the minor to submit his property to a warrantless search at any time,including any electronic device cell phone access codes.
ii.discussion 
the minor contends the juvenile court erred in convicting him of both subdivision a and of section and argues the enhancement alleging use of a knife under count one should be stricken because use of a deadly weapon is an element of the crime of assault with a deadly weapon.he also challenges the imposition of the probation condition permitting warrantless search of his electronic devices.
multiple violations of section 
governing law 
the statute governing the crime of aggravated assault,section,has undergone a gradual expansion over its history.for much of the first half of the last century,the section read,every person who commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon or instrument or by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison,or in a county jail,or by fine,or by both such fine and imprisonment.in re mosley cal d,fn.stats,ch.in,this provision was designated subdivision a,and a subdivision b was added separately criminalizing aggravated assault against a peace officer.stats,ch.in addition to other statutory changes to section not pertinent here,subdivision a was later split into two parts,dividing the crime into assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm or by force likely to produce great bodily injury,and assault with a firearm.the latter imposed the new requirement of a minimum jail term.stats,ch,see people milward cal th.in,subdivision a was added to section,specifying the crime of assault with a machinegun or assault weapon,which carried a mandatory prison term,unlike the other provisions of subdivision a.stats,ch.finally,in,subdivision a was split into the crimes of assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm,which remained subdivision a,and assault by force likely to produce great bodily injury,which became subdivision a.although stated in separate subdivisions,the two crimes continued to carry the same range of punishments,which were separately specified in each subdivision.stats,ch.as a result of these changes,subdivision a of section now specifies four different crimes,each with its own elements and range of punishments 
it has long been accepted that,in general terms,a person may be convicted of,although not punished for,more than one crime arising out of the same act or course of conduct.in california,a single act or course of conduct by a defendant can lead to convictions of any number of the offenses charged.citations.citation.section generally permits multiple conviction.section is its counterpart concerning punishment.it prohibits multiple punishment for the same act or omission.people reed cal th,reed.this general rule is subject to a judicially created exception,which prohibits multiple convictions based on necessarily included offenses.citations.i f a crime can not be committed without also necessarily committing a lesser offense,the latter is a lesser included offense within the former.id.at.many cases have found that only a single offense can arise from a single statute,but that has never been a rule 
the supreme court latest word on the issue of multiple convictions is gonzalez,supra,cal th.the gonzalez defendant sexually assaulted a woman who had been rendered unconscious by intoxication.he was convicted separately under two subdivisions of section,which prohibit oral copulation of an unconscious person,subd.f and oral copulation of a person rendered defenseless by intoxication,subd.i.the defendant contended he could not be convicted of both offenses because he had committed a single act of oral copulation.gonzalez,at.his appeal was premised on craig,supra,cal d,in which the defendant was convicted of two counts of rape based on a single act of forcible intercourse with an underage girl.this conduct violated two subdivisions of section,which separately criminalized sex with a minor and forcible intercourse.in requiring consolidation of the convictions,the craig court reasoned under section,but one punishable offense of rape results from a single act of intercourse,although that act may be accomplished under more than one of the conditions or circumstances specified in the statutory subdivisions.these subdivisions merely define the circumstances under which an act of intercourse may be deemed an act of rape they are not to be construed as creating several offenses of rape based upon that single act.the victim was not doubly outraged,once because she was forcibly attacked and once because she was under years of age.there was but a single outrage and offense.id.at.the court expressly distinguished conduct that violated more than one statute,noting different statutes are based upon an independent public policy.id.at.
although the circumstances of craig would appear to be materially indistinguishable from those in gonzalez,the gonzalez court permitted both convictions for oral copulation to stand,basing its conclusion on an analysis of the statutory structure.gonzalez,supra,cal th at.within the statute,section,subdivision a defines oral copulation in general terms.the subsequent subdivisions of the statute describe the various circumstances under which oral copulation,as so defined,is illegal.each subdivision describes a distinct circumstance and contains a specific punishment,applicable solely to the circumstances described in the subdivision.in inferring a legislative intent to permit convictions for violations of both subdivisions f and i,the gonzalez court concluded these offenses differ in their necessary elements an act of oral copulation may be committed with a person who is unconscious but not intoxicated,and also with a person who is intoxicated but not unconscious and neither offense is included within the other.citation.each subdivision sets forth all the elements of a crime,and each prescribes a specific punishment.not all of these punishments are the same.that each subdivision of section was drafted to be supports the view that each describes an independent offense,and therefore section is no impediment to a defendant conviction under more than one such subdivision for a single act.id.at.
gonzalez distinguished craig on the basis of the different structure of the two statutes involved.at the time craig was decided,section stated,r ape is an act of sexual intercourse,accomplished with a female not the wife of the perpetrator,under either of the following circumstances,and thereafter listed a variety of circumstances in separately numbered subparagraphs.no individual punishments were specified for the different circumstances.gonzalez,supra,cal th at,fn.according to gonzalez,craig simply concluded,based on the wording and structure of the statute,that former section set forth only one offense that could be committed under several different circumstances,as described in its several subdivisions.this conclusion flowed naturally from the wording and structure of former section section is textually and structurally different from former section.gonzalez,at,fn.omitted.
violations of section,subdivision a and 
a.the statutory structure of section 
the statutory structure of section is indistinguishable from that of section.each subdivision of section sets out different circumstances under which a person can commit aggravated assault,and each subdivision specifies the punishment applicable to those circumstances.the reasoning of gonzalez would therefore classify each subdivision as a separate offense and permit more than one conviction based upon the violation of more than one subdivision of section.
the minor encourages us to find subdivision a and of section do not constitute separate offenses on the basis of the legislative history of the amendment creating subdivision a,which described the legislation as a technical,nonsubstantive change.stats,ch.according to the bill author,the purpose of the amendment was to make it easier for prosecutors and defense attorneys to determine whether a defendant past aggravated assault conviction involved the use of a weapon when examining a defendant criminal history,since past aggravated assault convictions involving the use of a weapon are treated differently for certain purposes than those not involving a weapon.assem.com.on public safety,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.because criminal histories typically list prior crimes according to the statute violated,a citation to section,subdivision a was ambiguous in this respect prior to the amendment.see assem.com.on public safety,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.the minor argues no separate offense was created by the amendment because the two clauses specified different methods of committing a single offense before the amendment and the legislature expressed no intent to change that situation in enacting the amendment.
the rationale of gonzalez precludes such an analysis.the court held,in effect,that the legislature is deemed to have intended to create separate offenses whenever a statute isolates violations with separate elements and punishments in separate subdivisions.under gonzalez,this statutory structure was held to be an element of the plain language of the statute,and that language was held to be unambiguous in creating separately convictable offenses.given the absence of ambiguity,expressions of intent in a statute legislative history are irrelevant to its interpretation.gonzalez,supra,cal th at.
necessarily included offenses 
while we do not accept the minor reasoning,we find merit in his general point.gonzalez acknowledges an exception to its general rule.as the court noted in discussing the subdivisions violated by the defendant these offenses differ in their necessary elements and neither offense is included within the other.gonzalez,supra,cal th at.in other words,the court recognized that the general rule prohibiting multiple convictions for necessarily included offenses reed,supra,cal th at operates with respect to separate subdivisions within a single statute because,as discussed below,we conclude assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm includes the elements of assault by force likely to produce great bodily injury,such that a person can not commit the former without at the same time committing the latter,a person can not be convicted of both offenses on the basis of a single act,notwithstanding their inclusion in separate,subdivisions of section.
the separate aspects of aggravated assault found in subdivision a and of section have not previously been considered in the terms associated with lesser included offenses because,until,the subdivisions were alternative provisions within a single statutory subdivision.as section was constructed prior to,a person could commit aggravated assault by committing assault either with a deadly weapon or instrument other than a firearm or by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury.former,subd.a.use of a deadly weapon other than a firearm or force likely to produce great bodily injury were therefore two means to commit the same offense,rather than different offenses.when the two aspects are considered separately,however,it becomes clear the latter is necessarily committed when the former occurs.
the crime of assault is an unlawful attempt,coupled with a present ability,to commit a violent injury on the person of another.people navarro th.it is unnecessary for any actual injury to occur.people white th.
the distinction between assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm and assault by force likely to produce great bodily injury was explored in people aguilar cal th aguilar,in which the court considered whether hands or feet can constitute deadly weapons within the meaning of the statute.id.at.in aguilar,the defendant had severely beaten and kicked the victim,and the prosecutor argued to the jury a conviction for aggravated assault was appropriate because hands and feet may be deadly weapons within the meaning of former section,subdivision a.aguilar,at.in disapproving the prosecutor argument,the court noted weapons not inherently deadly are defined by their use in a manner capable of producing great bodily injury.id.at.for that reason,the clause force likely to produce great bodily injury would be rendered redundant if hands and feet could be considered weapons or instruments.ibid.rather,the separate clause force likely to produce great bodily injury was included in the statute to cover the application of such force without the use of an instrument.ibid.
while the court found the prosecutor argument to be improper,it concluded the prosecutor argument was harmless,using reasoning directly pertinent to the issue before us.ultimately,the jury decisionmaking process in an aggravated assault case under former section,subdivision a,is functionally identical regardless of whether,in the particular case,the defendant employed a weapon alleged to be deadly as used or employed force likely to produce great bodily injury in either instance,the decision turns on the nature of the force used.aguilar,supra,cal th at.that is,if the defendant acted by means of a weapon other than a firearm,it was necessary for the jury to find the defendant applied force likely to produce great bodily injury,regardless of whether the force was applied by means of an instrument or by hands and feet.as the court concluded,there is a fundamental identity of the concepts of assault with a deadly weapon and assault by
