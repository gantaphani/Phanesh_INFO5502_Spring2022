appeals the order sustaining the allegations in the juvenile dependency petition concerning his daughter under welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions a,b and d.claims the court erred in concluding that one incident of sexual abuse committed approximately six years before the petition was filed and one incident of physical abuse about two years before demonstrated the minor was at risk of future harm.as we shall explain,we do not agree.first,on appeal does not deny the sexual abuse in which he was alleged to have raped his daughter or the physical abuse in which he was alleged to have struck the minor and dislocated her shoulder constitute instances of prior serious physical harm under section.contrary,to argument,pursuant to section subdivisions a,b and d,the court can exercise dependency jurisdiction based on findings of prior instances of serious harm or abuse.in any event,the evidence in the record is sufficient to support a finding of future risk of harm.accordingly,we affirm.
factual and procedural history 
minor,born in september,is the daughter of father and mother.mother and father have been divorced since minor was two years old.minor has lived with mother and has visited father sporadically since the parents divorce.
in,minor,then years old was in therapy to address her declining academic performance,her depression and her frequent absences from high school.she had missed days of school since the beginning of the school year.during therapy she disclosed that when she was younger her father had raped her on one occasion minor also disclosed that on one other occasion when she was about years old and staying with father for a week,he struck her on the shoulder,causing it to become dislocated.she stated that she had locked herself in a bathroom to block out the noise from her father and his girlfriend partying and playing loud music.when she refused to open the door,father became angry and broke down the door and struck her on the shoulder.
when interviewed,mother indicated that she first learned of the sexual abuse about two years after it happened,but she did not speak to father about it and continued to allow minor to visit her father after it occurred because minor and father were close and because minor insisted on seeing him.mother also stated that she took minor to the doctor after the incident of physical abuse,but neither mother nor minor disclosed to the doctor how the injury had occurred they reported that it was an accident.mother stated that after father dislocated minor shoulder mother told father never to touch minor again.
the department of children and family services dcfs detention report further indicated the dcfs had been unable to contact father to obtain his statement and that he had not made himself available for an interview.
on may,the dcfs filed a dependency petition alleging minor was a person described by section,subdivisions a,b and d.under subdivision a the petition alleged that father had struck minor on the shoulder causing severe pain and the dislocation of her shoulder.it further alleged mother knew of the incident and failed to protect the child and that mother continued to allow minor to visit father after mother learned of the abuse.subdivision contained an allegation that on a prior occasion father sexually abused the child by forcibly raping the child and engaging in sexual intercourse,fondling and oral copulation on her.it further alleged mother knew of the incident and failed to protect the child,did not believe the child and allowed minor to continue to visit with father after learning of the abuse.the petition also included an allegation that alleged the incident of physical abuse described in allegation a.under subdivision d,the allegation described the incident of sexual abuse included in allegation.as to all of the allegations under a,b,and d,the petition alleged that the father abuse and the mother failure to protect her placed the minor at risk of physical and emotional harm,and damage.
at the detention hearing,the juvenile dependency court found father to be the presumed father,and detained minor,finding prima facie evidence that the minor was a person described under section,subdivisions a,b and d.the court made findings as to the father that there was a substantial risk to the emotional and physical health of minor and that no reasonable means existed to protect her without the removal from her father.the court ordered that minor be released to mother and ordered father to have visits with minor consent minor informed the court that she did not wish to visit with father.minor counsel asked the court to consider terminating jurisdiction with a family law order giving mother sole legal and physical custody.
the jurisdiction and disposition report described the alleged incidents and further indicated that mother and minor had a good relationship,that they had both been to counseling and that mother was cooperative and following the dcfs recommendations.mother now believed the claims of sexual abuse made by minor and intended to protect her.at a hearing in june,the court issued a order requiring mother and father to stay at least yards away from each other.counsel for the dcfs indicated that father had declined to be interviewed.the court ordered a supplemental report to include an interview with father and that father could be questioned with his counsel present 
at the august,jurisdictional and dispositional hearing,father counsel did not present any evidence,and submitted on the reports and other documents in the record.father counsel did,however,make a motion to dismiss under section,subdivision c arguing that the dcfs had not met its burden of proof.specifically counsel argued that the one incident of sexual abuse was remote in time and that only one incident of physical abuse had occurred,and as such the dcfs had failed to demonstrate a current risk to minor.the court denied the motion to dismiss.the court noted that minor statements concerning the abuse were consistent and specific she had presented enough information for the court to believe her claims were true.the court found minor was a person described by section,subdivisions a,b and d based on the conduct of father and the mother.as for the disposition,the juvenile court ordered that minor be placed with her mother.the court issued a family law exit order awarding mother full legal and physical custody of minor and allowed monitored visits for father with minor consent.the court then terminated jurisdiction.
father timely appeals.
discussion 
on appeal,father argues the juvenile court jurisdictional findings sustaining the section,subdivisions a,b and d allegations in the petition must be reversed because there is insufficient evidence that the conduct alleged posed a future risk of harm to minor.before we address the merits of these issues we first dispose of a threshold matter.
after the court sustained the jurisdictional allegations in the petition,it proceeded to the disposition.accordingly,the court issued a family law exit order awarding mother full legal and physical custody of minor and allowed monitored visits for father with minor consent.the court then terminated dependency jurisdiction.arguably termination of the court jurisdiction renders the appeal moot.see in re james d.the court termination of jurisdiction after sustaining the petition and issuing disposition orders raises an issue of mootness with respect to a subsequent challenge to the exercise of jurisdiction.likewise,the question of mootness also arises because father has not challenged the allegations in the original amended petition,concerning mother failure to protect the child and thus,the court exercise of jurisdiction over the child is appropriate at least with respect to section allegations in the original petition.in re alysha th,d t he minor is a dependent if the actions of either parent bring her within one of the statutory definitions of dependent.this notwithstanding,the sustained jurisdictional findings against father have had an adverse effect on his custody rights.in addition,the court ordered the stay away order to stay in effect after it terminated dependency jurisdiction.moreover,the jurisdictional findings could affect father in the future,if dependency proceedings were ever initiated,or even contemplated,with regard to the minor or father other children,if any.in re joshua th,d appeals in dependency matters are not moot if the purported error is of such magnitude as to infect the outcome of subsequent proceedings.consequently,we conclude father challenge to the jurisdictional findings is not moot.
jurisdictional findings 
at the jurisdictional hearing the juvenile court determines whether the allegations in the petition that the minor comes within section and therefore within the juvenile court jurisdiction are true.the court jurisdictional findings must be based on a preponderance of the evidence.see.if the court finds jurisdiction under section,it declares the child a dependent of the juvenile court and proceeds to the disposition phase,where the court considers whether the child should be removed from the parents under section 
at the dispositional phase of dependency proceedings the juvenile dependency court must find clear and convincing evidence to remove a child from his or her parents.see in re sheila th,d.
on appeal,the substantial evidence test is the appropriate standard of review for both the jurisdictional and dispositional findings.in re kristin th,d in re th,d.the term substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind would accept as adequate to support a conclusion it is evidence which is reasonable in nature,credible,and of solid value.see in re jerry th,d.with these principles in mind,we examine appellant contentions.
on appeal,father argues that the court jurisdictional findings can not stand because the dcfs did not demonstrate that minor was at risk of future harm.for the sake of appeal,he does not contest the claims alleged.father does not deny that the one incident of rape,sexual intercourse,fondling and oral copulation upon his daughter or that the incident where he struck the minor with such force that he dislocated her shoulder qualify under section subdivisions a,b and d as serious physical harm sexual abuse.instead he argues,that before the juvenile dependency jurisdiction can be exercised based on these subdivisions the dcfs must demonstrate that his actions create future risk of harm to the child.father argues the incidents alleged,though serious,were remote and do not demonstrate a continuing or substantial future risk to the minor.as we shall explain,we do not agree.
section,subdivisions a,b and d all provide,in pertinent part 
any child who comes within any of the following descriptions is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court which may adjudge that person to be a dependent child of the court 
a the child has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer,serious physical harm inflicted nonaccidentally upon the child by the child parent or guardian.for the purposes of this subdivision,a court may find there is a substantial risk of serious future injury based on the manner in which a less serious injury was inflicted,a history of repeated inflictions of injuries on the child or the child siblings,or a combination of these and other actions by the parent or guardian which indicate the child is at risk of serious physical harm.for purposes of this subdivision,serious physical harm does not include reasonable and spanking to the buttocks where there is no evidence of serious physical injury.
b the child has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer,serious physical harm or illness,as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent or guardian to adequately supervise or protect the child,or the willful or negligent failure of the child parent or guardian to adequately supervise or protect the child from the conduct of the custodian with whom the child has been left,or by the willful or negligent failure of the parent or guardian to provide the child with adequate food,clothing,shelter,or medical treatment,or by the inability of the parent or guardian to provide regular care for the child due to the parent or guardian mental illness,developmental disability,or substance abuse the child shall continue to be a dependent child pursuant to this subdivision only so long as is necessary to protect the child from risk of suffering serious physical harm or illness.
d the child has been sexually abused,or there is a substantial risk that the child will be sexually abused,as defined in section of the penal code,by his or her parent or guardian or a member of his or her household,or the parent or guardian has failed to adequately protect the child from sexual abuse when the parent or guardian knew or reasonably should have known that the child was in danger of sexual abuse.section,subds.a,b d.
evidence of prior serious harm or abuse satisfies jurisdiction under section,subdivisions a,b and d.
the language of section,subdivisions a,b and d is clear.all three subdivisions are satisfied by a showing that the minor has suffered prior serious physical harm or abuse.section,subd.a the child has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer,serious physical harm inflicted nonaccidentally upon the child by the child parent or guardian subd.b the child has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer,serious physical harm or illness,as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent or guardian to adequately supervise or protect the child subd.d the child has been sexually abused,or there is a substantial risk that the child will be sexually abused.in addition,the use of the disjunctive or demonstrates that a showing of prior abuse and harm is sufficient,standing alone,to establish dependency jurisdiction under these subdivisions.
our analysis finds support in in re david th,d david,where division five of the first district court of appeal concluded that an allegation the minor had suffered prior serious harm inflicted by his mother was sufficient,alone,to support jurisdiction under section,subdivision a.based on the plain language of subdivision a the david court rejected arguments,similar to father made here,that there must be evidence that the child faces a substantial risk of harm at the time of the hearing to support the jurisdictional findings.id.at,d.the court in david,further noted that a finding of jurisdiction does not give the court the right to remove the minor from parental custody.id.at,d.indeed,current or future risk to the child is relevant it is an alternative basis for jurisdiction under subdivisions a,b and d.moreover it is relevant,even when jurisdictional findings are based on prior abuse,to the dispositional phase when the court determines whether,under section,removal from parental custody is warranted.
father,like the mother in david,supports his argument that jurisdiction must be supported on a showing of future risk,by relying on in re rocco th,d,rocco and other cases cited in rocco as well as subsequent cases following rocco 
neither rocco nor any of the other cases cited by father,however,persuades us.in rocco the petition had alleged that the mother had left rocco in the care of a relative who was arrested for possession of heroin and methamphetamines the mother left rocco in the care of a friend who kicked him in the stomach the mother had a history of drug and alcohol abuse that interfered with her ability to provide for and supervise rocco and rocco had previously been removed from the mother care for three years due to her neglect of his basic needs.id.at,d.after reviewing the legislative history of a prior iteration of section,subdivision b,the rocco court concluded before courts and agencies can exert jurisdiction under section,subdivision b,there must be evidence indicating that the child is exposed to a substantial risk of serious physical harm or illness and w hile evidence of past conduct may be probative of current conditions,the question under section is whether circumstances at the time of the hearing subject the minor to the defined risk of harm citations omitted an
