in this appeal,we consider whether the family court erred in terminating the parental rights of a mother and two fathers based on their failure to plan for their four children.because the record amply supports the family court findings,we affirm.we take this occasion,however,to address the question of whether the interstate compact on the placement of children icpc applies to a parent seeking custody,since both fathers are virginia residents whose icpc home study evaluations were denied.we hold that the icpc does apply to natural parents in some circumstances,and that the placement requirements of the icpc do not violate the parents due process rights.
factual and procedural background 
sharon taylor had four children javone,jamare,hykeem,and breshawn.olin green was the father of jamare and javone.alfred gelman was the father of hykeem.all of the parents are from virginia,which is where they were living in,when the northampton county department of social services received its first complaint about one of taylor children.javonne,who was then five years old,reportedly smelled bad and was filthy.the department developed a service plan for taylor that involved maintaining proper hygiene.over the next three years,the department provided services to taylor in an effort to address the continuing hygiene problems as well as other problems,like javonne sporadic attendance at school,and the family lack of adequate housing.in,when the department was about to seek custody of her children,taylor moved to delaware.
in february,delaware division of family services dfs began working with taylor to provide the children with adequate housing,health care,food and other basics.over the next few months,dfs entered into several case plans with taylor,and provided,among other things,financial assistance and a parent aide.but jamar and javonne missed many days of school,and their living conditions did not improve.on june,when a caseworker came to visit,she found no food for the children.she told taylor,who claimed to be employed and to have a paycheck waiting for her,to buy food for the children by the following day.when the caseworker returned the following day,there still was no food for the children.dfs immediately sought,and was granted,emergency custody.
in july,dfs entered into another case plan with taylor,under which taylor was to improve her parenting skills,find steady work,and find appropriate housing.despite assistance from dfs,taylor failed to make progress.dfs entered into new case plans in september and again in december,but taylor showed no improvement.in may,taylor returned to virginia and asked to have her children placed with her there.the northampton department did not approve the placement,however.in september,taylor moved back to delaware,but by that time dfs had changed its goal from reunification to termination.the family court heard the petition for termination,as to taylor and the fathers,in october.
green and gelman traveled from virginia to attend the probable cause hearing in july.both expressed interest in obtaining custody of their children.green returned twice in august,and once in january,to visit his children and discuss their placement.dfs requested that virginia conduct a home study,but neither green nor his family cooperated with the virginia officials and the home study was never completed.after january,green did not visit his children again because his car was not running well and he had trouble arranging transportation.
gelman extended himself more than green.virginia social services caseworkers completed a home study for gelman,but did not approve placement because of his criminal record.after learning of the denial,gelman moved to delaware in an effort to obtain custody of his son.in february,gelman entered into a case plan under which he was to participate in counseling with hykeem,complete a parenting course,visit regularly,maintain regular employment,and find appropriate housing.during the next four months gelman met all of the requirements of the case plan except one.according to gelman,he was unable to find housing because the landlords would not rent to him until he had been in delaware and working for six months.
gelman had been living with his sister in delaware.in june,however,his sister accused gelman of stealing some jewelry that she thought was missing.gelman was so upset that he moved out immediately.in july,he advised dfs that he had moved back to virginia,and for almost eight months thereafter gelman had no contact with dfs or his son.it appears gelman sudden departure devastated hykeem,who became physically aggressive with children and adults.hykeem has been through six foster homes and is being treated for several mental health problems including adjustment disorder and disorder.gelman and his sister resolved their differences soon after he returned to virginia,but gelman decided not to come back to delaware because he wanted to stay in his own home and he did not want to have to start over in terms of establishing his employment record.
after a hearing,the family court terminated all the parties parental rights for failure to plan.the trial court noted that the older children suffer from behavioral and medical problems that require consistent treatment,counseling,and,for one child,regular medication.the youngest child has been living with a foster family for most of his life and is thriving in that environment.based on its evaluation of the childrens needs and placement,the trial court concluded that termination would be in their best interests.
discussion 
based on our review of the record,we are satisfied that there is clear and convincing evidence supporting the family court decision to terminate taylor parental rights.as the family court noted 
dfs has worked extensively with mother providing her with necessities as well as resources to turn her life around.while the court is sympathetic to the uphill battle mother has in overcoming poverty,the court does not believe that poverty is the factor keeping mother from being reunified with her children at this point mother has not yet demonstrated even basic parenting skills.mother has failed to complete the goals of the case plans mother has four children who all have severe emotional and medical needs.mother continually has failed to take these conditions seriously by not making doctors appointments,missing appointments that are scheduled,failing to get proper vaccinations,and failing to get the proper medications there is a history of lack of care and failure to terminate the relationship of parent and child will result in continued emotional instability and physical risk to the children.
the family court also carefully considered the best interests of the children and its conclusion is amply supported by the record.
we are not unmindful of taylor contention that her past parenting problems were caused by poverty,and that she is now financially secure.the record does not support her claim.first,financial assistance was available to taylor from the time dfs became involved,but she failed to use the assistance she was given to provide for her children welfare.second,taylor contention that she is now financially secure is based on her engagement to a man who allegedly has his own home and the resources to care for her children.taylor fiance did not appear at the hearing,however,and there was no independent verification of his financial situation or his willingness to take responsibility for four children with medical and emotional problems.accordingly,we find no error in the family court decision terminating taylor parental rights in all of her children.
the record also establishes,by clear and convincing evidence,that green and gelman failed to plan for their children and that it is in the children best interests to terminate their parental rights.green made almost no effort to establish or maintain a relationship with jamare and javone.he visited them only three times between july and january.since then,he has had no contact with the boys.he did not cooperate with the virginia caseworkers,and,as a result,they were unable to conduct a home study.in sum
