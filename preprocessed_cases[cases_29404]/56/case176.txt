may a court commit to the department of corrections and rehabilitation,division of juvenile facilities djf,a juvenile who has not committed an offense described in subdivision b of welfare and institutions code section two statutes govern the answer.welfare and institutions code section authorizes a juvenile court to commit a juvenile who has been adjudged a ward of the court to the djf if the ward has committed an offense described in subdivision b of welfare and institutions code section and the ward is not otherwise ineligible for commitment to the division under welfare and institutions code section.welf,subd.a hereafter section a.section makes a ward ineligible for commitment to the djf when the most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is not described in subdivision b of section,unless the offense is a sex offense set forth in subdivision c of section of the penal code,subd.c hereafter section c,italics added.
here,the juvenile court committed a juvenile ward,to the djf based on his commission of a sex offense listed in penal code section,subdivision c hereafter penal code section c,although he had never committed an offense listed in section,subdivision b hereafter b.we conclude a juvenile court lacks authority to commit a ward to the djf under section a if that ward has never been adjudged to have committed an offense described in section b,even if his or her most recent offense alleged in a petition and admitted or found true by the juvenile court is a sex offense set forth in section c as referenced in section c.we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal,which concluded otherwise 
factual and procedural background 
in october,a witness reported seeing year old orally copulating his sister while they were parked in a vehicle outside a grocery store.admitted his conduct to an investigating officer and told the officer he was in counseling for molesting a year earlier.also told the officer he had touched the genitalia of two of his other siblings.
an original petition was filed in juvenile court pursuant to section,alleging had committed a lewd and lascivious act upon within the meaning of penal code section,subdivision a.admitted the allegation and was declared a ward of the court and placed on probation in january.
over the course of the next three years,made little to no progress on probation.he admitted four separate violations of probation for failing to comply with program placement rules.
the first notice of violation of probation was filed,alleging had failed to comply with program placement rules by failing to obey staff directives,complete required assignments and participate actively in group therapy.admitted the violations and the court ordered him placed at a new residential program.
demonstrated the same lack of commitment and progress at his second program placement.in addition,he disclosed having gender identity issues and admitted engaging in mutually consenting sex acts on two occasions with another resident.after three months at this second placement,a second notice of violation of probation was filed,alleging a failure to comply with program placement rules.c.admitted the violations and in june he was placed at a residential program that offered services directed to his gender identity issues.
approximately months later,after failed to complete required assignments for his sex offender therapy and routinely pretended not to understand what he was being told in order to avoid doing work,a third notice of violation of probation was filed,alleging continuing failure to comply with program rules and lack of progress.admitted the violations and ultimately served days in custody at juvenile hall.
returned from custody to the residential program in september with a negative and defiant attitude.his continued failure to complete assignments,failing school grades,and lack of progress in his sex offender treatment program resulted in a fourth notice of violation of probation filed in january.again admitted the violations.
in february,after an extensive disposition hearing,the juvenile court committed to the djf in order to enable him to participate in its sex offender program.the court observed that commitment offense,the violation of penal code section,subdivision a,was not an offense falling within the provisions of section b but concluded that after three years of failed attempts to help in three different reputable programs,commitment of to the djf was necessary so that he would not have access to other potential victims and could receive the benefit of the djf adolescent sexual offender program.appealed the dispositional order.
the court of appeal affirmed.as relevant here,it rejected claim that he was ineligible for commitment to the djf because his offense under penal code section,subdivision a was not listed in section b.we granted petition for review.
discussiona.the plain meaning of sections a and c 
section,subdivision a authorizes a juvenile court to order specified types of treatment for a minor who is adjudged a ward of the court on the ground that he or she is a person described by section.it also authorizes certain additional orders and commitments.at issue here is subdivision a,which authorizes a juvenile court to c ommit the ward to the djf,if the ward has committed an offense described in subdivision b of section and is not otherwise ineligible for commitment to the division under section.
section provides,in relevant part,that a ward of the juvenile court who meets any condition described below shall not be committed to the djf a the ward is under years of age.b the ward is suffering from any contagious,infectious,or other disease that would probably endanger the lives or health of the other inmates of any facility.c the ward has been or is adjudged a ward of the court pursuant to section,and the most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is not described in subdivision b of section,unless the offense is a sex offense set forth in subdivision c of section of the penal code.it is this last restriction,section c,which gives rise to the question presented in this case.

it is clear from the statutory language of sections a and c that section a governs a ward eligibility for djf commitment and section governs a ward ineligibility for a djf commitment.subdivision a was added to section by urgency legislation passed in.see stats,ch.bill,operative.initially,subdivision a of section simply authorized a juvenile court to commit the ward to the department of corrections and rehabilitation,division of juvenile facilities,if the ward has committed an offense described in subdivision b of section.the same bill that amended section to include subdivision a also added section.see stats,ch,operative.section c provided that a ward of the juvenile court shall not be committed to the djf if,among other things,the most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is not described in subdivision b of section,unless the offense is a sex offense set forth in paragraph of subdivision d of section of the penal code.thus,from the time of enactment,section a stated a ward eligibility for djf commitment and section stated a ward ineligibility.this distinction was made express by the legislature when only a few weeks after its enactment of new subdivision a of section and section the legislature amended section a to clarify that a juvenile court has authority to commit a ward to the djf if the ward has committed an offense described in subdivision b of section and is not otherwise ineligible for commitment to the division under section.stats,ch.assem.bill,eff,italics added.this later version of section a was in effect at the time was committed to the djf.
as noted,section a authorizes djf commitment if the ward has committed an offense described in subdivision b of section and is not otherwise ineligible for commitment to the division under section.italics added.the ordinary and usual usage of and is as a conjunctive,meaning an additional thing,also or plus.amerigraphics,mercury casualty th,accord,kobzoff los angeles county medical center cal th,santos dondero d.
in order for a ward to be committed to the djf,section a read as a conjunctive,requires that the ward has committed an offense listed in section b,plus the ward is not ineligible under section.both are necessary predicates.a ward commission of an offense described in section b is,therefore,a prerequisite for a juvenile court authority to order djf commitment.only if the juvenile ward is eligible for commitment to the djf because of his or her commission of an offense listed in section b should the juvenile court proceed to consider whether he or she is nevertheless statutorily ineligible for such a commitment pursuant to section,including section c.
under section c,a ward who has committed an offense described in section b is ineligible for commitment to the djf if his or her most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is not described in subdivision b of section,unless the offense is a sex offense set forth in subdivision c of section of the penal code.c,italics added.the antecedent being referenced by the offense in this quoted language is the ward most recent offense.thus,the statutory language of section c provides that a ward is ineligible for commitment to the djf if his or her most recent offense admitted or found true by the court is not an offense described in section b,unless the ward has a previously sustained petition for a section b offense and the most recent offense is one of the sex offenses set forth in section c.the express exception for specified sex offenses in subdivision c of penal code section is to the in eligibility to a djf commitment as stated in the earlier clause of section c.it is not a substitute for the initial,prerequisite eligibility requirement set forth in section a that the ward have committed an offense described in section b.read together,sections a and c limit the class of wards who may be committed to the djf to those wards who have committed an offense described in section b and whose most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is listed either in section b or penal code section c.
a contrary reading of section c description of those juvenile wards who are ineligible for commitment to the djf would give the and used in section a a disjunctive meaning.that is,one would need to interpret and as or.it is true that courts will sometimes substitute or for and,and vice versa,when necessary to accomplish the evident intent of the statute,but doing so is an exceptional rule of construction.bianco industrial accident com.cal d,santos dondero,supra,d at.we reject application of the rule here because construing the word and in section a as or would render a portion of section c superfluous.if and were construed to mean or in this context,section a would provide that a ward is eligible for commitment to the djf if he or she has committed an offense specified in section b or if he or she was eligible under section c because his or her most recent offense was one specified under section b or because he or she committed one of the sex offenses enumerated in penal code section c.but if the commission of any offense specified in section b qualifies a juvenile ward for commitment to the djf,it would be meaningless to say that the ward is also eligible if his or her most recent offense is listed in section b.it is a settled principle of statutory construction,that courts should strive to give meaning to every word in a statute and to avoid constructions that render words,phrases,or clauses superfluous.klein united states of america cal th,accord,curle superior court cal th.we harmonize statutory provisions,if possible,giving each provision full effect.cacho boudreau cal th.
interpreting the word and in section a as a conjunctive not only avoids rendering a portion of section c meaningless,it harmonizes the provisions of the statutes as a whole,and preserves section a as the eligibility statute and section c as the ineligibility statute in accordance with the legislature apparent intent.it ascribes to the language of the statutes their ordinary and usual meaning.
b.the effect of other statutes added or amended at the same time as sections a and c 
the attorney general contends that statutes added or amended concurrently with sections a and c reflect the legislature intent that juvenile sex offenders remain eligible for djf commitment.we agree that certain juvenile sex offenders are eligible for djf,but only so long as they have a prior or current section b offense sustained against them.
we begin by considering section,which was added,along with sections a and c,by senate bill.stats,ch.section governs a juvenile court authority to recall the commitment of a ward to the djf.section provides that the court committing a ward to the djf may recall that commitment in the case of any ward whose commitment offense was not an offense listed in subdivision b of section,unless the offense was a sex offense set forth in subdivision c of section of the penal code,and who remains confined in an institution operated by the division on or after september,subd.a.
by its terms,section governs recall of previous commitments of wards to the djf,not eligibility for commitments starting on september.see in re carl th.that the legislature concluded juvenile sex offenders already committed to the djf should not receive the benefits of a recall under newly enacted section sheds no light on what the legislature intended regarding future commitment of juvenile offenders pursuant to sections a and c.as observed in in re th,the legislature undertook a fiscal realignment through senate bill that shifted responsibility to the counties for all but the most serious youth offenders.when considering such fiscal matters,the legislature could reasonably make different policy choices regarding which juvenile offenders should be kept in the custody of the djf and which juvenile offenders should be committed in the future to the djf.
we next consider section,which was amended by senate bill to read,in relevant part,as follows a after certification to the governor as provided in this article,a court may commit to the djf any person who meets all of the following is convicted of an offense described in subdivision b of section or paragraph of subdivision d of section of the penal code.is found to be less than years of age at the time of apprehension.is not sentenced to death,imprisonment for life,with or without the possibility of parole,whether or not pursuant to section of the penal code,imprisonment for days or less,or the payment of a fine,or after having been directed to pay a fine,defaults in the payment thereof,and is subject to imprisonment for more than days under the judgment.is not granted probation,or was granted probation and that probation is revoked and terminated.stats,ch,italics added.after the legislature reorganized and renumbered the provisions of penal code former section,the reference to penal code section,subdivision b in section was correspondingly change
