legal background

factual background 
mother drug addiction,criminal history,incarceration,and physical abuse of the children resulted in protective custody for the children in april.the santa clara county department of family and children services department placed the children together in a foster home.on june,the juvenile court declared the children dependents.on june,it bypassed reunification services.in august,mother was released from prison.in november,the department placed the children in another foster home and mother began supervised visits.shortly thereafter mother was again incarcerated and failed to visit during the first three months of.in july,the children were moved to an foster home.in october,the department reported that the children were doing very well in their new foster adopt placement,and foster parents were willing to adopt the children.in january,it recommended that the juvenile court terminate parental rights and order adoption as the children permanent plan.in july,mother tested positively for cocaine.the therapist for the two older children reported that,upon learning of mother relapse,the two children had overcome their conflicting emotions and were ready to proceed with adoption.
the juvenile court heard the section matter on august and.we rely on and appreciate the juvenile court lengthy oral decision,which includes a succinct summary of the evidence that is relevant at this stage of the proceedings.
the matter is deemed submitted at this time.and i going to give an indicated ruling because the matter needs to be sent to the attorney for the court that reviews the cases to make sure that we in full compliance with the icwa.
and the indicated ruling is that i will be following the recommendations of the department.
i noticed throughout the trial and throughout the final statements,final arguments,that the word adoptable has been used.
and the actual legal standard is not whether a child is or is not adoptable,the idea that any child that has someone that is ready and willing to adopt him or her is adoptable,the question is whether or not the court can find by clear and convincing evidence that it is likely that the children will be adopted.
and there a difference between likely to be adopted and adoptable.
now i believe that in this case that all three children are likely to be adopted.the only one that really raises any concerns about such a finding by clear and convincing evidence is.
and the evidence is that does have challenging behaviors but that he does,in the context of his placement at this point in time,respond to interventions that are provided in order to deal with those behaviors.
so i believe that is likely to be adopted.and if for some unforeseen reason,some emergency or catastrophe,the current foster parents are unable or unwilling to adopt any of these children,i believe that the evidence shows that they are likely to be adopted by another family.
i know it wo be easy to do that,but certainly they are the kind of children that a family would like to have as a part of their lives.even.even with all his difficulties.
so i will also indicate that i think the evidence is that the children do enjoy the contact that they have with their mother in that they have responded positively to the visitation schedule that been established for the mother.
but i think that the court is required at this point in time to weigh the benefit that children have by continuing a relationship with the parent against the benefit the children will have with the permanency that afforded to them by adoption.
and i think that in this case it is clear to me that the benefit that the children will receive by permanency in an adoption far outweighs the benefit that they would receive by continuing the relationship with the mother.
that is not to say that i do think the children should be given an opportunity to continue the relationship with the mother if that appropriate,it just means that in weighing those two things i believe that there would be a loss on either the weight of the permanency outweighs the benefit of the continuing relationship,and it should not prevent these children from having a permanent home.
so there is any evidence to indicate at this time that there there insufficient evidence to indicate at this time that any of the exceptions should apply.
therefore,i find the children likely to be adopted.
i will terminate parental rights in order for that to happen.
i will set the matter over actually giving you an indicated ruling.i set the matter over for three weeks so i can refer it to the attorney for the superior court that reviews to make sure that we not running afoul of the icwa and i enter judgment at the time that that advisement comes back.
the juvenile court later found that the icwa did not apply and rendered a written judgment consistent with its oral decision.
adoptability 
mother contends that no substantial evidence supports the juvenile court finding that was likely to be adopted.according to mother,was not generally adoptable because he was born with a positive toxicology screen and tested positive for tuberculosis,he was seeing a counselor,throwing tantrums,not following directions,doing poorly in second grade and was not motivated,and had severe behavior within two months of his detention,the department had requested that he undergo a psychological evaluation for the behavior problems as recently as two years after his detention,he had threatened to commit suicide,he had run away,he did not have a positive relationship with his foster mother,he had posttraumatic stress disorder,adhd,and a learning disorder,he had a deep love and loyalty to his mother,and the three siblings should be placed together and,if placement with the foster parents failed,it would be difficult to place them together elsewhere.mother suggests that was not specifically adoptable because,notwithstanding the foster parents willingness to adopt,there was insufficient evidence of their commitment to adopt given that a home study had not been done for the foster parents.mother analysis is erroneous.
on review of the sufficiency of the evidence,we presume in favor of the order,considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving the prevailing party the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in support of the order.in re autumn th,d.
