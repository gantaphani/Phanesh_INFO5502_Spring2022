a jury found defendant luis villa guilty of gross negligence in discharging a firearm,possession of a firearm by a juvenile previously adjudged a ward of the juvenile court,and possession of a loaded firearm in a public place.defendant was years old at the time of the offense.the trial court sentenced him as an adult to two years in state prison.
on appeal,defendant has four claims the evidence was insufficient to convict him of gross negligence in discharging a firearm the two convictions for possession of a firearm are unconstitutional based on the recent united states supreme court decision in district of columbia heller,d the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion to sever and the trial court prejudicially erred by not holding a hearing to determine if he was fit to be sentenced as an adult.we disagree and affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
on or about april,defendant began yelling at and insulting several individuals across the street near his house.the targets of defendant insults were standing in front of a neighbor home.after some time,defendant retreated into his house and returned with a large gun.one of the individuals defendant had insulted made a cell phone call.five to ten minutes later,codefendants miguel hernandez and juan cervantes arrived in a black car.cervantes got out of the car with a handgun and challenged defendant to put down his gun so they could fight like men.cervantes and defendant both dropped their guns.at some point,however,defendant picked up his gun and fired it two times.cervantes picked up his gun and got back into the black car,which then drove off quickly.
around this time,deputy sheriff kevin johnson arrived at the end of the street in a marked patrol car and saw the black car reversing at high speed toward his car.the black car slowed and then began to go forward.at that time,cervantes got partially out of the passenger side window and fired two to three shots.deputy johnson activated his sirens and pursued the black car.after a brief pursuit,the black car crashed several blocks away,and hernandez and cervantes were arrested.
the prosecutor brought several charges against defendant,including attempted murder.under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d,the attempted murder charge allowed the prosecutor to directly file charges against defendant in criminal court rather than petition for a hearing on whether defendant was a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law.welf,subd.d see,subd.b.the prosecutor charged defendant,hernandez,and cervantes in the same complaint.following the preliminary examination,where defendant and his codefendants were held to answer,defendant moved to sever the trials because all three defendants would be claiming and he argued their defenses were mutually antagonistic.the trial court denied the motion.
defendant admitted a prior juvenile adjudication for assault with a deadly weapon that made him a ward of the state.the jury found him guilty of gross negligence in discharging a firearm,possession of a firearm by a juvenile previously adjudged a ward of the juvenile court for assault with a deadly weapon,subd.e and possession of a loaded firearm in a public place,subd.a.the jury also found hernandez and cervantes guilty of several charges of particular relevance to defendant appeal,the jury found cervantes guilty of discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle.
before sentencing,defendant moved for a hearing on his fitness to be dealt with under the juvenile system.the trial court determined it had the discretion to grant such a hearing but found no need for one because it had considered the probation report and determined it was appropriate to treat defendant as an adult.the trial court sentenced defendant to two years in state prison.
discussion 
defendant heller claims fail because both statutes in question are constitutional as applied here 
defendant argues two of his three convictions are invalid because the statutes under which he was charged violate heller.specifically,he contends the prohibition of juvenile possession of a firearm,subd.e and the prohibition of possession of a loaded firearm in a public place,subd.a violate his second amendment right to possess firearms as articulated in heller.we disagree.
in heller,the high court addressed the constitutionality of a district of columbia law prohibiting the possession of all firearms in the district.district of columbia heller,supra,at.at,d at.the court analyzed the district law in light of the second amendment and found that an individual has the right to keep and bear firearms.id.at.at,d at.however,the court recognized this right is not limitless and provided a brief nonexhaustive list of exceptions to the rule of heller,including the state ability to prohibit felons from possessing firearms.id.at pp.at,d at.further,the court did not address whether this right is applicable to states or if it applied only to the federal government and left this as an open question id.at.at,d at.
for reasons articulated in people yarbrough th,d,defendant has the right to bring this heller claim,even though he did not raise it in the trial court.most importantly,defendant trial predated heller,making a timely objection impossible.yarbrough,at,d.further,the issue is still one of law presented by undisputed facts in the record before us that does not require the scrutiny of individual circumstances,but instead requires the review of abstract and generalized legal task that is suited to the role of an appellate court.id.at,d.
the prohibition of juvenile possession of firearms is not unconstitutional as applied here 
defendant contends penal code section,subdivision e unconstitutionally infringes on his right to bear arms as articulated in heller.this statute provides that an individual who has committed certain violent serious crimes while a juvenile and who is subsequently determined to be a ward of the state as a result of a violent serious crime is prohibited from possessing firearms until he or she is years old,subd.e.the statute similarity to penal code section,subdivision c,prohibition on possession of firearms by misdemeanants,which was upheld against constitutional challenge in people flores th,d,is helpful here.
in flores,the court upheld the statute against a heller challenge for several reasons.first,the flores court found penal code,subdivision c to be much narrower than the broad sweep of the statutes at issue in heller because the misdemeanant prohibition concerned itself only with a specific group of people who had committed a specific type of crime.people flores,supra,th at,d.second,the flores court noted the heller court recognized an exception to the right to bear arms for convicted felons.flores,at,d.and the flores court did not see any logical reason to not extend this exception to violent misdemeanants because t he public interest in a prohibition on firearms possession is at its apex in circumstances,as here,where a statute disarms persons who have proven unable to control violent criminal impulses.id.at,d.because the predicate crime of the defendant in flores was violent assault,which showed an inability to contain violent criminal impulses,the court reasoned that the application of penal code section,subdivision c to the defendant was particularly appropriate,given the public interest in preventing violent individuals from possessing guns.flores,at,d.
penal code section,subdivision e at issue here has the same purpose as the statute upheld in flores to disarm people who have proven an inability to control violent criminal impulses.see,subds.c,e.therefore,we see no reason to distinguish the two statutes for purposes of a heller challenge.the prohibition in penal code section,subdivision e is not a blanket prohibition,as was the case in heller,and it is narrowly tailored to achieve its result.the statute is further limited in scope because it prohibits possession or use of a firearm only for a specified length of time,until the person reaches years of age,subd.e.furthermore,the predicate crime here,assault with a deadly weapon,is violent
