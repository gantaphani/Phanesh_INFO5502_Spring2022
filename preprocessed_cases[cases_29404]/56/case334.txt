in this case,we address the issue of whether a party,by not objecting in the trial court,forfeits an objection to the failure to follow procedures related to an alternative permanent plan for indian children established by the legislature tribal customary adoption which became operative on july.stats,ch.
father,appeals a december order terminating his parental rights to the minor.he contends the juvenile court did not comply with welfare and institutions code section and ensure the minor indian tribe considered the appropriateness of a tribal customary adoption.the children services division of the butte county department of employment and social services the department initially conceded the claim,stating that because the social workers and the indian child welfare expert did not address the issue of tribal customary adoption,the matter must be reversed and remanded to allow for proper consideration.we requested supplemental briefing.the department now contends the issue is forfeited and any error was harmless.we agree.
we hold that to preserve claims related to the failure to follow the tribal customary adoption procedures,a parent must object on those grounds in the juvenile court.here,father failed to object to those procedural errors.further,any such errors were harmless here.accordingly,we affirm the juvenile court order.
procedural background 
these proceedings commenced in august.in september,the court found the minor was a dependent child as described by section,subdivision b because of parents ongoing drug use,father filthy home and father history of domestic violence.the minor was placed in a foster home with cynthia in september,where he has remained.
mother is tribally affiliated father is not.in march,the tyme maidu tribe,berry creek rancheria the tribe filed a notice of tribal intervention,in which it stated the minor is a member of or eligible for membership in the tribe and is the child of a member of the tribe.
in april,prior to the combined disposition and review hearing,the tribe filed a tribal resolution for preferred placement,which designated cynthia home as a designated indian home that met the tribe prevailing social and cultural standards and protects the best interests of indian children.in the resolution,the tribe specifically noted the foster family is an indian family,therefore the indian child will stay connected to his tribe and culture and have his special needs met.father opposed this placement.father wanted the minor to be placed with father relative.the juvenile court made dispositional findings and orders and set the case for a contested placement hearing.
the contested placement hearing was held in may.during the hearing,the court determined the minor to be an indian child within the meaning of the indian child welfare act icwa et.as to placement,the court determined it was not in the minor best interest to deviate from the tribal preference.accordingly,the minor remained with cynthia 
reunification services for both parents were terminated at the month review hearing in october,and the matter was set for a section hearing.
the selection and implementation report for the february section hearing indicated cynthia preferred a permanent plan of adoption,but was willing to defer to the wishes of the tribe.the department recommended a permanent plan of guardianship,with cynthia being declared the legal guardian.this plan was consistent with the tribe preference at that time as reflected in the selection and implementation report and the indian child welfare expert report.in february,cynthia was declared the legal guardian of the minor and the dependency proceedings were terminated.
on july,section became operative.the statute establishes tribal customary adoption as an alternative permanent plan for indian children.amendments to the california rules of court addressing tribal customary adoption also became effective in july.cal.rules of court,rule g,g,b,b,b,d,d c vi,d c,e,e.
in april,the department moved for a change in court order,requesting that the dependency proceedings be reinstated and a new section hearing be set,because cynthia was planning to move out of state and wanted to adopt the minor.father was not present at the hearing.mother stated she was willing to let cynthia adopt the minor,because the minor was happy and content with cynthia and she just wanted the best for the minor.the court resumed dependency jurisdiction and set the matter for another section hearing.
in the october,selection and implementation report,the department recommended that the minor be ordered into a permanent plan of adoption and parental rights be terminated.according to the report,the tribe had previously stated it would not object to adoption if mother were willing to relinquish her parental rights.although mother had indicated she was willing to relinquish her parental rights,at the time the selection and implementation report was written,she had not pursued relinquishment.
an indian child welfare expert,angelina arroyo,wrote a report dated october.she interviewed terilyn steele,the icwa director of the berry creek rancheria,who told her that the tribe supported the current placement,but did not support forced termination of parental rights and had not had contact with mother so as to justify support of adoption 
the section hearing was ultimately heard in december.father was present and represented by counsel.
by the time of the hearing,the minor was nine years old and had been living in his current home for seven years.he was happy living there and fully integrated with his three step siblings,who had all been adopted by the foster parents.the minor wanted to be adopted by his foster parents.the mother and father had not sought contact with the minor.the minor testified that he had not had any visits with either parent in four years the department recommended a permanent plan of adoption and termination of parental rights.father objected to the plan of adoption,testifying the only way they going to get my custody rights is if somebody puts a bullet in me.
arroyo testified she had now been informed mother was going to relinquish her parental rights.based on that relinquishment,the tribe supported a plan of adoption with cynthia arroyo also testified that based on her review of the records and mother relinquishment,continued custody of the children by the biological parents would result in serious emotional and physical harm to the minor.arroyo had not discussed with the tribe what its view would be if father did not support adoption.however,even after arroyo learned father opposed termination of his parental rights,it was still her recommendation that parental rights be terminated and that adoption be selected as the permanent plan.father did not mention the need to consider tribal customary adoption.
mother voluntarily relinquished her parental rights.based on the evidence,including arroyo testimony,the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that continued custody of the child by the parents is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.thus,father parental rights were terminated.the court also found by clear and convincing evidence it was likely the minor would be adopted.accordingly,adoption was selected as the permanent plan.about one week later,the tribe withdrew its intervention,stating that the tribe does not intervene in cases involving an indian mother relinquishing her parental rights voluntarily to a native home.
discussion 
on appeal,father contends the order terminating his parental rights must be reversed.for the first time,father complains that the juvenile court failed to comply with section and ensure the tribe considered whether tribal customary adoption was the appropriate permanent plan for the minor.in the face of the department concession that the error required reversal,we requested supplemental briefing on whether the issue was forfeited for failure to raise it in the trial court,and whether any error was harmless.both parties responded.
we conclude that the failure to object to deficiencies in the selection and implementation report or errors at the section hea
