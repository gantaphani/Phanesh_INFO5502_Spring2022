a deputy sheriff finds an intoxicated minor in a woodshed located to feet from the side of a house.the minor complies with the deputy requests to come out of the shed and to the street.a juvenile court finds true an allegation that the minor violated penal code section,subdivision f section f for being found in any public place under the influence of intoxicating liquor.can the true finding stand,either because the woodshed was a public place or because the minor ended up in a public place when he complied with the deputy requests to come out of the shed and to the street the answer to these questions is no.we therefore reverse the judgment against the minor 
factual and procedural background 
a juvenile petition was filed against the minor for disorderly conduct in violation of section f.that section penalizes as a misdemeanor a person who is found in any public place under the influence of intoxicating liquor in a condition that he is unable to exercise care for his own safety or the safety of others,or by reason of his being under the influence of intoxicating liquor interferes with or obstructs or prevents the free use of any street,sidewalk,or other public way.
at the jurisdictional hearing,the prosecutor presented the following testimony from plumas county sheriff deputy matthew beatley as proof of the allegation 
around midnight on a friday in march,deputy beatley arrived at the corner of a residential neighborhood in quincy where he saw two juveniles walking away from a house deputy beatley attempted contact with anyone who might be inside the house,but all the doors were locked and the lights were turned off.he walked around to the west side of the house to a woodshed that was about to feet from the house.he heard noises coming from inside.when he shined a flashlight inside,he saw the minor and another juvenile.the minor smelled strongly of alcohol,his eyes were red and watery,his speech was slurred,and he was unsteady on his feet.the minor admitted he had drank a lot that evening.
deputy beatley believed the minor was incapable of attending to his own safety.although it was a r eal cold night with a foot of snow on the ground,the minor was wearing just pants and a and it looked as though he had nowhere to go.
deputy beatley asked the minor to come out of the shed,and the minor complied.deputy beatley then asked him to come out to the street next to the patrol car,and again the minor complied.the minor was issued a citation and released to his parents,who were called to the scene.
after deputy beatley testimony,the court asked for a rgument.
the prosecutor responded as follows um,well,the minor has a right to a jurisdictional hearing,and that the best i can come up with.it the first time we had jurisdictional hearings with the minor.who knows if it will be the last.i find myself frustrated by the situation where most kids admitted to drinking.he out in the snow in a in a wood shed sic at midnight,some impaired gait,some impaired speech,red and watery eyes.he what,a f otherwise,if the court wants,if it the belief of everyone else in the courtroom that he free of crime,then that fine,too.
when the court asked the prosecutor to address the public place aspect of it,the prosecutor responded as follows it might he out in a wood shed sic,presumably on private property,with another guy who we do know who owns the house.it might be.not a bad issue.and whether or not an officer has a duty in that situation to respond such that he brings the child,if you will,out to to the public place,that he then finds himself on,whether that somehow exonerates him of the crime,or whether or not there circumstantial evidence that he would shortly be in a public place.if the court rules that the wood shed sic,or right outside the wood shed sic was a public place,those are open questions.and again,frankly,the minor drinking problem should probably not go much further with the court system in plumas county 
the court found sufficient evidence to sustain the allegation of violating section f,explaining the following w ith regard to the public place issue a lthough the officer either asked him to come out or told him to come out of the shed the minor apparently came out willingly.there was no evidence that he had to be dragged out of the shed.the officer then moved him out to the street.so i going to find that that was in a public place.
discussion 
the minor contends there was insufficient evidence to sustain the court true finding that he violated section f because,in the minor view,he was not found in any public place.he argues that the woodshed was not a public place and that the deputy actions compelling him to come to a public place can not satisfy the statutory requirement.we agree there was insufficient evidence to sustain the true finding because the minor was not found in any public place.
the woodshed was not a public place 
california courts have defined a public place within the meaning of section f variously depending on the facts of the case.people perez d.perez.in one of the earlier cases defining the term,our supreme court concluded that a barber shop was a public place for the reason that public has been defined as c ommon to all or many general open to common use,and o pen to common,or general use,participation,enjoyment,etc in re zorn cal d,zorn.
the zorn definitions were used and expanded on in several cases dealing with defendants found intoxicated near private residences.
in one such case,division three of the court of appeal,second appellate district held that a hallway of an apartment building was a public place.perez,supra,d at.there,two police officers went to the defendant front door in response to a call from the defendant wife that he had struck her in the face.id.at.one officer knocked on the door and called out,police officers.ibid.the d efendant opened the door and stepped out into the hallway with an empty whiskey bottle raised above his head.ibid.he appeared intoxicated,did not comply with the officer orders to drop the bottle,and tried to swing at the officer with the bottle.ibid.he was arrested for violating section f but prosecuted for and convicted of possessing heroin that was found in his pockets when he was being booked.perez,at.the appellate court reversed the judgment of dismissal that had been based on the trial court grant of the defendant motion to suppress evidence.id.at.in explaining why the hallway was a public place,the appellate court noted the zorn definitions and stated t here were no locked gates or doors to keep the public from entering and h allways and stairways of multiple dwellings are open to delivery men,service men,solicitors,visitors and other strangers in other words,a public place is a location readily accessible to all those who wish to go there rather than a place which the general public frequents.perez,at.
in two cases in which the defendants were in the front yards of private residences,the courts of appeal reached different conclusions as to whether they were found in a public place,again using and expanding the zorn definitions.
in the first front yard case,division one of the court of appeal,second appellate district applied the zorn definitions of a public place to find that police had reasonable cause to believe that an intoxicated defendant had violated section f in front of a house.people olson d.olson.there,the defendant rang the doorbell of a stranger home,and the owner let her in to make a telephone call.id.at.the defendant ended up falling asleep at the kitchen table,and the owner called police to get help for the defendant.id.at.the police arrived,helped the defendant regain consciousness,asked her to step out of the house,and once outside,determined she was intoxicated.id.at.they arrested her for violating section f and transported her to the police station where she was booked.olson,at.during the procedure,two bindles of heroin were found in her purse.ibid.the appellate court affirmed the trial court denial of the defendant motion to suppress evidence.id.at.the appellate court explained,as to the area outside in the front of the house,whether it be the driveway,lawn or fron
