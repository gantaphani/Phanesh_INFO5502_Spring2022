michael has a long history of involvement in the juvenile justice system.while several of the incidents involved sexual overtones,only the last adjudication involved a felony.as a result of this adjudication,michael was committed to the california youth authority cya.
the people filed a petition pursuant to welfare and institutions code section et shortly before michael commitment was scheduled to expire on his birthday.the juvenile court ordered michael commitment extended for two years after a contested court trial 
michael argues the proceedings in the juvenile court violated his rights to due process and to equal protection of the laws.he also argues there was not substantial evidence to support the necessary findings to continue his commitment.
the supreme court recently upheld section et in the face of a due process challenge by construing the statutory scheme to require a finding that the person mental deficiency,disorder,or abnormality causes serious difficulty in controlling his or her dangerous behavior.in re howard cal th,d.
taking our cue from the supreme court,we will uphold the constitutionality of section et by construing the statutory scheme to require that the person mental deficiency,disorder,or abnormality causes serious difficulty in controlling his or her behavior,resulting in a serious and risk of reoffense.we also hold that this requirement must be alleged in the petition seeking extended commitment and demonstrated at the probable cause hearing and trial.because the petition seeking to extend michael commitment did not contain the necessary allegations,we will reverse the order of commitment and remand to the juvenile court.
we reject michael equal protection arguments because howard and our due process analysis render them moot.we do not address,and express no opinion on,other potential due process arguments that were not asserted in this court.
factual and procedural summary 
michael first contact with the juvenile justice system occurred in when he was arrested after he entered a neighbor house late at night.michael removed his clothes after entering the house and proceeded to the bedroom where his neighbor was sleeping.michael fled when she awoke.the neighbor chased and caught michael hiding outside.

in april michael admitted he violated his probation by failing to report to probation as ordered,stealing funds from school,disobeying his parents,and taking ammunition to school.he remained on probation and was committed to juvenile hall for three weekends.
in november michael admitted violating his probation by violating penal code section,subdivision a annoying a child under the age of.the conduct resulting in this violation occurred when michael and a developmentally disabled youth engaged in mutual masturbation at school during breaks and before lunch.michael was continued on probation and placed in a group home.

the parties apparently agreed that michael needed intense therapy in a highly structured setting.a satisfactory disposition could not be reached because of the misdemeanor offenses,so the people filed a new petition alleging the same incidents constituted a violation of penal code section,subdivision a.michael remained in the custody of his parents under house arrest pending the adjudication hearing.
three weeks later,before the adjudication of the last petition,a new petition was filed alleging that michael violated his probation by refusing to obey his parents,shoplifting from a store,and being verbally abusive to his family.michael was detained in juvenile hall until the adjudication hearing.
michael raised the double jeopardy bar to the penal code section petition,arguing the incident arose out of the same acts as the indecent exposure petition.the people argued the indecent exposure incident related to a specific incident,and the new petition related to several incidents that occurred before the indecent exposure.
michael eventually withdrew his motion to dismiss and admitted he violated penal code section,subdivision a.the juvenile court ordered michael to undergo a cya evaluation.the juvenile court followed the subsequent recommendation and committed michael to cya.
michael was committed to cya when he was two months shy of his birthday.the people filed a petition to extend michael commitment pursuant to section et a little more than three months before michael birthday.
after receiving evidence,the juvenile court issued its ruling.
the court finds the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that michael has a mental or physical deficiency,disorder,or abnormality.he has,but not limited to,been diagnosed with paraphilia,if not pedophilia,that has not been alleviated,particularly by his own failure to take part in his treatment,and as a result of that he is physically dangerous to the public.

further,as a result of his mental or physical deficiency,disorder,or abnormality,michael has serious difficulty in controlling his behavior.
finally,as a result of such loss of control there is a serious and risk of.
the petition is therefore sustained.the minor is ordered recommitted for a period of two years.
michael appeals from the order extending his commitment.
discussion 
due processa.california civil commitment statutes 
our discussion of michael right to due process is guided by the supreme court recent decision in howard n.we begin,however,with the various civil commitment schemes that exist in california.
in the legislature enacted the sexually violent predators act svp act,which is codified in section et.stats,ch.the svp act provides for the involuntary civil commitment of certain offenders.an offender is eligible for commitment as a sexually violent predator svp if he or she has been convicted of sexually violent offenses as defined in section,subd.a against two or more victims,and he or she has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent behavior,subd.a.a diagnosed mental disorder is defined as a congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to the commission of criminal sexual acts in a degree constituting the person a menace to the health and safety of others,subd.c.
the mentally disordered offender act mdo act,et applies to certain offenders about to be released on parole.an offender is eligible for commitment under the mdo act if all of the following are met he or she has a severe mental disorder that is not in remission or can not be kept in remission without treatment,subd.a the disorder must have been one of the causes of or was an aggravating factor in the commission of a crime for which he or she was sentenced to prison,subd.b he or she has been in treatment for the severe mental disorder for days or more within the year prior to the release date,subd.c before his or her parole or release,the treating physician and other specified medical authorities certify that each of the noted conditions exist and,because of the disorder,the offender represents a substantial danger of physical harm to others,subd.d and the crime for which the prisoner was sentenced to prison was punished by a determinate sentence under penal code section,subd.e and is specifically listed in the mdo act,subd.e a q.
the act lps act et is a comprehensive scheme designed to address a variety of circumstances in which a member of the general population may need to be evaluated or treated for different lengths of time.citations.cooley superior court cal th,d.a person who,as a result of mental disorder,is a danger to others,or to himself or herself,or gravely disabled,may be taken into custody and placed in a designated facility for varying periods,depending on the circumstances.
section et provides for the civil commitment of individuals under the control of cya.the scheme provides that if the youthful offender parole board yopb determines that discharge of a person from cya would be physically dangerous to the public because of the person mental or physical deficiency,disorder,or abnormality,the yopb may request that a petition be filed seeking continued commitment of the person.
sections,and were added by statute in.stats,ch.section was added by statute in.stats,ch.these statutes have been amended infrequently some,if not most,of the amendments were in response to constitutional challenges to other civil commitment statutes 
b.the current state of the law 
legislation similar to california svp act has appeared throughout the country.constitutional challenges to the svp act have reached both the california supreme court and the united states supreme court.these decisions have established constitutional limitations on civil commitment statutes.
kansas sexually violent predator act the kansas act,similar to the svp act people williams cal th,d,williams,was challenged on substantive due process grounds in kansas hendricks,d hendricks.hendricks was a pedophile who admittedly had trouble controlling his urge to molest children when he became stressed out.id.at.the kansas act defined a sexually violent predator as any person who has been convicted of or charged with a sexually violent offense and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in the predatory acts of sexual violence.citation.a mental abnormality was defined,in turn,as a congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity which predisposes the person to commit sexually violent offenses in a degree constituting such person a menace to the health and safety of others.citation.id.at.
the kansas supreme court invalidated the kansas act,concluding it violated hendricks right to due process because the statute definition of mental abnormality did not satisfy the constitutional requirement that civil commitment statutes be limited to those individuals who have a mental illness.hendricks,supra,at.
the united states supreme court acknowledged that states have in certain narrow circumstances provided for the forcible civil detainment of people who are unable to control their behavior and who thereby pose a danger to the public health and safety.citations.we have consistently upheld such involuntary commitment statutes,provided the confinement takes place pursuant to proper procedures and evidentiary standards.citations.a finding of dangerousness,standing alone,is ordinarily not a sufficient ground upon which to justify indefinite involuntary commitment.we have sustained civil commitment statutes when they have coupled proof of dangerousness with the proof of some additional factor,such as a mental illness or mental abnormality.citations.these added statutory requirements serve to limit involuntary civil confinement to those who suffer from a volitional impairment rendering them dangerous beyond their control.hendricks,supra,at.the supreme court concluded the kansas act satisfied the above requirements and did not violate hendricks right to equal protection.id.at.the supreme court also held the kansas act was a civil commitment statute that did not implicate either ex post facto or double jeopardy principles.id.at.
the supreme court revisited the kansas act in kansas crane,d crane.the kansas supreme court vacated crane commitment as a sexually violent predator,concluding that hendricks required the state to prove that crane could not control his dangerous behavior and the state had failed to meet this burden.the united states supreme court held that hendricks did not impose such a requirement.crane,at.
we do not agree with the state,however,insofar as it seeks to claim that the constitution permits commitment of the type of dangerous sexual offender considered in hendricks without any determination.citation.hendricks underscored the constitutional importance of distinguishing a dangerous sexual offender subject to civil commitment from other dangerous persons who are perhaps more properly dealt with exclusively through criminal proceedings.citation.that distinction is necessary lest civil commitment become a mechanism for retribution or general deterrence functions properly those of criminal law,not civil commitment.citation.the presence of what the psychiatric profession itself classifie d as a serious mental disorder helped to make that distinction in hendricks.and a critical distinguishing feature of that serious disorder there consisted of a special and serious lack of ability to control behavior.in recognizing that fact,we did not give to the phrase lack of control a particularly narrow or technical meaning.and we recognize that in cases where lack of control is at issue,inability to control behavior will not be demonstrable with mathematical precision.it is enough to say that there must be proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior.and this,when viewed in light of such features of the case as the nature of the psychiatric diagnosis,and the severity of the mental abnormality itself,must be sufficient to distinguish the dangerous sexual offender whose serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder subjects him to civil commitment from the dangerous but typical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal case.citations.crane,supra,at.second italics added.
the california supreme court has addressed the svp act on several occasions.in hubbart superior court cal th,d,the supreme court cited hendricks extensively in rejecting due process,equal protection and ex post facto challenges to the svp act.in rejecting the defendant claim that the svp act deprived him of due process because it did not incorporate a mental illness requirement,the supreme court stated,much like the kansas law at issue in hendricks,our statute defines a sexually violent predator as a person who has committed sexually violent crimes and who currently suffers from a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior,subd.a.through this language,the svp act plainly requires a finding of dangerousness.the statute then links that finding to a currently diagnosed mental disorder characterized by the inability to control dangerous sexual behavior.citation.this formula permissibly circumscribes the class of persons eligible for commitment under the svp act.hubbart,at,d,fn.omitted.in rejecting another argument,the supreme court reaffirmed that due process requires an inability to control dangerous conduct citation.ibid.
the supreme court revisited the svp act in people superior court ghilotti cal th,d,ghilotti.the defendant was confined under the svp act when the director of the state department of mental health the director designated two psychologists to examine him formally.both psychologists concluded the defendant no longer met the statutory conditions for confinement.the director disagreed and a petition was filed to continue the commitment under the svp act.
the supreme court rejected the attorney general suggestion that the svp act permitted the filing of a petition,even in the absence of the recommendation of two psychologists.ghilotti,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court,however,held that the director retained the ability to challenge the formal evaluations if he or she concluded that the evaluations did not comply with the statutory framework.id.at,d.
