a jury convicted jaime guadalupe gonzalez of first degree murder count,subd.a all further undesignated statutory references are to this code and street terrorism count,subd.a for killing year old juan carlos cena.the jury found true a special circumstance allegation that gonzalez,who was years old at the time of the offense,intentionally committed the murder for a criminal street gang purpose,subd.a,and found true a gang penalty enhancement allegation,subd.b.the jury also found gonzalez was a principal in committing a gang offense involving the intentional discharge of a firearm causing death,subds.d e.the trial court sentenced gonzalez to a term of years to life for count,consisting of years to life for first degree murder and a consecutive years to life term for the firearm use enhancement.the court stayed under section gonzalez street terrorism sentence on count.gonzalez now contends his youth at the time of the offense renders his lengthy sentence cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the federal and state constitutions,cal.
he relies on miller alabama.miller,which precludes for juvenile offenders a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole lwop.gonzalez argues the mandatory term the trial court imposed is tantamount to an lwop sentence based on actuarial tables showing a life expectancy in his mid,which he asserts is overstated given the dangers of prison life.in any event,he contends his sentence is unconstitutional because it denies him the possibility of any meaningful period outside prison on parole if he demonstrates rehabilitation.his core premise is mistaken,however.he does not face lwop.new legislation effective january,provides for a parole hearing for juvenile offenders like gonzalez in the year of their incarceration,usually within their life expectancy by a matter of decades and therefore well within constitutional norms.we also find no merit in gonzalez,disproportional punishment challenge or his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.we therefore affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
on december,gonzalez shot and killed cena in a second encounter after two of cena friends dropped him off near an anaheim intersection.according to cena friends,cena planned to sell shampoo they had stolen from a store so they could use the proceeds to buy drugs.the trio belonged to the kodiak criminal street gang,while gonzalez belonged to kodiak rival,the underhill gang.in an initial encounter,cena friends saw gonzalez and a companion engage cena in a conversation that did not appear friendly,but there was no yelling.cena returned safely to his friends truck,and they dropped him off at the balsom and curtis intersection.before the truck could make a to retrieve cena,two shots rang out,felling cena.the police and an ambulance responded,but cena never regained consciousness and bled to death from his injuries.
more than a year later,gonzalez mother discovered a firearm in his possession and turned it over to the police.a ballistics test at the time did not connect the weapon,which had a damaged barrel,to cena shooting.gonzalez admitted in a police interview only that he had received the gun as an underhill gang member trying to earn his stripes,and that he had used it to fire shots in the air to scare off rival la jolla gang members in a different incident.
in,a fellow gang member identified gonzalez as the person who shot cena and agreed to wear a recording device while he briefly shared a jail cell with gonzalez,who was incarcerated on other charges.but gonzalez admitted in the recording only that he possessed the handgun his mother discovered.the gang associate,however,also identified gonzalez accomplice on the day of the shooting,ricardo castaneda.
in may,officers arrested castaneda on an outstanding traffic warrant,he admitted his role in the shooting,and at trial in may,castaneda identified gonzalez as the shooter.a new ballistics test conducted with the aid of d printing technology to account for the damaged barrel on gonzalez gun confirmed the weapon matched the bullet retrieved when cena died on a hospital gurney.the jury convicted gonzalez as noted,and the trial court held a sentencing hearing in july.
at the time of sentencing,gonzalez was years old and already serving an year sentence for assaulting a police officer with a firearm.the trial court imposed a years to life sentence and ordered it to run concurrently with gonzalez year assault sentence.the trial court credited gonzalez with just over a year of pretrial incarceration,days,and gonzalez now appeals his years to life sentence.

categorical rules governing punishment and process in the juvenile context 
in the juvenile context,because juvenile offenders can not with reliability be classified among the worst offenders roper simmons,roper,certain categorical rules graham florida,graham have emerged to mitigate the risk of disproportionate punishment.as graham explained,the court cases addressing the proportionality of sentences fall within two general classifications.the first involves challenges to the length of sentences given all the circumstances in a particular case.the second comprises cases in which the court implements the proportionality standard by certain categorical restrictions on the death penalty.id.at.in graham,the high court extended its categorical approach to bar lwop sentences for juveniles in nonhomicide cases.id.at the present case involves an issue the court has not considered previously a categorical challenge to a sentence.
the high court cautioned its categorical approach in graham was not suited for considering a gross proportionality challenge to a particular defendant sentence on an basis,but instead applies w here a sentencing practice itself is in question.graham,supra,at this case implicates a particular type of sentence as it applies to an entire class of offenders who have committed a range of crimes.
the supreme court categorical line of cases has yielded several rules.the death penalty may not be imposed on juvenile offenders.roper,supra,at.an lwop sentence may not be imposed on a juvenile who commits a nonhomicide offense.graham,at.similarly,our supreme court has explained that a de facto lwop sentence,including for example a sentence of years to life,is constitutionally barred in juvenile nonhomicide cases.people caballero cal th,caballero.
miller recently established another rule in the juvenile context a mandatory lwop sentence may not be imposed on a juvenile even in homicide cases because the sentencing court must take into account how children are different,and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.miller,supra.at,italics added.gonzalez relies heavily on miller,and we therefore explore it in some depth.
in miller,the high court noted,our decision does not categorically bar a penalty for a class of offenders or type of crime as,for example,we did in roper or graham.miller.at.the court emphasized it did not reach the defendants argument that the eighth amendment requires a categorical bar on life without parole for juveniles,or at least for those and younger.id.at.instead,the court decision in miller mandates only that a sentencer follow a certain process considering an offender youth and attendant characteristics before imposing a particular penalty.id.at,italics added.
miller emphasis on a constitutionally adequate process traces back to the high court jurisprudence in death penalty cases,where the court held capricious infliction of the state most severe penalty violates the eighth amendment.see,furman georgia,conc.opn.of stewart,these death sentences are cruel and unusual in the same way that being struck by lightning is cruel and unusual see also solem helm,solem the death penalty is different from other punishments in kind rather than degree.
miller observed that just as the eighth amendment requires the heightened procedural safeguard of individual sentencing consideration because death is different,children are different too.miller,supra.at.the court therefore held individualized consideration is similarly necessary before an lwop sentence may be imposed on a juvenile.t he eighth amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile offenders.id.at,italics added.a sentencing process mandating a blind eye to the very factors that make juveniles different is arbitrary and capricious in light of the irrevocable penalty at stake.by making youth and all that accompanies it irrelevant to imposition of that harshest prison sentence,such a scheme poses too great a risk of disproportionate punishment.ibid.
the court in miller acknowledged its precedent did not require individualized sentencing in noncapital cases involving adults.miller,supra.at,citing harmelin,supra,upholding mandatory term for adult convicted of possessing more than grams of cocaine.but as miller explained,just as children are different from adults,an lwop term is distinct from other sentences in its severity for children.in graham,for example,the court recognized that for juveniles an lwop share s some characteristics with death sentences that are shared by no other sentences,primarily as a forfeiture that is irrevocable.graham,supra,at this sentence means denial of hope.
while an lwop sentence is for an adult far more severe than any other term of years solem,supra,at,it is even more so for a juvenile.under this sentence a juvenile offender will on average serve more years and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an adult offender.a year old and a year old each sentenced to life without parole receive the same punishment in name only.graham,at.thus,while a defining characteristic of youth is its malleability,an lwop sentence means that good behavior and character improvement are immaterial it means that whatever the future might hold in store for the mind and spirit of the juvenile convict,he will remain in prison for the rest of his days.ibid.
accordingly,observing it is no surprise that the law relating to society harshest punishments recognizes a distinction for children,the court in miller held that a judge or jury must have the opportunity to consider mitigating circumstances before imposing the harshest possible penalty for juveniles.miller,supra.at.absent such consideration,the defendants in miller gained an automatic reversal of their lwop sentences.as the court explained,by requiring that all children convicted of homicide receive lifetime incarceration without possibility of parole,regardless of their age and characteristics and the nature of their crimes,the mandatory sentencing schemes before us violate this principle of proportionality,and so the eighth amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment.id.at.
in effect,miller and graham recognize that lwop sentences are for juveniles analogous to the death penalty for adults.consequently,the constitution requires individualized consideration of the distinctive mitigating features of a minor age and attendant circumstances,just as it requires an individualized assessment of a death penalty defendant culpability and character.
miller,graham,roper,and caballero all derive their rules from the fundamental distinction that juveniles,particularly in the early and middle teen years,are more vulnerable,more impulsive,and less than adults,and therefore may deserve less punishment because adolescents may have less capacity to control their conduct and to think in terms thompson oklahoma,see also in re nunez th,noting supporting scholarly research,including that the steepest inflection point in the development curve occurs sometime between age and years.
based on these differences,the high court observed in roper the susceptibility of juveniles to immature and irresponsible behavior means their irresponsible conduct is not as morally reprehensible as that of an adult.citation.their own vulnerability and comparative lack of control over their immediate surroundings mean juveniles have a greater claim than adults to be forgiven for failing to escape negative influences in their whole environment.citation.the reality that juveniles still struggle to define their identity means it is less supportable to conclude that even a heinous crime committed by a juvenile is evidence of irretrievably depraved character.from a moral standpoint it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult,for a greater possibility exists that a minor character deficiencies will be reformed.roper,supra,at.
these observations also informed graham,caballero,and miller,for as the court explained in miller,imposing m andatory life without parole for a juvenile precludes consideration of his chronological age and its hallmark features among them,immaturity,impetuosity,and failure to appreciate risks and consequences.it prevents taking into account the family and home environment that surrounds him and from which he can not usually extricate himself no matter how brutal or dysfunctional.it neglects the circumstances of the homicide offense,including the extent of his participation in the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures may have affected him.miller,supra.at.
gonzalez is not entitled to automatic reversal under the foregoing rules 
gonzalez relies principally on miller,which was decided about a month before his sentencing hearing.he claims he falls within miller proscription against mandatory lwop sentences because the applicable sentencing and enhancement scheme mandated his sentence of years to life,and that sentence amounts to a de facto lwop.specifically,he notes his sentence of years to life for murder is mandatory,subd.a,see people demirdjian th,demirdjian for juveniles under who were or when the crime was committed,a life term without the possibility of parole is not permitted,leaving a term of years to life with possibility of parole.and the consecutive enhancement of years to life for discharging a firearm causing death is also mandatory,subd.d.because the mandatory length of his sentence amounts to an lwop term,gonzalez asserts he is entitled to reversal and on remand an individualized sentencing determination,as in miller.
while miller involved an actual lwop sentence and not as here an assertedly de facto lwop term,miller acknowledged the reasoning in graham implicates any sentence imposed on a juvenile,including a sentence imposed on a juvenile convicted of murder.miller,supra.at,italics added accord,caballero,supra,cal th at applying graham rationale to bar de facto lwop sentences for juveniles in nonhomicide cases.indeed,while the high court in miller was careful to emphasize graham categorical bar against juvenile lwop sentences applied only to nonhomicide crimes miller,at,the court also observed that none of what graham said about children about their distinctive and transitory mental traits and environmental vulnerabilities is so graham reasoning implicates any sentence imposed on a juvenile,even as its categorical bar relates only to nonhomicide offenses.miller,at,italics added accord,caballero,at.thus,caballero held a de facto lwop term implicates the same constitutional considerations that barred in graham an actual lwop sentence for juveniles in nonhomicide cases.caballero,at.
we see no reason the same analysis should not apply to bar mandatory de facto juvenile lwop terms in homicide cases.the reasoning in miller extends not just to mandatory sentences that impose an actual lwop term on a juvenile,but also to mandatory sentences tantamount to an lwop term.
gonzalez contends his sentence amounts to a de facto lwop term.he argues that because he was sentenced at age,with credit for a year of time served,then even assuming he is eligible for parole after serving years will,at age,push him close to the brink of a life expectancy of years.he obtains this figure from people mendez th,involving the projected life expectancy of an year old defendant.we note that life expectancy projections derived on appeal vary widely in recent juvenile lwop cases.in another recent case the projected life expectancy of a year old male defendant was only years.people martin th,review granted on.in people solis th wl,fn,another year old defendant requested and was granted judicial notice on appeal of actuarial tables showing a life expectancy of years.other actuarial projections are as high as years.see national center for health statistics,centers for disease control and prevention,national vital statistics,vol,table.had gonzalez faced trial and the consequences of his conviction promptly at age,he would be eligible for parole under a year sentence around age,well within an year life span.
gonzalez contends all actuarial estimates overstate his life expectancy because he is incarcerated,and therefore his life span in reality may be considerably shorter.see solis,supra,th wl,considering the health hazards associated with prison life,an estimated life expectancy of years may actually be optimistic.gonzalez cites a source discussing persistent problems in united states prisons of rape,gang violence,the use of excessive force by officers,and contagious diseases the commission on safety and abuse in america prisons,confronting confinement june as of march.
gonzalez also suggests that life prisoners rarely obtain parole on their first opportunity and therefore,based on his asserted life expectancy of years,an initial parole hearing at age is too late to ensure a meaningful chance to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.graham,supra,at.as gonzalez phrases it,a handful of years is not substantial.absent a meaningful period of potential release on parole,gonzalez argues his sentence is tantamount to an lwop.see people perez th,perez there is a bright line between lwops and long sentences with eligibility for parole if there is some meaningful life expectancy left when the offender becomes eligible for parole,original italics.
gonzalez further argues his minimum year sentence does not accurately reflect the time he will serve before he is eligible for parole because the board of parole hearings parole board calculates a base term,tit,a for parole eligibility that adds several more years to the determinate portion of the sentence based on the nature of the murder and the victim involved.according to gonzalez,depending on where the particular offense falls in the matrix of base terms,a parole board panel fixes the base term,typically considering mitigating and aggravating circumstances.here,the murder of a person not well known to appellant and whose death was fairly immediate yields under the matrix of base terms for first degree murder see,tit,b a base term range of years.gonzalez elaborates assuming the panel would select the middle term of years for appellant case,added to which is the additional minimum term of years for the gun use,that is a minimum of years appellant will be required to serve before being considered eligible to actually be released on parole.so in reality,appellant will be about years old at that point,two years past an optimistic life expectancy of years.
gonzalez calculation,however,ignores the eight years he escaped accountability and defied justice.this is particularly true given he demonstrated no hint of remorse or reform in that time.to the contrary,he promptly reoffended by pointing a firearm at a peace officer and continued to menace society by committing other felonies.it would be a perverse incentive indeed to count that period towards gonzalez release instead of against it.
in any event,gonzalez calculations are fatally flawed for another reason,as we explain.
gonzalez challenge under miller fails because sb effectively modifies his sentence to afford him a parole date well within his life expectancy.sb specifies in its preamble the legislature recognizes that youthfulness both lessens a juvenile moral culpability and enhances the prospect that,as a youth matures into an adult and neurological development occurs,these individuals can become contributing members of society.the purpose of this act is to establish a parole eligibility mechanism that provides a person serving a sentence for crimes that he or she committed as a juvenile the opportunity to obtain release when he or she has shown that he or she has been rehabilitated and gained maturity,in accordance with the decision of the california supreme court in people caballero cal th and the decisions of the united states supreme court in graham florida,and miller alabama d.stats,ch.
specifically,sb provides in new section,subdivision b,for a parole hearing in the year of incarceration for juvenile offenders like gonzalez,sentenced to prison for a term of or longer.gonzalez will enter his year of incarceration and receive under the statute a parole hearing when he is years old.that affords gonzalez a substantial parole period outside prison if he demonstrates reform,even under the earliest projections.consequently,gonzalez incarceration,although lengthy and under a mandatory sentence,does not implicate miller s per se ban on mandatory lwop terms for juveniles.he similarly falls outside caballero holding that de facto lwop terms may be tantamount to an lwop for constitutional purposes.simply put,under the new legislation,gonzalez does not face the prospect of life in prison without the possibility of parole.therefore,miller does not apply,and neither does caballero recognition that a lengthy term of years may amount to an lwop sentence.
the court in in re heard th heard recently reached a contrary conclusion concerning the relevance of sb.there,the trial court sentenced a juvenile defendant to years to life for two nonhomicide offenses he committed when he was years old,plus a consecutive year term for an unrelated voluntary manslaughter he committed at age.on appeal,the heard court explained sb did not alleviate its constitutional concerns about the length of the juvenile sentence.the court found persuasive the defendant contentions he is not guaranteed to receive an opportunity to avail himself of sb,given it could be repealed,and sb passage does not remedy the sentencing court failure to consider the mitigating circumstances of heard youth,as required by miller,supra.heard,supra,th at.
in our view,these contentions in heard do not suffice to disregard the parole opportunity sb affords to juvenile offenders.first,while sb theoretically may be repealed or modified in the future,that is true of all legislation.it is speculative to suppose the law may change before gonzalez parole hearing,and we therefore must consider the law and its constitutional effect as we find it,according to its present terms.notably,sb is a statutory provision,and therefore does not establish its year parole hearing date as a constitutional minimum or maximum.if the legislature later liberalizes parole consideration for youthful offenders still further with an earlier hearing date,subd.d providing for recall of juvenile lwop sentences at,or years,upon specified showing,or if the legislature instead restricts sb to afford a parole hearing after years of incarceration instead of in the year,reviewing courts will assess those changes in due course.
second and related,given the parole opportunity afforded by sb,the state has not subjected gonzalez to the penalty proscribed in miller mandatory life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.in effect,the reversal in heard compels judicial fine tuning of a defendant sentence even though the legislature in section has set a parole date within constitutional norms.we therefore find too broad and unmoored from high court authority the remedy of per se reversal adopted in heard for a sentencing court failure to consider the mitigating circumstances of the defendant youth,as required by miller.heard,supra,th at.as noted,the rules resulting in reversal in miller and its antecedents turned on the constitutional danger of gross disproportionality in irrevocably subjecting juveniles to the harshest penalties available by law the death penalty in roper,lwop for nonhomicide offenses in graham,and mandatory lwop in miller.the same was true in caballero for a de facto lwop in nonhomicide cases.
outside of these contexts,the presumption applies that the legislature in enacting prescribed penalties and trial courts in imposing them have each acted within constitutional bounds.wingo,supra,cal d at.reviewing courts therefore do not have roving authority to order remand to fine tune a juvenile defendant sentence with strict proportionality to his or her culpability and prospects for reform.as a panel of this court explained in perez,there is no rule of constitutional authority that requires discretion to reduce penalties when minors are sentenced for adult crimes to periods which still leave them a substantial life expectancy after release from prison.perez,supra,th at,original italics.
in other words,roper,miller,graham,and caballero do not apply to sentences which leave the possibility of a substantial life expectancy after prison,are not de facto lwop or functional lwop.perez,supra,th at.to conclude otherwise would put in question every mandatory sentencing provision and effectively prohibit determinate sentencing in favor of individualized sentencing,usurping the legislature role.to the contrary,however,reviewing courts must grant substantial deference to the broad authority that legislatures necessarily possess in determining the types and limits of punishments for crimes,as well as to the discretion that trial courts possess in sentencing convicted criminal.solem,surpa,at.
perez did not involve the prospect of life in prison without parole because the defendant two consecutive sentences of years to life for offenses he committed at age made him eligible for parole no later than age.perez,supra,th at.accordingly,perez held the per se rule of reversal in miller and its line of cases did not apply.here,we similarly can not ignore that under sb gonzalez will be eligible for parole in his year of incarceration when he is years old.he does not face the prospect of life in prison without the possibility of parole.consequently,miller per se reversal based on imposition of a mandatory,irrevocable lwop has no applicability here.we therefore part company with heard to the extent it required remand for the trial court to fine tune the defendant sentence based on his youth,even though under sb his effective prison term was no longer tantamount to an lwop.
true,gonzalez sentencing postdated miller and predated sb.imposition of a mandatory lwop at the time gonzalez was sentenced,without consideration of his youth and without the ameliorating effect of sb,constituted error.sb,however,cured or rendered moot any error under miller in the sentencing hearing gonzalez received.
gonzalez argues that if sb is repealed,he will have lost the opportunity to present an accurate picture of his or her individual characteristics at the time of the offense,and even if there is no repeal or modification,it will be more difficult years down the road at a parole suitability hearing to show his diminished culpability at the time of the offense based on his youth.this challenge fails for two reasons.first,the presentence or probation report,trial proceedings,and record of any pretrial hearings or police investigation often describe a defendant youthful characteristics or other mitigating circumstances.moreover,it is the defendant responsibility to make a record of mitigating circumstances and,if this is not done at trial or sentencing,to do so in making a record for relief on habeas corpus.sb does not alter the defendant responsibility to make this record nor would its repeal 
second,we emphasize the particularized,considerations gonzalez raises are outside the domain of the challenges addressed in roper,graham,miller,and caballero.as noted,sb necessarily affects our review because with the parole eligibility it affords,gonzalez does not face the prospect of irrevocable imprisonment that triggered reversal in those cases.of course,the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment is not limited to the circumstances identified in miller and its antecedents.as noted in perez q uite apart from miller,graham,roper,or caballero,a defendant claim of disproportional punishment based on the diminished culpability of youth may amount to a claim his sentence must be reduced under the older california supreme court jurisprudence of gross disproportionality,as shown primarily in lynch,supra,cal d and dillon,supra,cal d.perez,supra,th at.the federal constitution provides for a similar review for extreme sentences that are grossly disproportionate to the crime.ewing california.we now turn to those claims.
as applied and iac challenges 
gonzalez contends his lwop sentence does not reflect his actual culpability and prospects for reform.an challenge is subject to forfeiture,however,and gonzalez did not raise the issue of cruel and unusual or disproportionate punishment below.specifically,a challenge based on the particular characteristics of the defendant or the offense may be forfeited by failing to raise it.people dejesus th,demirdjian,supra,th at correct term is forfeiture,not waiver.forfeiture is particularly appropriate where resolution of factual issues is necessary to determine whether the sentence is grossly disproportionate to the offender culpability.people kelley th.nevertheless,an appellate court may reach the issue on the record presented demirdijian,at,often in the interest of judicial economy to prevent the inevitable iac claim.people em th,fn.
here indeed,gonzalez asserts an iac claim based on counsel failure to object to the sentence in view of appellant individual characteristics.as gonzalez phrases it neither did counsel develop the record by supplying evidence of appellant upbringing,family dynamics,educational difficulties,or peer pressures,though some of that information is contained in the overall record from the trial.while miller may have suggested to competent counsel the importance of challenging even mandatory sentences for juvenile homicide defendants,we do not resolve the iac claim on that ground.to prevail on a claim counsel rendered constitutionally defective assistance,the challenger must show his attorney representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that he suffered prejudice as a result.strickland washington,strickland people ledesma cal d.prejudice arises only if there is a reasonable probability of a more favorable result absent counsel failings.strickland,at.we may first consider whether defendant suffered any prejudice from the attorney alleged failings,without determining counsel failed to provide effective representation.people cox cal d,disapproved on another ground in people doolin cal th,fn.
the standard under the california constitution for counsel to have obtained a reduced sentence despite mandatory statutory provisions see,dillon requires a showing that gonzalez punishment is so disproportionate to the crime for which it is inflicted that it shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity.lynch,supra,cal d at.the showing must demonstrate the punishment is grossly disproportionate in light of the nature of the offense and the defendant personal characteristics,punishment for more serious offenses,and punishment for similar offenses in other jurisdictions.ibid.
the federal standard is virtually identical a court proportionality analysis under the eighth amendment should be guided by objective criteria,including i the gravity of the offense and the harshness
