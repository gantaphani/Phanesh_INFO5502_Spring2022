section petition with respect to

mother section petition with respect to 
on may,mother filed a section petition with respect to which alleged the same change of circumstance stated in mother section petition as to,namely,that mother had completed domestic violence and substance abuse programs as well as a parenting and anger management program,she has continued to test negative and has attended meetings.mother requested family reunification services in order to maintain positive ongoing contact with mother asserted she had complied with court orders,she was now in a position to be a better parent,and was young enough to grow up in her mother care.
the combined hearings of may.
on may,the juvenile court called the matter for a review hearing and a contested permanency planning hearing as to,and section petitions and a permanency planning hearing for 
when the juvenile court indicated it intended to deny section petition,counsel stated the voluntary declaration of paternity entitled to presumed father status.the juvenile court indicated there still had been no showing of a change in circumstances.mother counsel protested that mother and signed the declaration and counsel witnessed it and mailed the form out to the state.the juvenile court denied the petition and stated was an alleged father only.
the juvenile court then indicated it was ready to proceed with the contested permanency planning hearing as to and saw no reason why permanency planning hearing also could not be conducted today as the issues are identical.when counsel for requested a contested hearing,the juvenile court responded the only relevant issue was whether an exception to adoption could be shown.counsel for persisted that wished to testify there is a bond between himself and the juvenile court responded was present and could testify forthwith.
mother counsel then requested a contested hearing as to and stated counsel and mother had received a copy of the social report that morning and mother would like to have an opportunity to prepare and offer testimony.the juvenile court suggested mother testimony is going to be identical for as it is for.mother counsel again objected mother had not had an opportunity to review the report and mother was entitled to a continuance by statute.
at that point,county counsel offered that,in an abundance of caution,the department would not object to a brief continuance.the juvenile court found a continuance was not necessary,noted the only difference between the children was their age,and asked what different testimony mother would offer at a later time.mother counsel responded mother believed,by allowing her to have more time,she would be able to obtain more documentation regarding her ability to establish her bond with her child.counsel joined in the request and stated also did not receive the report days before the hearing and case law entitled him to a continuance.the juvenile court denied the request and indicated it was prepared to proceed over mother and objection.
after the juvenile court received the social reports into evidence,mother testified she visits each of her children once per week for two hours.during visits,mother reads to the children and plays with them.she would like to do more but is restricted by the length of the visits and the area in which they take place.reaches out to mother,kisses her and they laugh and play.smiles when she sees mother.neither child seems upset during visits.has tantrums but only because she becomes upset when she does not get what she wants.mother feeds snacks brought to the visits by the foster mother.mother believes she has a bond with each child even though she sees them only once a week.mother wanted to participate in regional center activities but it was hard for mother to attend on the bus.mother believes she has the kind of bond that a mother and child should have,and i feel that if i had more time with them,that i can build a stronger bond with them.
testified he plays with during visits,shows her the swings and walks around the sand.believes he has a strong bond with,she recognizes him and is happy to see him.she has not cried with him.asked the juvenile court to give himself and mother another chance to regain what we had going at one point.
mother counsel argued mother had done the best she could to remain engaged with the children and involved in their lives.mother worked hard to turn her life around and she now would be an appropriate parent for both girls.
counsel argued the department detained based on mother prior behavior and that consistently had asserted not only that he was biological father,but also that he should be her presumed father.when the juvenile court noted did not visit the child until february of and then saw the child only three or four times,counsel protested that father regularly had been attending visits,the visits are of high quality and had established a relationship with his daughter.
after the matter was submitted,the juvenile court stated that,as to mother,this is a very sad situation in that five of mother children previously had been placed for adoption.the juvenile court noted both mother and had only monitored visitation and neither had demonstrated that the beneficial parental relationship exception applied.the juvenile court pointed out that,for the first three and a half months of life,never saw child.the juvenile court found,by clear and convincing evidence,both children were likely to be adopted and terminated parental rights.
contentions 
mother contends the juvenile court erred in denying her section petitions,in denying a continuance of permanency planning hearing and in terminating her parental rights.
contends the juvenile court erred in denying his section petition,in denying a continuance of permanency planning hearing,and in terminating his parental rights 
discussion 
denial of mother section petition filed april.
mother contends her section petition as to filed april,contained substantial evidence indicating mother circumstances changed significantly after the juvenile court terminated mother family reunification services as to on december.mother had completed domestic violence and substance abuse classes,mother visited on a regular basis and mother presence was observed to have a soothing effect on mother asserts she participated in life in a motherly role in that she fed her snacks,read her books,changed her diapers,fixed her hair and talked to her.also,was well cared for,healthy and clean when she was redetained from mother.mother claims the petition proved mother was fully invested in the case plan and ready for the opportunity to establish that she would ensure attendance at regional center appointments.mother concludes the juvenile court erred in summarily denying the petition.
section permits an order of the juvenile court to be changed,modified or set aside if the petitioner establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that new evidence or changed circumstances exist,and the proposed change would promote the best interests of the child.in re stephanie cal th.to trigger the right to a hearing,the petitioner need only make a prima facie showing of these elements,and the petition should be liberally construed in favor of granting a hearing to consider the petitioner request.in re marilyn cal th,in re zachary th.we review the summary denial of a section petition for abuse of discretion.in re angel th.
here,was returned to mother care with family maintenance services on may.however,the child was redetained two months later because mother failed to take her to regional center appointments and failed to provide a stable home.mother section petition failed to allege these circumstances had changed,that is,that mother had secured appropriate housing or that she was now better able to ensure that would attend her regional center appointments.
the petition also failed to show the proposed modification was in best interests.mother compliance with the case plan and activities with during visits are not sufficient to demonstrate the modification sought was in the child best interest.it is not enough for a parent to show just a genuine change of circumstances under the statute.the parent must show that the undoing of the prior order would be in the best interest of the child.citation.in re kimberly th.the fact the parent makes relatively albeit genuine changes does not automatically tip the scale in the parent favor.id.at.
mother notes that,at a hearing on april,the juvenile court observed the social report reflected things were going a lot better for mother.however,the juvenile court made this comment in response to a request from counsel that mother visits be terminated or limited to once per month.in any event,improvement in mother visitation,without more,was insufficient to warrant modification of the previous order.
in sum,we find no abuse of the juvenile court discretion in the order summarily denying mother section petition filed april.
the denial of mother section petition with respect to 
mother contends her section petition as to filed may,contained substantial evidence that mother circumstances changed significantly after the juvenile court terminated mother family reunification services on january,and that best interests would be furthered by reinstating reunification services.mother notes she completed domestic violence and substance abuse programs and the director of mother counseling services reported mother attitude,participation and overall rating was very good.mother also completed a program on april,she continued to test negative for drugs and attend meetings,and mother remained consistent in visiting,missing only three visits in five months.mother concludes the juvenile court erred in denying a hearing on the petition.
initially,we note mother was denied family reunification services with respect to based on her failure to reunify with her other children.because mother was not entitled to family reunification services,her section petition,which requested reinstatement of family reunification services,was flawed from the outset.in any event,mother failed to show a change in circumstances.mother petition states she completed various programs and classes but disregards that was detained because mother failed to provide with appropriate housing and failed to take to regional center appointments.mother petition stated no changed circumstances that addressed these issues.
mother also failed to show the proposed change would be in best interests.mother stated only the child was young enough to spend her future growing up in her mother care.this was insufficient to demonstrate that a change in the previous order,which would have further delayed permanence for,was in the child best interests.see,in re marilyn,supra,cal th.
thus,no abuse of discretion appears in the summary denial of the petition.
denial of mother request for a continuance of permanency planning hearing.
mother contends the social report for permanency planning hearing on may,was mailed to an incorrect address on may,and her counsel received the report on the day of the hearing.mother claims she informed the social worker she was moving before the hearing and,had the social worker telephoned mother or father,the report could have been mailed to the new address.mother asserts she was entitled to receive the report calendar days prior to the hearing.judith superior court th,subd.c,cal.rules of court,rule c.mother notes she requested a continuance to prepare for the permanency planning hearing and county counsel indicated the department would not be opposed to a brief continuance.nonetheless,the juvenile court denied the request and proceeded over mother objection.
mother asserts the denial of her request for a continuance violated her right to due process.mother argues she was prejudiced by her inability to read the report in advance of the hearing,confer with counsel and prepare to controvert the contents of the report.in re jeanette th.the department failure to provide the section report to mother counsel in advance of the hearing also forced counsel to represent mother without an opportunity to prepare mother defense.thus,mother was deprived of her right to competent counsel.in re th,in re carrie th,in re kristin th.
mother argues the juvenile court belief that denial of a continuance as to did not prejudice mother because contested permanency planning hearing was scheduled for that day was error.the children were differently situated and were being adopted by different families.thus,mother defense to the recommendation in case might well have been different from the defense she intended to present in case.further,any request for an offer of proof would have been futile because mother and her counsel had not had an opportunity to review the report and thus could not present an intelligent offer of proof.see in re earl th,superior court th.
mother concludes the order terminating parental rights must be reversed.
we find no abuse of the juvenile court discretion in the denial of the request for a continuance.mother concedes the report was mailed on may,to her last known address.although mother claims the department failed to exercise diligence to identify her correct address,it was mother obligation to provide the department and the juvenile court with a correct mailing address.cal.rules of court,rule,subd.m.
further,mother assertion she did not receive the report because it was mailed to an incorrect address is suspect.the section petition mother filed with respect to on april,indicated she lived at the address and listed the same address on the section petition he filed with respect to on may,four days after the department mailed section report to mother.
in any event,the case on which mother relies,judith superior court,is distinguishable.judith addressed reports filed for jurisdictional,dispositional and status review hearings.judith noted the important distinction to be made between reports prepared for these prepermanency planning hearings and a report prepared for a permanency planning hearing.judith,supra,th at,fn.thus,mother reliance on sections,subdivision c,related to status review reports,and section,related to supplemental review reports,is misplaced.
further,in judith the review report indicated the social agency did not know whether mother was in compliance with the case plan.mother informed the juvenile court she had completed family reunification services and requested a continuance to provide documentation to the social agency.here,unlike the parent in judith,mother did not make an offer of proof regarding why a continuance was necessary,did not seek to the social worker and,in essence,requested only more time.given that it is not a denial of due process to require a parent to make an offer of proof before conducting a contested permanency planning hearing in re tamika th,it follows that due process does not require the juvenile court to grant a continuance of a permanency planning hearing where a parent fails to make an offer of proof indicating new information or evidence could be obtained during the additional time.
even on appeal,mother does not suggest what additional evidence she would have presented had the juvenile court granted the continuance.she argues that,with additional time,she might have prepared a different defense.however,it is clear that additional time to prepare would not have altered the facts of the case.was never in mother care and mother was denied family reunification services.
thus,assuming the juvenile court denial of a continuance violated california rules of court,rule and testing the error under the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard in re thomas th,mother fails to demonstrate prejudice.moreover,in determining whether to grant a continuance in dependency matters,the juvenile court is directed to give substantial weight to a minor need for prompt resolution of his or her custody status,the need to provide children with stable environments,and the damage to a minor of prolonged temporary placements,subd.a see in re marilyn,supra,cal th at.this mandate provides further support for finding the juvenile court committed no abuse of discretion in the denial of mother request for a continuance of the permanency planning hearing.in re elijah th,in re ninfa th.
the beneficial parental relationship exception.
under section,subdivision c,if reunification services have been terminated and the child is adoptable,the juvenile court must terminate parental rights unless one of several statutory exceptions applies.one such exception,the beneficial parental relationship exception,arises when the juvenile court finds termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the child because the parents have maintained regular visitation and contact with the child,and the child would benefit from continuing the parental relationship,subd.c b i.
in re autumn th,held the exception applies only when the relationship with a natural parent promotes the of the child to such a degree as to outweigh the the child would gain in a permanent home with new,adoptive parents.to overcome the statutory preference for adoption,the parent must show he or she occupies a parental role in the child life,resulting in a significant,positive emotional attachment of the child to the parent.in re th at.
case law acknowledges it is unreasonable to require a noncustodial parent to prove that a child has a primary attachment to the parent,or to show the parent and the child have maintained contact.in re th.instead,the juvenile court determines whether the parent has maintained a parental relationship,or an emotionally significant relationship with the child,through consistent contact and visitation.id.at.
the parent has the burden of proving the applicability of the exception.in re cristella th.
mother notes mother and were described as well bonded at the hospital and was a normal happy baby,indicating mother had a healthy pregnancy.mother visited regularly,she was appropriate during visits and she interacted well with mother advanced to unmonitored visits and on may,was returned to mother.at that time,was described as bonded with mother and she remained in mother care for two months before she again was detained.even then,was found to be well groomed and in good health.in july of,it was reported that mother and were closely bonded.further,mother was teaching multiple languages,she sang to her and was described as a happy baby.mother attended needs and services meeting in august of.mother visited regularly and in october of,a social worker described their bond as confirmed.
mother testified she read to and played with her.when saw mother,she reached out to kiss her.mother concludes her regular contact and consistent visitation demonstrated would benefit more from continuing the relationship with mother than she would benefit from adoption.in re,supra,th.
the record does not support mother claim.mother failed to visit regularly after was redetained in july of.also,mother caused disruption by bringing with her to visits with however,even assuming mother visited regularly,she failed to show a significant benefit from continuing the relationship.foster mother reported became anxious and withdrawn on the way to the visits and was clingy and fretful after visits.also,had difficulty sleeping for a couple of nights after each visit.although mother visits reportedly had improved,preferred to play by herself or with foster mother even though mother tried to engage her.mother had difficulty getting to listen and at times struggled to change diaper because would not let her.the social worker also expressed concern that mother would not be able to handle tantrums.
mother case is substantially different than in re,supra,th.there,the parent visited the child as often as permitted,acted in a loving,parental role and did virtually everything asked of him.also,the juvenile court found the child loved her father,wanted their relationship to continue and derived some measure of benefit from his visits.id.at.
here,mother contact with was inconsistent,did not regard mother as a parental figure and the visits made anxious.additionally,mother failed to show the benefit of relationship with mother outweighed the benefit of a stable adoptive placement.was placed with her prospective adoptive family in july of,had adjusted well and viewed her prospective adoptive parents as her parents and their son as her brother.the department reported an obvious attachment between and her prospective adoptive family.
the record therefore supports the juvenile court conclusion the beneficial parental relationship exception did not apply with respect to 
in support of her assertion the beneficial parental relationship exception applies to,mother notes the disposition report indicated appeared to be very bonded to mother.mother visited regularly for two hours per week and was involved in meeting the child needs.mother only missed three visits in five months and the department reported mother was nurturing and affectionate with the child.mother testified smiled when she saw mother and mother believed she and were strongly bonded.mother compares her case to in re amber th,in which an order terminating parental rights was reversed because it was shown the child loved her mother and shared a strong,primary bond.the mother visited as often as she was allowed and acted as a loving parent.mother claims she similarly maintained regular contact and visitation,she nearly had completed the case plan,she continued to participate in the necessary programs and she cultivated a strong relationship with mother concludes the evidence supported application of the exception with respect to 
contrary to mother assertion,the record showed mother visitation of was not consistent.additionally,mother failed to attend assessment in december of.however,even assuming mother visited regularly,she failed to show would gain a significant benefit from continuing the relationship that outweighed the benefit the child would derive from adoption.mother claim she nearly had completed the case plan is misleading in that mother was denied family reunification services with respect to and thus had no case plan to complete.further,was in the care of a prospective adoptive family who loved her and enjoyed caring for her.
in re amber is distinguishable.the children at issue in that case were older than and had been in the care of their mother for substantial portions of their lives.further,a bonding study concluded mother and amber shared a primary attachment and a primary maternal relationship and that i t could be detrimental to sever that relationship.in re amber,supra,th at.in re amber concluded the evidence showed the two older children had a strong primary bond with mother and their sibling,while seemingly too young to have developed much of a relationship with mother,nevertheless was very strongly attached to her.id.at.also,the mother visited as often as she was allowed and acted in a loving,parental role she was devoted to them and did virtually all that was asked of her to regain custody.ibid.
mother,on the other hand,has never been the primary caretaker of and failed to advance beyond monitored visitation.the evidence supports the juvenile court finding stability in a new prospective adoptive family outweighed the benefit of maintaining a relationship with mother.
denial of section petition.
contends his section petition presented new evidence,namely,the voluntary declaration of paternity,which established as presumed father and qualified him to receive family reunification services.asserts his voluntary declaration of paternity was properly executed,witnessed and filed with the dcss as required by family code section et.in re mary th.
recounting the history of the case,claims the juvenile court apparently was determined not to recognize him as presumed father.he notes that,at the initial juvenile court hearing,mother informed the juvenile court that was father,he held himself out to be father,he supported mother throughout the pregnancy,and there was no one else who could be her father.nonetheless,the juvenile court found to be merely an alleged father and ordered hla testing to determine paternity.when mother counsel asked whether testing would be required if submitted a voluntary declaration of paternity,the juvenile court indicated failed to sign a voluntary declaration of paternity at the hospital.
at the jurisdictional hearing on january,mother testified had never made any statements to her indicating he did not believe he was father.the juvenile court responded,erroneously,that denied paternity of at the initial hearing on november.at the disposition phase of the same hearing,counsel indicated was willing to sign a voluntary declaration of paternity.the juvenile court again noted did not sign a declaration of paternity at the hospital and denied family reunification services.however,a valid declaration of paternity may be made at any time after the child birth.in re mary,supra,th at,subd.d.thus,the juvenile court erroneously insisted the voluntary declaration of paternity had to be signed at the hospital.further,hla testing confirmed was biological father.
notes the reunification period had not expired when he filed the voluntary declaration of paternity in that no reunification services were ordered and should not have been precluded from being recognized as presumed father and considered for family reunification services.asserts an unwed father can not be deprived of an opportunity to develop a parental relationship with a child born out of wedlock where the father does not deny or reject paternity as soon as he has reason to know of it and thereafter does not delay in asserting his interest in the child.in re julia th.notes he visited every week after february,and the social reports indicated was appropriate and attentive to the child during visits.
concludes the juvenile court erroneously found his voluntary declaration of paternity of no effect and improperly denied his section petition without a hearing.
voluntary declarations of paternity.
in,the legislature amended family code section,which generally sets forth the exclusive means for an unwed father to establish presumed fatherhood,to provide that a man is a presumed father if he meets the conditions provided in chapter commencing with section of part,which pertains to the establishment of paternity by voluntary declaration.in re mary,supra,th at.
family code section states that,with exceptions not relevant here,a completed voluntary declaration of paternity,as described in section,that has been filed with the department of child support services shall establish the paternity of a child and shall have the same force and effect as a judgment for paternity issued by a court of competent jurisdiction,kevin lauren th,in re mary,supra,th at county of los angeles sheldon th,cal.rules of court,rule c.
family code section,states a voluntary declaration of paternity shall be executed on a form developed by the dcss which must contain certain information,including statements by the parents that they have read and understand the written materials described in family code section a statement by the mother that the man who has signed the declaration is the only possible father and,a statement by the man that he is the biological father of the child,and that he consents to the establishment of paternity,subd.b.
the legislature enacted the statutes creating the declaration process to further the state interest in establishing paternity for all children and to provide a means of establishing paternity that avoided the need for a lengthy and expensive court process,subd.b.the legislature also found knowledge of family medical history is often necessary for correct medical diagnosis and treatment.additionally,knowing one father is important to a child development,subd.a.
family code section,subdivision a directs that,before an unmarried mother leaves the hospital after giving birth,the person responsible for registering live births must provide the mother and the man she identifies as the father a voluntary declaration of paternity.hospital staff is directed to witness the signature of the declaration and forward the signed declaration to the dcss within days.attesting parents also may mail a notarized declaration to the dcss at any time after the child birth,subd.d.in addition,declarations shall be made available without charge at all local child support agency offices,offices of local registrars of births and deaths,courts,and county welfare departments within this state.staff in these offices shall witness the signatures of parents wishing to sign a voluntary declaration of paternity and shall be responsible for forwarding the signed declaration to the dcss within days of the date the declaration was signed,subd.f.also,publicly funded or licensed health clinics,pediatric offices,head start programs,child care centers,social services providers,prisons,and schools may offer parents the opportunity to sign a voluntary declaration of paternity these agencies shall ensure that the form is witnessed and forwarded to the dcss,subd.j.
voluntary declaration of paternity was not properly executed or filed.
the record discloses voluntary declaration of paternity was witnessed by mother attorney who was employed by los angeles dependency lawyers.attorneys appointed to represent parents in dependency proceedings are not among the individuals listed in family code section as statutorily authorized to witness voluntary declarations of paternity.also,there was no evidence the declaration was forwarded to the dcss within twenty days after it was signed,as required by the statute.it therefore appears the voluntary declaration of paternity submitted with section petition was not validly executed or filed.
argues mother attorney qualifies as a proper witness of the declaration.he notes federal law requires states to adopt a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity process as a condition of receiving certain federal funds.he quotes code of federal regulations section,subdivision g which states the state must establish,in cooperation with hospitals,state birth record agencies,and other entities designated by the state and participating in the state voluntary paternity establishment program,a program for voluntary paternity establishment services.ii the voluntary paternity establishment services program must also be available at the state birth record agencies,and at other entities designated by the state and participating in the state voluntary paternity establishment program.these entities may include the following types of entities f legal aid agencies,and private attorneys,subd.g ii f.
claims this regulation controls over any state statute that does not allow an attorney to participate in the voluntary paternity establishment services program.thus,according to,mother attorney was authorized under federal law,either as a private attorney or as an attorney appointed by the juvenile court,to witness voluntary declaration of paternity.
however,the cited regulation merely permits a state to allow legal aid agencies and private attorneys to participate in the state voluntary paternity establishment services program.the regulation states the entities required to establish paternity services may include l egal aid,and private attorneys,subd.g ii f,italics added.the regulation does not require the states to include legal aid agencies and private attorneys in the program.thus,family code section,which does not include legal aid agencies and private attorneys in the voluntary paternity establishment services program,is not in conflict with the federal regulation.
alternative assertion,that mother counsel was part of the court staff,similarly fails.mother counsel was appointed by the juvenile court to represent mother but was not part of the court staff.
moreover,even if mother counsel properly witnessed the declaration,there was no evidence the declaration was forwarded to the dcss within days after it was signed.claims the presumption that official duty has been performed cures the filing infirmity.kevin lauren,supra,th at in raphael th.however,the cases cited by are distinguishable.in kevin,the voluntary declaration of paternity was witnessed by an employee of the dcss,subd.f.in in re raphael,the declaration was witnessed by hospital staff performing their official duty under family code section,subdivision a,which includes forwarding the signed declaration to the dcss within days,subd.a.declaration,unlike those at issue in kevin and raphael,was not witnessed by an employee of the dcss or hospital staff but by mother counsel who had no statutory duty to forward it to the dcss.consequently,evidence code section is not applicable here.
based on the foregoing,we conclude voluntary declaration of paternity did not give rise to a presumption of paternity.however,even if we assume the declaration substantially complied with the statutory requirements,we find no abuse of the juvenile court discretion in the denial of the modification petition.
assuming voluntary declaration of paternity substantially complied with the statutory requirements,the summary denial of his modification petition does not require reversal.
initially,we note that at both the detention hearing on november,and the hearing on january,counsel indicated was willing to submit a voluntary declaration of paternity.however,he failed to do so.thus,the juvenile court properly relied on the evidence in the record at the time of the disposition hearing that indicated did not qualify as a presumed father.this evidence included failure to acknowledge paternity at the hospital and his refusal to sign birth certificate.also declined to hold at the hospital and refused to make himself available to social workers.even after testing showed he was biological father,continued to question his paternity.when eventually did contact the department on january,he refused to participate in the case plan.based on this evidence,the juvenile court properly concluded was merely an alleged father who did not qualify for family reunification services.
after the disposition hearing,commenced visitation of on february.however,even then he visited for only one hour rather than the visit the juvenile court order permitted.did not present the voluntary declaration of paternity to the juvenile court until may,eight days before the permanency planning hearing.the declaration he submitted was dated january.thus,had the signed declaration at his disposal for three and a half months before he brought it to the attention of the juvenile court when he filed it in connection with his section petition.
further,did not file the signed declaration until more than six months after was detained.the presumptive maximum term for court ordered family reunification servi
