background 
according to probation records,santa barbara county sheriff deputies arrested henry father for a parole violation on march,and arrested his mother pursuant to a warrant the next day.aware henry and his brother needed to be taken into protective custody,the deputies searched for the children where they had been living with their father.they found henry driving his father car,with his younger brother riding as a passenger.
henry refused to stop.the deputies chased him for miles at speeds up to miles per hour along highway and through the university of california,santa barbara campus.after the california highway patrol chp continued the pursuit,henry drove over a center island and rammed a chp vehicle.he subsequently struck a second chp vehicle,causing its airbag to deploy and the officer to sustain a neck injury requiring medical treatment.henry continued driving until the chp pinned henry car against a telephone pole.
the officers took henry into custody.he admitted he knew his actions were dangerous and did not pull over because he snapped.henry brother told the officers he repeatedly asked henry to stop and he thought henry intentionally swerved toward the chp vehicles because he did not want them to catch him.
the following week,the santa barbara county district attorney filed a juvenile wardship petition under section alleging henry committed an assault with a deadly weapon likely to produce great bodily injury,subd.a,child abuse,subd.a,leaving the scene of an accident,subd.a,evading a peace officer,subd.a,hit and run driving,subd.a,and driving without a license,subd.a.henry counsel requested a joint assessment report pursuant to section to assist the juvenile court in determining whether henry should be treated as a dependent child under section or a delinquent ward under section.after taking the objections of the prosecutor and child welfare services cws into consideration,the juvenile court ordered cws and the probation department to prepare the report.
on may,henry counsel requested a contested section hearing to present several witnesses pursuant to california rules of court,rule g the next day,the prosecutor argued that rule g only established a right to a hearing to be heard and not to present evidence or call witnesses.henry counsel responded that due process required he be allowed to present evidence and to witnesses and the preparers of the joint assessment report if he were to have a real and fair opportunity to be heard.the juvenile court reasoned that if the legislature had assumed that there would be a contested hearing where witnesses would be called and evidence presented,they would have so indicated accordingly,the juvenile court denied the motion to present evidence and scheduled a hearing for counsel to argue their positions.
on may,henry counsel filed a motion to continue the section hearing along with points and authorities and a list of proposed witnesses including henry,his psychologist,his brother cws social worker,and the cws and probation department authors of his joint assessment report.several days later,the juvenile court explained it found no indication in the rules of court or case law requiring a full evidentiary hearing and reiterated that it would not allow additional witnesses or at the section proceeding.on may,the juvenile court granted henry request for a continuance to consider a new report from his evaluating psychologist.
the juvenile court held the section hearing on may.at the onset of the hearing,henry counsel renewed her previous objections that she wanted to call witnesses and the authors of the section report on henry behalf.the prosecutor argued that the gravity of henry actions warranted section treatment to hold him accountable and to protect the public,neither of which would be accomplished by treating him as a section dependent.the prosecutor also noted henry previously had been treated informally for acts of arson and vandalism.county counsel added her opinion that cws was not equipped to handle henry because it lacked the ability to mandate services.defense counsel countered that henry best interest would be served by treating him as a dependent given his documented history of significant abuse beginning when he was three years old up to the night before his arrest when his father choked him for trying to protect his mother.defense counsel also described henry current offenses as the result of panic and the need to protect his younger brother after both of his parents had just been arrested.after a brief recess,the juvenile court reasoned 
clearly,with a section approach there is the accountability factor that been argued by counsel that is not found under section.i think it a very close call.it is a tragic,tragic fact of life that henry has been subjected to this terrible upbringing and all of the pitfalls that he faced along the way and i wish we could go back in time and erase all of that and place him in a placement that would give him a lot better chance at life.but when the court looks at the best interests of henry and also considers the protection of society,it does seem appropriate to treat henry as a section ward.that going to be the finding of the court.original capitalization not followed.
on may,henry counsel announced he planned to enter a no contest plea.at his counsel request,the juvenile court permitted henry to preserve his right to appeal the court ruling denying him the right to present evidence and witnesses at the section hearing.henry acknowledged for the record,these no contest statements are being given,subject to reservation of rights to appeal from denial of an evidentiary hearing on a section petition.henry then entered a plea of no contest to leaving the scene of an accident and evading a peace officer,and the juvenile court dismissed the remaining four counts.
the juvenile court transferred the case to fresno county,henry permanent residence,for disposition.on july,the juvenile court in fresno county found henry a ward of the court and placed him under the supervision of the probation department pending a suitable placement.henry filed a notice of appeal on september.
discussion 
henry contends the juvenile court violated his federal due process rights by refusing to allow him to call witnesses and to the authors of his section report at the hearing to determine his juvenile court treatment.under section,an abused or neglected minor falls within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court as a dependant child of the court.under section or,a minor who is habitually disobedient or truant,or commits a crime,falls within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court as a ward of the court.section requires that whenever a minor appears to fall within the description of both a dependent child and a delinquent ward,cws and the probation department must jointly initially determine which status will serve the best interests of the minor and the protection of society,subd.a.both departments present their recommendations to the juvenile court,which must then determine the minor appropriate status.ibid.a minor may not be both a dependant child and a delinquent ward of the court absent a written agreement between the juvenile court,cws,and probation department,and the record does not suggest any such agreement existed in henry case,subds.d e.
appealability 
the attorney general contends henry appeal must be dismissed because the juvenile court determination pursuant to section that henry should be treated as a delinquent ward under section is not an appealable order or is othe
