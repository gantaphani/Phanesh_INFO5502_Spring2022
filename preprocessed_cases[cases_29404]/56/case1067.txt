in this appeal,we consider whether a statement given to the police by a mildly mentally retarded juvenile was admissible at his delinquency trial.after viewing a portion of the videotaped statement and hearing testimony from the police officer and others,the family court concluded that the juvenile knowingly and voluntarily waived his miranda rights.on review,we adhere to the totality of the circumstances test,but we consider the juvenile mental limitations and the fact that his mother was not with him during the interview as significant factors.having viewed the videotaped statement,and considering all of the circumstances,we conclude that the juvenile waiver was not knowing.we therefore reverse and remand the case for a new trial.
factual and procedural background 
the incidents that gave rise to this delinquency proceeding took place on september.rita smith took her children,james and cheryl,to visit her sister,mary hawn,and mary daughter,georgia gallo.at that time james was years old and georgia was three.according to georgia,at some time during that day,she was in the bathroom with james and he told her to lick his.later that day,while they were playing frisbee,they went behind a shed and he again demanded that she perform fellatio.georgia reported what happened to her mother,who immediately sought assistance from her family physician and the authorities.georgia was examined at the dupont hospital.although the examining physician found no physical evidence of sexual contact,he opined that georgia had been abused based on her spontaneous statements in the waiting room and in the examining room.in october,terri kaiser,a forensic interviewer from the children house interviewed georgia about the events in question.georgia repeated her earlier statements and also said that james touched her and her behind.
detective jason atallian,of the new castle county police department,went to the motel where james and his family were living on december.rita answered the door and told atallian that her son was asleep,having stayed home from school for the past two days because of a cold.atallian told rita that he wanted to talk to james and that she should call to schedule the interview.as atallian was returning to his car,however,rita called out and told him that james was awake and that they would come to the station right then.rita and james followed atallian to the station in their own car.
there is some dispute as to exactly what was said before atallian took james into the interrogation room.atallian testified that he told rita that james was a suspect in a criminal investigation involving sexual misconduct that rita could be present while he questioned james and that she could have a lawyer present during the questioning.rita testified that atallian refused to tell her what the investigation was about told her she could not be with her son and never mentioned a lawyer prior to the questioning.the trial court accepted atallian version of the facts.
atallian questioned james for approximately minutes.at the outset,atallian asked james whether he could read and write.james said he had trouble with reading.atallian said that he would read the rights to james and that james could stop him and ask questions.atallian then stated 
okay number one you have the right to remain silent.and what that means is you can be quiet if you want to.you do have to answer anything if you do want to.anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.it just means whatever we talking about today you know is legal,you know whether it happens from here on out whatever we talk about you know is pertinent to what going to happen okay.you have the right to talk to a lawyer and have him present with you while you being questioned.if you ca afford to hire a lawyer one will be appointed to represent you.if you wish one we already talked to your mom about that and that fine.at any time during this interview if you wish to discontinue your statement you have the right to do so.all that means is at any time we talking if you want to talk to me or you do.you understand these things i explained to you 
james answered,uh uh and then wrote his name in the appropriate space on the form he could not sign his name because he did not know how to write in cursive.
during the questioning,atallian repeatedly told james that he knew what had happened,but that he had to hear it from james so atallian would be able to help james.frequently,after atallian questions,james gave no response.he simply sat silently,bent over,looking at the floor.after many attempts to get james to open up,and another period of silence,atallian said,i not going anywhere.the only way we walking out of here is if you straight up and honest with me and we deal with this and then i can help you.during the course of the interrogation,james confessed to several of the sexual encounters georgia described.at the end of the interrogation,atallian explained to james,and then his mother,that james was going to be arrested for sexual crimes.
prior to trial,james moved to suppress the statement,arguing that his waiver of miranda rights was not knowing and voluntary.after a hearing,the trial court acknowledged that james was a special education student with reading problems.nonetheless,the court denied the motion,finding that the rights were read to him in simple language and that there was no indication that james did not understand them.several months later,james filed a motion to determine his competency to stand trial.
at the competency hearing,abraham mensch,a psychologist supervisor with the delaware division of child mental health services,was the only witness.mensch testified that james was identified as a special needs child at the age of three.james has a full scale iq of,which is in the mild mental retardation range,and his word recognition and arithmetic skills are equivalent to second grade,which is extremely low.in his page report,mensch concluded 
in summary,at the time of this evaluation,as a result of mental defects involving impaired neurocognitive functions,james presents with significant impediments to his ability to proceed to trial,including to consult with defense counsel rationally,to assist in preparing his defense,and to have both a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings against him.
james,in spite of specific significant deficits,possesses some of the related to competency to proceed to trial.he understands that he faces criminal charges,and can relate the date and basic elements of his offenses.he is likely able to establish rapport with his attorney,but his intellectual deficits set limits on the functionality of this rapport.
although there are also difficulties with the accurate understanding of the roles of some of the participants in the courtroom,these can be taught to james,and this does not constitute a significant impediment to adjudicative competency.the most serious impediments to the capacity to proceed to trial involve significant deficits in the cognitive abilities necessary to consult with his attorney,follow testimony reasonably well,and testify in his behalf,if necessary 
the trial court decided that,despite his limitations,james was competent to understand the proceedings,assist his attorney,and give evidence in his own defense.in recognition of mensch findings,however,the trial court agreed to schedule additional time for the trial to allow james and his counsel to review the proceedings slowly.
at trial,the state relied primarily on georgia testimony and james videotaped statement.james did not testify.his only witness was his sister,who testified that she was at mary house most of the day and that georgia and james were not together,alone.the trial court found james delinquent on two counts of second degree rape and one count of second degree unlawful sexual contact.in reaching that decision,the trial court relied primarily on the admissions in james videotaped statement and georgia testimony.
discussion
