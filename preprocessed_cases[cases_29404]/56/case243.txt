appellant alejandro,a minor,admitted to being an accessory to illegal drug sales and was found to be a ward of the court.in addition to typical conditions of probation,the juvenile court imposed a condition requiring appellant to submit to the warrantless search of his electronic devices and his use of social media.appellant challenges the condition as substantively invalid and unconstitutionally overbroad.we conclude,following our recent decision in in re ricardo th ricardo,that the condition,while valid under people lent cal d lent,superseded on other grounds as stated in people wheeler cal th,is overbroad as imposed by the juvenile court.we affirm the juvenile court order with appropriate modification of the electronics search condition.
background 
appellant,the subject of a juvenile wardship petition under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a,admitted a misdemeanor charge of being an accessory after the fact to the transportation and distribution of marijuana,a violation of health and safety code section,subdivision a.the police report from appellant arrest stated he approached undercover officers outside a concert venue and said something similar to,yo bucks for a blunt.when an officer expressed interest,appellant directed him to another person seated nearby,from whom the officer purchased two marijuana cigarettes.at the time of his detention,appellant was in possession of grams of presumed cocaine and two pills of presumed methamphetamine.
at the dispositional hearing,the juvenile court found appellant to be a ward of the court,but allowed him to remain at home.in addition to typical conditions of juvenile probation,the court imposed the following two conditions,which appellant challenges in this appeal appellant must submit to a search of your electronics day or night and passwords day or night at the request of a probation officer or peace officer and attend school on a regular basis.when appellant counsel objected generally to the electronics search condition,the court explained,addressing appellant,as in this case with drugs,i find it very important and the best way of supervising individuals like yourself who have drug cases,that we check your electronics,because that where you buy and sell and very often boast with photos about your drug usage and drug paraphernalia.
ii.discussion 
we summarized the law applicable to juvenile probation conditions in in re th under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,the juvenile court,in placing a ward on probation,may impose and require any and all reasonable conditions that it may determine fitting and proper to the end that justice may be done and the reformation and rehabilitation of the ward enhanced.see in re sheena cal th.consistent with this mandate,the juvenile court is recognized as having broad discretion in formulating conditions of probation in re tyrell cal th,tyrell,disapproved on other grounds in in re jaime cal th,and the juvenile court imposition of any particular probation condition is reviewed for abuse of discretion.in re walter th.
while adult criminal courts are also said to have broad discretion in formulating conditions of probation people carbajal cal th,the legal standards governing the two types of conditions are not identical.because wards are thought to be more in need of guidance and supervision than adults and have more circumscribed constitutional rights,and because the juvenile court stands in the shoes of a parent when it asserts jurisdiction over a minor,juvenile conditions may be broader than those pertaining to adult offenders.in re antonio th.in tyrell,the supreme court explained another aspect of the difference although the goal of both types of probation is the rehabilitation of the offender,j uvenile probation is not,as with an adult,an act of leniency in lieu of statutory punishment it is an ingredient of a final order for the minor reformation and rehabilitation.citation.in light of this difference,a condition of probation that would be unconstitutional or otherwise improper for an adult probationer may be permissible for a minor under the supervision of the juvenile court.citations.even conditions which infringe on constitutional rights may not be invalid if tailored specifically to meet the needs of the juvenile tyrell,supra,cal th at.
while broader than that of an adult criminal court,the juvenile court discretion in formulating probation conditions is not unlimited.in re walter,supra,th at.despite the differences between the two types of probation,it is consistently held that juvenile probation conditions must be judged by the same standard applied to adult probation conditions under lent,supra,cal d a condition of probation will not be held invalid unless it has no relationship to the crime of which the offender was convicted,relates to conduct which is not in itself criminal,and requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related to future criminality citation.conversely,a condition of probation which requires or forbids conduct which is not itself criminal is valid if that conduct is reasonably related to the crime of which the defendant was convicted or to future criminality.id.at,fn.omitted see,in re luis th,citations,supra,th at.
in addition to satisfying the lent test,juvenile probation conditions that infringe constitutionally protected rights must be clearly stated and no more restrictive than necessary to achieve their purpose.under the void for vagueness constitutional limitation,a n order must be sufficiently precise for the probationer to know what is required of him,and for the court to determine whether the condition has been violated.citations.in addition,the overbreadth doctrine requires that conditions of probation that impinge on constitutional rights must be tailored carefully and reasonably related to the compelling state interest in reformation and rehabilitation.citations.if available alternative means exist which are less violative of the constitutional right and are narrowly drawn so as to correlate more closely with the purposes contemplated,those alternatives should be used in re luis,supra,th at.
electronics search condition 
appellant contends the electronics search condition violates penal code section,is invalid under lent,and is unconstitutionally overbroad.in ricardo,we addressed the same arguments regarding an identical electronics search condition and affirmed the imposition of a narrowed version of the condition.for the reasons explained below,we find this case materially indistinguishable from ricardo,and we therefore follow that decision 
the appellant in ricardo admitted felony violations of the burglary statute after breaking into two homes.ricardo,supra,th at.the juvenile court imposed an identical electronics search condition to that imposed here and articulated the same rationale.id.at.
the ricardo court initially determined the meaning of the condition and concluded the court reference to electronics included not only electronic devices and the data contained on the devices,but also electronic accounts,such as social media accounts,that,while not stored on electronic devices,can be accessed through them.ricardo,supra,th at.the court based this construction on the juvenile court reference,as here,to monitoring the appellant activity on such accounts.ibid.we understand the electronics search condition at issue here to have the same meaning.
penal code section 
addressing the appellant claim that the electronic search condition violates penal code section,subdivision a,which prohibits eavesdropping on confidential electronic communications,ricardo found the claim forfeited because the appellant had not raised section below.the decision also concluded the appellant lacked standing to raise the claim,since it was based on the argument the condition might invade the privacy of the people with whom he communicates,not his own.ricardo,supra,th at.on both grounds,that reasoning applies here,since appellant did not raise section below and now asserts only the privacy interests of third parties.
validity under lent 
appellant claim the electronics search condition is invalid under lent was also addressed in ricardo p.as noted,a probation condition is invalid under lent if it has no relationship to the crime committed,relates to conduct that is not criminal,and is not reasonably related to future criminality all three elements must be present before a condition will be found invalid.ricardo,supra,th at.as to the first lent element,ricardo found that nothing in the record permit ed an inference that electronics played a role in the appellant crimes.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded the electronics search condition satisfied the first element of lent,in that it had no demonstrated relationship to the offenses at issue.ricardo,at.here,as in ricardo,there was no evidence appellant used electronic devices or social media in the commission of the crime.similarly,ricardo found the second element of lent satisfied,since the use of electronic devices is not illegal.ricardo,at.
ricardo found the electronics search condition valid under lent,however,on the ground it was reasonably related to future criminality.in doing so,the court followed people olguin cal th olguin,in which the supreme court considered the validity of a probation condition requiring an adult probationer to inform the probation officer of the presence of pets in his residence.the court noted that it was important for a probation officer conducting a warrantless search of the probationer residence,which was permitted by a separate probation condition,to know whether he or she would encounter pets at the residence.it concluded a probation condition that enables a probation officer to supervise his or her charges effectively is reasonably related to future criminality.id.at.because an electronics search condition is reasonably related to enabling the effective supervision of the appellant compliance with his other probation conditions,the ricardo court held,it was valid under the reasoning of olguin.ricardo,supra,th at.the court expressly rejected the reasoning of in re erica th,which,without considering olguin,concluded a similar electronics search condition imposed in similar circumstances did not reasonably relate to future criminality.erica,at ricardo,at.
division three of this court has recently issued a decision rejecting the conclusion in ricardo that an electronics search condition satisfies the third element of lent because it permits monitoring of a juvenile compliance with other probation conditions.in re th.while acknowledging the rationale of olguin,noted that,in discussing the third element of lent,the olguin court stated that the relevant test is reasonableness,at,quoting olguin,supra,cal th at.applying this test,found the electronics search condition to be unreasonable because there was no showing of a connection between the probationer use of electronic devices and his past or potential future criminal activity and the condition burdened the minor privacy interests.id.at.
we are unpersuaded by the analysis of for two reasons.first,in adopting a generic test of reasonableness,disregarded the actual holding of olguin.in that case,the supreme court conclusion that the probation condition reasonably related to future criminal conduct was unrelated to any connection between the condition and the probationer past or future crimes.on the contrary,the probationer keeping of pets was entirely unrelated to any crime he did or likely would commit.rather,olguin concluded a probation condition is reasonably related to future criminal conduct if it permits more effective monitoring of the probationer compliance with other probation conditions olguin,supra,cal th at.nothing more was required.
second,contrary to the impression created by,olguin did not announce a generic test of reasonableness for probation conditions.while all juvenile probation conditions must,of course,be reasonable welf,sub.b,the test of lent and the constitutional tests of vagueness and overbreadth have been developed to determine whether this overarching standard has been met.nothing in olguin suggests the court intended to supplant these tests with a subjective determination of reasonableness.while olguin did mention reasonableness,that reference arose in the context of a discussion of the burden imposed on the probationer by compliance with the probation condition.it was this burden that the court held must be reasonable,rather than the probation condition itself.olguin,supra,cal th at.under the portion of olguin cited by,therefore,the relevant burden for measuring the reasonableness of a probation condition is the practical burden of complying with the condition,not the extent to which the condition infringes the probationer rights.
in rejecting the rationale of,we do not mean to minimize the invasion of privacy inherent in the electronics search condition.cell phones and social media have become the primary means for young people to communicate.although an electronics search condition thereby effects a substantial invasion of constitutionally protected interests,it is not clearly greater than that created by other juvenile probation conditions approved in the past.foremost among these is the condition permitting warrantless searches of a juvenile person,property,and residence,a commonly imposed condition whose validity has been accepted for decades,despite its potential for invasion of the minor most private matters.see in re tyrell,supra,cal th,tyrell in re binh th,binh.other approved conditions include a ban on the juvenile association with persons disapproved by the probation officer or other adults in re byron th,a curfew welf,subd.c in re laylah d,disapproved on other grounds in in re sade cal th,fn.gps monitoring of the juvenile location in re th,blood,breath,or urine testing at the discretion of the probation officer in re th,a ban on tattoos in re victor th,and forced administration of psychotropic medication in re luis,supra,th at.division two of this court has even approved probation conditions entirely forbidding the juvenile from possession of a cell phone and use of the internet.victor,at.while a wholesale ban on cell phone and internet use represents less of an infringement of a minor privacy rights than the electronics search condition,that is only because the ban strips the minor of any opportunity for private communications by these means.an invasion of privacy interests is thereby avoided by an equal or greater infringement on liberty interests.
courts have been more willing to approve intrusive probation conditions in juvenile cases in part because even children have a more limited right to privacy than adults.in re carmen th.a s a general matter,the right to privacy of an unemancipated minor is more limited than that of an adult.an unemancipated minor has limited privacy rights as against the state.american academy of pediatrics lungren cal th.when a child is declared a ward,these rights are permissibly limited even further because the child has engaged in criminal behavior,and the juvenile court acts in parens patriae,thus assum ing the parents authority to limit the minor freedom of action.in re eric cal d,see leroy workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,juvenile system is fundamentally different from the adult penal system because it is designed to place the state in the status of in loco parentis.as diligent parents recognize,monitoring social media communications is an important tool in tracking the activities of a wayward minor.while acknowledging parents have greater leeway than the courts in regulating a minor conduct in re byron,supra,th at,we conclude the adoption of a electronics search condition is similarly a permissible,and potentially critical,tool in helping the juvenile court,acting in loco parentis,to determine whether the ward is complying with the terms of his or her probation.
as rightly notes,supra,th at,another distinction between the imposition of adult and juvenile probation conditions is that u nlike a parolee,a minor can not be made subject to an automatic probation condition e very juvenile probation condition must be made to fit the circumstances and the minor.binh,supra,th at see tyrell,supra,cal th at probation conditions infri
