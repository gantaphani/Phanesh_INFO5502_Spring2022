the kern county department of human services the agency appeals from a juvenile court disposition order that appointed hereafter stepgrandmother the legal guardian of five of her six grandchildren born to hereafter mother.the dispositional hearing occurred after the juvenile court found the allegations of the supplemental petition filed pursuant to welfare and institutions code section to be true.
the agency contends the juvenile court erred when it relied on section,subdivision a to appoint stepgrandmother the children legal guardian.the agency asserts the juvenile court was required by california rules of court,rule f to proceed directly to a welfare and institutions code section selection and implementation hearing.
it appears the juvenile court relied on section,subdivision a to avoid the requirements of section,which prohibits placement of a child with someone who has a criminal record unless an exemption is obtained from the agency,subd.d.stepgrandmother had a criminal record and the agency denied her request for an exemption.
as we shall explain,the relevant statutes and cases lead us to conclude the disposition order must be reversed because the juvenile court erred in two respects.first,case law,as well as rule f,required the juvenile court,on the facts before it,to proceed directly to a section planning and implementation hearing.second,the case on which the juvenile court relied in concluding that it could avoid the requirements of section,in re summer th,d summer,is inapplicable to a disposition held after the allegations in a supplemental petition have been sustained.accordingly,the juvenile court erred in ignoring the requirements of section.we will remand the matter to the juvenile court to schedule a section hearing and comply with the applicable statutes.
factual and procedural summary 
there is no factual or procedural dispute in this case.nor is a detailed recitation of facts necessary to resolve this legal dispute.therefore,we will provide only a brief summary of the underlying facts.
mother gave birth to six children by two fathers.fathered mother oldest child,who was born in april.fathered the remaining five children,and.the two youngest children,and,were born after the juvenile court assumed jurisdiction over the other four children.petitions were filed on behalf of those two children shortly after birth and the juvenile court assumed jurisdiction over both children.
mother first contact with the agency occurred through family court.in approximately,the family court gave legal guardianship of the three oldest children to mother father hereafter grandfather and stepgrandmother.the legal guardianship was terminated in april because of grandfather criminal history,including a recent arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol.the children were returned to mother on the condition that she participate in the agency voluntary family maintenance plan.mother failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the plan,and it was terminated in less than one month.
mother retained custody of the children until june,when the agency filed a section petition alleging that the four oldest children were at risk because mother failed to supervise or protect them adequately.the children were detained.the allegations of the petition as amended were found true at the jurisdictional hearing,the children were found to be dependents of the court,placement was confirmed,and family reunifications services were ordered for the parents.a separate petition was filed when was born,and she was detained and placed in foster care.
at the review hearing,the social study found that the parents had not met the objectives of the family reunification plan.the juvenile court ordered six additional months of services.
at the review hearing,services for the fathers and.were terminated.mother was provided with six additional months of services as she had made progress in her plan.
at the review hearing,four of the children,and,were placed with mother.the review hearing for the two children who were not returned to the custody of mother was continued.it appears these two children were not returned to mother custody because both children had serious health issues.
at the continued review hearing,the juvenile court returned custody of the remaining two children to mother over the agency objections.
less than one month later,a supplemental petition pursuant to section was filed.the petition alleged that and,the children with medical problems,had not been receiving their prescribed medications and were experiencing medical problems.in addition,mother had refused to allow the agency representative to inspect her house to ensure the children safety.all of the children were removed from mother custody.the juvenile court ordered the children detained.four months later,the juvenile court found it had jurisdiction over the children.the juvenile court also ordered the agency to assess stepgrandmother for placement of the children.
at the dispositional hearing,the juvenile court appointed stepgrandmother the legal guardian for all the children except.the parties agreed that placement with a relative continue because of medical condition.a section hearing was scheduled for.the agency appeals from the order appointing stepgrandmother the legal guardian of the five children.
discussion 
we are asked to decide whether the juvenile court had the authority to appoint stepgrandmother the legal guardian of the children after finding the allegations of the section supplemental petition true.relying on section,subdivision a,the juvenile court believed it had such authority.to understand the arguments,we begin with a restatement of the goals of dependency proceedings.
the overarching goal of dependency proceedings is to safeguard the welfare of california children.citation.family preservation,with the attendant reunification plan and reunification services,is the first priority when child dependency proceedings are commenced.citation.reunification services implement the law strong preference for maintaining the family relationships if at all possible.citation.citation.reunification services are typically understood as a benefit provided to parents,because services enable them to demonstrate parental fitness and so regain custody of their dependent children.citation.
the legislative scheme reflects this reunification goal.with some limited exceptions section requires the juvenile court to order child welfare services for both parent and child when a minor is removed from parental custody.unless an exception applies,whenever a child is removed from a parent or guardian custody,the juvenile court shall order the social worker to provide child welfare services to the child and the child mother and statutorily presumed father or guardians.citations.this requirement implements the law strong preference for maintaining the family relationship if at all possible.citation.citation.in re nolan cal th,d.
the legislative scheme conforms to these goals.once the juvenile court finds it has jurisdiction over a child,it is required to hold a timely disposition,subd.a.the social worker is required to prepare a social study to aid the juvenile court in determining the appropriate disposition,subd.b.after receiving and considering evidence on the appropriate disposition,the juvenile court may order a legal guardian be appointed for the child,subd.a order informal services without adjudicating the child a dependent,subd.b or adjudge the child a dependent of the juvenile court,subd.d.
if the child is adjudged a dependent,the juvenile court is required to order a plan with the goal of reunifying the family.various services are to be provided to the parents to meet this goal.review hearings are held throughout this period to track the progress of the parents and the welfare of the child.at the review hearing,the juvenile court is required to return the child to the custody of the parent or guardian,unless the court finds that return would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child,subd.e.
a permanency hearing must be held no later than months after the jurisdictional hearing,subd.f.the juvenile court is required to return the child to the parent or legal guardian unless it makes the same finding required at the review hearing.ibid.at the hearing,the juvenile court is required to determine the permanent plan for the child,including a determination of whether and when the child will be returned to the parent or legal guardian.ibid.if the child is not returned to the custody of the parent or legal guardian at this hearing,the juvenile court must continue the permanency hearing for up to an additional six months if it finds that there is a substantial probability of return of the child to the parents within the extended time period,order a selection and implementation hearing be held within days pursuant to section,or order that the child remain in foster care if the child is not suitable for adoption and there is no one willing to be appointed a legal guardian,subd.g.
if the case proceeds to the selection and implementation hearing,the juvenile court has five options.in order of preference these options are terminate the rights of the parents and place the child for adoption appoint a relative with whom the child is currently residing as the legal guardian identify adoption as the permanent placement goal and order that efforts be made to locate an appropriate adoptive family appoint a nonrelative legal guardian and place the child in foster care,subd.b.
here,the children were returned to mother before the case proceeded to the section selection and implementation hearing.the agency,however,determined shortly thereafter that mother was not complying with the juvenile court orders.accordingly,it filed a supplemental petition pursuant to section.
an order changing a previous order by removing a child from the physical custody of the parent may be made only after a supplemental petition has been filed and proper notice has been provided to all interested parties.at the jurisdictional hearing,the parties are entitled to the same constitutional and procedural safeguards as at hearings on an original petition.rule e,in re antonio d.
the parties do not challenge the jurisdictional findings in this case.instead,the dispute arises out of the dispositional hearing.the juvenile court appointed stepgrandmother as the children legal guardian pursuant to subdivision a of section.we,therefore,will review the requirements of this subdivision.
before the juvenile court may appoint a legal guardian pursuant to subdivision a of section,each of the following must occur the court must find that the child is a person described by section the parent must advise the court that he or she is not interested in family maintenance or family reunification services the court must determine that a legal guardianship is in the best interests of the child the parent and the child must agree to the appointment the court must advise the parent and child that reunification services will not be provided and the court must order an assessment of the person whom the court anticipates appointing as the legal guardian,subd.a.the assessment must include documentation of the efforts made to notify the noncustodial parent of the hearing a review of the amount and nature of the contact between the parent and the child since the petition was filed an evaluation of the child developmental,scholastic,medical,mental,and emotional status an assessment of the eligibility and commitment of the prospective guardian social history,a screening for criminal records,a screening for prior referrals for child abuse or neglect,an evaluation of the proposed guardian capacity to meet the child needs,and an evaluation of the proposed guardian understanding of the legal and financial rights and responsibilities of a legal guardianship an assessment of the nature of the relationship between the child and prospective guardian,including duration and an analysis of the likelihood that the child would be adopted if parental rights were terminated,subd.a.
although there is no reference in section to the dispositional hearing,the rules of court specifically provide for the disposition after a supplemental petition is granted.rule f states,if a dependent child was returned to the custody of a parent or guardian at the review or the review or at an interim review between and months and a section petition is sustained and the child removed once again,the court must set a hearing under section unless the court finds there is a substantial probability of return within the next months or,if more than months had expired at the time of the prior return,within whatever time remains before the expiration of the maximum period.
here,the children were returned to mother at the review hearing after the juvenile court provided her with six additional months of services.shortly after the children were returned to mother,the section petition was filed and sustained,resulting in the children once again being removed from mothers custody.nonetheless,the juvenile court did not set a selection and implementation hearing pursuant to section as required by rule f.the juvenile court reasoned that a disposition hearing was required,and all of the options provided in section were available.relying on section,subdivision a,the juvenile court appointed stepgrandmother the legal guardian of the children.
apparently,the reason the juvenile court acted pursuant to section,subdivision a instead of setting a selection and implementation hearing pursuant to section was stepgrandmothers criminal conviction and the limitations imposed by section.
section provides that before a child can be placed with a relative,the agency must ascertain the appropriateness of the placement and must conduct a criminal background check of all persons living in the prospective home,subds.a b.if the criminal records check reveals that a person has been convicted of a crime,the child may not be placed in that home unless the crime was one for which the agency may grant an exemption pursuant to health and safety code section,and the agency grants an exemption.welf,subd.d.stepgrandmother had a conviction for misdemeanor willful cruelty to a child,subd.b,and the agency refused to grant her an exemption 
by relying on section,subdivision a,however,the juvenile court believed it could avoid the requirements of section.according to summer,supra,th,d,this result is permissible because section does not apply to the appointment of a legal guardian pursuant to section,subdivision a.summer,at,d.
we conclude the juvenile court erred for two reasons.first,the juvenile court erred by failing to comply with rule f.as stated ante,this rule requires the juvenile court,after sustaining a supplemental petition,to assess the status of the parents reunification efforts and proceed to a section selection and implementation hearing,unless there is a substantial probability of return of the children to the custody of the parent in the reunification time remaining.while it is true that a court is not bound by a rule of court,the formal rules the judicial council adopts that interpret a statute,are entitled to a measure of judicial deference.accordingly,a rule interpretation of a statute,although not binding on the courts and invalid if contrary to statute,is entitled to great weight and will be overturned only if it is clearly erroneous.citations.we emphasize that this is merely deference,not abdication.statutory construction remains ultimately a matter for the courts.sara superior court cal th,d.
in addition to failing to give deference to rule f,the juvenile court also failed to follow this courts decision in carolyn superior court th,d carolyn.carolyn was the mother of two children who were removed from her custody pursuant to section.approximately eight months later,the children were returned to carolyn custody.approximately nine months later,the allegations of a supplemental petition filed pursuant to section were found true and a disposition was set.carolyn argued for additional months of reunification services,even though she had received eight months of reunification services and months of family maintenance
